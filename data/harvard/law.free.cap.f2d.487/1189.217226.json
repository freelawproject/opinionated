FPC, No. 71-1743, 159 U.S.App.D.C. -, 487 F.2d 1182, which we decide today.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1191\">*1191</page-number>of the first phase, this court affirmed a Commission Order which (1) authorized abandonment \u00f3f a liquified natural gas (LNG) project, and (2) allowed withdrawal of a petition to amend the original certificate for that project. The Order under review here (1) denied the claim of Valley Gas Company (Valley) for reinstatement of alleged losses in level of service, and (2) refused the request of Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (Tennessee) that its unrecovered losses be amortized (and thereby included in its rate base) as either Research and Development Costs or as Extraordinary Property Losses. Supported by substantial evidence and based on legally appropriate criteria, as it was, the Commission\u2019s Order under review here is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-4\">1. <em>Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1259-5\">On 5 May 1965 Tennessee filed an application in Docket No. CP 65-352 for authority to construct and operate an in-ground storage LNG facility designed to render peaking service to eighteen New England customers. On 26 July 1965 the Commission issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the construction and operation of the facilities to provide the proposed service.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> One basis for that approval was the existence of contracts with proposed customers to. take such peaking service, at prearranged rates, when the project was completed.</p>\n<p id=\"pAON\">Tennessee\u2019s customers had requested construction of these facilities,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> with a central purpose of relieving themselves of the expense involved in building separate and individual storage facilities to provide \u201cpeak-shaving\u201d service. Since the construction of such a large facility would take some time, Tennessee undertook to provide an \u201cInterim General\u201d service (IG) to serve peaking needs, renewable at one year intervals until the LNG facility was completed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> When the originally planned and certified facility failed for technological reasons, and Tennessee\u2019s proposed alternative met with only lukewarm customer support at necessarily increased proposed rates,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Tennessee sought approval to abandon the in-ground LNG project, asked to withdraw its application for amendment of the certificate to allow above-ground storage, and allowed its current one-year interim service to expire.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Protesting these actions, which resulted in termination of a supply of 6,900 Mcf of IG gas annually to itself,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Valley claims that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1192\">*1192</page-number>Tennessee is under a duty to continue supplying some form of substitute service to replace these lost supplies. The Commission disagreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-4\">With respect to the proper accounting treatment to be given Tennessee\u2019s losses, the Commission reversed the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s decision, which allowed Tennessee to amortize its net loss of $8,841,744 over a ten year period as a miscellaneous deferred debit. The Commission found that under applicable regulations the loss could not be properly classified as either a Research and Development Cost or an Extraordinary Property Loss. Further, the Commission held that the original certificate conditions agreed to by Tennessee precluded amortization of costs, no matter how characterized, to the extent that the project proved unsuccessful.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1260-5\">II. <em>Valley\u2019s Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1260-6\">As to whether Tennessee was legally obligated to complete (or replace with an adequate substitute) the LNG project which had foundered on technological and economic shoals, we agree with the Commission\u2019s conclusion that there was no such obligation, either to Valley individually or to the customer group as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-12\">A. <em>Interim General Service</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1260-13\">Valley attempted to focus the argument on the cancellation, or more accurately, refusal to further extend, Interim General service. This position conveniently overlooks the fact that IG service was specifically intended as merely an interim measure \u201cpending the completion of [the] . . . liquified natural gas facilities.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It was designed, for that interim period, \u201cto avoid the expense of constructing peak shaving facilities by the New England customers who expected [LNG] service.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> IG was quite obviously a necessary incentive for the customers to await completion of the larger centralized project, rather than proceeding with construction of decentralized plants. It also helped to insure the availability of adequate market support (at the originally proposed rates) to justify the central LNG project when it was to be completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1193\">*1193</page-number>The IG service was carefully tailored to this temporary purpose. Since the exact completion date of the in-ground project was uncertain, the related IG contracts were explicitly limited to a one year term; the Commission\u2019s certificates only \u201cauthorized [the IG] as a short-term temporary service on a year-to-year basis.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> When the LNG project failed, and Tennessee\u2019s alternative proved unacceptable, unless Tennessee had a continuing obligation either to proceed with the project or to provide an acceptable substitute, the whole rationale and basis for the IG service disappeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-4\">B. <em>The Certificate</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1261-5\">That Tennessee had no general continuing duty to complete the originally certificated project, or to use the liquefaction facilities in some other way to benefit the original customer group, was properly determined by the Commission in Phase I. Permission to withdraw Tennessee\u2019s application for amendment of the original certificate, like permission to abandon, was granted on the appropriate \u201cpresent or future public interest\u201d test.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> While a certificate of public convenience and necessity does contemplate that the applicant will proceed with the best efforts towards completion of the project and commencement of the proposed service, such a certificate is also subject to the contingency that approved abandonment may, as a general matter, validly cancel that obligation. The certificate neither commands the impossible nor guarantees the unattainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-6\">Valley contends that it suffered special financial hardship as a re-suit of the abandonment, and that as a result the \u201cpublic interest,\u201d as applied to obligations created by the certificate, required that abandonment be conditioned on Tennessee\u2019s continuation of some form of substitute service to Valley. While it is undoubtedly within the power of the Commission to so condition abandonment approvals in appropriate circumstances, refusal to do so here was neither arbitrary nor without support in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-12\">Valley\u2019s plight did not differ materially from that of the other customers. Once the LNG project failed, all of Tennessee\u2019s customers were necessarily subjected to differing levels of financial expense in making new peaking service arrangements, depending on their need for such service and the proximity and size of alternative sources. But all, including Valley, succeeded in making adequate arrangements. It was true that some of the old customers were in varying degrees in a better position than others to benefit from NEGEA\u2019s project. But it was inevitable that any new ownership and use of the liquefaction plant would result in both different rates and a different customer group. The Commission did not approve NEGEA\u2019s plan because it most closely resembled Tennessee\u2019s project, but rather because it was the best alternative from the standpoint of all New England gas consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-13\">If the certificate created an obligation on Tennessee\u2019s part to go forward with provision of a peaking service come hell or a high boil-off rate, then that obligation necessarily extended to all customers alike.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Such a conclusion would necessarily imply that rights originally created by this certificate of public con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1194\">*1194</page-number>venience and necessity could not be can-celled by later developments which altered the present or future public interest when they occurred. We hold to the contrary in No. 71-1743.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-4\">C. <em>The Contracts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1262-5\">If the original certification of Tennessee\u2019s in-ground storage LNG project did not operate to give Valley a continuing or special right to the expected level of service, then the only remaining basis for Valley\u2019s claim is an argument that Tennessee had some contractual duty to supply the gas. As discussed above, no such contractual duty existed with respect to continuation of the IG service \u2014 since the contracts applicable thereto were specifically limited to one-year\u2019s duration. In addition, while a pipeline and its customers no doubt could contract to assure a guaranteed gas supply without regard to the successful construction of a proposed physical plant, the contracts entered into with respect to Tennessee\u2019s proposed LNG peaking service established no such right or guarantee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-6\">All the prospective customers signed agreements to take LNG service, a show of market support at the proposed volume and rates which was no doubt helpful in obtaining original certification. However, all those contracts specifically provided that Tennessee would \u201cbe under no obligation to deliver\u201d (nor would the customers be under obligation to take) gas \u201cuntil the expiration of thirty days after [Tennessee] . . . notified [the customer] ... in writing that [Tennessee] ... is ready to commence the delivery of such new quantities of gas.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Such notice was never sent, because of the technological failure of the project. Although such a contract entails an implicit obligation on Tennessee\u2019s part to attempt completion in good faith, there was no evidence of malingering. As with the certificate, the contracts involved were just not designed to repeal any laws of nature which got in the way.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-11\">D. <em>Reliance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1262-12\">Nor did Tennessee act in any improper way to mislead Valley or raise false hopes. The failure of the in-ground project was evident to all by March of 1969.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This in itself should have alerted Valley that the IG service, which was designed as merely a stop-gap measure, was in jeopardy. As early as 17 October 1969 Tennessee formally notified its customers that it would not offer IG service for the 1970-71 winter.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> As late as the 1969-70 season, Tennessee was not limiting the availability of firm General Service to its customers. Yet Valley declined to contract for such base-load long-term service. Having made other arrangements for peaking gas, Valley is now asking that the \u201csubstitute service\u201d it requests take the form of firm General Service. To the extent that Valley\u2019s claim is for the fulfillment of its expectations, the very nature of its requests may be a revealing indication of the actual use to which Valley put the IG service while it was still available.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1195\">*1195</page-number>If Valley\u2019s \u201creliance\u201d was in reality tied to its need for and expectation of \u201cpeaking service,\u201d it had considerable advance notice of the need to make other arrangements, and actually did so. If, as seems likely, Valley\u2019s reliance was tied to the hope that it could continue to use IG service as a supplement for its base load demand, rather than its short-term peak demand needs, then Valley is merely suffering now from its own inappropriate use of the IG gas. It is important to remember that the whole purpose of the LNG project, <em>and </em>the fill-in IG service, was to provide a substitute for other peaking arrangements. Neither was ever intended (as opposed, perhaps, to used) as a substitute for General Service, which is a base load, year-round service rendered on a long-term basis. There, is no explanation in the record as to why the IG service was so structured that it could be used year round.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1263-4\">There is reason to believe that Valley\u2019s failure to convert to General Service while that was possible, and its reliance on IG sei'vice to meet base load demand (until caught out by the termination of that service under its own terms), was not based on any plausible construction of the conditions attaching to IG, but rather on a desire to squeeze the last possible economic advantage out of the rate structure \u2014 legitimate, but hazardous, given the risks attaching to such a course. One legitimate function of any peaking service is to lower rates by lessening the impact of the highest demand days on the \u201cdemand charge\u201d levied in the succeeding twelve months. Since the IG service began afresh each November, the demand charge as to that gas calculated on the basis of the greatest amount supplied during any day in that contract year. Assuming the highest day fell in January or February, Valley paid the highest demand charge for only nine or ten months of the year (until the next contract termination date) .<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> If IG was used, not for purely peak demand, but in large amounts year round, a substantial saving might thereby be made. In contrast, if Valley had contracted for firm long-term General Service for its regular base load needs, no such advantage could have been obtained. So the one-year term of IG service, which Valley now asserts is not to be taken literally, was not most likely viewed as a definite advantage for Valley at the time the IG service was still in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-7\">In short, both the early warnings of trouble and Valley\u2019s economic motivation for failing to contract for General Service while that was still available belie, at least as to justified'reliance, its claim that it would have obtained a full supply of gas under the General Service schedule, had it not been for Tennessee\u2019s proposal of the LNG project and the interim availability of IG gas.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-8\">E. <em>Burden of Proof</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1263-9\">Finally, Valley contends that the burden of proof on the issue of \u201csubstitute service\u201d was improperly shifted from Tennessee to Valley as a result of deferral of that question to Phase II of the proceedings. To the extent that Valley is claiming that the abandonment did not meet the \u201cpublic interest\u201d standard, unless conditioned on provision of additional service to itself, we must agree that the burden to refute that claim rested on Tennessee, the applicant for abandonment authority.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> However, contrary to Valley\u2019s contentions, we find that the burden was in fact correctly allocated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-10\">Although he did not rule on the question, the Examiner in Phase I clearly felt that Tennessee had made a persuasive showing that Valley was not en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1196\">*1196</page-number>titled to relief. Despite that conclusion, <em>for Valley\u2019s benefit, </em>he delayed resolution of the substitute service issue and directed that <em>\u201cTennessee should show cause </em>in Phase II of the proceeding why it should not provide the additional interim gas service desired by Valley Gas.\u201d On review of the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s decision in Phase II, the Commission explicitly found that in Phase II \u201cTennessee satisfied the Examiner\u2019s directive\u201d to show cause \u201cand went forward at the hearing with a persuasive presentation.\u201d <footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1264-4\">It is true that the Commission also noted that \u201cthe burden of proof . remained upon Valley as to the alleged undue discrimination and Valley has not shown that it is being unduly discriminated <em>against.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Valley cites this language as an indication that the burden of proof was improperly switched. Yet, to the extent that Valley\u2019s claim alleged wrongful conduct or breach of contract on Tennessee\u2019s part, rather than asserting substitute service was required by the public interest standard applicable generally to the question of abandonment and its consequences, Valley <em>should </em>have borne that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-5\">Read as a whole, and in context, the challenged Order reveals that the Commission merely separated out the two possible interpretations of Valley\u2019s claim, bent over backwards to require Tennessee to make a second showing on the abandonment-related argument, and correctly put Valley to its proof on the arguments which remained after the general public interest test had been applied, to Valley\u2019s detriment, on the abandonment-related question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-6\">III. <em>Accounting Treatment for Tennessee\u2019s Unrecovered Losses</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1264-7\">In its own petition for review, Tennessee challenges the Commission\u2019s order to the extent that it reverses the decision of the Administrative Law Judge and refuses to allow amortization (and, consequently, rate-base treatment) of the. unrecovered costs related to the Hopkinton LNG project. Tennessee seeks to have these costs included in its rate base as either Research and Development expenses or as Extraordinary Property Losses. While disputing those characterizations, the Commission-found that Tennessee\u2019s claim for rate base treatment was in any event barred by specific conditions included in the original certificate and accepted by Tennessee. Without attempting to delve into the questions raised by the specific characterization claimed to allow amortization, we hold that the restrictions in the original certificate were properly construed to bar inclusion of these unre-covered costs in Tennessee\u2019s rate base.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-10\">When the original certificate of public convenience and necessity was issued for the LNG project, the Commission included, at the request of several intervenors and with Tennessee\u2019s consent, specific restrictions which were essentially designed to deny future rate base treatment to the cost of the proposed facilities to the extent that they proved unsuccessful. Specifically, clause (E) provided, in pertinent part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1264-11\">[i]n the event that Applicant shall be unable, because of mechanical or operational failure of the LNG facilities, to deliver the maximum LNG winter contract quantity of gas, it shall,__ in any rate determination, if so directed by the Commission, remove from its rate base an amount which shall be determined by multiplying the net original cost of plant and facilities authorized by a fraction the numerator of which shall be the annual winter contract quantity which the Applicant was unable to deliver and the denominator of which shall be the maximum winter contract quantity. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1264-12\">If this formula is applied to a total failure to provide gas, the result is that the Commission may direct exclusion of all costs from Tennessee\u2019s rate base. By <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1197\">*1197</page-number>denying Tennessee\u2019s request for amortization, the Commission has done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-5\">Tennessee argues that these conditions were not meant to pre-judge the appropriate accounting treatment in this case. To the extent that the Commission was intended to exercise its discretion at the time of decision on the rate treatment to be given such costs, and could interpret or indeed modify or refuse to enforce the certificate decis-sions where warranted, we agree. However, the Commission has <em>now </em>judged the impact of these restrictions in the light of both past expectations and present circumstances. In interpreting its own prior certificate and its present statutory duty, a determination to which this court must give suitable deference, the Commission has come to a conclusion which we see no reason to disturb.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-6\">Although it is arguable that the conditions did not explicitly foresee the possibility of total failure of the LNG project, their clear intent was that rate base treatment should turn on the level of successfully delivered service. Tennessee\u2019s resolution of any latent ambiguity would embrace the absurd result that, while a mere 1% success rate would allow the Commission to deny 99% of the costs rate base treatment, total failure somehow opens the way for complete amortization. The basic intent behind these conditions, as accepted by Tennessee, can be gleaned from their origination with intervenors, who wished to protect the integrity of the pipeline\u2019s system-wide rate structure by barring rate base impact on those who would not benefit from the project.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Despite any position later taken by some of Tennessee\u2019s New England customers, it would be irrational to hold, on the basis of language so originating, that while Tennessee, which planned and controlled the facilities, was not guaranteeing to its independent customers the success of the project, the customers were making such a sweeping guarantee <em>to Tennessee. </em>The Commission\u2019s reading of the certificate conditions is eminently reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-9\">IV. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1265-10\">The failure of Tennessee\u2019s planned LNG facilities gave rise to regrettable dislocations for all of the parties involved. In essence, the Commission\u2019s determinations under review here and in No. 71-1743, decided today, were based on the conclusion that the applicable contracts, regulations, certificates and statutes combined to require that the facilities be committed to the most desirable future use and that the various losses rest where they fell. We find the Commission\u2019s reasoning, and the result reached, to be quite sound. Accordingly, the Commission\u2019s Order is</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1258-12\">.

Intervenors, the Berkshire Gas Company, et al., so argue. The certificate made no special conditions as to any given customer. Their contracts were the same. Though most of the customers did not oppose abandonment, the Administrative Law Judge found that Valley \u201chas failed to show exceptional need for additional gas supply as compared with the other customers.\u201d Record at 1637. (To the extent that this suggests an incorrect allocation of the burden of proof, note that the Commission specifically recognized Tennessee\u2019s primary burden in affirming the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s decision.

A representative of Tennessee met with the customers in -March of 1969 to explain the necessity for modification of the project and increasing the proposed rates. He also indicated at that time that lack of market support for the amended proposal would force total abandonment. By June of 1969 the customers were notified that inadequate support was forthcoming and that Tennessee planned to abandon the project.

The general gas shortage situation renders Tennessee\u2019s decision not to supply <em>additional </em>unobligated service quite reasonable. Tennessee had turned down requests of existing contracted demand customers for increased services totalling in excess of 450,000 Mcf per day for 1971-72. App., Vol. I, p. 113; Record at 1636. Indeed, since Tennessee\u2019s notice to its customers on 16 June 1970 that additional commitments would not be made, many pipelines have been unable to meet existing service obligations, and more than twenty pipelines now have cases pending before the Commission involving plans for curtailment of service.
