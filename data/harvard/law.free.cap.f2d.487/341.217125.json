As a basis for relief, appellant contended that his court-appointed counsel had refrained from requesting the court to have him examined for possible insanity at the time of his escape. Because of the alleged incompetence of counsel, appellant contended that he had been denied due process of law. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b409-21\">The district court conducted a hearing to ascertain the facts surrounding appellant\u2019s claims. Appellant and two witnesses testified that appellant had indeed requested counsel to seek a psychiatric examination. Court-appointed counsel denied ever receiving such a request. Crediting the counsel\u2019s testimony, the district court denied relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-22\"> We affirm. Factual questions must be determined by the district court, and unless clearly erroneous are binding on the court of appeals. <em>See </em>United States v. Strother, 458 F.2d 424, 430 (5th Cir. 1972). Since this case falls within the well established rule,, we are bound to affirm the district court\u2019s determinations of the factual issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
