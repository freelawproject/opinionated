After trial before Judge Dooling and a jury in the District Court for the Eastern District of New York, they were convicted on both counts and were given concurrent sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">The Government\u2019s evidence was as follows: On October 2, 1970, Michael Fiore, an acquaintance of Cioffi and Ciuzio, met them at Cioffi\u2019s barber shop in Plainview, N. Y. Cioffi told Fiore he had some counterfeit stamps and money and asked if Fiore knew anyone who would take the contraband out of the country. Cioffi then handed him a sheet of 100 6\u00a1\u00e9 stamps and a $100 bill and told him to give the stamps to \u201cyour man\u201d and see if he was interested.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">Shortly thereafter Fiore met with Secret Service Agent Daniel Marchitello and two other investigators. He told Marchitello that .Cioffi and Ciuzio were selling counterfeit stamps and showed him the 100 stamp sample. Marchitello took 50 and gave the other 50 back to Fiore. That evening Marchitello and Fiore met Cioffi and Ciuzio outside the barber shop. Fiore introduced Marchi-tello as \u201cmy man here from Cuba,\u201d and the defendants agreed to speak with him. Cioffi said he had $500,000 worth of counterfeit 6f! stamps and asked if Marchitello could obtain a perforating machine. After a brief negotiation over the price, Ciuzio agreed to a figure of 1 per stamp if Marchitello would buy a large number and take them out of the country. During the discussion, Cioffi indicated that in addition to the stamps, he could produce between $5,000,000 and $15,000,000 of counterfeit currency. If Marchitello would agree to purchase the stamps, Cioffi told him, he would not require him to put up any \u201cfront money\u201d for the currency. Marchitello then asked Cioffi for a sample sheet to try on his perforating machine and Cioffi sent Ciuzio to pick one up. Cioffi told Mar-chitello he wanted a commitment on the stamp purchase as soon as possible; Marchitello agreed to contact his own people and get back to Cioffi later. Ciu-zio then returned, handed Marchitello a sheet of 400 counterfeit stamps, and demanded an answer by 11 A.M. the next day. Because he feared possible interference with another agent\u2019s investigation, Marchitello never reestablished contact with either Cioffi or Ciuzio.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-12\">Testifying in their own defense, appellants denied that these events had occurred. They attempted to impeach Marchitello\u2019s testimony by focusing on certain inconsistencies in his account of the events of October 2, and attacked Fiore\u2019s testimony on the ground that there was bad blood between Cioffi and Fiore because Fiore had refused to repay $2,000 that Cioffi had lent him.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-14\">We must first consider various contentions of appellants based on their earlier trial for a related offense. The earlier prosecution was also brought on a two count indictment and concerned the very same course of conduct. The first count charged that Cioffi and Ciu-zio had attempted to sell stamps they knew to be falsely made, forged and counterfeited, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 472;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the second count charged a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>spiracy to violate the same section. The alleged overt acts were the same in both indictments. The evidence at the trial under the \u00a7 472 indictment, also before Judge Dooling, was much the same as under the \u00a7 501 indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">At the close of the first- trial the judge granted a motion by Cioffi for acquittal on the substantive count. Although we might well have concluded otherwise, Judge Dooling ruled that the Government\u2019s evidence was insufficient to show an attempt to sell the stamps. The Government then moved for dismissal of the substantive count as to Ciuzio and this was granted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The jury hung on the conspiracy count. Instead of seeking a retrial on that count, the Government abandoned its efforts under \u00a7 472 and procured the instant indictment under \u00a7 501. Defendants claim that the second prosecution was barred by the Double Jeopardy clause or, in the alternative, that most of the Government\u2019s evidence should have been excluded on grounds of collateral estoppel, see Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436, 90 S.Ct. 1189, 25 L.Ed.2d 469 (1970); United States v. Kramer, 289 F.2d 909 (2 Cir. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\"> The double jeopardy question with respect to the substantive count of the second indictment is not free from difficulty. If the true test remains Chief Justice Shaw\u2019s famous formulation in Morey v. Commonwealth, 108 Mass. 433, 434 (1871), quoted with approval in Ex parte Nielsen, 131 U.S. 176, 187-188, 9 S.Ct. 672, 33 L.Ed. 118 (1889); Carter v. McClaughry, 183 U.S. 365, 395, 22 S.Ct. 181, 46 L.Ed. 236 (1902); Gavieres v. United States, 220 U.S. 338, 342, 31 S.Ct. 421, 55 L.Ed. 489 (1911); Ebeling v. Morgan, 237 U.S. 625, 630-631, 35 S.Ct. 710, 59 L.Ed. 1151 (1915); and Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932), namely, that \u201cthe evidence required to support a conviction upon one of them [the indictments] would have been sufficient to warrant a conviction upon the other,\u201d the double jeopardy defense must fail. Proof of possession with intent to use or sell is sufficient to support a conviction under \u00a7 501, but it would not satisfy the requirements of the charge made under \u00a7 472 unless the intent to sell ripened into an attempt. Moreover, proof of an attempt to sell, without evidence of possession,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> would suffice for a conviction under \u00a7 472 but not under \u00a7 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-17\">Although this formulation has never been expressly rejected by the Supreme Court or this circuit, it has been subject to serious criticism.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, the Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>preme Court has rather conspicuously refrained from employing the <em>Morey </em>formulation in recent cases such as United States v. Ewell, 383 U.S. 116, 124-25, 86 S.Ct. 773, 15 L.Ed.2d 627 (1966); Waller v. Florida, 397 U.S. 387, 390, 90 S.Ct. 1184, 25 L.Ed.2d 435 (1970); and Robinson v. Neil, 409 U.S. 505, 511, 93 S.Ct. 876, 35 L.Ed.2d 29 (1973). In at least two cases, Petite v. United States, 361 U.S. 529, 80 S.Ct. 450, 4 L.Ed.2d 490 (1960), and Marakar v. United States, 370 U.S. 723, 82 S.Ct. 1573, 8 L.Ed.2d 803 (1962), the Government has avoided testing the continued validity of the traditional formulation by requesting the' dismissal of convictions that might have called for reconsideration of the <em>Morey </em>rule. The Government there insisted that its requests for dismissals were based, not on a violation of double jeopardy principles, but on its own policy \u201cthat several offenses arising out of a single transaction should be. alleged and tried together and should not be made the basis of multiple prosecutions, a policy dictated by considerations both of fairness to defendants and of efficient and orderly law enforcement,\u201d 361 U.S. at 530, 80 S.Ct. at 451. In both <em>Petite </em>and <em>Marakar, </em>three Justices would have rejected the Government\u2019s \u201cpolicy of fairness\u201d approach and would have based reversal directly on the Double Jeopardy clause.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In United States v. Sabella, 272 F.2d 206, 211 (2 Cir. 1959), we held that the Double Jeopardy clause prohibited a second prosecution after a conviction stemming from the same narcotics sale. Although this court there reaffirmed the <em>Morey </em>doctrine, we refused to extend it to the point of rigid formalism. While the two charged offenses in <em>Sabella </em>each technically included one unique element, the Government was not required to prove either in order to make out a <em>prima fa-cie </em>case. In effect, then, the same proof could support both convictions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In view of the shadow that has been cast over <em>Morey, </em>one is justified in speculating that, unless prosecutors take to heart the recommendations for joinder of all offenses arising out of the same criminal episode or transaction,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> double jeopardy will be a fertile ground for Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>preme Court development in the next decade.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">Whatever the future of the <em>Morey </em>formulation may be in the Supreme Court, the facts of this case afford no such temptation to temper it as existed in <em>Sabella. </em>The very basis for the acquittal in the first trial was the judge\u2019s belief that the Government had not presented sufficient evidence to show an attempt to sell; he thought apparently that the\u2019 evidence showed only possession, but that the defendants\u2019 alleged acts had not gone far enough to constitute an attempt. There was thus no bar to a new prosecution under \u00a7 501 unless, which appellants have not contended and, because of the required showing of possession, could not reasonably contend, the latter was a lesser included offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">In any event, if the concurrent sentence doctrine retains some vitality after Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784, 789-92, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 23 L.Ed.2d 707 (1969) , compare United States v. Febre, 425 F.2d 107, 113 (2 Cir.), cert, denied, 400 U.S. 849, 91 S.Ct. 40, 27 L.Ed.2d 87 (1970) ; United States v. Gaines, 460 F. 2d 176, 178-80 (2 Cir.), cert, denied, 409 U.S. 883, 93 S.Ct. 172, 34 L.Ed.2d 139 (1972), the double jeopardy objection to the substantive count under \u00a7 501 is of little practical importance. The acquittal under the substantive count of the first indictment would not have barred retrial of the conspiracy count on which the jury had hung, although the Government might have been confronted with serious restrictions on the evidence it could introduce, <em>cf. </em>United States v. Kramer, <em>supra, </em>289 F.2d at 915-16. By submitting that count to the jury, the judge clearly indicated his belief that the evidence was sufficient to warrant a finding that defendants had agreed to attempt to sell the stamps, although not to show they had actually made the attempt. As has been stated countless times, \u201c[t]he essence of the conspiracy charge is an agreement,\u201d see Pereira v. United States, 347 U.S. 1, 11, 74 S.Ct. 358, 364, 98 L.Ed. 435 (1954); there can be a valid conviction for conspiracy even though the object is never attained. See Developments in the Law, Criminal Conspiracy, 72 Harv.L.Rev. 920, 925-27, 944-45 (1959). The same reasoning leads <em>a fortiori </em>to the conclusion that acquittal on the substantive charge under \u00a7 472 would not bar, as a matter of double jeopardy, subsequent trial and conviction on the charge of conspiring to violate \u00a7 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\"> There remains for consideration, on this branch of the case, appellants\u2019 contention that even if the Double Jeopardy clause did not bar the second prosecution, principles of issue preclusion should have prevented the Government from reintroducing the evidence tendered at the first trial. Appellants rely on the portion of our <em>Kramer </em>decision which held that, after the defendants were acquitted on several charges related to the burglary of two Connecticut post offices, the Government could not introduce evidence in a subsequent prosecution to prove that the defendants themselves burglarized the post offices or were responsible for whoever did. 289 F.2d at 914-916. <em>Kramer, </em>however, is readily distinguishable from this ease. Like Ashe v. Swenson, <em>supra, Kramer </em>was the rare case where it was possible to determine with certainty what the jury in the earlier prosecution had decided.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Here there is absolutely no basis for belief that when the judge dismissed the substantive count in the \u00a7 472 trial, he determined that the evidence was insufficient to show that defendants possessed the counterfeit stamps with intent to use or sell them. In its endeavor to prove the intent required by \u00a7 501, the Government was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>not obliged to truncate its evidence and eliminate parts that might show how far the intent had gone.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Although \u00a7 501 is violated by possession \u201cwith intent to use or sell,\u201d the indictment under which Cioffi and Ciuzio were convicted charged possession \u201cwith intent to use and sell.\u201d The judge\u2019s proposed charge was in the disjunctive. At the request of trial counsel for Cioffi and without objection from counsel for Ciuzio or the Assistant United States Attorney, the judge agreed to delete the words \u201cor sell.\u201d However, on two occasions, the phrase \u201cuse or sell\u201d remained in the charge; this inconsistency was not called to the court\u2019s attention by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">Defendants contend that the striking of the words \u201cand sell\u201d was an impermissible amendment of the indictment within the condemnation of Ex parte Bain, 121 U.S. 1, 7 S.Ct. 781, 30 L.Ed. 849 (1886), and its progeny. Apart from the question whether defendants could be heard to complain of an error which counsel for one of them -introduced and in which counsel for the other acquiesced, it appears settled that indictments worded in the conjunctive, charging violations of statutes worded in the disjunctive, can be supported by proof of either of the conjoined means of violating the act. See United States v. Barbato, 471 F.2d 918 (1 Cir. 1973); Gerberding v. United States, 471 F.2d 55 (8 Cir. 1973); United States v. McCann, 465 F.2d 147 (5 Cir. 1972); Joyce v. United States, 454 F.2d 971 (D.C. Cir. 1971); United States v. Price, 444 F.2d 248 (10 Cir. 1971); McGriff v. United States, 408 F.2d 333 (9 Cir. 1969). Since an instruction charging possession with intent to use <em>or </em>sell would have been permissible, the amendment of the indictment to charge only possession with intent to use did not constitute prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">However, we must reverse the convictions in this case because the judge erred in instructing the jury as to the definition of the word \u201cuse.\u201d After due objection, he told the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-12\">The Government must show that the defendant intended to use the stamps. If you conclude that there was an intention to use the sheet of stamps, Exhibit One, as a sample to induce the purchase of a larger quantity of similar stamps, then you may find from that evidence that there was an intention to use the stamps within the meaning of the indictment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-13\">Both the context and the history of the statute indicate that \u201cuse\u201d in \u00a7 501 means use for a postal purpose, not \u201cuse\u201d in a broader, colloquial sense. It is hard to believe, for example, that the knowing use of bogus stamps for a table-cover or wall decoration would violate \u00a7 501. On this basis, the proffer of a sample of unperforated stamps to induce a sale may be relevant to show an intent (\u00a7 501) or attempt (\u00a7 472) to sell, but it hardly seems to show an intention to \u201cuse\u201d for postal purposes. Even if the evidence were sufficient to show an intention to use in the limited sense, the judge\u2019s instructions permitted the jury to convict appellants for a kind of \u201cuse\u201d that exceeds the contemplation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-14\">Section 501 can be traced back to \u00a7 3 of an 1851 act, 9 Stat. 589-90, penalizing \u201cany person who shall forge or counterfeit any postage stamp ... or shall make or print, or knowingly use or sell, or have in his possession with intent to use or sell, any such false, forged, or 'counterfeited stamp.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> While these words alone are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>no clearer than \u00a7 501 with respect to the meaning of \u201cuse,\u201d significant aid is provided by the immediately succeeding section of the same act, which penalizes any person who \u201cshall use, or attempt to use, in prepayment of postage any postage stamp which shall have been before used for like purposes.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AjW4\">The 1851 legislation was carried forward into a massive act of June 8, 1972, entitled \u201cAn Act to revise, consolidate and amend the Statutes relating to the Post-office Department.\u201d Section 178, the analogue of present \u00a7 501, penalized</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AyG\">any person who shall forge or counterfeit any postage stamp, . . . ; [any person] who shall make or print, or knowingly use or sell, or have in . possession with intent to use or sell, any such . . . forged or counterfeited postage-stamp .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">17 Stat. 305 (1872). In the preceding \u00a7 177 Congress indicated rather clearly what it meant by \u201cuse\u201d by saying, in language drawn from \u00a7 4 of the 1851 statute, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-7\">any person who shall use or attempt to use, in payment of the postage on any mail-matter conveyed, by mail or otherwise, any postage-stamp or stamped envelope, or any stamp cut from any such stamped envelope, which has been before used for a like purpose, shall forfeit and pay fifty dollars.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-12\">Although \u00a7 177 migrated to a different title in the Revised Statutes of 1875, while \u00a7 178 became \u00a7\u25a0 5464, it is reasonably clear that the previous meaning of postal use was continued.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-13\">There was no evidence in this case that defendants had any intention to use the counterfeited stamps for large scale mailing of letters; the evidence was rather that they were intent on a sale. In short, when the judge redacted the indictment, he cut out the wrong word; the case should have been submitted to the jury on the basis of possession with intent to sell rather than possession with intent to use. If the judge\u2019s action was based on a belief of insufficiency of the evidence to show possession with intent to sell, he was mistaken. From the evidence presented at trial, the jury could permissibly infer that defendants intended to sell the Sheet of 400 counterfeit stamps they gave, to Marchitello and that they had access to a much larger number of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>stamps which they offered to sell to Marchitello\u2019s \u201cpeople.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">There remains the question whether defendants can be tried again under the same indictment, with the jury this time instructed that it can convict on proof of intent to sell, a charge which the judge erroneously removed from the indictment at the defendants\u2019 request and which we direct him to restore. Plainly they can be. It is settled that when a defendant has his conviction reversed on appeal, the double jeopardy clause does not prevent his retrial for the same offense. See Mayers &amp; Yarbrough, Bis Vexari: New Trials and Successive Prosecutions, 74 Harv.L.Rev. 1, 4-8 (1960). We see no tenable distinction between a case like this where defendants have procured a reversal because the judge submitted the indictment to the jury on a wrong theory and one where they procured reversal because the judge submitted a defective indictment, as in the classic case of United States v. Ball, 163 U.S. 662, 672, 16 S.Ct. 1192, 41 L.Ed. 300 (1896). Indeed, this case is <em>a fortiori </em>to Bryan v. United States, 338 U.S. 552, 70 S.Ct. 317, 94 L.Ed. 335 (1950), which sustained the power of courts of appeals to reverse and remand for a new trial although the prosecution\u2019s evidence at the first trial was insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">In view of our disposition of the case, we need not discuss appellants\u2019 other points beyond saying that we agree with the judge\u2019s ruling which admitted Mar-chitello\u2019s testimony concerning Cioffi\u2019s offer to sell him the counterfeit currency, see United States v. Deaton, 381 F. 2d 114 (2 Cir. 1967); United States v. Kaufman, 453 F.2d 306, 310-11 (2 Cir. 1971), and the many cases there cited. We also agree with the trial court\u2019s ruling that, after Cioffi had testified about his $2,000 loan to Fiore, the Government could ask whether Cioffi had not charged interest at the rate of $60 a week.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">The convictions are reversed and the cause is remanded for a new trial consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-3\">ON PETITION FOR REHEARING</p>\n<author id=\"A6p\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">The defendants\u2019 petition for rehearing is addressed solely to the portion of our decision, slip opinion at 501, which held that they could be retried for violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 501 on the basis of having possessed counterfeit stamps with intention to sell; they contend that the judge\u2019s redaction of the indictment constituted an acquittal, even though it came about in consequence of their erroneous argument that the evidence was insufficient to show possession with intention to sell.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">Petitioners\u2019 initial error is in reading the statute as if it defined two offenses, whereas in fact it defines only one; an accompanying intention either to use or to sell is sufficient to make the possession of counterfeit stamps a crime. Since the judge allowed the case to go to the jury and the jury convicted, neither the judge nor the jury could have intended to acquit the defendants of possession with guilty intention. Indeed, the judge made clear that he believed the jury could find that the defendants possessed the counterfeit stamps with an intention to use them \u201cto induce the sale of larger quantities\u201d over which the jury could have found they had constructive possession; this is all that is needed to justify a conviction of possession with intention to sell.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">The case is thus analogous to one where a defendant procures a reversal on the basis of a faulty instruction rather than to an erroneous direction of acquittal ; and the principle of United States v. Ball, 163 U.S. 662, 671-672, 16 S.Ct. 1192, 41 L.Ed. 300 (1896), particularly as explicated by Mr. Justice Harlan in United States v. Tateo, 377 U.S. 463, 465-466, 84 S.Ct. 1587, 12 L.Ed. 2d 448 (1964), forbids acceptance of the defendants\u2019 argument. See also United States ex rel. Jackson v. Follette, 462 F. 2d 1041 (2 Cir.), cert, denied, 409 U.S. 1045, 93 S.Ct. 544, 34 L.Ed.2d 496 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">The petition for rehearing is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b563-9\">.

Although it would be rare for a seller not to have at least constructive possession, such a case is conceivable, e. g., if A, a middleman, sells B counterfeit owned by and in the possession of C, and the contraband is delivered directly to B by O. The same circumstances could arise, of course, in the case of an attempted sale.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b564-19\">. See the separate opinion of Mr. Justice Brennan in Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S. 187, 196, 201, 79 S.Ct. 666, 3 L.Ed. 2d 729 (1959) ; his concurring opinion, joined by Justices Douglas and Marshall, in Ashe v. Swenson, <em>supra, </em>397 U.S. 448, 90 S.Ct. 1189; and Note, Twice in Jeopardy, 75 Yale L.J. 264 (1965). See also Mr. Justice Schaefer\u2019s Traynor lecture, Unresolved Issues in the Law of Double Jeopardy: Waller and Ashe, 58 Calif.L. Rev. 391 (1970). No small part of the difficulties in double jeopardy law is traceable to the fact that the same tests have been applied to acquittals and convictions, although the policy considerations relative to reprosecution are quite different.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b565-4\">. With tlie support of Justices Douglas and Marshall, Justice Brennan has continued to hammer away at the Court\u2019s reluctance to consider anew what constitutes the \u201csame offence\u201d for double jeopardy purposes. Sounding a theme that originated with his separate opinions in <em>Abbate </em>and <em>Ashe, </em>he has pressed for adoption of a constitutional requirement of joinder for all charges arising out of a \u201csingle criminal act, occurrence, episode or transaction,\u201d in concurrences, see Simpson v. Florida, 403 U.S. 384, 387, 91 S.Ct. 1801, 29 L.Ed.2d 549 (1971) ; Harris v. Washington, 404 U.S. 55, 57, 92 S.Ct. 183, 30 L.Ed.2d 212 (1971) ; Robinson v. Neil, 409 U.S. 505, 511, 93 S.Ct. 876, 35 L. Ed.2d 29 (1973), and in dissents from denials of certiorari, see Duncan v. Tennessee, 405 U.S. 127, 130, 92 S.Ct. 785, 31 L.Ed.2d 86 (1972) (writ dismissed as improvidently granted) ; Miller v. Oregon, 405 U.S. 1047, 92 S.Ct. 1321, 31 L.Ed.2d 590 (1972) ; Grubb v.

Nathan, 476 F.2d 456, 458-59 (2 Cir. 1973), the court rejected a double jeopardy attack on a second narcotics prosecution (for conspiracy to violate 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 173, 174) allegedly relating to the same conduct as was involved in a prior federal prosecution in Florida where the complaining defendant had pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4704(a). Because of the essential difference in the nature of conspiracy and substantive offenses, it was not true in <em>Nathan </em>\u2014 as it was in <em>Sabella </em>\u2014that \u201cthe government could sustain the second indictment with the selfsame evidence needed to prove the first.\u201d 272 F.2d at 210. In addition, there was doubt in <em>Nathan </em>whether the second conspiracy charge was the same as the first, see 476 F.2d at 458 n.4; there was no such doubt with respect to the two indictments for substantive crimes in <em>Sabella. </em>The <em>Nathan </em>court did not address itself to <em>Sabella, </em>which counsel failed to bring to its attention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b565-11\">.

Compare Justice Schaefer\u2019s perceptive remark: \u201cThe defense of collateral estop-pel will not often be available to a criminal defendant .... Collateral estoppel is therefore of limited value because it is not often possible to determine with precision how the judge or jury has decided any particular issue.\u201d Schaefer, <em>supra </em>note 4, at 394.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b567-8\">. The inference that Congress was thinking in terms of postal use is heightened by a still earlier precursor of \u00a7 501, 5 Stat. 749 (1845), which provided : That if any person or persons shall forge or counterfeit, or shall' utter or use knowingly, any^ounterfeit stamp of the Post Office Department of the United States issued by authority of this act within the United States, or the post office stamp of any foreign Government, he shall be adjudged guilty of felony ....</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>The fact that here there was no prohibition of sale indicates that, in condemning \u201cuse\u201d of counterfeit stamps, the purpose of Congress was to protect the postal revenues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b568-9\">. An 1847 act, which the 1851 statute superseded, further supports the limited construction of the word \u201cuse\u201d in the early postal laws. Like the 1851 act, that statute first provided that the Postmaster General should prepare and distribute stamps for the prepayment of postage. Clearly referring to \u201cuse\u201d in the postal sense, the act authorized a deputy postmaster to \u201csell or dispose of any stamps so received ... to any person who may wish to <em>use </em>the same.\u201d (Emphasis supplied). The act then added two penal provisions. The first made it unlawful \u201cfor any deputy postmaster to prepare, use, or dispose of any postage stamps not authorized by and received from the Postmaster General\u201d; the second contained a more general prohibition against making, uttering, or forging any postage stamp. 9 Stat. 201 (1847).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b568-14\">. Section 177 became \u00a7 3923 of the Revised Statutes. While \u00a7 178 appeared in the title dealing with federal crimes, \u00a7 177 was placed in title 46, which collected the statutes relating to the postal service. Also incorporated in that title was \u00a7 3924, which was drawn from \u00a7 4 of the 1851 act, and which, once again, clearly indicated that the word \u201cuse\u201d was intended to be limited to postal use. Section 3924 made it illegal for Post Office employees to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0k\">willfully and knowingly use, or cause to be used, in prepayment of postage, any postage-stamp, . . . which has already been once used for a like purpose or [to] remove, or attempt to remove, the canceling or defacing marks from any such postage-stamp with intent to use or cause the use of the same a second time, or to sell or offer to sell the same, or [to] remove from letters or other mail the stamps attached to the same in payment of postage with intent to use the same a second time for a like purpose, or to sell, or oiler to sell, the same.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
