Plaintiff alleges jurisdiction resting on diversity of citizenship between the South Dakota trustee and the defendants, one of whom resides in Minnesota.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-10\">Here the trustee serves as a representative of living persons, <em>i.e., </em>the widow and next of kin of Earl Prinsen, deceased. <em>See </em>Minn.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 573.02 (Supp.1973). Under these circumstances, an appointment solely to create diversity jurisdiction will not be recognized by federal courts. The district court properly dismissed the action. This case is controlled by the principles enunciated in Rogers v. Bates, 431 F.2d 16, 18-22 (8th Cir. 1970). <em>Cf. </em>O\u2019Brien v. Stover, 443 F.2d 1013, 1015-1016 (8th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1090-12\">(a) <em>On The Motion Of The Court. </em>The court may at any time, on its own motion and without notice, dispose of an appeal summarily, except that notice must be given if the appeal is in forma pauperis, a certificate of probable cause has been issued, and briefs have not been filed. The court may dismiss an appeal that is not within the jurisdiction of the court or that it finds to be frivolous and entirely without merit, or may affirm or reverse when the questions presented do not require further argument.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1090-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1090-11\">.
