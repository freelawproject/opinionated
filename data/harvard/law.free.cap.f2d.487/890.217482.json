Initially, the order was vacated and remanded to permit the district court \u201cto consider whether the creation of such a position and its filling by a black person in the light of current conditions within the school system is indicated to dismantle the unconstitutional condition that he found to exist.\u201d Davis v. School District of City of Pontiac, Inc., 474 F.2d 46 (6th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-16\">Without a hearing or notice to either party, on April 16, 1973, the district court reinstated its prior order and directed that it be implemented forthwith. A stay of implementation was granted' upon application.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-17\">Appellant contends that the district court did not comply with our directions because it did not afford an opportunity for a hearing to permit appellant to show that under \u201ccurrent conditions\u201d the school system needs only one assistant superintendent. However, we observe that in obedience to the request of the district court, appellant had filed two comprehensive reports summarizing the status of the operations in the School District with particular reference to the progress of efforts to desegregate the system in . compliance with the court\u2019s earlier orders. One status report reflected conditions as of February 29, 1972, and the other, conditions on February 28, 1973. The order from which this appeal is taken was entered April 13, 1973 and, therefore, it cannot be said that the court was without information concerning current conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-18\">The order recites, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-19\">The provisions of the order of this Court mandating the appointment in question, which was entered at the conclusion of the hearing held in July. 1971, was an essential part of the judicial remedy that this Court devised, in the exercise of its discretion, to eliminate the <em>de jure </em>segregation existing at all levels of the Pontiac School System. The requirement that a black assistant superintendent be hired <em>was and continues to be a </em>crucial part of the comprehensive remedy necessary to rectify the result of years of purposeful segregation. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b960-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>We also observe that appellant, which filed the status report, made no request to submit any other evidence in order to demonstrate that an additional assistant superintendent was unnecessary in light of current conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\"> Once a past constitutional violation has been established, \u201cthe scope of a district court\u2019s equitable powers to remedy past wrongs is broad, for breadth and flexibility are inherent in equitable remedies.\u201d Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenberg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 15, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 1276, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971). We hold that the district court sufficiently complied with our directions on remand and that the order, as reinstated, is properly within the scope of the court\u2019s broad equitable powers to eliminate the unconstitutional segregation.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
