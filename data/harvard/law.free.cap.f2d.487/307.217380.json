The motion was supported by an affidavit of Carol M. Brunner, who had been indicted with him and had testified against him, that an Assistant United States Attorney had offered her \u201cspecial favors\u201d in exchange for her testimony against Taylor. It was made clear to her, she stated, that the charges against her \u201cwould be .reduced in consideration of my presenting the most damaging testimony possible against John Taylor.\u201d The Assistant responded with an affidavit stating that the Government \u201cdid not make any promises or offer any special favors\u201d in exchange for her testimony. Judge Travia, in an opinion, denied the application. When it turned out that Taylor had never received the Assistant\u2019s affidavit, the judge reopened the ease and two more sharply conflicting affidavits were filed. This time Brunner stated that the prosecutor had promised her that she would not go to jail if she cooperated with the Government and that he had told her to answer in the negative if asked whether any promises had been made to her, as she did. The Assistant denied these charges as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">On April 16, 1973, the court filed an opinion adhering to its earlier decision. Crediting the Assistant\u2019s affidavit and discrediting Brunner\u2019s the judge concluded that \u201cthe motion papers submitted and the files and records of this court on this case conclusively show that the defendant Taylor is entitled to no relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Taylor appealed to this court and filed his <em>pro se </em>brief on June 19, 1973. The Government\u2019s answering brief was due on July 18, 1973. It filed none and obtained no extension of time. Inquiry from a judge of this court a week before the date scheduled for submission of the appeal developed that the Government, now recognizing that the court had been in error in not conducting an eviden-tiary hearing, was preparing to move for a remand. This it did on November 2, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\"> The Government\u2019s motion refers to \u201cthe position that this Court has taken with respect to the requirement of evidentiary hearing following applications similarly [sic] to that of appellant\u201d and cites as an example a summary order to that effect filed last April. This is disingenuous in the extreme. It is not a novel doctrine peculiar to this court that when a federal prisoner raises an issue which would require a new trial if factually sustained, as the judge conceded to be the case here, see Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 154-155, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972), and presents a sufficient affidavit in its support, an opposing affidavit by the Government is not part of \u201cthe files and records of the case\u201d which can be taken to \u201cconclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief,\u201d within 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The principle was established by the Supreme Court as long ago as Walker v. Johnston, 312 U.S. 275, 61 S. Ct. 574, 85 L.Ed. 830 (1941), and Waley v. Johnston, 316 U.S. 101, 62 S.Ct. 964, 86 L.Ed. 1302 (1942). By this time the rule should be well known to Assistant United States Attorneys, who ought not to lead courts into errors, and to federal trial judges, who ought not to make them. The result of what happened here is that this court has been burdened with an appeal that should never have had to be taken and, more important, that Taylor has been denied an evidentiary hearing he should have had a year ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">The order denying the petition is reversed, with instructions that the petition be assigned to another judge who shall appoint counsel for Taylor and conduct an evidentiary hearing as soon as feasible. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
