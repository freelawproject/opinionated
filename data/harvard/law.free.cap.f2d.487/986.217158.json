JOSEPH SMITH, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1059-6\">Donald Galella, a free-lance photographer, appeals from a summary judgment dismissing his complaint against three Secret Service agents for false arrest, malicious prosecution and interference with trade (S.D.N.Y., Edward C. McLean, Judge),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the dismissal after trial of his identical complaint against Jacqueline Onassis and the grant of injunc-tive relief to defendant Onassis on her counterclaim and to the intervenor, the United States, on its intervening complaint and a third judgment retaxing transcript costs to plaintiff (S.D.N.Y., Irving Ben Cooper, Judge), 353 F.Supp. 196 (1972). In addition to numerous alleged procedural errors, Galella raises the First Amendment as an absolute shield against liability to any sanctions. The judgments dismissing the complaints are affirmed; the grant of injunctive relief is affirmed as herein modified. Taxation of costs against the plaintiff is affirmed in part, reversed in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-8\">Galella is a free-lance photographer specializing in the making and sale of photographs of well-known persons. Defendant Onassis is the widow of the late President, John F. Kennedy, mother of the two Kennedy children, John and Caroline, and is the wife of Aristotle Onassis, widely known shipping figure and reputed multimillionaire. John Walsh, James Kalafatis and John Connelly are U. S. Secret Service agents assigned to the duty of protecting the Kennedy children under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3056, which provides for protection of the children of deceased presidents up to the age of 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-9\">Galella fancies himself as a \u201cpaparazzo\u201d (literally a kind of annoying insect, perhaps roughly equivalent to the Eng<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>lish \u201cgadfly.\u201d) Paparazzi make themselves as visible to the public and obnoxious to their photographic subjects as possible to aid in the advertisement and wide sale of their works.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1060-4\">Some examples of Galella\u2019s conduct brought out at trial are illustrative. Galella took pictures of John Kennedy riding his bicycle in Central Park across the way from his home. He jumped out into the boy\u2019s path, causing the agents concern for John\u2019s safety. The agents\u2019 reaction and interrogation of Galella led to Galella\u2019s arrest and his action against the agents; Galella on other occasions interrupted Caroline at tennis, and invaded the children\u2019s private schools. At one time he came uncomfortably close in a power boat to Mrs. Onassis swimming. He often jumped and postured around while taking pictures of her party notably at a theater opening but also on numerous other occasions. He followed a practice of bribing apartment house, restaurant and nightclub doormen as well as romancing a family servant to keep him advised of the movements of the family.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-5\">After detention and arrest following complaint by the Secret Service agents protecting Mrs. Onassis\u2019 son and his acquittal in the state court, Galella filed suit in state court against the agents and Mrs. Onassis. Galella claimed that under orders from Mrs. Onassis, the three agents had falsely arrested and maliciously prosecuted him, and that this incident in addition to several others described in the complaint constituted an unlawful interference with his trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-6\">Mrs. Onassis answered denying any role in the arrest or any part in the claimed interference with his attempts to photograph her, and counterclaimed for damages<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and injunctive relief, charging that Galella had invaded her privacy, assaulted and battered her, intentionally inflicted emotional distress and engaged in a campaign of harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-11\">The action was removed under 28 U. S.C. \u00a7 1442(a) to the United States District Court. On a motion for summary judgment, Galella\u2019s claim against the Secret Service agents was dismissed, the court finding that the agents were acting within the scope of their authority and thus were immune from prosecution. At the same time, the government intervened requesting injunctive relief from the activities of Galella which obstructed the Secret Service\u2019s ability to protect Mrs. Onassis\u2019 children.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Galella\u2019s motion to remand the case to state court, just prior to trial, was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-12\">Certain incidents of photographic coverage by Galella, subsequent to an agreement among the parties for Galella not to so engage, resulted in the issuance of a temporary restraining order to prevent further harassment of Mrs. Onassis and the children. Galella was enjoined from \u201charassing, alarming, startling, tormenting, touching the person of the defendant ... or her children . ... and from blocking their movements in the public places and thoroughfares, invading their immediate zone of privacy by means of physical movements, gestures or with photographic equipment and from performing any act reasonably calculated to place the lives and safety of the defendant . . _ and her children in jeopardy.\u201d Within two months, Galella was charged with violation of the temporary restraining order; a new order was signed which required that the photographer keep 100 yards from the Onassis apartment and 50 yards from the person of the defendant and her children. Surveillance was also prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-15\">Upon notice of consolidation of the preliminary injunction hearing and trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>for permanent injunction, plaintiff moved for a jury trial \u2014 nine months after answer was served, and to remand to state- court. The first motion was denied as untimely, the second on grounds of judicial economy. Just prior to trial Galella deposed Mrs. Onassis. Under protective order of this court, the defendant was allowed to testify at the office of the U. S. Attorney and outside the presence of Galella.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-5\">After a six-week trial the court dismissed Galella\u2019s claim and granted relief to both the defendant and the intervenor. Galella was enjoined from (1) keeping the defendant and her children under surveillance or following any of them; (2) approaching within 100 yards of the home of defendant or her children, or within 100 yards of either child\u2019s school or within 75 yards of either child or 50 yards of defendant; (3) using the name, portrait or picture of defendant or her children for advertising; (4) attempting to communicate with defendant or her children except through her attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-6\">We conclude that grant of summary judgment and dismissal of Galella\u2019s claim against the Secret Service agents was proper. Federal agents when charged with duties which require the exercise of discretion are immune from liability for actions within the scope of their authority. Ordinarily enforcement agents charged with the duty of arrest are not so immune. Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bur. of Narc., 456 F.2d 1339 (2d Cir. 1972). The protective duties assigned the agents under this statute, however, require the instant exercise of judgment which should be protected. The agents saw Galella jump into the path of John Kennedy who was forced to swerve his bike dangerously as he left Central Park and was about to enter Fifth Avenue, whereupon the agents gave chase to the photographer. Galella indicated that he was a press photographer listed with the New York City Police; he and the agents went to the police station to check on the story, where one of the agents made the complaint on which the state court charges were based. Certainly it was reasonable that the agents \u201ccheck out\u201d an individual who has endangered their charge,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and seek prosecution for apparent violation of state law which interferes with them in the discharge of their duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-11\">If an officer is acting within his role as a government officer his conduct is at least within the outer perimeter of his authority. <em>Bivens, supra, </em>456 F.2d at 1345.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Secret Service agents were charged under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3056 with \u201cguarding against and preventing any activity by any individual which could create a risk to the safety and well being of the . . . \u25a0 children or result in their physical injury.\u201d It was undisputed that the agents were on duty at the time, and there was evidence that they believed John Kenendy to be endangered by Galella\u2019s actions. Unquestionably the agents were acting within the scope of their authority.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1061-13\"> To be sure, even where acting within their authority, not all federal agents are immune from liability. Immunity is accorded officials whose de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>cisions involve an element of discretion so that the decisions may be made without fear or threat of vexatious or fictitious suits and alleged personal liability. Ove Gustavsson Contracting Co. v. Floete, 299 F.2d 655, 659 (2d Cir. 1962), cert, denied, 374 U.S. 827, 83 S.Ct. 1862, 10 L.Ed.2d 1050 (1963). The issue in each case is whether the public interest in a particular official\u2019s unfettered judgments outweighs the private rights that may be violated.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See Bivens, supra, </em>456 F.2d at 1346. The protective duties of the agents on assignments similar to this warrant this protection.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See Scherer v. Brennan, 379 F.2d 609 (7th Cir.), cert, denied, 389 U.S. 1021, 88 S.Ct. 592, 19 L.Ed.2d 666 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-4\">Discrediting all of Galella\u2019s testimony <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the court found the photographer guilty of harassment, intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault and battery, commercial exploitation of defendant\u2019s personality, and invasion of privacy. Fully crediting defendant\u2019s testimony, the court found no liability on Galella\u2019s claim. Evidence offered by the defense showed that Galella had on occasion intentionally physically touched Mrs. Onassis and her daughter, caused fear of physical contact in his frenzied attempts to get their pictures, followed defendant and her children too closely in an automobile, endangered the safety of the children while they were swimming, water skiing and horseback riding. Ga-lella cannot successfully challenge the court\u2019s finding of tortious conduct.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1062-11\">Finding that Galella had \u201cinsinuated himself into the very fabric of Mrs. Onassis\u2019 life . . . \u201d the court framed its relief in part on the need to prevent further invasion of the defendant's privacy. Whether or not this accords with present New York law, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>is no doubt that it is sustainable under New York\u2019s proscription of harassment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1063-5\">Of course legitimate countervailing social needs may warrant some intrusion despite an individual\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy and freedom from harassment. However the interference allowed may be no greater than that necessary to protect the overriding public interest. Mrs. Onassis was properly found to be a public figure and thus subject to news coverage. <em>See </em>Sidis v. F. R. Publishing Corp., 113 F.2d 806 (2d Cir.), cert, denied, 311 U.S. 711, 61 S.Ct. 393, 85 L.Ed. 462 (1940). Nonetheless, Galella\u2019s action went far beyond the reasonable bounds of news gathering. When weighed against the <em>de minimis </em>public importance of the daily activities of the defendant, Galella\u2019s constant surveillance, his obtrusive and intruding presence, was unwarranted and unreasonable. If there were any doubt in our minds, Galella\u2019s inexcusable conduct toward defendant\u2019s minor children would resolve it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-10\">Galella does not seriously dispute the court\u2019s finding of tortious conduct. Rather, he sets up the First Amendment as a wall of immunity protecting newsmen from any liability for their conduct while gathering news. There is no such scope to the First Amendment right. Crimes and torts committed in news gathering are not protected. <em>See </em>Branzburg v. Hayes, 408 U.S. 665, 92 S.Ct. 2646, 33 L.Ed.2d 626 (1972); Rosenbloom v. Metromedia, 403 U.S. 29, 91 S.Ct. 1811, 29 L.Ed.2d 296 (1971); Dietemann v. Time, Inc., 449 F.2d 245, 249-250 (9th Cir. 1971). <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>Restatement of Torts 2d \u00a7 652(f), comment k (Tent. Draft No. 13, 1967). There is no threat to a free press in requiring its agents to act within the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-4\">In addition to his substantive claims, Galella challenges the court\u2019s (a) refusal to remand the case; (b) refusal to allow a jury trial despite an untimely request; (c) exclusion of Galella from defendant\u2019s deposition; (d) failure to recuse himself; (e) consolidation of the temporary injunctive proceedings and trial on the merits. Numerous claims of error in evidentiary rulings are also raised. Little need be said about most of these evidentiary rulings;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the rulings were either clearly correct or if error, harmless.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Galella\u2019s procedural claims must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-5\">Galella\u2019s claim against Mrs. Onassis, originally in federal court as an action joined with that against the Secret Service agents, was not automatically stripped of federal pendent jurisdiction by the dismissal of the claim against the agents. United Mineworkers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966); <em>see </em>Almenares v. Wyman, 453 F.2d 1075, 1084 (2d Cir. 1971), cert, denied, 405 U.S. 944, 92 S.Ct. 962, 40 L.Ed.2d 815 (1972). Whether the claim was to be remanded was within the court\u2019s discretion after consideration of judicial economy and fairness to the litigants. United Mineworkers v. Gibbs, <em>supra, </em>383 U.S. at 726, 86 S.Ct. 1130. The motion to remand was made six months after dismissal of the suit against the agents and on the eve of trial; the United States Government had then intervened in the case,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> a series of hearings on the substantive claims had been heard by the federal court, a special master in charge of discovery had been appointed and a number of motions had been heard, and others were pending.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> As no claim of unfairness has been raised, considerations of judicial economy govern and support the court\u2019s denial of the motion to remand. A great deal of judicial effort had been expended in covering ground that must be gone over anew had remand been ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-10\"> Untimely requests for jury trial must be denied unless some cause beyond mere inadvertence is shown. Noonan v. Cunard Steamship Co., 375 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>F.2d 69 (2d Cir. 1967). Galella explains the delay in making the request as a result of the removal proceedings and the fact that New York does not require a written request for a jury trial. Precisely the same allegations were made and correctly rejected in Leve v. General Motors Corp., 248 F.Supp. 344 (S.D. N.Y.1965). No error was made in refusing to excuse the untimeliness of the motion; any other decision would have been reversible error. <em>See Noonan, supra, </em>375 F.2d at 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-4\">Circumstances of a deposition may be governed by the court\u2019s protective order. The court may order that \u201cdiscovery be conducted with no one present except persons designated by the court.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(c). The extent of the court\u2019s authority to determine those present was enlarged by the 1970 revision of the Rules of Discovery. Pri- or to the revision, Rule 30(b) allowed the court to order discovery to be conducted \u201cwith no one present except the parties to the action and their officers or counsel. . . . \u201d In view of the revision, it is clear that the court has the power to exclude even a party,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> although such an exclusion should be ordered rarely indeed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-6\"> The grant and nature of protection is singularly within the discretion of the district court and may be reversed only on a clear showing of abuse of discretion. Chemical &amp; Industrial Corp. v. Druffel, 301 F.2d 126, 129 (6th Cir. 1962); Essex Wire Corp. v. Eastern Electric Sales Co., 48 F.R.D. 308, 310 (E.D.Pa.1969). While we might have assessed the need to exclude Galella differently, we cannot find the court\u2019s ruling clearly erroneous. At the time the order was issued, Galella had already^ been charged with violation of the court\u2019s temporary restraining order which was entered to protect the defendant from further harassment. Such conduct could be deemed to reflect both an irrepressible intent to continue plaintiff\u2019s harassment of defendant and his complete disregard for judicial process. Anticipation of misconduct during the examination could reasonably have been founded on either.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-11\">The court\u2019s refusal to recuse himself was correct. See United States ex rel. Brown v. Smith, 200 F. Supp. 885, 930 (D.Vt.1961), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 306 F.2d 596 (2d Cir. 1962), cert denied, 372 U.S. 959, 83 S.Ct. 1012, 10 L.Ed.2d 11 (1963); United States v. Sclafani and Ross, 487 F.2d 245 at 255 (2d Cir. 1973). A judge may be disqualified for bias only on motion supported by a written affidavit of facts supporting the claim of bias and a certificate of good faith from the counsel of record. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 144. Galella failed to comply with the statute; no showing was made of a legal basis for the claim, no motion was made nor affidavit filed. Informal requests to the court, or failure to comply with the statute because of an expectation of denial, however well founded, cannot be substituted for compliance with \u00a7 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-12\">Galella claims that notice given him of consolidation under Rule 65(a)(2) of preliminary injunction proceedings and the trial was inadequate in that he was not advised of the consolidation sufficiently in advance of trial to properly prepare. The claim borders on the frivolous. The required notice under Rule 65 is solely for the purpose of alerting the parties that the hearing is to be the final determination of the action. <em>See </em>7 J. Moore, Federal Practice [[ 65.04[4]. Galella knew five weeks before trial that the actions on the preliminary and permanent injunction had been consolidated. There is thus no merit to an attack on sufficiency of notice under Rule 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-13\">Essentially Galella\u2019s challenge is one of denial of due process; he contends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>that the court\u2019s scheduling of trial unfairly limited his preparation for trial. The claim is based generally on depositions and discovery either not made or not completed.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Here any lack of discovery was due to plaintiff\u2019s own dilatory actions; it was not error for the court to proceed. <em>See </em>Eli Lilly &amp; Co. v. Generix Drug Sales, 460 F.2d 1096, 1105 (5th Cir. 1972). Issue was joined and counterclaim filed by September, 1970, and the ease removed in October, 1970. Yet even by the time of trial in 1972 Galella had not yet noticed for deposition defendant\u2019s husband (a witness Galella says he was deprived of deposing by the scheduling.) <footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1066-4\">Scheduling of trials is for the trial courts. Only where actual and substantial prejudice can be shown will a court\u2019s calendar orders be reviewed. Galella has made no such showing. He himself requested consolidation in October, 1971; that motion was withdrawn in January, 1972; the court however indicated that it would consolidate the proceedings as both the plaintiff and defendant had requested, and planned to go to trial as soon as a space opened on his calendar. Galella had five weeks\u2019 notice of the expected date of trial. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-5\">Injunctive relief is appropriate. Galella has stated his intention to continue his coverage of defendant so long as she is newsworthy, and his continued harassment even while the temporary restraining orders were in effect indicate that no voluntary change in his technique can be expected. New York court! have found similar conduct sufficient to support a claim for injunctive relief. Flamm v. Van Nierop, 56 Misc.2d 1059, 291 N.Y.S.2d 189 (1968).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1066-9\">The injunction, however, is broader than is required to protect the defendant. Relief must be tailored to protect Mrs. Onassis from the \u201cpaparazzo\u201d attack which distinguishes Galella\u2019s behavior from that of other photographers; it should not unnecessarily infringe on reasonable effors to \u201ccover\u201d defendant. Therefore, we modify the court\u2019s order to prohibit only (1) any approach within twenty-five (25) feet of defendant or any touching of the person of the defendant Jacqueline Onassis; (2) any blocking of her movement in public places and thoroughfares; (3) any act foreseeably or reasonably calculated to place the life and safety of defendant in jeopardy; and (4) any conduct which would reasonably be foreseen to harass, alarm or frighten the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-10\">Any further restriction on Galella\u2019s taking and selling pictures of defendant for news coverage is, however, improper and unwarranted by the evidence. See Estate of Hemingway v. Random House, Inc., 49 Misc.2d 726, 268 N.Y.S.2d 531, 535, aff\u2019d 25 A.D.2d 719, 269 N.Y.S.2d 366 (1966); Youssoupoff v. Columbia Broadcasting, 41 Misc. 2d 42, 244 N.Y.S.2d 701, 704, aff\u2019d 19 A.D.2d 865, 244 N.Y.S.2d 1 (1963); Thompson v. C. P. Putnam\u2019s Sons, 40 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>Misc.2d 608, 243 N.Y.S.2d 652, 654 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-4\">Likewise, we affirm the grant of injunctive relief to the government modified to prohibit any action interfering with Secret Service agents\u2019 protective duties. Galella thus may be enjoined from (a) entering the children\u2019s schools or play areas; (b) engaging in action calculated or reasonably foreseen to place the children\u2019s safety or well being in jeopardy, or which would threaten or create physical injury; (c) taking any action which could reasonably be foreseen to harass, alarm, or frighten the children; and (d) from approaching within thirty (30) feet of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-5\">Taxation of costs of a daily transcript of trial may be assessed against a party by the court, where they are \u201cnecessarily obtained for use in the case.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920. <em>See </em>Oscar Gruss &amp; Son v. Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co., 422 F.2d 1278 (2d Cir. 1970). Galella was ordered to pay the cost of four daily copies, one each for the government intervenor and the court, and two for defendant.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> To assess the losing party with the premium cost of daily transcripts, necessity \u2014 beyond the mere convenience of counsel \u2014 must be shown. Delaware Valley Marine Supply Co. v. American Tobacco Co., 199 F.Supp. 560, 561 (E.D.Pa.1960). We cannot say that no such showing has been made here.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> There does not, however, appear any justification for allowing multiple copies to the defendant. Galella therefore should not be taxed for any more than the cost of a transcript at the daily rate for three copies, one for the defendants, one for the intervenor and one for the court.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> See Farmer v.

They have supported their motion by affidavits. I will treat it as a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-13\">The moving defendants are Special Agents of the United States Secret Service. The Secret Service is charged by statute with the responsibility for protecting the persons of minor children of a former president until they reach the age of 16. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3056. These defendants were assigned to protect the children of President Kennedy, Caroline and John Jr., neither of whom is sixteen. They were acting in that capacity throughout the period involved in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-15\">It is well settled that a government employee is immune from suit for acts dong in the course of his official duties within the scope of his employment. Barr v. Mateo [Matteo] 360 U.S. 564 [79 S.Ct. 1335, 3 L.Ed.2d 1434] (1959) ; Gregoire v. Biddle, 177 F.2d 579 (2d Cir. 1949) ; Ove Gustavsson Contracting Co. v. Floete, 299 F.2d 655 (2d Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-16\">The question is whether the^e defendants were acting within the scope of their employment in performing the acts of which plaintiff complains. I have no doubt that they were. The fact that plaintiff feels aggrieved by their acts is immaterial. Doubtless this is a factual question but plaintiff\u2019s affidavits in opposition to this motion do not raise a triable issue on this aspect of the case. For sound policy reasons explained at length in the decisions on the subject, these agents, under the circumstances of this case are immune from suit and may not be called upon to defend themselves against plaintiff\u2019s extravagant claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-17\">The decision of the Supreme Court in Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics [403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619] (June 21, 1971) relied upon by plaintiff does not, in my opinion, require the denial of this motion. Not only were the facts of that case very different from those here, but more important, the Supreme Court expressly stated that it was not passing upon the question of immunity from liability by virtue of their official position. 39 U.S. Law Week at 4824.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-18\">The motion is granted.

Manor Nursing Centers, Inc., 458 F.2d 1082, 1100 (2 Cir. 1972). That certainly is the settled law in this Circuit. And it is the command of Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-5\">In the instant case, after a six week trial at which 25 witnesses testified, hundreds of exhibits were received and a 4,714 page record was compiled,- Judge Cooper filed a careful, comprehensive 40 page opinion, 353 F.Supp. 194, which meticulously sets forth detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law. As for the provisions of the injunction requiring Galella -to keep certain distances away from Mrs. Onassis and her children (from the modification of which I dissent), Judge Cooper stated his reasons for these provisions as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1068-6\">\u201cFor practical reasons, the injunction cannot be couched in terms of prohibitions upon Galella\u2019s leaping, blocking, taunting, grunting, hiding and the like. Nor have abstract concepts \u2014 harassing, endangering\u2014 proved workable. No effective relief seems possible without the fixing of proscribed distances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1068-7\">We must moreover make certain plaintiff keeps sufficiently far enough away to avoid problems as to compliance with the injunction and injurious disobedience. Disputes concerning his compliance may be frequent, thereby necessitating repeated application to the Court. Hence, the restraint must be clear, simple and effective so that Galella\u2019s substantial compliance cannot seriously be disputed unless a violation occurs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1068-9\">Of major importance in determining the scope of the relief to be afforded here is the attitude which Galella has demonstrated toward the process of this Court in the past. Galella blatantly violated our restraining orders of October 8 and December 2, 1971. He did so deliberately and in full knowledge of the fact of his violation. His deliberate disobedience to the subpoena and his attempts to obstruct justice with respect to Exhibit G, together with the perjury that infected his testimony, do not warrant mere token relief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1068-10\">In light of Galella\u2019s repeated misbehavior, it is clear that only a strong restraint \u2014 an injunction which will clearly protect Mrs. Onassis\u2019 rights and leave no room for quibbling about compliance and no room for evasion or circumvention \u2014 is appropriate in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1068-11\">-X- * -X-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1068-12\">As for the actual distance to be proscribed, we must bear in mind that plaintiff never moved to modify the distances heretofore imposed by our restraining order, even after the Court had clearly and explicitly invited him to do so if he could prove it was too harsh. (Minutes, Proceedings January 19, 1972, p. 31).\u201d 353 F.Supp. at 237.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1068-14\">I have set forth the foregoing explanation by Judge Cooper of his reasons for the critical distance provisions of the injunction because they are weighty findings by the trial judge who had the benefit of seeing the parties before him and who obviously was in a better position than we to judge their demeanor. I feel very strongly that such findings should not be set aside or drastically modified by our Court unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>they are clearly erroneous; and I do not understand the majority to suggest that they are.</p>\n<p id=\"AoD\">But here is what the majority\u2019s modification of the critical distance provisions of the injunction has done:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1069-6\">DISTANCES GALELLA AS PROVIDED IN AS MODIFIED BY IS REQUIRED TO DISTRICT COURT COURT OF APPEALS MAINTAIN INJUNCTION MAJORITY</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1069-7\">From home of Mrs. Onassis and her children 100 yards No restriction</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1069-10\">From children\u2019s schools 100 yards Restricted only from entering schools or play areas <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1069-13\">From Mrs. Onassis personally 50 <em>yards 25 feet </em>and not to touch her</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1069-15\">From children personally 75 <em>yards </em>30 <em>feet </em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1069-19\">In addition to modifying the distance restrictions of the injunction, the majority also has directed that Galella be prohibited from blocking Mrs. Onassis\u2019 movement in public places and thoroughfares ; from any act \u201cforeseeably or reasonably calculated\u201d to place Mrs. Onassis\u2019 life and safety in jeopardy (and similarly with respect to her children); and from any conduct which would \u201creasonably be foreseen\u201d to harass, alarm or frighten Mrs. Onassis (and similarly with respect to her children).</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-20\">With deference, I believe the majority\u2019s modification of the injunction in the respects indicated above to be unwarranted and unworkable. Briefly summarized, the following are the reasons for my dissent from the modification of the injunction:</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-21\">(1) The majority ignores the weighty findings of the district court. Without holding them clearly erroneous,</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-23\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a), the majority simply sets them aside and substitutes its own perimeters for those carefully and wisely drawn by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-24\">(2) This results, for example, in a wholly unexplained and anomalous 84% reduction of the distance Galella is required to keep away from Mrs. Onassis (from. 50 <em>yards </em>to 25 <em>feet), </em>and an equally implausible 87% reduction of the distance he is required to keep away from the children (from 75 <em>yards </em>to 30 <em>feet). -</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1069-25\">(3) It further results in no restriction whatsoever against Galella\u2019s hovering at the entrance to the home of Mrs. Onassis and her children (where he has caused such agonizing humiliation in the past), or at the schools attended 'by the children \u2014just so he does not physically en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>ter their schools or play areas. This strikes me as an invitation for trouble.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-4\">(4) The majority, in substituting its own injunctive provisions for those of the district court, has couched its prohibitions in terms of conduct <em>\u201cforeseeably or reasonably calculated\u201d </em>to endanger the life or safety of Mrs. Onassis or her children, or conduct which would <em>\u201creasonably be foreseen\u201d </em>to harass, alarm or frighten them, (emphasis added). These are just the sort of abstract concepts which the district court found to be unworkable and ineffective. 353 F. Supp. at 237. They do not comply with the specificity requirement of Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(d) (\u201cEvery order granting an injunction shall be specific in terms. . . .\").

The district court was justifiably concerned \u2014 in view of Galel-la\u2019s record of outrageous disregard of the court\u2019s previous restraining orders \u2014 that it would be confronted with repeated compliance applications in the future. The majority\u2019s substitution of such abstract concepts as \u201creasonably foreseen\u201d and \u201cforeseeably calculated\u201d for the clear, simple and effective distance restrictions in the district court injunction seems to me virtually to assure the compliance disputes that the district court wisely sought to avert.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-7\">(5) In modifying the injunctive relief granted by the district court, I fear that the majority has overlooked the fact that the record shows that Ga-lella in the past has jeopardized the lives and safety of Mrs. Onassis and her children and has done so <em>in the teeth of previous restraining orders of the district court. </em>One of the particularly weighty findings of the district court in support of the scope of injunctive relief granted was that \u201cGalella blatantly violated our restraining orders of October 8 and December 2, 1971. He did so deliberately and in full knowledge of the fact of his violation.\u201d 353 F.Supp. at 237. Our Court has been particularly adamant against disturbing a district court\u2019s grant of injunctive relief when the parties enjoined \u201ccontinued to violate the . laws even after a consent decree had been entered enjoining them from such conduct\u201d and when \u201c[t]hey have persisted in their contention that their past conduct was not improper . . . .\u201d SEC v. Koenig, 469 F.2d 198, 202 (2 Cir. 1972), citing SEC v. MacElvain, 417 F.2d 1134, 1137 (5 Cir. 1969), cert, denied, 397 U.S. 972 (1970), and SEC v. Manor Nursing Centers, Inc., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-10\">(6) All else aside, the wisdom and fairness of the distance restrictions which the district court provided for in its permanent injunction\u2014 which are substantially identical to those in its temporary restraining order of December 2, 1971 and which were in effect until July 20, 1972 \u2014 appear to be borne out by the failure of Galella ever to request the district court to modify such restrictions, despite the express invitation-of the district court to Galella to do so: \u201cAs for the actual distance to be proscribed, we must bear in mind that plaintiff never moved to modify the distances heretofore imposed by our restraining order, even after the Court had clearly and explicitly invited him to do so if he could prove it was too harsh.\u201d 353 F. Supp. at 237. Pursuant to the district court\u2019s decision of July 5, 1972 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>requesting that the form of injunction be settled on three days notice, both sides submitted proposed judgments which were identical in all respects here material; neither in his proposed form of judgment nor in his memorandum accompanying it did Galella interpose any objection whatsoever to the distance restrictions on the ground that they were too harsh or onerous. Since the district court never was afforded an opportunity to pass upon such questions which are raised for the first time on appeal, I see no compelling reason for departing from the long settled rule in this Circuit that such matters should not be reached by us on appeal. Ring v. Authors\u2019 League of America, 186 F.2d 637, 641 (2 Cir.) (L. Hand, C. J.: \u201cIf a party\u2019s sensibilities are so tender, the least we must demand is that he make known his complaint at a time when it can be remedied.\u201d), cert, denied sub nom. Ring v. Spina, 341 U.S. 935 (1951); United States v. Five Cases, 179 F.2d 519, 523-24 (2 Cir.) (Swan, C. J., aff\u2019g judgment entered on jury verdict after trial before Hincks, D. J.), cert, denied, 339 U.S. 963 (1950). At the very least, if there is to be any modification of the injunction with respect to the distance provisions (and I believe none is warranted), then the case should be remanded to the district court which obviously is in a far better position to make such determinations after a hearing than are we. After all, what possible basis is there in this record for us as appellate judges to say that Galella should keep 25 feet, rather than 50 yards, away from Mrs. Onassis; or that he should remain 30 feet, rather than 75 yards, away from the children?</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-4\">(7) Finally, I am utterly unable to find any basis in the record or any justification as a matter of law for the majority\u2019s modification of the injunction so as to limit the protection provided for the children to the \u201cgrant of injunctive relief to the <em>government </em>modified to prohibit any action interfering with Secret Service agents\u2019 protective duties.\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Supra </em>at p. 999. Just two paragraphs before this, the majority has modified the injunction to prohibit Galella from engaging in four types of conduct directed at \u201cdefendant Jacqueline Onassis\u201d, with no mention of the children. <em>Id. </em>And yet the claim for injunctive relief sought in the counterclaim filed March 8, 1971 was explicitly \u201cfor the personal safety of defendant [Mrs. Onassis] and of her infant children\u201d. The judgment entered July 20, 1972 provided, in paragraph 4, for injunctive relief for the protection of Mrs. Onassis and both of her children; the only reference to the government in the injunctive provisions of the judgment is in subparagraph (viii) of paragraph 4 where Galella is enjoined from \u201cotherwise interfering with any agent of the United States of America in the performance of protective duties relating to Caroline B. Kennedy or John F. Kennedy, Jr.\u201d As I read the majority\u2019s modification of the injunction, to the extent that it distinguishes between protection for Mrs. Onassis and that for the children, limiting the latter to the grant of injunctive relief to the government, the net effect is to strip the children of any protection under the injunction after they reach age 16 when their protection by the Secret Service ceases. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3056 (1970). For Caroline, who was born November 27, 1957, this means that one of her birthday presents \u2014 less than two months away\u2014 will be exposure to the resumed predatory conduct of the paparazzo Galella who will be totally unrestrained with respect to her by the injunction as modified by the majority. For John, who was born November 25, 1960, he has only three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>years to wait for similar exposure. To strip these children, before they reach their majority, of the protection of the injunction of the United States District Court below, is to deny to them and to their mother the very least to which they are entitled under the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-4\">I most respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-5\">ON PETITION FOR REHEARING</p>\n<p id=\"AOb\">A petition for a rehearing having been filed herein by counsel for appellee Jacqueline Onassis,</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-6\">Upon consideration thereof, it is Ordered that said petition be and it hereby is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1069-22\"> As pointed out below, the majority appears further to have modified the injunction, by limiting the protection of the children to the \u201cgrant of injunctive relief to the <em>government </em>modified to prohibit any action interfering with Secret Service agents\u2019 protective duties.\u201d (emphasis added). The district court injunction was not so limited. It granted injunc-tive relief for the protection of the children as specifically prayed for <em>by Mrs. Onassis. </em>The distinction introduced by the majority, as indicated below, substantially reduces the protection provided for the children.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<author id=\"b1072-7\">TIMBERS, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Arqd\">votes to grant the petition for rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-8\">ON PETITION FOR REHEARING EN BANC</p>\n<p id=\"A2g\">A petition for a rehearing containing a suggestion that the action be reheard en banc having been filed herein by counsel for appellee Jacqueline Onassis, and a poll of the judges in regular active service having been taken on the request of such a judge, and Chief Judge Kaufman, Circuit Judges Friendly, Hays, Feinberg, Mansfield and Mulligan having voted to deny the petition, and Circuit Judges Oakes and Timbers having voted <em>to </em>grant the petition, and a per curiam opinion and an opinion by Circuit Judge Timbers having been filed,</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-9\">Upon consideration thereof, it is Ordered that said petition be and it hereby is denied.</p>\n<author id=\"b1072-10\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1072-11\">Our brothers Oakes and Timbers have, as they characterize it, dissented \u201conce again\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from this Court\u2019s denial of en banc reconsideration of a panel decision. In their dissenting opinion, they have recognized that en banc review is not appropriate simply to resolve a mere disagreement with the outcome reached by a panel of this Court. Our dissenting brothers note, however, that they find in this ease not merely an erroneous decision but a substantial question of unusual importance. Wholly aside from our view whether it was proper for the panel to modify the district court\u2019s decree, we cannot agree with their assessment of the importance of the question before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-14\">Although we sympathize with the plight of Mrs. Onassis, it hardly need be stated that the importance of a decision does not turn on whether the litigants stand in the limelight of public recognition or in, the shadows of anonymity. Rather, significance rests on the prece-dential impact that a determination of this Court is likely to have on the future course of the law and hence on the lives of countless others.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-15\">When examined from this perspective, it is quite clear that the panel\u2019s decision does not rise to the threshold of importance requisite to en banc reconsideration. To be sure the issue of what constitutes the appropriate standard for appellate review of the terms of an in-junctive decree is indeed important. And, if the panel had recast the traditional yardstick into a test other than abuse of the wide discretion accorded the district court in formulating its decree, International Salt Co. v. United States, 332 U.S. 392, 400-401, 68 S.Ct. 12, 92 L. Ed. 20 (1947); United States v. National Lead Co., 332 U.S. 319, 335, 67 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>S.Ct. 1634, 91 L.Ed. 2077 (1947), then we too would have responded affirmatively to a request for. en banc review. But it did not do this. Although several members of the Court may dislike the result, the principle embodied in the majority\u2019s opinion is not a departure from the established rule. Since we foresee minimal precedential impact for this decision, and because we are properly concerned that the sparse judicial resources of this Court should not be expended unnecessarily \u2014 particularly where the question is not of unusual importance \u2014 reconsideration of the question en banc would be wholly unwarranted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1072-12\">. The three cases cited by our dissenting brothers as illustrative of our failure to \u201cbe more gingerly about declining to act as a full court in ruling upon substantial questions of unusual importance,\u201d Eisen v. Carlisle &amp; Jacquelin, 479 F.2d 1005, 1020-1026 (2 Cir. 1973), cert, granted, 414 U.S. 908, 94 S.Ct. 235, 38 L.Ed.2d 146 (1973) ; Boraas v. Village of Belle Terre, 476 F.2d 806, 824-827 (2 Cir. 1973), prob. juris, noted, 414 U.S. 907, 94 S. Ctr'234, 38 L.Ed.2d 145 (1973) ; Zahn v. International Paper Co., 469 F.2d 1033, 1040-1042 (2 Cir. 1972), eert. granted, 410 U.S. 925, 93 S.Ct. 1370, 35 L.Ed.2d 585 (1973), indeed only prove the wisdom of our careful selectivity. At a time of burgeoning calendars, we do well at least to recognize those cases which should not tarry in this Court many months during en banc proceedings when resolution by the Supreme Court is inevitable. Surely our insight was confirmed when the highest court agreed to review our panel decisions in the cited cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1073-5\">TIMBERS, Circuit Judge, with whom OAKES, Circuit Judge, concurs</author>\n<p id=\"A9t\">(dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc):</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-6\">Once again, although Judge Oakes and I have voted in favor of en banc reconsideration of the 2-1 panel decision in this case, we have been unsuccessful in mustering a majority vote of the active judges to do-so. While we recognize that we may be fighting a rear guard action in our attempt to persuade our colleagues to be more gingerly about declining to act as a full court in ruling upon substantial questions of unusual importance, we nevertheless have not given up hope. Moreover; the pattern that has emerged from recent similar situations is quite clear. See, e. g., Eisen v. Carlisle &amp; Jacquelin, 479 F.2d 1005, 1020-26 (2 Cir. 1973) (en banc denied, 5-3), cert, granted, 42 U.S.L.W. 3226 (U.S. Oct. 15, 1973); Boraas v. Village of Belle Terre, 476 F.2d 806, 824-27 (2 Cir. 1973) (en banc denied, 4-4), prob. juris, noted, 42 U.S.L.W. 3226 (U.S. Oct. 15, 1973); Zahn v. International Paper Co., 469 F.2d 1033, 1040-42 (2 Cir. 1972) (en banc denied, 4-3, i. e. 4 in favor of en banc, 3 against), cert, granted, 410 U.S. 925 (1973), aff\u2019d, 42 U.S.L.W. 4087 (U.S. Dec. 17,1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-7\">I have already stated as best I can in my panel dissent, 487 F.2d at 999, the reasons I believe the majority\u2019s modification of the injunctive relief found necessary by the district court to protect Mrs. Onassis and her children from the continued predatory conduct of Galel-la constituted an unwarranted appellate interference with the district court\u2019s discretion, especially absent any suggestion by the majority that the weighty findings of the district court were clearly erroneous. We recognize at this stage of the case, however, that an en banc rehearing normally will not be granted \u201c \u2018merely\u2019 to correct individual injustices or mistakes\u201d. <em>Eisen, supra, </em>479 F.2d at 1021-22. When a clearly erroneous panel decision as here is rendered in the context of \u2014 or is coupled with \u2014 a substantial question of unusual importance, then we believe the case is ripe for en banc reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-9\">There would appear to be few issues more vital and of more recurring importance in the administration of federal justice than the appropriate standard by which an appellate court reviews the grant or denial of permanent injunctive relief by a district court. Are we bound by the command of Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a) that \u201c[fjindings of fact shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous\u201d? Or are we free as appellate judges, without the slightest basis in the record for- doing so, to substitute our own injunctive provisions for those of the district court? With due respect to the panel majority, we believe that it is beyond dispute that here there was an unwarranted appellate interference with the discretion of the trial judge in fashioning relief based upon all of the facts after hearing all of the testimony and after judging the demeanor of all of the witnesses. It is on the basis of excessive and wholly unwarranted appellate intrusion into the traditional area of trial court operations that we believe this case cries out for en banc reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-10\">Such appellate intrusion here is particularly exacerbated by the fact that the district court\u2019s temporary restraining order of October 8, 1971, 353 F.Supp. at 200 n. 6, which was very similar to the decree refashioned by the panel majority on appeal, had already been deliberately violated by Galella. 353 F.Supp. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>237-38. It is undisputed that in the past he had jeopardized the lives and safety of Mrs. Onassis and her children and had done so in the teeth of previous restraining orders of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-4\">Moreover, we believe that it is important to note the internal inconsistency of the panel majority\u2019s condemnation of Galella\u2019s outrageous and dangerous conduct toward Mrs. Onassis and her children on the one hand, and its effectively stripping them of the protection of the district court injunction on the other, including the wholly incomprehensible elimination of any protection whatsoever for the children after they reach age 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-5\">In short, here, as we suggested a year ago in <em>Zahn, supra, </em>469 F.2d at 1042, \u201cThe record in this case strikes [us] as a particularly good one on which to resolve this important issue. The facts are not in dispute. The legal question is starkly presented. The issue to be resolved is both important and sure to recur.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-6\">We respectfully dissent from the denial of rehearing en banc.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-7\">HAYS, Circuit Judge, votes against en banc reconsideration but joins in neither opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
