GOODWIN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b546-13\">This appeal challenges the government\u2019s ownership of the fossil fuel deposits underlying the Outer Continental Shelf off the California coast.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-14\">Appellants sued the United States (Department of the Interior) and the four corporate appellees to quiet title, and demanded damages for trespass and conversion, for waste of private oil and gas resources, and for devaluation of mining locations.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-15\">Appellants base their claims upon their filing, in early 1968, of forty-one placer mining locations situated in Tract 402, Block 51, North, 65 West, as shown on the Official Outer Continental Shelf Leasing Map 68, of the Channel Islands Area. The district court dismissed the action, ruling that the complaint did not, either in its original or in its amended form, allege a valid claim to any interest in the subsoil or seabed of the Outer Continental Shelf of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-16\">The district court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-17\">1. The General Mining Laws never applied to submerged lands.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-18\">2. The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 (41 Stat. 437, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 193) superseded the General Mining Laws with respect to oil and gas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-19\">3. Since 1953, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 et seq.) has provided the sole method by which oil and gas resources are to be disposed of on the Outer Continental Shelf.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-20\">4. The United States of America (sued herein as the United States, Department of the Interior) is an indispensable party to the action, and has not consented to be sued herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-21\">5. The United States, Department of the Interior, is not a suable entity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-22\">Because we dispose of this case on the district court\u2019s third ground, we do not reach the other issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>Jurisdiction is founded on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(f).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Governmental consent to suit is based upon 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2409a(a) <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For the purposes of this case we will accept the appellants\u2019 theory that the twelve-year statute of limitation<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> did not start running until they filed their so-called locations in 1968. Therefore, we need not decide whether the appellants\u2019 attempt to dismiss the United States from the suit was successful,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or alternatively whether the United States would be an indispensable party.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Appellants allege that their placer mining locations were filed pursuant to the General Mining Laws. The General Mining Laws, enacted in 1872 and substantially unchanged to the present, provide, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-6\">\u201cExcept as otherwise provided, all valuable mineral deposits in lands belonging to the United States, both surveyed and unsurveyed, shall be free and open to exploration and purchase * * * \u201d 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 22.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">The Supreme Court has held that the \u201cexcept as otherwise provided\u201d clause is satisfied when there is another, more specific, statute which provides for the disposition of certain lands and the mineral deposits thereon. In Oklahoma v. Texas, 258 U.S. 574, 42 S.Ct. 406, 66 L. Ed. 771 (1921), the Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-13\">\u201c * * Only where the United States has indicated that the lands are held for disposal under the land laws does the section apply; and it never applies where the United States directs that the disposal be only under other laws.\u201d 258 U.S. at 600, 42 S.Ct. at 416.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-15\">It is obvious that the United States has \u201cotherwise provided\u201d in connection with the Outer Continental Shelf. In 1953, Congress enacted the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 et seq. That act, <em>inter alia, </em>asserted United States\u2019 ownership of and jurisdiction over minerals in and under the Outer Continental Shelf, extended the Constitution and laws of the United States to the shelf lands, and established an exclusive system of mineral leasing on the Outer Continental Shelf. The purpose of the Lands Act was to define a body of law applicable to the seabed of, subsoil of, and fixed structures on the Outer Continental Shelf. Rodrigue v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., 395 U.S. 352, 89 S.Ct. 1835, 23 L.Ed.2d 360 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-16\">The Lands Act specifically provided that \u201cmineral leases on the outer Continental Shelf shall be maintained or issued only under the provisions of this subchapter.\u201d 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333(a)(1). Section 1331(c) defines the term \u201cmineral lease\u201d as \u201cany form of authorization for the exploration for, or develop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>ment or removal of deposits of, oil, gas, or other minerals * * Furthermore, \u00a7 1337 established a detailed bidding procedure pursuant to which the Secretary of the interior may grant leases. In light of these clear expressions of a congressional intent to provide an exclusive procedure for acquiring mineral interests in the Outer Continental Shelf, we hold that appellants\u2019 claims based upon their purported placer mining locations filed under the General Mining Laws are invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b547-8\">. \u201cThe district courts shall have exclusive original jurisdiction of civil actions under section 2409a to quiet title to an estate or interest in real property in which an interest is claimed by the United States.\u201d 28 U. S.O. \u00a7 1346(f) (Supp.1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b547-9\">. \u201cThe United States may be named as a \u25a0party defendant in a civil action under this section to adjudicate a disputed title to real property in which the United States claims an interest, other than a security interest or water rights * * *,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2409a (a) (Supp.1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b547-10\">. \u201cAny civil action under this section shall be barred unless it is commenced within twelve years of the date upon which it accrued. Such action shall be deemed to have accrued on the date the plaintiff or his predecessor in interest knew or should have known of the claim of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2409a(f) (Supp.1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b547-18\">. Plaintiffs\u2019 original complaint was filed on February 2, 1971. By Stipulation dated March 15, 1971, plaintiffs were allowed to amend their complaint. On March 19, 1971, the United States moved to dismiss the cause of action and for summary judgment in response to the plaintiffs\u2019 original complaint. On March ' 24, 1971, the district court ordered plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint to be filed retroactively as of March 15, 1971. On March 30, 1971, plaintiffs filed notices of dismissal as to the United States, Department of Interior. Subsequently the United States and all other defendants filed motions to dismiss the cause of action with prejudice or for summary judgment in answer to the plaintiffs\u2019 first amended complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
