The factual circumstances requiring the remand order and the directions given to the district court for an evidentiary hearing appear in our prior opinion, United States v. Allison, etc., 5 Cir. 1973, 481 F.2d 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-22\">The trial judge has conducted an evi-dentiary hearing, the transcript thereof and the court\u2019s findings and conclusions have been certified to us. The parties were requested to but have declined to file briefs on the remand issue. In the hearing each juror and the alternate was interrogated out of the presence of the other jurors. Following the hearing the trial judge entered an order containing detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-23\">The procedures followed by the trial judge and the standards employed by him complied with our remand directions. We find no error in the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that there is no reasonable possibility that the presence of the alternate juror during the jury\u2019s deliberations affected the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-24\">The findings and conclusions of the district court on remand are affirmed. This requires that the convictions be, and they hereby are</p>\n<p id=\"b407-25\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
