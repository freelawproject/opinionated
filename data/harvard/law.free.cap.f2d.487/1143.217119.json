SKELLY WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1215-12\">These cases were consolidated and heard <em>en banc </em>to resolve an important question of first impression arising under the National Labor Relations Act: Does a union commit an unfair labor practice under Section 8(b)(1)(B), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(b)(1)(B) (1970), by disciplining supervisor-members for crossing a picket line and performing rank-and-file struck work during a lawful economic \u25a0strike against the company? The National Labor Relations Board answered the question in the affirmative and issued cease and desist and other orders against the unions involved.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>We reverse, deny enforcement of the Board\u2019s orders, and remand both cases to the Board with instructions to dismiss the complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-21\">Although the issue, as stated above, is a legal question of statutory construction, we think it helpful to have a full understanding of the factual context in which the issue arose in the two eases before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-22\">\n<em>Florida Power &amp; Light Co., No. 71-1712</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-23\">The Florida Power &amp; Light \u25a0 Company has, since 1953, maintained a collective bargaining agreement with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, AFL-CIO, through the union\u2019s System Council U-4 comprising the local unions involved in this case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There was no provision in the collective bargaining agreement requiring employees to become members of the union as a condition of employment, and union membership was accordingly voluntary. Section 14(a) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 164(a) (1970),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> provides that an employer shall not be compelled to deem supervisors as employees for the purpose of collective bargaining. In addition, Section 2(3) <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> exempts supervisors, as defined in Section 2(11),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> **from the defi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1148\">*1148</page-number>nition of \u201cemployee\u201d in the Act, thereby depriving supervisors of the protections of the Act and permitting an employer to refuse to hire union members as supervisors<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and to refuse to engage in collective bargaining with its supervisors.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Florida Power chose not to exercise its rights under these sections and recognized the union as the exclusive bargaining representative for many of its supervisory employees. They were considered part of the bargaining unit and their wages and conditions of employment were set out in the bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-4\">Other higher ranking supervisors were not represented by the union for collective bargaining purposes and did not have their wages and conditions of employment determined by the collective bargaining agreement. These included supervisors in the positions of District Supervisor, Assistant District Supervisor, Assistant Supervisor, Plant Superintendent, Plant Supervisor, Assistant Plant Superintendent, Distribution Assistant, Results Assistant, Assistant Plant Engineer, Substation Supervisor, and some miscellaneous supervisory classifications. The company, however, also permitted these higher ranking supervisors, many of whom had attained high <em>ranking </em>supervisory status after passing through the rank and file and through lower bargaining unit supervisory classifications, to maintain their union membership. It is with these high ranking supervisors who, though union members, were not represented by the union for collective bargaining purposes that the present case is concerned.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1216-15\">Although their wages and conditions of employment were not negotiated for them by the union, these supervisors nevertheless received substantial benefits from union membership. In particular, union membership in good standing gave them the right to participate in the System Council Death Benefit Fund<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and made them eligible for pension, disability, and death benefits under the terms of the International\u2019s constitution.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1216-16\">A small number of the supervisors involved in this case were union members who paid* no dues because they had obtained withdrawal cards from the union. Some had apparently obtained \u201chonorary\u201d withdrawal cards, under the terms of which the member did not actively participate in the union and did not pay monthly dues. The card constitutes a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1149\">*1149</page-number>valuable benefit, however, as it permits the holder, in the event he loses his supervisory position and returns to the rank and file, to return to active membership without paying the initiation fee normally required of new members, simply by returning the withdrawal card and resuming payment of dues. It was the practice of the System Council Death Benefit Fund to permit supervisors who had obtained honorary withdrawal cards to continue their participation in the Fund. Other supervisors had apparently obtained \u201cparticipating\u201d withdrawal cards. Under the International constitution, these members could not actively participate in the union, but continued to pay a monthly fee equal to normal monthly dues, and therefore continued to remain eligible for pension, death, and disability benefits.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1217-4\">All union members, including those on withdrawal cards,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> bore certain obligations under the union\u2019s constitution, which provides that \u201c[a]ny member may be penalized for committing any one or more\u201d of 23 listed offenses. The offenses most relevant to the present case are \u201c(10) Working in the interest of any organization or cause which is detrimental to, or opposed to, the I.B.E.W.\u201d and \u201c(21 Working for any individual or company declared in difficulty with a [local union] or the I.B.E.W., in accordance with this Constitution.\u201d In the collective bargaining agreement, however, the union made certain concessions with respect to union discipline of supervisor-members. The contract provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1217-5\">\u201c * * * it js further agreed that employees in [supervisory] classifications have definite management responsibilities and are the direct representatives of the Company at their level of work. Employees in these classifications and any others in a supervisory capacity are not to be jacked up or disciplined through Union machinery for the acts they may have performed as supervisors in the Company\u2019s interest. The Union and the Company do not expect or intend for Union members to interfere with the proper and legitimate performance of the Foreman\u2019s management responsibilities appropriate to their classification. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1217-12\">From October 22, 1969 through December 28, 1969, the union was engaged in an economic strike against the company, and the local unions maintained picket lines at nearly all of the company\u2019s operational facilities. Many supervisor-members crossed the picket lines and performed rank-and-file struck work \u2014 that is, work normally performed by nonsupervisory employees when no strike is in progress.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Whether they crossed the picket line at the request of the company or totally of their own volition is not revealed in the record. The union brought charges for violations of the uniones constitution, and those found guilty of crossing the picket line to perform rank-and-file struck work received fines of from $100 to $6,000. Most were also expelled from the union, thereby losing their right to continue participating in the System Council Death Benefit Fund. By expulsion they were also deprived of the membership in good standing which was a prerequisite for receiving pension, disability, or death benefits under the International constitution.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1150\">*1150</page-number>The Board found that in so disciplining supervisor-members the union violated Section 8(b)(1)(B) because the fines \u201cstruck at the loyalty an employer should be able to expect from its representatives for the adjustment of grievances and therefore restrained and coerced employers in their selection of such representatives.\u201d Int. Brhd of Electical Wkrs System Council U-4, 193 NLRB No. 7 (slip opinion at 6) (1971). Accordingly, the Board ordered the union to cease and desist, rescind all fines, expunge all records of disciplinary proceedings, restore union membership, restore eligibility in all benefit plans, and post appropriate notices.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-4\">\n<em>Illinois Bell Telephone Co., No. 71\u2014 1559</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-5\">The Illinois Bell Telephone Company and its predecessors have, since 1909, maintained a contractual relationship with Local 134, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, AFL-CIO. Illinois Bell, like Florida Power, chose not to exercise its right under Sections 2 (3), 2(11), and 14(a) of the Act to refuse to hire union members as supervisors. The union was recognized as the exclusive bargaining representative, not only for rank-and-file journeymen and apprentice employees, but also for employees within certain supervisory categories, including General Foreman, P. B.X. Installation Foreman, and Building Cable Foreman. These supervisors, as well as rank-and-file members of the bargaining unit, were required to become and remain members of Local 134 under the terms of a union security clause agreed to by the company in the collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-6\">As recently as 1959, the collective bargaining agreements had prescribed monthly wage rates applicable to these foremen. Contracts since then have not contained such wage provisions, but the bargaining agreement in effect at the time of the instant dispute included a section entitled \u201cWorking Conditions for General Foremen and Foremen,\u201d which concerned payment for overtime work and for certain absences. Other provisions of the agreement, for example that dealing with vacations, were found by the trial examiner to be applicable to foremen as well as to rank-and-file employees.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1218-8\">Other higher ranking supervisors were not part of the bargaining unit and were not represented by the union for collective bargaining purposes. None of their conditions of employment were determined by the bargaining agreement. These included employees in the positions of District Installation Superintendent, Plant Assignment Foreman, and Test Center Foreman. The company also permitted these higher ranking supervisors to maintain their union membership. In fact, in 1954, when the position of District Installation Superintendent was first created, the company and the union signed a Letter of Understanding, apparently still in force, providing that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1218-9\">\u201c[a]s District Installation Superintendents * * * their wages and conditions of employment will not be a matter of union-management negotiations but They [sic] will not be required to discontinue their membership in the union as it is recognized that they have accumulated a vested interest in pension and insurance benefits as a result of their membership in the union. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1218-11\">In contrast to <em>Florida Power, </em>we are here concerned with supervisors both in and out of the bargaining unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-12\">All supervisor-members received substantial benefits from union membership. Those in the bargaining unit benefited in having the union act as their representative for collective bargaining purposes, including the benefit of any contract provisions obtained on their behalf by the union. Those both in and out of the bargaining unit benefited from participation in the International\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1151\">*1151</page-number>pension benefit and death benefit plans and from participation in group life insurance and old age benefit plans sponsored by Local 134. As in <em>Florida Power, </em>some supervisor-members apparently were no longer active dues-paying members but had obtained withdrawal cards. But, as indicated earlier, those on withdrawal cards continued to benefit under certain of the benefit plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-4\">The same International union is involved in both cases, and union members of Illinois Bell bore the same obligations under the International\u2019s constitution as were described earlier. In contrast to the <em>Florida Power </em>case, however, there was no provision in the Illinois Bell collective bargaining agreement in which the union purported to make any concessions with respect to union discipline of supervisor-members. The only related provision is in the 1954 Letter of Understanding which, after recognizing that those serving as District Installation Superintendents will be permitted to continue union membership, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1219-5\">\u201cHowever, any allegiance they owe to the union shall not affect their judgment in the disposition of their supervisory duties. Since they will have under their supervision employees who are members of unions other than Local 134 and perhaps som.e with no union affiliations whatever, the company will expect the same impartial judgment that it demands from all Supervisory personnel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1219-6\">Between May 8, 1968 and September 20, 1968, Local 134 engaged in an economic strike against the company. At the inception of the strike, the company informed supervisory personnel that it would like to have them come to work during the work stoppage, but it told them the decision whether to work or to respect the strike was a matter left to the personal discretion of each individual. Indeed, the employer indicated that those who chose not to work would not be penalized. In contrast, Local 134 warned its supervisor-members, at a union meeting held immediately before the strike, that they would be subject to union discipline if they performed rank- and-file work during the strike. During the course of the strike, some of the supervisor-members crossed the union\u2019s picket line to perform rank-and-file struck work, while other supervisors honored the strike and stayed away from work. Local 134 carried out its pre-strike warning and brought disciplinary actions against a number of supervisors. Those who were found guilty of performing rank-and-file work during the strike were each fined $500. Unlike <em>Florida Power, </em>apparently no supervisors were expelled from the union or denied the right to continue participating in various union benefit plans. Local 134 has commenced suit in the Illinois courts to collect some of the fines, but insofar as any supervisors have paid any part of the fines the company has reimbursed them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-8\">The Board found that in so disciplining supervisor-members the union violated Section 8(b)(1)(B) because \u201cthe underlying dispute giving rise to the fines was between the Union and Illinois Bell rather than between the Union and its supervisor-members.\u201d Int. Brhd of Electrical Wkrs, 192 NLRB No. 17 (slip opinion at 7) (1971). The Board referred to its decision in a case consolidated with <em>Illinois Bell </em>for purposes of oral argument before the Board in which it had said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1219-9\">\u201c * * * The intent [of Section 8(b)(1)(B)] is to prevent the supervisor from being placed in a position where he must decide either to support his employer and thereby risk internal union discipline or support the union and thereby jeopardize his position with the employer. To place the supervisor in such a position casts doubt both upon his loyalty to his employer. and upon his effectiveness as the employer\u2019s collective-bargaining and grievance adjustment representative. The purpose of Section 8(b) (1)(B) is to assure to the employer that its selected collective-bargaining representatives will be completely faithful to its desires. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1152\">*1152</page-number>cannot be achieved if the union has an effective method, union disciplinary action, by which it can pressure such representatives to deviate from the interests of the employer. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AL3m\">Local Union No. 2150, Int. Brhd of Electrical Wkrs, 192 NLRB No. 16 (slip opinion at 7) (1971). Accordingly, the Board ordered the union to cease and desist, rescind all fines, expunge all records of disciplinary proceedings, and post appropriate notices.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-5\">Section 8(b)(1)(B) provides: \u201cIt shall be an unfair labor practice for a labor organization or its agents * * * to restrain or coerce * * * <em>an employer </em>in the selection of his representatives for the purposes of collective bargaining or the adjustment of grievances * * (Emphasis added.) The purpose of this provision is clear on its face. It is designed to prevent unions from restricting management\u2019s free choice of its agent to bargain with the union or adjust grievances. Under the Act, each party to the collective bargaining process has a right to choose its representative, and there is a correlative duty on the opposite party to negotiate with the appointed agent. <em>See </em>NLRB v. Int. Ladies Garment Wkrs Union, 3 Cir., 274 F.2d 376 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-8\">The legislative history of the section is fully consistent with this literal reading. The Senate Report says that the section</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1220-9\">\u201cproscribes unions and their agents from interfering with, restraining, or coercing employers in the selection of their representatives for the purposes of collective bargaining or the settlement of grievances. * * * [T]his subsection would not permit a union to dictate who shall represent an employer in the settlement of employee grievances, or to compel the removal of a personnel director or supervisor who has been delegated the function of settling grievances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1220-10\">1 Legislative History of the Labor Management Relations Act (hereinafter \u201cLegis.Hist.\u201d) 427 (1948). Senator Taft gave an appropriate example of the kind of activity the section was designed to proscribe:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1220-13\">\u201cThis unfair labor practice referred to is not perhaps of tremendous importance, but employees cannot say to their employer, \u2018We do not like Mr. X, we will not meet Mr. X. You have to send us Mr. Y.\u2019 That has been done. It would prevent their saying to the employer, \u2018You have to fire Foreman Jones. We do not like Foreman Jones, and therefore you have to fire him, or we will not go to work.\u2019 * * <em>*\u00bb</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1220-14\">2 Legis.Hist. 1012. Senator Ellender echoed the same concerns:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1220-15\">\u201c * * * [Qjuite a few unions forced employers to change foremen. They have been taking it upon themselves to say that management should not appoint any representative who is too strict with the membership of the union. This amendment seeks to prescribe a remedy in order to prevent such interferences.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1220-17\">Another concern expressed in the legislative history involves unions forcing management to bargain through a mul-ti-employer association.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1220-18\">\u201c \u2022&gt;:\u25a0 * * [A] union or its responsible agents could not, without violating the law, coerce an employer into joining or resigning from an employer association which negotiates labor contracts on behalf of its members * -\u00bb <em>*\u00bb</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1220-20\">1 Legis.Hist. 427.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1220-21\">\u201c * * * Under this provision it would be impossible for a union to say to a company; \u2018We will not bargain with you unless you appoint your national employers\u2019 association as your agent so that we can bargain nationally.\u2019 Under the bill the employer has a right to say, \u2018No, I will not join in national bargaining. Here is my representative, and this is the man you have to deal with.\u2019 * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1220-23\">2 Legis.Hist. 1012 (remarks of Senator Taft).</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1153\">*1153</page-number>For over 20 years since its enactment in 1947, Section 8(b)(1)(B) interpretations by the Board faithfully followed its literal language and this legislative history. The cases decided by the Board involved attempts either to force employers into or out of multi-employer associations, <em>see, e. g., </em>United Slate, Tile, etc. Wkrs. Assn, Local 36 (Roofing Contractors Assn of Southern California), 172 NLRB No. 249 (1968); Orange Belt District Council of Painters No. 48 (Painting &amp; Decorating Contractors of America, Inc.), 152 NLRB 1136 (1965), or to force dismissal of an employer bargaining representative or grievance adjuster considered objectionable because of his tough, anti-union attitude, <em>see, e. g., </em>Local 986, Teamsters Union (Tak-Trak, Inc.), 145 NLRB 1511 (1964); Los Angeles Cloak Joint Board, ILGWU (Helen Rose Co.), 127 NLRB 1543 (1960). <em>See also </em>NLRB v. Local 294, Int. Brhd of Teamsters, 2 Cir., 284 F.2d 893 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-4\">That the present cases lie outside this original understanding of Section 8(b) (1)(B) seems obvious. There was no claim or showing in either case that the purpose of disciplining the supervisors was to get management to replace them. There is no indication that replacement of the fined supervisors was even a likely result of the union discipline. Indeed, just the opposite seems the case. In <em>Illinois Bell, </em>at the inception of the strike management expressly told all supervisors that no reprisals would be taken against those observing the picket line, and after the strike management promoted many of those who chose not to cross the picket line to perform rank-and-file work. Nor is there any indication in <em>Florida Power </em>that the company replaced any striking supervisors. The only purpose and likely effect of the imposition of union discipline was to force the supervisors to observe the picket line to the extent of not performing struck work for the employer. If anyone was restrained or coerced, it was the supervisors, not their employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-6\">Since 1968, however, the Board has embarked upon a new approach in applying Section 8(b)(1)(B), expanding its scope far beyond the situations encompassed in this original understanding. The process began with the Board\u2019s decision in San Francisco-Oakland Mailers\u2019 Union No. 18, 172 NLRB No. 252 (1968). In <em>Oakland Mailers, </em>management charged the union with attempting to discipline a foreman for the manner in' which he interpreted the collective bargaining contract in making work assignments for the employees under his supervision. Although there was no allegation that the union was attempting to coerce the employer into hiring a new representative for collective bargaining and adjustment of grievances, the Board nonetheless found a Section 8(b)(1)(B) violation. The union\u2019s actions, according to the Board, \u201cwere designed to change the [company\u2019s] representatives from persons representing the viewpoint of management to persons responsive or subservient to [the union\u2019s] will.\u201d Slip opinion at 2. This was the sort of pressure which Section 8(b)(1)(B) was designed to prevent. \u201cThat [the union] may have sought the substitution of attitudes rather than persons, and may have exerted its pressure upon the [company] by indirect rather than direct means, cannot alter the ultimate fact that pressure was exerted here for the purpose of interfering with the [company\u2019s] control over its representatives. Realistically, the [company] would have to replace its foremen or face <em>de facto </em>nonrepresentation by them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-7\"> Although the <em>Oakland Mailers </em>doctrine unquestionably expanded Section 8(b)(1)(B) to cover situations not envisioned by the section\u2019s enactors, we have recognized and continue to recognize that its basic rationale is consistent with the purposes of Section 8(b)(1) (B). <em>See </em>Dallas Mailers Union, Local No. 143 v. NLRB, 144 U.S.App.D.C. 254, 445 F.2d 730 (1971). Where a supervis- or is disciplined for the manner in which he performed his collective bargaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1154\">*1154</page-number>and grievance adjustment functions, the union\u2019s purpose in imposing such discipline and the discipline\u2019s likely effect is to change the manner in which the supervisor performs those functions in the future. Discipline therefore achieves by indirect means what Section 8(b)(1)(B) clearly was intended to prevent. It permits the union to get a supervisor who is not \u201ctoo strict with the membership of the union,\u201d <em>see </em>page 1152 <em>supra,, </em>not by changing the identity of the supervis- or, but by changing the attitude the supervisor brings to his grievance adjustment and collective bargaining tasks. Although Section 8(b)(1)(B) speaks literally in terms of coercing the \u201cselection\u201d of employer representatives, it is clear that management\u2019s right to a free selection would be hollow indeed if the union could dictate the manner in which the selected representative performed his collective bargaining and grievance adjustment duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-4\">In several cases decided after <em>Oakland Mailers, </em>the Board continued to apply Section 8(b)(1)(B) to union attempts to discipline supervisors for the manner in which they performed their collective bargaining or grievance adjustment functions. In some of these cases fines had been imposed \u201cfor the manner in which the [foreman] had interpreted and administered\u201d the collective bargaining agreement, Toledo Locals Nos. 15-P &amp; 272. Lithographers &amp; Photoengravers Int. Union (Toledo Blade Co.), 175 NLRB 1072 (1969), enforced, 6 Cir., 437 F.2d 55 (1971), or where the union had \u201csought, [by an internal union procedure], to enforce its viewpoint as to the meaning of the contract,\u201d Sheet Metal Wkrs Int. Assn, Local Union 49 (General Metal Products, Inc.), 178 NLRB 139, 142 (1969), enforced, 10 Cir., 430 F.2d 1348, 1350 (1970). <em>See also </em>Houston Typographical Union No. 87, 182 NLRB 592 (1970) ;<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Freight, Constr., Gen.

NLRB, <em>supra, </em>enforcing 181 NLRB 286 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-13\">A common theme emerges from these cases which at once defines the scope of the <em>Oakland Mailers </em>doctrine and relates that doctrine to the core concerns of Section 8(b)(1)(B). In each, \u201c[t]he relationship between the Union and its members * * * [was] used as a convenient and, it would seem, powerful tool * * * to compel the Employer\u2019s foremen to take pro-union positions in interpreting the collective bargaining agreement.\u201d San Francisco-Oakland Mailers\u2019 Union No. 18, <em>supra, </em>172 NLRB No. 252 (slip opinion at 4).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1223-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1155\">*1155</page-number>The cases before us, however, are critically different from those decided under <em>Oakland Mailers </em>and lie outside the rationale of that ease and its progeny. In both cases here the union has disciplined supervisors, not for the way they interpreted the collective bargaining agreement, not for being too strict with union members, but simply for crossing a picket line to perform rank-and-file struck work. There is no underlying dispute relating to contract interpretation or grievance settlement in these cases, but rather an economic clash between union and employer totally unrelated to the manner in which supervisors perform their collective bargaining or grievance settlement functions. As the trial examiner in <em>Illinois Bell </em>pointed out, the previous cases are all</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1223-4\">\u201creadily distinguishable here where the action for which the supervisors were fined bore no direct relation to their work as supervisors or to any interpretation of the contract. As an original proposition I would be inclined to construe Section 8(b)(1)(B) as interdicting union fines of supervisors only when the conduct for which the supervisor was fined bore some relation to his role as a representative of management in \u2018collective bargaining or the adjustment of grievances,\u2019 to quote Section 8(b)(1)(B). In the instant case the question confronting the supervisors whether to work or to respect the strike call of their Union was in no way related to those subjects. Moreover, the Company itself had made it clear that it was not demanding that it's supervisors work during the strike. On the contrary, the Company expressly left the decision up to each individual supervisor, with specific assurances that no reprisal would be visited on those who chose not to work. After the strike the Company promoted some of the supervisors who had not worked during the strike. I \u2022therefore find some difficulty in concluding that the Company was restrained or coerced by the Union\u2019s action in fining the supervisors who worked, or even in finding that the Union\u2019s action had any natural or inherent tendency to restrain or coerce the Company. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1223-11\">192 NLRB No. 17 (trial examiner\u2019s decision at 9). And as Member Fanning pointed out in dissent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1223-12\">\u201cHere the supervisors were not fined because they gave directions to the work force, interpreted the collective-bargaining agreement, adjusted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1156\">*1156</page-number>grievances, or performed any other function generally related to supervisory activities, in a manner in disfavor with the Respondent Union. They were fined because they performed production work in the bargaining unit during a strike. Their Employer sought to use them, not in the direction of the work of employees who had not gone on strike or of replacements for strikers, but to replace the strikers themselves. In short, he assigned them to work as employees within the meaning of Section 2(3) of the Act, not as supervisors within the meaning of Section 2(11) of the Act. \u2022X- -X- -X- \u00bb</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1224-5\">192 NLRB No. 17 (slip opinion at 13).</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-6\">The Board insists, however, that the present cases fall within the <em>Oakland Mailers </em>rationale. Its position is couched in vague but superficially appealing language. It is said that these fines \u201cimpinged on the loyalty\u201d which the employer should be able to expect from his supervisors, <em>id. </em>at 6, that if they were found to be lawful they would permit the union \u201cto drive a wedge between a supervisor and the Employer,\u201d Local Union No. 2150, Int. Brhd of Electrical Wkrs, <em>supra, </em>192 NLRB No. 16 (slip opinion at 6), and that as a result an employer \u201ccould no longer count on the complete and undivided loyalty of those it had selected to act as its collective-bargaining agents or to act for it in adjusting grievances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6-7. If we try to rephrase the Board\u2019s language in terms consistent with the rationale of <em>Oakland Mailers, </em>the Board\u2019s position seems to come down to the following propositions. By being forced to take sides with the union during any confrontation between union and employer, even one unrelated to performance of his collective bargaining or grievance adjustment functions, a supervisor becomes, or is likely to become, more loyal to the union and less loyal to the company. He is then likely to bring this shift in loyalties to his grievance adjustment or collective bargaining tasks in the future, thus achieving in the end precisely that which Section 8(b)(1)(B) and the <em>Oakland Mailers </em>doctrine were intended to prevent. In our view, the Board overestimates the risk that discipline for performing rank-and-file struck work will significantly affect performance of grievance adjustment and collective bargaining functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-8\">Discipline, or the threat thereof, may well force a supervisor to observe a picket line, but it is questionable whether it will turn him into a believer in the union\u2019s cause. The Illinois Bell Company apparently recognized as much when it promoted many of those supervisors who, under threat of union discipline, refused to cross the picket line to perform rank-and-file struck work. Our everyday experience tells us that the result of discipline is normally some degree of hostility toward the person or group imposing the discipline, and this commonsense analysis appears confirmed by the record in the cases before us. The result of threatened union discipline was to turn the supervisors against the union, not to ingratiate them into the union fold. This is even clearer when we look at expulsion as a disciplinary measure. Those who are expelled are obviously going to be more loyal to the company and less loyal to the union in the future. One who has resigned or been expelled from union membership owes no further obligations to the union. <em>See </em>NLRB v. Granite State Joint Board, Textile Wkrs Union of America, Local 1029, 409 U.S. 213, 93 S.Ct. 385, 34 L.Ed.2d 422 (1972). Therefore, not only is there no reason to conclude that those supervisors of Florida Power who were expelled from the union will be more lenient with the union when they are called upon to interpret the contract, adjust grievances, or engage in collective bargaining in the future. Just the opposite is likely to be the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-9\">More importantly, let us concede for the moment that in some manner, perhaps through the camaraderie of the picket line, a supervisor who is forced under threat of discipline to observe a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1157\">*1157</page-number>picket line undergoes a subtle change in attitude and comes to feel closer ties to the union. It still does not follow that this change in attitude will affect his performance of his collective bargaining or grievance adjustment functions. When a supervisor acts as such he is a representative of management, and as such he should be immune from union discipline. The unions participating in the present cases conceded as much at oral argument when they agreed that when a supervisor crosses a picket line to perform <em>supervisory </em>work he remains immune from discipline. But when- a supervisor foresakes his supervisory role to do rank-and-file work ordinarily 'the domain of nonsupervisory employees, he is no longer acting as a management representative and no longer merits any immunity from discipline. The dividing line between supervisory and nonsuper-visory work in the present context is sharply defined and easily understood. There is accordingly no reason to believe that by being forced to take sides with the union in a dispute unrelated to the performance of his supervisory functions, and to take sides only to the extent of withholding his labor from rank-and-file nonsupervisory work, a supervisor will suffer- from a change in attitude when, after the strike, he returns to the performance of his normal supervisory duties. Despite the Board\u2019s protestations to the contrary, he is not put in the difficult position of serving the union and the employer at the same time. As the Board has noted in an analogous situation where supervisory and rank-and-file functions were \u201csharply demarcated,\u201d the supervisors \u201cwill not be \u2018serving two masters at the same time.\u2019 They will be serving them at different times.\u201d <em>See </em>Great Western Sugar Co., 137 NLRB 551, 553-554 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-4\">The foregoing analysis should serve to dispel any support the Board might have hoped to obtain from our recent decision in Meat Cutters Union Local 81 v. NLRB, 147 U.S.App.D.C. 375, 458 F.2d 794 (1972). In its decision in this ease, Meat Cutters Union Local 81, 185 NLRB No. 130 (1970), the Board found a Section 8(b)(1)(B) violation when a union attempted to discipline a supervisory employee for obeying a company order to institute a new meat procurement policy which would have resulted in a loss of union jobs. <em>Meat Cutters </em>differed from <em>Oakland Mailers </em>in that no one claimed that the new procurement policy had anything to do with the supervisor\u2019s grievance settlement or collective bargaining functions. It was thus unclear how the Board could claim that any substitution of attitudes or shift in loyalties in violation of Section 8(b)(1)(B) as to these functions had occurred, particularly in view of its recent explicit rejection of a <em>per se </em>ban on all union discipline of supervisory employees. <em>See </em>Local Union 453 Brhd of Painters, etc. (Syd Gough &amp; Sons, Inc.), 183 NLRB No. 24 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-6\">When <em>Meat Cutters </em>was appealed to this court we were clearly concerned that the Board\u2019s Section 8(b)(1)(B) decisions might be deteriorating into a flat prohibition against any union discipline of supervisors. Our objections to such a prohibition are explained in greater detail in Part III of this opinion, but suffice it for now to state that such an approach inequitably gives supervisory personnel all the benefits of union membership without having to bear any of the responsibilities. In its brief in <em>Meat Cutters, </em>however, the Board sought to meet these fears and dispel them. \u201c[I]t is only when the representative\u2019s obligations to the union conflict with his management responsibilities that his union obligations are compelled to yield,\u201d the Board argued. \u201cThus, in each case, including the instant ease, where the Board has found a Section 8(b)(1)(B) violation based on union discipline of a management representative, the conduct which prompted disciplinary action consisted of the representative\u2019s efforts to discharge his management reponsibilities. * * * In fact, the Board has recently dismissed a Section 8(b)(1)(B) complaint on the ground that the infraction of union rules for which the employer representative was disciplined did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1158\">*1158</page-number>not involve the exercise of supervisory or managerial authority.\u201d NLRB brief at 15 in Meat Cutters Union Local 81 v. NLRB, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1226-4\">Partially on the basis of these representations we enforced the Board\u2019s decision, but with the explicit caveat that \u201c[t]he rule here applied by the Board only affects union discipline which is imposed upon a member, who has responsibilities as a representative of his employer in administering the collective bargaining agreement or the adjustment of employee grievances, because he has performed duties as a management representative. * * * The N.L.R.B. has made it clear that a union may legally discipline a supervisor-member for acts which are <em>not </em>performed by the individual in furtherance of his obligations as the employer\u2019s representative.\u201d Meat Cutters Union Local 81 v. NLRB, <em>supra, 147 </em>U.S.App.D.C. at 379-380 n.12, 458 F.2d at 798-799 n.12 (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-6\">Perhaps it is unfair to suggest that . the Board is dissembling in seeking to draw some support for its present position from <em>Meat Cutters, </em>but certainly it is clear that the Board is changing its interpretation of the law to suit the case. <em>Meat Cutters </em>was an expansion of the <em>Oakland Mailers </em>doctrine, but it nevertheless was and remains directly tied to the principles <em>Oakland Mailers </em>properly implied from Section 8(b)(1)(B). The discipline of the supervisor in <em>Meat Cutters </em>was not totally unrelated to the performance of grievance settlement functions since by fining the supervisor the union was avoiding and undereuttirig a clause in the contract that provided that all matters pertaining to the proper application of the agreement shall be handled by certain grievance-arbitration procedures spelled out in the agreement. <em>See 147 </em>U.S.App.D.C. at 378 n. 6, 458 F.2d at 797 n.6. More importantly, the underlying dispute was one of contract interpretation since the union\u2019s basic position was that the new meat procurement policy which the supervisor was fined for enforcing violated the collective bargaining agreement. <em>See </em>147 U.S.App.D.C. at 378, 458 F.2d at 797. Discipline was used, in effect, as a tool to enforce the union\u2019s interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement. <em>See </em>pages 1154, 1155 <em>supra. </em>In the present cases, by contrast, no question of grievance settlement or contract interpretation is either directly or indirectly involved. The underlying dispute is not one of contract interpretation but simply a lawful economic strike against the company to get a better contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-8\">The Board, in a final attempt to bring this case within the holding of <em>Meat Cutters, </em>argues that crossing the picket line to perform rank-and-file work is part of a supervisor\u2019s management function. The Board claims that management \u201cconsidered its supervisors among those it could depend on\u201d during a strike, and that the employer \u201chad a right to expect the supervisor\u201d to cross the picket line and perform rank-and-file struck work. Local Union No. 2150, Int. Brhd of Electrical Wkrs, <em>supra, </em>192 NLRB No. 16 (slip opinion at 6). But saying that rank-and-file labor is part of a management function is tantamount to saying that black is white. Whatever the parameters of <em>Meat Cutters\u2019 </em>\u201cmanagement function\u201d test may be, the term \u201cmanagement function\u201d has no meaning except in contrast to the concept of rank-and-file work. And the Board\u2019s reference to management\u2019s \u201cright\u201d to expect supervisors to perform rank-and-file work is nothing but a facade by which the Board hopes to avoid analysis by assuming the answer to the question before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-9\">Try as one might, then, there is simply no way to derive the Board\u2019s decision in these cases from the literal language of Section 8(b)(1)(B), from the legislative history, or from the gloss that has been added to that section by <em>Oakland Mailers </em>and subsequent eases. The Board\u2019s decision in these eases, in the words of the learned trial examiner in <em>Illinois Bell, </em>\u201cstretch[es] the statute beyond what I would otherwise consider the breaking point.\u201d Int. Brhd of Elec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1159\">*1159</page-number>trical Wkrs, 192 NLRB No. 17 (trial examiner\u2019s decision at 11) (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-4\">In the final analysis, the Board\u2019s position in these eases does not rest on the language of Section 8(b)(1)(B), <em>Oakland Mailers, </em>or <em>Meat Cutters, </em>but rather on a policy which the Board for the first time now finds imbedded in Section 8(b)(1)(B) \u2014 that supervisors who are permitted by their employer to join unions owe their undivided loyalty to their employer in any dispute between the union and the employer. That the Board has just discovered this policy some 20-odd years after enactment of Section 8(b)(1)(B) makes us naturally suspicious that any such policy exists, especially since it appears that union discipline of supervisors is a long-standing problem that labor and management have attempted to resolve in a collective bargaining context for many years.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The Board apparently derives this interpretation of the statute in large part from Sections 2(3) and 14(a) of the Act which, as noted earlier, deprive supervisors of the protections of the Act and give employers the right to refuse to hire union members as supervisors. The Board\u2019s analysis starts off correctly enough when it states that in enacting these sections Congress recognized that an employer should be able to keep his supervisors out of unions in order to ensure their undivided loyalty. But the Board is mistaken in leaping to the conclusion that this same objective should be furthered by interpreting Section 8(b)(1)(B) to preclude all union discipline of supervisor-members when the employer has permitted his supervisors to maintain union membership. We draw precisely the opposite conclusion from the interrelationship between Sections 2(3) and 14(a), on the one hand, and Section 8(b)(1)(B) on the other. When Congress recognized that an employer should be able to have supervisors who owe him their undivided loyalty, it gave the employer a specific means to achieve such loyalty \u2014 the right to refuse to hire union members as supervisors, or in other words, the right to require employees to relinquish union membership upon promotion to a supervisory position. Congress never intended the inequitable result of permitting supervisors to have it both ways \u2014 joining unions with the consent of their employer and obtaining all the advantages of union membership without assuming the basic obligations normally incident to such membership.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-6\">The policy questions raised in an analysis of the statutes are relevant not only in this context, but also in order to apply the principles set down in a line of Supreme Court cases concerning union discipline of members. Since, in our view, those eases control the ones before us, we now turn to consider the Supreme Court precedents and return in Part III to a discussion of the interrelationship between Section 8(b)(1)(B) and the exclusion of supervisors from the protections of the Act in Sections 2(3) and 14(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-8\">The Board\u2019s rough sailing through the complexities of Section 8(b)(1)(B) might, perhaps, be more understandable if the seas were entirely uncharted. But in fact union discipline of members who cross picket lines to do struck work has been the subject of a series of important Supreme Court decisions. The Board has considered these decisions in its past applications of Section 8(b)(1)(B), but inexplicably chose to ignore them in its decision in the present cases. The Supreme Court\u2019s decisions, unlike the Board\u2019s approach, set out a rational, workable interpretation of Section 8(b)(1) which balances a union\u2019s right to enforce reasonable discipline against the rights of employers and union members to be free from union overreaching.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-9\">The first and most important of these decisions is NLRB v. Allis-Chalmers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number>Manufacturing Co., 388 U.S. 175, 87 S.Ct. 2001, 18 L.Ed.2d 1123 (1967). In all relevant respects, <em>Allis-Chalmers </em>is indistinguishable from these cases. There, as here, the union sought to impose reasonable fines on union members who had crossed a picket line during a lawful strike. In <em>Allis-Chalmers, </em>however, none of the fined members were supervisors, so the relevant provision governing the union\u2019s conduct was subsection (A) of Section 8(b)(1) rather than subsection (B). However, when the Supreme Court found the union innocent of any unfair labor practice, it did so not because of anything peculiar to subsection (A), but rather because of its interpretation of the words \u201crestrain or coerce\u201d which are common to subsections (A) and (B). <em>See </em>Christensen, Union Discipline Under Federal Law: Institutional Dilemmas in an Industrial Democracy, 43 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 227, 268 (1968). Thus the Court stated: \u201cIt is highly unrealistic to regard \u00a7 8(b)(1), <em>and particularly its words \u2018restrain or coerce,\u2019 </em>as precisely and unambiguously covering the union conduct involved in this case.\u201d 388 U.S. at 179, 87 S.Ct. at 2006. (Emphasis added.) On the contrary, such a reading of Section 8(b)(1) would \u201cattribute to Congress an intent at war with the understanding of the union-membership relation which has been at the heart of its effort \u2018to fashion a coherent labor policy\u2019 and which has been a predicate underlying action by this Court and the state courts. More importantly, it is to say that Congress limited unions in the powers necessary to the discharge of their role as exclusive statutory bargaining agents by impairing the usefulness of labor\u2019s cherished strike weapon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 183, 87 S.Ct. at 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-4\">Of course, <em>Allis-Chalmers </em>did not mean that unions were free to impose discipline for any purpose at all. Section 8(b)(1) must be read so as to conform with the other provisions of federal labor law. <em>See, e.g., </em>NLRB v. Int. Ladies Garment Wkrs Union, <em>supra, </em>274 F.2d 376; Silard, Labor Board Regulation of Union Discipline After Allis-Chalmers, Marine Workers and Scofield, 38 Geo.Wash.L.Rev. 187, 193-196 (1969). Thus if a union rule \u201cinvades or frustrates an overriding policy of the labor laws the rule may not be enforced, even by fine or expulsion, without violating \u00a7 8(b)(1).\u201d Scofield v. NLRB, 394 U.S. 423, 429, 89 S.Ct. 1154, 1158, 22 L.Ed.2d 385 (1969). <em>See </em>NLRB v. Industrial Union of Marine &amp; Shipbuilding Wkrs, 391 U.S. 418, 88 S.Ct. 1717, 20 L.Ed.2d 706 (1968). But if one thing is clear after <em>Allis-Chalmers, </em>it is that there is no \u201coverriding policy of the labor laws\u201d which prohibits reasonable union fines levied against members who cross a lawful picket line to perform rank-and-file struck work. In fact, quite the contrary is true.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1228-6\">\u201cIntegral to [the] federal labor policy has been the power in the chosen union to protect against erosion its status under that policy through reasonable discipline of members who violate rules and regulations governing membership. That power is particularly vital when the members engage in strikes. The economic strike against the employer is the ultimate weapon in labor\u2019s arsenal for achieving agreement upon its terms, and \u2018[t]he power to fine or expel strikebreakers is essential if the union is to be an effective bargaining agent. \u00bb * * <em>#\u00bb</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1228-7\">NLRB v.

However, that proviso is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1161\">*1161</page-number>limited to Section 8(b)(1)(A) of the Act only and is not a part of Section 8(b)(1)(B). * * *\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1229-4\">San Francisco-Oakland Mailers\u2019 Union No. 18, <em>supra, 172 </em>NLRB No. 252 (slip opinion at 3-4). It is quite clear, however, that the Board has misread the <em>Allis-Chalmers </em>decision. The Court expressly stated in its opinion that it was unnecessary to decide whether the proviso protected the union discipline there under scrutiny. <em>See </em>NLRB v. Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Co., <em>supra, </em>388 U.S. at 192 n. 29, 87 S.Ct. 2001. And as Mr. Justice Black pointed out in dissent: \u201c[T]he Court correctly assumes that the proviso to \u00a7 8(b)(1)(A) cannot be read to authorize its holding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 200, 87 S.Ct. at 2017. Indeed, our own court just recently characterized the holding in <em>Allis-Chalmers </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1229-6\">\u201c * * * Instead of relying on the express language of the <em>proviso, </em>\u2022\u00bb * * Supreme Court carefully analyzed the entire legislative history of Section 8(b)(1)(A), and it concluded that Congress did not intend to prohibit such internal union discipline by the prohibition against \u2018restraint\u2019 or \u2018coercion.\u2019 * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1229-9\">Booster Lodge No. 405, Int. Assn of Machinists, etc. v. NLRB, 148 U.S.App.D.C. 119, 125, 459 F.2d 1143, 1149 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-10\">That the proviso is appended to Section 8(b)(1)(A) rather than to both that section and Section 8(b)(1)(B) is without significance in these cases. As we saw earlier, under the original congressional understanding Section 8(b) (1)(B) did not affect union discipline of supervisors, but only concerned direct attempts to restrain or coerce employers. So understood, it was unnecessary to repeat the proviso in Section 8(b)(1)(B). Now that <em>Oakland Mailers </em>has expanded Section 8(b)(1)(B) to encompass indirect coercion of employers through discipline of supervisors, the proviso gains significance for both subsections of . Section 8(b)(1), for as the Supreme Court noted in <em>Allis-Chalmers, </em>the proviso was only part of \u201cthe repeated refrain throughout the debates on \u00a7 8(b)(1)(A) <em>and other sections </em>that Congress did not propose any limitations with respect to the internal affairs of unions * * 388 U.S. at 195, 87 S.Ct. at 2014. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-13\">Apparently having sensed that its proviso distinction will not withstand analysis, the Board now puts forth a new argument. <em>Allis-Chalmers, </em>according to the Board, dealt only with internal union rules affecting the relationship between a member and the labor organization to which he belongs. Here, however, the Board claims, the union discipline does not concern legitimate internal union affairs, but affects primarily the employer who is external to the union-member relationship.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1229-14\">The Board\u2019s internal-external distinction, however, simply cannot be squared with the holding in <em>Allis-Chalmers. </em>Of course, the discipline in <em>Allis-Chalmers </em>had, and was intended to have, an external effect on the employer. By deterring strikebreakers the rule assured union solidarity and thereby allowed the union to bring greater economic pressure on the company. The discipline has precisely the same \u201cexternal\u201d effect in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1162\">*1162</page-number>the present cases. If the anti-strikebreaking activity there can be characterized as \u201cinternal\u201d it simply makes no sense to label the same sort of anti-strikebreaking rule in these cases as \u201cexternal.\u201d The Board recognized as much in its <em>Oakland Mailers </em>decision: \u201c'[0]nly legitimate internal union affairs are protected under <em>Allis-Chalmers. </em>The <em>Allis-Chalmers </em>case involved a union\u2019s fining of its members for crossing picket lines. The primary relationship there affected was the one between the union and its members, and the union\u2019s particular objective \u2014 solidarity in strike action \u2014 was deemed by the Supreme Court a legitimate area for union concern in the circumstances involved.\u201d San Francisco-Oakland Mailers\u2019 Union No. 18, <em>supra, </em>172 NLRB No. 252 (slip opinion at 4).

Union discipline is internal when it is enforced through fines or expulsion from the union. It becomes \u201cexternal,\u201d and a violation of Section 8(b)(1)(A) as well as other sections of the Act, when the union seeks to have the employer fire or take other measures against the recalcitrant union member.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The Supreme Court made this clear in its decision in Scofield v. NLRB, <em>supra, </em>its next major Section 8(b)(1) case after <em>Allis-Chalmers. </em>Describing its analysis in <em>Allis-Chalmers, </em>the <em>Scofield </em>Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1230-5\"><em>\u201c * </em>* -x- The Court thus essentially accepted the position of the National Labor Relations Board dating from Minneapolis Star &amp; Tribune Co., 109 N.L.R.B. 727 (1954) where the Board also distinguished internal from external enforcement in holding that a union could fine a member for his failure to take part in picketing during a strike but that the same rule could not be enforced by causing the employer to exclude him from the work force or by affecting his seniority * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aok-dedup-0\">394 U.S. at 428, 89 S.Ct. at 1157.

Wkrs (Wisconsin Motor Corp.), 145 NLRB 1097, 1104 (1964), affirmed, sub nom. Scofield v. NLRB, <em>supra. </em>The internal-external distinction thus has nothing to do with who is affected by the union discipline. As the Court recognized in <em>Scofield, </em>union discipline normally affects all three participants in the union-management relation: employer, employee, and union. Scofield v. NLRB, <em>supra, </em>394 U.S. at 431, 89 S.Ct. 1154. But it does not follow from this that enforcement of the rule violates the Act \u201cunless some impairment of a statutory labor policy can be shown.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 432, 89 S.Ct. at 1159.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-10\">The Board\u2019s last attempt to distinguish <em>Allis-Chalmers </em>relates to the matter of statutory labor policy. Subsequent to <em>Allis-Chalmers, </em>the Court made it clear that even internal enforcement of union rules violates Section 8(b)(1)(A) if such enforcement \u201cinvades or frustrates an overriding policy of the labor laws,\u201d Scofield v. NLRB, <em>supra, </em>394 U.S. at 429, 89 S.Ct. at 1158, or if it contravenes \u201cother considerations of public policy * * NLRB v. Industrial Union of Marine &amp; Shipbuilding Wkrs., <em>supra, </em>391 U.S. at 424, 88 S.Ct. 1717. The Board argues, as we indicated at the close of Part I of this opinion, that the legislative history of Sections 2(3) and 14(a) of the Act indicates an overriding congressional policy in favor of supervisors who are completely subservient to their employer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>will. As indicated earlier, we disagree with the Board\u2019s analysis of the interrelationship between Section 8(b)(1)(B) on the one hand and Sections 2(3) and 14(a) on the other, and it is to this issue that we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-5\">Although it is only since 1968 that the Board has sought to use Section 8(b)(1)(B) as a solution to conflict of loyalties problems arising from union discipline of supervisor-members, these problems are not of recent vintage.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Prior to passage of the National Labor Relations Act in 1935, it was quite common for foremen in many industries to become unionized in the same bargaining unit as their subordinates. \u25a0 <em>See </em>Jones v. Laughlin Steel Corp., 66 NLRB 386, 400 (1946). Conflict of loyalties problems were common, and employers were concerned \u201clest foremen should be subject to union discipline for differing with the local union in the interpretation of the terms of a contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 401 n.27, <em>quoting </em>H. Millis (ed.), How Collective Bargaining Works 67 (1942). Such problems as arose were apparently worked out through collective bargaining. Unions recognized the legitimate concerns of employers in having contracts fairly administered by foremen, and means were provided for resolving disputes. \u201cThe unions [did] not, however, forego their right to discipline foremen for disobeying laws relating to internal union matters, or for deliberately disregarding union rules.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1231-6\">The problem of supervisor-member conflict of loyalties first came before the Board under the 1935 Act in the form of the question whether foremen and other supervisors were \u201cemployees\u201d under the statute, that is, whether management was required to engage in collective bargaining with foremen. The Board first held that foremen were \u201cemployees\u201d and entitled to the protections of the Act, <em>see </em>Union Collieries Coal Co., 41 NLRB 961 (1942), but abruptly shifted course a year later in Maryland Drydock Co., 49 NLRB 733 (1943). The Board justified its shift on fears that conflicts of loyalties would arise if foremen belonged to the same union as the men under their supervision.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1231-8\">\u201cThe very nature of a foreman\u2019s duties make him an instrumentality of management in dealing with labor. The duty of supervision with which he is principally charged implies a delegation of authority with respect to the selection, promotion, and discharge of the workers in his section. * * * To hold that the National Labor Relations Act contemplated the representation of supervisory employees by the same organizations which might represent the subordinates would be to view the statute as repudiating the historic prohibition of the common law against fiduciaries serving conflicting interests.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1231-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 740. (Footnote omitted.) The Board, however, soon shifted positions again, holding that foremen were entitled to mandatory collective bargaining under the Act if they formed unions independent of those representing the rank and file. <em>See </em>Packard Motor Car Co., 61 NLRB 4 (1945), enforced, 6 Cir., 157 F.2d 80 (1946), affirmed, 330 U.S. 485, 67 S.Ct. 789, 91 L.Ed. 1040 (1947). And the next year, in Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp., <em>supra, </em>the Board held that supervisors were entitled to the protections of the Act even if they were represented by the same union that represented the rank and file.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-11\">The Board\u2019s opinion in Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp. is helpful in understanding the significance of the 1947 amendments to Sections 2(3) and 14(a) of the Act. To begin with, the Board recognized the conflict of loyalties problems arising from having supervisors belong to the same union that represents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>the rank and file. The Board noted the \u201cserious and genuine concern about the effect of this decision upon the relations of management with its foremen, and the effect of the unionization of the latter upon their loyalty to the employer\u2019s interests.\u201d 66 NLRB at 402. But the Board concluded that \u201csatisfactory solutions\u201d to these problems \u201ccan be worked out by men of good will on both sides in the give-and-take of collective bargaining.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 401. \u201c[T]he union and the employer, neither of which is lacking in ingenuity, should not be discouraged by this Board from working out, at the bargaining table, contract clauses which will deal with this difficult situation. Such clauses can guarantee the maintenance of discipline by supervisors without fear of reprisal by the rank-and-file * * <em>Id. </em>at 402-403.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-4\">The question whether foremen and other supervisory employees were entitled as a class to the rights of self-organization, collective bargaining, and other concerted activities assured to employees by the 1935 National Labor Relations Act came before the Supreme Court in Packard Motor Car Co. v. NLRB, 330 U.S. 485, 67 S.Ct. 789, 91 L.Ed. 1040 (1947). The Court had before it the arguments \u201cthat unionization of foremen is from many points bad industrial policy, that it puts the union foreman in the position of serving two masters, divides his loyalty and makes generally for bad relations between management and labor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 493, 67 S.Ct. at 794. But the Court found policy to be irrelevant to its decision, and felt compelled to define the statutory term \u201cemployee\u201d literally, thereby concluding that foremen and other supervisors were entitled to the Act\u2019s protections.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-5\">Congress picked up the Court\u2019s cue when it enacted the 1947 amendments to the Act. As a matter of policy, the Congress felt that employers should not be forced into having unionized supervisors.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1232-6\">\u201cThe evidence before the committee shows clearly that unionizing supervisors under the Labor Act is inconsistent with * * * our policy to protect the rights of employers; they, as well as workers, are entitled to loyal representatives in the plants, but when the foremen unionize, even in a union that claims to be 'independent\u2019 of the union of the rank and file, they are subject to influence and control by the rank and file union, and, instead of their bossing the rank and file, the rank and file bosses them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1232-10\">1 Legis.Hist. 305. The legislative history of Sections 14(a) and 2(3) clearly indicates that the purpose of these provisions was to reverse the result of the <em>Packard </em>case so that no employer would be required under the Act to bargain collectively with his foremen or to hire foremen who were union members.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1232-11\">\u201cWhat the bill does is to say * * * [t]hat no one, whether employer or employee, need have as his agent one who is obligated to those on the other side, or one whom, for <em>any </em>reason, he does not trust.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1232-13\">I Legis.Hist. 308. (Emphasis in original.) <em>See also </em>Int. Ladies Garment Wkrs Union v. NLRB, 2 Cir., 339 F.2d 116, 122 (1964). In the words of the Senate Report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1232-14\">\u201cIt merely relieves employers who are subject to the national act free from any compulsion by this National Board or any local agency to accord to the front line of management the anomalous status of employees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1232-15\">1 Legis.Hist. 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-16\">While Section 14(a) provides that \u201cno employer subject to this subchapter shall be compelled to deem individuals defined herein as supervisors as employees for the purpose of any law, either national or local, relating to collective bargaining,\u201d it also expressly provides that \u201c[njothing herein shall prohibit any individual employed as a supervisor from becoming or remaining a member of a labor organization * * The purpose of this provision is also clear from the legislative history.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1233-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number>\u201cThe bill does not forbid anyone to organize. It does not forbid any employer to recognize a union of foremen.

In other words, the bill does not prevent anyone from organizing nor does it prohibit any employer from recognizing a union of foremen. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1233-8\">1 Legis.Hist. 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-9\">The legislative history of Section 14(a) is important in two respects. First, it is clear the the supervisory exclusion was enacted precisely because Congress assumed that when supervisors became union members they were \u201cobligated to those on the other side\u201d and were \u201csubject to the influence and control of the rank and file union.\u201d And Congress solved the conflict of loyalties problem by giving management the right to make the would-be supervisor choose between union loyalty and rank- and-file status on the one hand and management loyalty and supervisory status on the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-10\">Second, by expressly providing that foremen could unionize, and by indicating that employers who so desired could continue to bargain collectively with supervisors, Congress effectively gave employers an option. Those who wished to do so could continue to hire union member\u2019s as supervisors and could continue to engage in collective bargaining with supervisors, resolving whatever conflict of loyalties problems arose through the traditional give-and-take of collective bargaining approved in Jones &amp; Laugh-lin Steel Corp., <em>supra, </em>to arrive at contract clauses dealing with the problem. <em>See </em>pages 1163, 1164 <em>supra. </em>On the other hand, those employers who wanted to settle the conflict of loyalties problem once and for all would be within their rights in refusing to hire union members as supervisors and refusing to engage in collective bargaining with supervisors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-12\">This option approach to an employer\u2019s rights under Section 14(a) has received the tacit approval of the courts. For example, a union commits no unfair or unlawful act in proposing that supervisors be covered by the collective bargaining agreement, Sakrete of Northern California, Inc. v. NLRB, 9 Cir., 332 F.2d 902, 908 (1964), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 961, 85 S.Ct. 649, 13 L.Ed.2d 556 (1965), but a union does commit an unfair labor practice in trying to coerce an employer into agreeing to hire only union members as foremen. <em>See </em>Int. Typographical Union Local 38 v. NLRB, 1 Cir., 278 F.2d 6 (1960), affirmed by equally divided Court, 365 U.S. 705, 707, 81 S.Ct. 855, 6 L.Ed.2d 36 (1961). An employer is within his rights in refusing to engage in collective bargaining over supervisors, <em>cf. </em>Safeway Stores, Inc. v. Retail Clerks Int. Assn, 41 Cal.2d 567, 261 P.2d 721 (1953), and supervisors are routinely excluded from a certified bargaining unit at the employer\u2019s request. <em>See, e. g., </em>Federal Compress &amp; Warehouse Co. v. NLRB, 6 Cir., 398 F.2d 631 (1968); NLRB v. Corral Sportswear Co., 10 Cir., 383 F.2d 961 (1967). On the other hand, courts have approved contracts in which management agreed to hire only union members as foremen and where the conflict of loyalties problem was resolved by clauses in the collective bargaining agreement limiting the union\u2019s right to discipline supervisor-members. <em>See, e. g., </em>NLRB v. News Syndicate Co., 2 Cir., 279 F.2d 323 (1960), affirmed, 365 U.S. 695, 81 S.Ct. 849, 6 L.Ed.2d 29 (1961). <em>Cf. </em>Evening Star Newspaper Co. v. Columbia Typographical Union No. 101, D.D.C., 141 F.Supp. 374 (1955), affirmed, 98 U.S.App.D.C. 206, 233 F.2d 697 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-13\">In applying this option approach, it has always been assumed, consistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>with the legislative history, <em>see </em>pages 1164, 1165 <em>supra, </em>that once an employer permits his supervisors to join unions or agrees to engage in collective bargaining with unionized supervisors, he no longer can claim their undivided loyalty in every employer-union dispute except to the extent that the collective bargaining agreement ensures such loyalty. <em>See, e. g., </em>NLRB v. News Syndicate Co., <em>supra, </em>279 F.2d at 330:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1234-4\">\u201c * -x- * The foremen, under the contract at least, were not subject to the conflicting obligations of two masters. <em>Regardless of the Union obligations to which, without more, a foreman would be subject by reason of his Union membership, </em>* * * the contract specifically provides that: \u2018The Union shall not discipline the foreman for carrying out the instructions of the publisher or his representative in accordance with this agreement.\u2019 * * * By these provisions the parties clearly indicated that the foremen are <em>solely </em>[this emphasis in original] the employers\u2019 agents and that they are under an obligation to act in accordance with the agreement, <em>in spite of Union ties and obligations which otherwise might control. </em>-x- * -x-\u00bb</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1234-8\">(Emphasis added; footnote omitted.) <em>See also </em>NLRB v. News Syndicate Co., 365 U.S. 695, 701, 81 S.Ct. 849, 6 L.Ed.2d 29 (1961); Int. Typographical Union Local 38 v. NLRB, <em>supra, </em>278 F.2d at 12. <em>Cf. </em>Local Union No. 1055 v.

Assn., <em>supra.</em><footnotemark><em>24</em></footnotemark><em> </em>And, until now, it seemed that the Board shared this assumption. To justify its holding that certain supervisors could actively participate in union affairs, the Board recognized that supervisor-members \u201cowe allegiance at least as much to the Union as to their employers. They are agents of both.\u201d Nassau and Suffolk Contractors\u2019 Assn, Inc., 118 NLRB 174, 182 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-13\">Thus, while now purporting to interpret Section 8(b)(1)(B) so as to enforce the underlying policy of Section 14(a) in favor of management\u2019s right to loyal supervisors, the Board in fact acts contrary to the very assumption engendering enactment of Section 14(a), namely, that when a supervisor joins a union he is under certain obligations to the union which conflict with his loyalty to his employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-14\">Throughout the lengthy discussion of supervisor-union member conflict of loyalties in' the legislative history of the 1947 amendments, there is not a single indication that Section 8(b)(1)(B) was in any way related to the comprehensive solution to the conflict of loyalties problem found in Sections 2(3) and 14(a).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Section 8(b)(1)(B) was in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1167\">*1167</page-number>tended to deal with a problem separate and distinct from the problem of supervisor-union member conflict of loyalties, as is evident from the different scopes of the Section 2(3) supervisor exclusion and Section 8(b)(1)(B). The supervisor exclusion in Section 2(3), defined in Section 2(11), applies not only to individuals having authority to \u201cadjust [employee] grievances,\u201d but also to any individual \u201chaving authority, in the interest of the employer, to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline other employees * * The scope of Section 8(b)(1)(B), in contrast, is much narrower, and concerns only those individuals who represent the employer \u201cfor the purposes of collective bargaining or the adjustment of grievances.\u201d Since the scope of Section 8(b)(1)(B) is narrower than that of the supervisor exclusion in Section 2(3), the Board\u2019s approach achieves the anomalous result of having certain supervisor-members\u2014 those coming within the definitions of both Sections 2(3) and 8(b)(l.)(B) \u2014 immune from all union discipline where there is a dispute between the union arid the employer, while other supervisor-members \u2014 those coming within the definition of Section 2(3) but falling outside the definition of Section 8(b)(1)(B) \u2014 remain subject to union discipline. Such a dichotomy is awkward on its face, and makes no sense if one accepts the Board\u2019s assumption that under Section 14(a) a supervisor owes his undivided loyalty to his employer not only where his employer exercises his right to refuse to hire union members as supervisors, but also where the employer permits supervisors to join unions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-8\">Not only is there no indication of any legislative purpose to make Section 8(b)(1)(B) an integral part of the solution to supervisor-union member conflict of loyalties problems, but the result achieved by the Board\u2019s interpretation of Section 8(b)(1)(B) is clearly inconsistent with the concept of union membership as understood by Congress. The \u201c \u2018contractual conception of the relation between a member and his union widely prevails in this country . . . \u2019\u201d NLRB v. Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Co., <em>supra, </em>388 U.S. at 182, 87 S.Ct. at 2008, <em>quoting </em>Int. Assn of Machinists v.

Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Co., <em>supra, </em>388 U.S. at 181-182 n.8, 87 S.Ct. at 2007, <em>quoting </em>Summers, Disciplinary Powers of Unions, 3 Ind. &amp; Lab.Rel.Rev. 483, 495 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-5\">In addition, the Board\u2019s interpretation of Section 8(b)(1)(B) reaches a result inconsistent with ordinary standards of equity and fairness. In <em>Illinois Bell, </em>for example, the employer recognized the union as the exclusive bargaining agent for some of its supervisory personnel. These supervisors directly benefit from union membership, not just from the fringe benefits available to all union members, but from the contract which the union negotiates with management. True, the present contract does not determine their wages, but these employees do benefit from other contract provisions such as that establishing vacation rights. These supervisors might benefit from a successful strike, for example, if the purpose or result of the strike was to obtain longer vacations or to improve some other condition of employment applicable to all members of the bargaining unit, supervisory or rank and file. Can it fairly be said that Congress intended that supervisor-members can perform rank-and-file struck work, undercutting a strike from which they serve to benefit, and remain immune from union discipline while all other members of the bargaining unit remain bound by the majority decision of the union to go out on strike ?</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-9\">The inequity in the Board\u2019s approach to Section 8(b)(1)(B) may well have been tacitly conceded by both the Board and the employer in <em>Florida Power </em>when, by stipulation, it was agreed that no unfair labor practice charge would be based on union discipline of those supervisors who were members of the bargaining unit and who had their wages and conditions of employment determined by the collective bargaining agreement. <em>See </em>note 8 <em>supra. </em>Were the Board to have applied Section 8(b)(1)(B) to union discipline of these supervisor-members, the Board would have prevented the union from disciplining strikebreaking supervisors whose very wages were the subject of the ongoing strike. We note, however, that nothing in the Board\u2019s approach would limit Section 8(b)(1)(B) so that it would not apply to union discipline of these supervisors. The Board\u2019s position is that a union cannot fine supervisor-members for \u201cfurthering the interests of the Employer in a dispute not between the Union and the supervisor-union members but between the Employer and the Union.\u201d Local Union No. 2150, Int. Brhd of Electrical Wkrs, <em>supra, </em>192 NLRB No. 16 (slip opinion at 6). Under such an approach it is irrelevant whether or not the supervisors are members of the collective bargaining unit and whether or not their wages and conditions of employment are negotiated for them by the union. That the Board places no significance on the fact that supervisors are members of the collective bargaining unit represented exclusively by the union is demonstrated in <em>Illinois Bell </em>where the Board based its finding of a Section 8(b)(1)(B) viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1169\">*1169</page-number>tion on discipline of supervisor-members both outside and within the collective bargaining unit. <em>See </em>pages 1150, 1151 <em>swpra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1237-4\">Those supervisor-union members who feel that the union is not adequately representing their interests, or who feel that they do not wish to be bound to support the union in its economic disputes with management, are free at any time to resign from union membership. As the Supreme Court recently made clear, once they do so, and once they voluntarily agree to relinquish the benefits of union membership, they are no longer subject to union discipline. <em>See </em>NLRB v. Granite State Joint Board, <em>supra; id. </em>at 218, 93 S.Ct. 385, 34 L.Ed.2d 422 (Mr. Chief Justice Burger, concurring) <footnotemark>27</footnotemark> But it is unreasonable for supervisors to expect to be able to enjoy either the fringe or the direct benefits of union membership without bearing the obligation of supporting the union in its economic disputes with the employer.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> <em>See </em>NLRB v. San Francisco Typographical Union No. 21, 9 Cir., 486 F.2d 1347, 1350 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-5\">The lack of equity and fairness in the Board\u2019s approach is also evident when we look at the situation from the employer\u2019s perspective. Section 14(a) gives the employer a means to obtain the undivided loyalty of his supervisors. If the employer, however, chooses not to exercise his rights under that section, permits his supervisors to join unions and agrees to engage in collective bargaining with the union over supervisors, the employer cannot still insist on the supervisors\u2019 undivided loyalty in every union-employer dispute, no matter how unrelated the subject of that dispute is to the supervisory function. The employer, of course, benefits from having supervisors continue membership in unions. He can follow the commendable practice of elevating supervisors from the rank and file, without having to compensate these supervisors for any loss in pension or death benefit rights they would incur were the employer to exercise his Section 14(a) rights and force them to resign from union membership upon achieving supervisory status.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Management cannot have its cake and eat it too. As Professor Gould has pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1237-9\">\u00ab* * * [Supervisors who remain union members are most often obtaining additional benefits. Frequently, they have remained members in order to retain possession of withdrawal cards which will make it less expensive for them to re-enter the trade or another plant under union jurisdiction. Under the <em>Allis-Chalmers </em>rationale, this would seem to indicate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1170\">*1170</page-number>a pledge of allegiance by the supervisor and therefore should be deemed consent by such an individual to render himself liable to financial obligations where the union\u2019s interest is direct and where the conduct engaged in is somewhat distant from basic supervisory functions. If the employer is unduly harmed by such a rule, it seems to me that its obligation is to make the supervisory position financially attractive enough for the supervisor to forego the benefits of union membership and to resign.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1238-4\">Gould, Some Limitations Upon Union Discipline Under the National Labor Relations Act: The Radiations of Allis-Chalmers, 1970 Duke L.J. 1067, 1129.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-5\">This is not to say, of course, that by permitting his supervisors to join unions the employer completely waives his right to their loyalty. Even if he permits them to join unions, Section 8(b)(1)(B), as interpreted by <em>Oakland Mailers </em>and <em>Meat Cutters, </em>immunizes them from union discipline imposed for the manner in which they perform their supervisory functions. In addition, the employer is free to seek further immunity from discipline through the collective bargaining process. For example, if the employer shares the Board\u2019s fear that when supervisors are forced not to perform rank- and-file struck work they become biased against the employer in the later performance of their supervisory functions, the employer may condition his permission for supervisors to remain union members upon the union\u2019s agreeing to a bargaining contract clause that immunizes supervisors from union discipline for performing rank-and-file struck work. As we have already seen, such an agreement by which the employer permits supervisors to join unions upon condition that the union give up part of its control over the supervisors is a mode of dealing with the problem of supervisor conflicts of loyalty that, in contrast to the Board\u2019s approach, has a firm basis in history both before and after passage of the 1947 amendments. Not only is it historically sound, but it comports with the Act\u2019s pervasive focus on collective bargaining as the means for resolving labor-management conflicts. <em>See </em>Fibreboard Paper Products Corp. v. NLRB, 379 U.S. 203, 85 S.Ct. 398, 13 L.Ed.2d 233 (1964); NLRB v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U.S. 1, 45, 57 S.Ct. 615, 81 L.Ed. 893 (1937). Where the employer has bargained for immunity from union discipline for his supervisors, such a clause may be enforced through the normal grievance adjustment procedure or arbitration machinery established in the contract to resolve alleged contract violations.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> But where the employer has agreed to union membership for his supervisors without obtaining in return some concession from the union with respect to the immunity of supervisors from discipline, interpreting Section 8(b)(1)(B) so as to make the supervisor subject to an undivided loyalty to his employer in all union-employer disputes permits the employer to abrogate its part of the bargain. We can \u201cdiscern no basis in the statutory policy encouraging collective bargaining for giving the employer a better bargain than he has been able to strike at the bargaining table.\u201d Sco-field v. NLRB, <em>supra, </em>394 U.S. at 443, 89 S.Ct. at 1159, 22 L.Ed.2d 385.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-8\"> To be sure, the Labor Board is entitled to great deference when it interprets the act it administers. <em>See, e. g., </em>Brooks v.

In the final analysis, \u201cadministrative experience is of weight in judicial review only to this point \u2014 it is a persuasive reason for deference to the [Board] in the ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1171\">*1171</page-number>ercise of its discretionary powers under and within the law. It cannot be invoked to support action outside of the law. And what action is, and what is not, within the law must be determined by courts, when authorized to review, no matter how much deference is due to the agency\u2019s fact finding.

My separate word is not in derogation of that opinion but is added, first, to note that the same result obtains even if there should be disagreement with some aspects of the court\u2019s opinion, and second because I think the soundness of our result is underscored by thinking of this case in a large context of Congressional policy on upward mobility of labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-17\">Congress did not accept the view that supervisors, such as foremen, are necessarily and for all purposes to be identified as completely integrated in management. Foremen are officers of management, but of a special kind; like non-commissioned sergeants, they bear a special relationship to the employee troops, one that promotes two-way communication and working relationships, and is of unique value to the entire enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-18\">There would be no problem if Congress had accepted a clear-cut view of foremen, as wholly integrated with management. This they could have done, by excluding foremen from employees\u2019 unions, or removing them from any union discipline, a course that was counseled in the name of good sense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But as in so many other aspects of labor-management legislation, Congress was more interested in an accommodation of tensions than the tidiness of abrupt solutions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1172\">*1172</page-number>One thing Congress did do was to give a complete option to any employer who placed paramount value on complete and unquestioned loyalty in the foreman. That employer has the absolute and unqualified right to insist that no foreman or supervisor be a member of an employee\u2019s union. \u00a7 14(a), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 164(a) (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-4\">Such an employer attitude, however, involves costs to the employer who appreciates the benefits to the enterprise from the upward mobility of labor. Not a few enlightened managements are on the lookout for talent in the ranks, able to infuse, management levels with the special awareness, aptitudes and attitudes of production experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-5\">Mobility of union labor is restricted if departure from the union means surrender of existing or prospective economic benefits. Such surrender requirements are not a rarity in the various benefit and insurance plans sponsored by labor unions. Congress might conceivably have required that such plans be revised so as to \u201cvest\u201d economic benefits on reasonable terms. But it has not yet even required vesting in the more glaring case of employer pension plans, which often remove pension rights on transfers to other employers, thus limiting mobility of labor.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1240-6\">The option given by Congress is an accommodation to employers, enabling them to permit their supervisors to stay on as members of an employers\u2019 union, without surrender of the economic benefits available to members of the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-14\">The foremen who are permitted by th\u00e9ir employers to maintain membership in the ranks of both union and management will have dual ties, and there is the prospect of clash and tension. That tension may not be entirely felicitous so far as management is concerned, but when elected by the employer it reflects a trade-off, making it preferable to available alternatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-15\">The employer is protected by the statute against the coercion implicit in certain union exercise of control over members. The clear language of the statute protects supervisors against discipline as union members, and means the control of the union must give way, when there is a question of union control over the choice of a supervisor,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or interference with the performance of the supervisor in \u201cadjusting grievances.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1240-16\">Whether or to what extent this approach may be extended to limit union control over members in other respects, it cannot be extended to the cases before us, which lie at the opposite end of the spectrum. A union member who performs rank-and-file struck work executes an act which is inherently destructive of the existence of the union. In contemplating that supervisors might continue as members of the union, Congress did not contemplate that the unions would have to surrender the elemental right of self-preservation, and to continue the good standing of agents of its own destruction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1241-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1173\">*1173</page-number>This case does not involve a management instruction to a foreman to perform managerial or supervisory work. Indeed Illinois Bell did not issue any instruction relative to the supervisors to work during the strike. If the management wishes to take the position that even rank-and-file work is the duty of a supervisor during a strike, then that is such an incursion on a union\u2019s elemental right of self-preservation as to require management to prohibit the supervisor from remaining with the union. A management insisting on absolute loyalty, to such an extent, must bear the potential expense of the economic rights supervisors will surrender by withdrawing from the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-4\">I do not take <em>Meat Cutters, supra </em>note 1, to be in conflict with this view. That case involved the implementation by a manager of a Safeway store of a company directive to teminate the grinding and slicing of certain meats at the retail stores, and to henceforth fill market needs by .ordering meat in prepared form from a warehouse. While the implementation of this management decision had the effect of eliminating some work for the Union Local 81,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> it was not inherently destructive of the Union. Without reconsidering the broad sweep of the doctrines of \u201cindirect\u201d interference and management loyalty voiced in <em>Meat Cutters, </em>they must be taken in the light of the factual problem then before the court, and cannot soundly be extended so as to prohibit union discipline of supervisors who perform rank-and-file struck work.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-5\">The limits on the protection for management loyalty are clearly posed by these cases, and reflect, I believe, an underlying congressional policy on the question of upward mobility in the labor market. Congress permits the employer to permit a rank-and-file worker to upgrade his employment situation by becoming a supervisor without surrendering certain rights as a member of an employees union. When, however, the transition is complete, and the supervisor is to side with management over the very existence of the union, the supervisor and management must make a choice and assume the consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-11\">MacKINNON, Circuit Judge, with whom TAMM, ROBB and WILKEY, Circuit Judges, join, dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-12\">The majority expresses its approval of the Board\u2019s interpretation of section 8(b)(1)(B)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as set out in <em>Oakland Mailers </em>and its progeny. In <em>Oakland Mailers </em>the Board held illegal union actions which \u201cwere designed to change the (employer\u2019s) representatives from persons representing the viewpoint of management to persons responsive or subservient to (the union\u2019s) will.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In reaching the conclusion that the union\u2019s imposition of discipline on supervisors because of the manner in which they interpreted and applied the collective bargaining agreement violated section 8(b)(1) (B), the Labor Board noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1241-13\">In enacting Section 8(b)(1)(B) Congress sought to prevent the very evil involved herein. \u2014 union interference with an employer\u2019s control over its own representatives. <em>That [the un</em>ion] <em>may have sought the substitution of attitudes rather than persons, and may have exerted its pressure upon the </em>[employer] <em>by. indirect rather than direct means, cannot alter the ultimate fact that pressure was exerted here for the purpose of interfering </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1174\">*1174</page-number><em>with the </em>[employer\u2019s] <em>control over its representatives. Realistically, the Employer would have to replace its foremen or face de facto nonrepresen-tation by them.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em>-</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1242-4\">Thus, there is unanimous agreement on this court that section 8(b)(1)(B) prohibits union discipline of supervisory personnel for acts performed by them in the course of their supervisory or managerial duties. However, there is considerable disagreement as to whether a supervisor\u2019s performance of rank-and-file work during a strike at the direction of his employer constitutes part of his supervisory or managerial duties protected by section 8(b)(1)(B). Basically the majority\u2019s position is that the Board has stretched section 8(b)(1)(B) to the breaking point, in light of the legislative history of that section and sections 2(3)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 14(a),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the <em>Allis-Chalmers </em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark> case, when it has sought to prohibit the union discipline of these supervisors. I find many defects in the majority\u2019s analysis, and shall deal with the pertinent statutes and legislative history first, and take up the <em>Allis-Chalmers </em>case lastly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-6\">Underlying much of the majority\u2019s criticism of the Board\u2019s decision is the belief that a strike is \u201ctotally unrelated\u201d to the collective bargaining process. Thus, the majority argues that even if the union's discipline here has the effect of making a supervisor pro-union during the strike, it \u201cdoes not follow that this change in attitude will affect his performance of his collective bargaining or grievance adjustment functions.\u201d This is because, it is argued, when a supervisor performs rank-and-file work during a strike at the direction of his employer \u201che is no longer acting as a management representative.\u201d Whereas, when a supervisor performs his normal supervisory work, engages in collective bargaining, or adjustment of grievances, he is clearly acting as a management representative. Since, in the majority\u2019s view, performing struck work during a strike at the request of management is \u201cunrelated\u201d to the performance of his supervisory function, a supervisor will never be forced into the situation of having to serve two masters, as the Board found would be the case \u2014 for he \u201cwill be serving them at different times.\u201d .</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-11\">The majority\u2019s reasoning ignores the realities of the collective bargaining process. A strike is <em>not </em>\u201ctotally unrelated\u201d to the supervisor\u2019s performance of collective bargaining functions. As the Board argued before this court, \u201cthe outcome of an economic strike . determines the substance of an agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1175\">*1175</page-number>ment between the disputing parties and is thus a far more fundamental dispute, and one with more at stake, than a quarrel over the interpretation of a portion of a previously negotiated agreement or over its application to a given situation or individual.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is well recognized that \u201cthe use of economic pressure by the parties to a labor dispute is not a grudging exception to some policy of completely academic discussion enjoined by the Act; <em>it is part and parcel of the process of collective bargaining.\u201d </em>N. L. R. B. v. Insurance Agents International Union, 361 U.S. 477, 495, 80 S.Ct. 419, 430, 4 L.Ed.2d 454 (1960) (emphasis added). It is readily apparent, therefore, that when supervisors\u2019 actions during an economic strike further the interests of their employer, they are performing in a manner which could reasonably be expected from such persons. <em>See </em>Local Union No. 2150, I. B. E. W., 192 NLRB No. 16 (1971). <em>See also, </em>Texas Co. v. N. L. R. B., 198 F.2d 540 (9th Cir. 1952). As management representatives, supervisory personnel may be requested by management to enhance the bargaining position of their employer during a dispute between it and the particular union involved.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Yet this is the precise activity for which the supervisors in question were disciplined by these unions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-4\">Not only has the majority taken an unrealistic look at the role of a strike in the collective bargaining process, it completely disregards the Labor Board\u2019s assessment of what will be the realistic consequences of union discipline of supervisors during confrontations between the. union and the employer. In both these cases the Board relied on its analysis of the same issue in <em>Local Union No. 2150, I. B. E. W., </em>decided the same day as <em>Illinois Bell Telephone, </em>wherein the Board found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1243-9\">[t]he Union\u2019s fining of the supervisors who were acting in the Employer\u2019s interest in performing the struck work severely jeopardized the relationship between the Employer and its supervisors. Thus, <em>the fines, </em>if found to be lawful, <em>would now permit the Union to drive a wedge between a supervisor and the Employer, thus interfering with the performance of the duties the Employer has a right to expect the supervisor to perform. </em>The Employer could no longer count on the complete and undivided loyalty of those it has selected to act as its collective bargaining agents or to act for it in adjusting grievances. Moreover, such fines clearly interfere with the employer\u2019s control over its representatives.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1243-10\">The Labor Board has drawn an inference from the evidence before it, concluding that the unions\u2019 discipline of these supervisors will interfere with the performance of their supervisory duties. Such inferences are not to be disturbed by a reviewing court merely because in its own opinion it disagrees with the rightness of the Board\u2019s judgment. Radio Officers\u2019 Union v. N. L. R. B., 347 U.S. 17, 74 S.Ct. 323, 98 L.Ed. 455, 48-50 (1954); Universal Camera Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 340 U.S. 474, 488, 490, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951); N. L. R. B. v. Nevada Consolidated Copper Corp., 316 U.S. 105, 62 S.Ct. 960, 86 L.Ed. 1305 (1942). Rather, as with other findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1176\">*1176</page-number>of fact, the proper test is whether the inference is supported by substantial evidence in the record. And under this standard, I see no reason to disagree with the Board\u2019s assessment of the effect of the union discipline upon the supervisor-employer relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-4\">Further, the majority embraces a rule which makes the <em>type </em>of work a supervisor performs during a strike the determinative factor in section 8(b)(1)(B) cases involving the legality of union discipline. This distinction makes no sense from the standpoint of the Congressional purpose underlying sections 8(b)(1)(B), 2(3), and 14(a). The Board\u2019s present interpretation of section 8(b)(1)(B) was set out in <em>Local Union No. 2150 I. B. E. W., </em>wherein it quoted from <em>Toledo Blade:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1244-5\">The Board\u2019s decision in the <em>San Francisco Mailers </em>case, underscores the import of Section 8(b)(1) (B) as a general prohibition' of a union\u2019s disciplining supervisor-members for their conduct in the course of representing the interests of their employers. As the Board held, such discipline by a union, even though the employer may have consented to the compulsory union membership of the supervisor under a union-security clause, is an unwarranted \u201cinterference with [the] employer\u2019s control over its own representatives,\u201d and deprives the employer of the undivided loyalty of the supervisor to which it is entitled.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1244-6\">When a union disciplines a supervisor for crossing a picket line to perform rank-and-file work at the request of his employer, that discipline <em>equally </em>interferes with the employer\u2019s control over his representative and <em>equally </em>deprives him of the undivided loyalty of that supervisor as in the case where the discipline was imposed because of the way the supervisor interpreted the collective bargaining agreement or performed his \u201cnormal\u201d supervisory duties. Thus, if the Board's construction of section \u20228(b)(1)(B) can be sustained, the majority\u2019s distinction of the type of work the supervisor performs during the strike would be without justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-12\">The Board\u2019s construction of 8(b)(1) (B), as prohibiting union discipline of supervisors for furthering the interests of their employer during disputes between the union and the employer, rests upon the legislative history of that section, and sections 2(3) and 14(a). The Supreme Court has recognized the fact \u201cthat labor legislation is peculiarly the product of legislative compromise of strongly held views, Local 1976, Carpenters\u2019 Union v. Labor Board, 357 U.S. 93, 99-100, 78 S.Ct. 1011, 1016-1017, 2 L.Ed.2d 1186, and that legislative history may not be disregarded merely because it is arguable that a provision may unambiguously embrace [or not embrace] conduct called in question. National Woodwork Mfrs. Assn. v. N. L. R.

Section 2(3) evidences its <em>intent to make the obligations to the employer paramount. </em>That provision excepts foremen from the protection of the Act. Its purpose was to give the employer a free hand to discharge foremen as a means of <em>ensuring their undivided loyalty, in spite of any union obligations. </em>See H.Rep.No.245, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 14-17 (1947); S.Rep.No.105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 3-5 (1947); L.

However, it has completely misinterpreted the legislative solution to that problem which Congress enacted in sections 2(3) and 14(a). There is just no support in the language of those sections or in the legislative history for the majority\u2019s interpretation that \u201cCongress effectively gave employers an <em>option\u201d </em>to prohibit unionization thereby ensuring undivided loyalty, or to permit unionization and thereby accept divided loyalty from their supervisors. What Congress <em>did </em>do in sections 2(3) and 14(a) was to solve the conflict of loyalties problem once and for all by taking supervisors completely out of the operation of the Act. Congress provided that there was nothing intended to prevent unionization of supervisors, even in rank-and-file unions, but even if unionized supervisors were to enjoy no protection from the Act. Congress \"did not give employers the means to <em>opt </em>for the undivided loyalty of their supervisors \u2014 it guaranteed it itself by enacting sections 2(3) and 14(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-14\">By the terms of sections 2(3), supervisors, as defined in section 2(11),<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> are excluded from the statutory definition of \u201cemployee\u201d, and thus taken out of the operation of the Act. This was the legislative solution to the conflict of loyalties problem experienced when supervisors unionized \u2014 thereby incurring certain rights under the Act and at the same time being subjected to union influence. Congress concluded that supervisors should be considered to be a part of management, and that the only way to guarantee the undivided loyalty of supervisors to their employer was to take them out of the operation and protection of the Act. Thus, the Senate Report, in noting what major <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1178\">*1178</page-number>changes the Taft-Hartley Bill would make in the National Labor Relations Act, stated, \u201cIt eliminates the. genuine supervisor from the coverage of the act as an employee and makes clear that he should be deemed a part of management.\u201d S.Rep.No.105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 3 (1947), in I Legislative History of the Labor Management Relations Act at 409 [hereinafter cited as Legis.Hist.]. Similarly, the House Report noted that \u201c[supervisors are management people,\u201d and concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1246-4\">\n<em>Congress must exclude foremen from the operation of the Labor Act, not only when they organize into unions of the rank and file and into unions affiliated with those of the rank and file, but also when they organize into unions that claim to be independent of the unions of the rank and file.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1246-5\">H.R.Rep.No.245, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 15-16 (1947), in I Legis.Hist. at 306-307 (emphasis in original). The legislative understanding was that even if supervisors organized, they were to be considered \u201cmanagement people\u201d outside the operation of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-6\">The explanatory comments of committee members also support this interpretation. Senator Taft explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1246-7\">It is felt very strongly by manage- . ment that foremen are part of management; that it is impossible to manage a plant unless the foremen are wholly loyal to the management. We tried various inbetween steps, but the general conclusion was that they must either be a part of management or a part of the employees. 'It was proposed that there be separate foremen\u2019s union not affiliated with the men\u2019s unions, but it was found that that was almost impossible; that there was always an affiliation of some sort; that foremen, in order to be successful in a strike, must have the support of the employees\u2019 union. A plant can promote other men to be foremen if necessary. The tie-up with the employees is inevitable. <em>The committee felt that foremen either had to be a part of management and not have any rights under the Wagner Act, or be treated entirely as employees, and it was felt that the latter course would result in the complete disruption of discipline and productivity in the factories of the United States.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1246-11\">93 Cong.Rec. 3952 (1947), in II Legis.Hist. at 1008-1009 (emphasis added).

Ball commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1246-12\">The committee took the position that foremen are an essential and integral part of management, and that to compel management to bargain with itself, so to speak, by dividing the loyalties of foremen between the union and the employer, simply did not make sense, and inevitably would prove harmful- to the free-enterprise system. It might be stated that both the House and Senate bills deal with that subject in substantially the same way.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1246-13\">93 Cong.Rec. 5146 (1947), in II Legis.Hist. at 1496. <em>See also, </em>93 Cong.Rec.

Ellender), in II Legis.Hist. 1064-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-15\">The majority finds its option argument in the language and legislative history of section 14(a). Of course, the legislative history of that section is intimately bound up in that of section 2(3), and cannot be looked at separately.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The legislative history clearly indicates that section 14(a) was intended to do nothing more than make clear that an employer could not be compelled to treat his supervisors like other statutory \u201cemployees,\u201d even if they remained in the union. This follows directly from the exclusion of supervisors from the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d in section 2(3). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1179\">*1179</page-number>There is just nothing in the legislative history to indicate that Congress assumed that if an employer permitted his supervisors to remain in the union, he thereby impliedly accepted their dual loyalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-4\">What <em>is </em>eminently lucid from the legislative history is that Congress thought it was providing that even if a supervisor remained in a union, he had no protection or coverage under the act, and had to rely solely on the benevolence of his employer. Thus, the House Report states, \u201cThe bill' does not forbid these people <em>[i. e., </em>supervisors] to organize. It merely leaves their organizing and bargaining activities outside the provisions of the act.\u201d H.R.Rep.No.245, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 23 (1947), in I Legis.Hist. at 314. <em>See also, </em>S.Rep.No.105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 5 (1947), in I Legis.Hist. at 411; S.Min.Rep.No.105, pt. 2, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 39 (1947), in I Legis.Hist. at 501. Again, the remarks of the committee are informative. For example, Rep. Hartley noted, \u201cThis bill also exempts supervisors from the com-pulsory features of the National Labor Relations Act. In other words, this bill does not bar them from organizing but they cannot obtain the benefits of the act.\u201d 93 Cong.Rec. 3533 (1947), in I Legis.Hist. at 613. <em>See also, </em>93 Cong.Rec. 3952 (1947) (remarks of Sen. Taft), in II Legis.Hist. at 1008.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-5\">The fact that section 14(a) also provides that \u201cNothing herein shall prohibit any individual employed as a supervisor from becoming or remaining a member of a labor organization\u201d does not in any way support the majority\u2019s option argument. This statement was <em>not </em>intended to \u201cexpressly [provide] that foremen could unionize\u201d at the employer\u2019s will, as the majority argues, for there was nothing in the 1947 Amendments which would have prevented such unionization.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The statement was without material effect, and \u201cwas included presumably out of an abundance of caution.\u201d H.Conf.Rep.No.510, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 60 (1947), in I Legis.Hist. at 564.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> This almost superfluous provision obviously cannot legitimately serve as a cornerstone for any interpretation of the legislative solution to the conflict of loyalties problem enacted by the 80th Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-10\">The majority maintains that the case law has always assumed that once an employer permits his supervisors to join unions, he can no longer claim their undivided loyalty in disputes with the union. Yet the cases it cites for this proposition all pre-date the Board\u2019s decision in <em>Oakland Mailers, </em>wherein the Board faced the issue of union discipline of supervisors for the first time and admittedly expanded the interpretation of section 8(b)(1)(B).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The cases since <em>Oakland Mailers </em>indicate that merely because an employer may have consented to the compulsory union membership of his supervisors under a union-security provision does not negate his right to the full protection of section 8(b)(1) (B). <em>See </em>Meat Cutters Union Local 81 v. N. L. R. B., 147 U.S.App.D.C. 375, 458 F.2d 794 (1972); Toledo Locals Nos. 15-P and 272, 175 NLRB 1072, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1180\">*1180</page-number>1080 (1969), enfd., 437 F.2d 55 (6th Cir. 1971); Local Union No. 2150, I. B. E. W., 192 NLRB No. 16, slip op. at 5 (1971). And in <em>Meat Cutters </em>we specifically rejected the union\u2019s argument that section 14(a) expressed an intent to subject supervisor/members to the full control of the union, concluding that it is readily apparent \u201cwhen all the relevant 1947 amendments to the Act are considered in concert, that Congress did not intend thereby to allow unions to subvert the \u2018undivided loyalty' it clearly believed such managerial personnel owe to their respective employers.\u201d <footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1248-4\">In my view the Board\u2019s interpretation of section 8(b)(1)(B) as proscribing union discipline of supervisors for furthering the interests of their employer by performing struck work expressly at his request does not stretch that section to the breaking point, but is fully justified in light of the legislative history and the other sections dealing with supervisors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-6\">The majority attempts to draw significant support for its construction of section 8(b)(1)(B) from <em>Allis-Chalmers,</em><footnotemark><em>22</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which it characterizes as \u201cindistinguishable from these cases.\u201d It is my view that a close analysis of <em>Allis-Chal-mers </em>and <em>Scofield</em><footnotemark><em>23</em></footnotemark><em> </em>reveals nothing which would relieve the unions from responsibility under section 8(b)(1)(B) for these fines. First, it is vitally important to remember that <em>Allis-Chalm-ers </em>involved section 8(b)(1)(A),<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> not 8(b)(1)(B).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> While both contain the common language \u201cto restrain or coerce,\u201d the two provisions protect completely different interests in quite different ways. Section 8(b)(1)(A) was only intended to impose some slight controls upon the <em>union-employee </em>relationship, and the legislative history makes clear that Congress did not intend extensive regulation of the <em>internal </em>union-employee/member relationship. <em>See </em>N. L. R. B. v. The Boeing Co., 412 U.S. 67, 93 S.Ct. 1952, 36 L.Ed.2d 752 (1973); N. L. R. B. v. Allis-Chalmers Mfg. Co., 388 U.S. 175, 183-195, 87 S.Ct. 2001, 18 L.Ed.2d 1123 (1967). <em>See also, </em>National Maritime Union, 78 NLRB 971, 982-987 (1948), enfd. 175 F.2d 686 (2d Cir. 1949), cert. denied, 338 U.S. 954, 70 S.Ct. 492, 94 L.Ed. 589 (1950). Section 8(b)(1)(B), on the other hand, was intended to regulate the <em>external </em>union-<em>employer </em>relationship. No amount of union coercion or interference with an employer\u2019s selection or control of his representatives for the purpose of collective bargaining or adjustment of grievances was permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-16\">Second, in upholding the union fines in <em>Allis-Chalmers </em>and <em>Scofield, </em>while the Supreme Court did not rely upon the express language of the proviso to section 8(b)(1)(A),<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> as the Labor Board had originally done in Minneapolis Star and Tribune Co., 109 NLRB 727 (1954), it did draw \u201ccogent support\u201d for its decision from it.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> <em>See </em>N. L. R. B. v. Allis-Chalmers Mfg. Co., 388 U.S. 175, 191-192, 87 S.Ct. 2001, 18 L.Ed.2d 1123 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1181\">*1181</page-number>(1967); Scofield v. N. L. R. B., 394 U.S. 423, 428, 89 S.Ct. 1154, 22 L.Ed.2d 385 (1969). <em>See also, </em>Gould, Some Limitations Upon Union Discipline Under the National Labor Relations Act; The Radiations of Allis-Chalmers, 1970 Duke L. J. 1067, 1128 (1970). The applicability of that proviso, however, is clearly limited to section 8(b)(1)(A). It is not a part of section 8(b)(1)(B), which directly regulates only the union-employer relationship.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Therefore, to the extent that <em>Allis-Chalmers </em>and <em>Scofield </em>draw \u201ccogent support\u201d from that proviso for their holdings, that rationale cannot lend support to disciplining \u201csupervisors\u201d where the cases arise under section 8(b)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-4\">In the majority\u2019s view the \u201cone thing that is clear\u201d from <em>Allis-Chalmers </em>is that there is no overriding policy of the labor laws which prohibits reasonable union fines levied against its members who cross a lawful picket line to perform rank-and-file struck work. A union has a right to assure solidarity in its ranks by imposing fines to prevent strike breaking by its members. This reasoning, the majority argues, is directly applicable to the situation here. The defect in this argument is that it fails to recognize the fundamental distinction which Congress made between <em>employees </em>and <em>supervisors, </em>even if the latter were members of a union. In <em>Al-lis-Chalmers </em>the Court was faced only with the situation of union discipline of employee/member s. Thus, the Court there began by noting that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1249-9\">National labor policy has been built on the premise that by pooling their economic strength and acting through a labor organization freely chosen by the majority, the employees of an appropriate unit/ have the most effective means of bargaining for improvements in wages, hours, and working conditions. . . . The employee \u25a0may disagree with many of the union decisions but is bound by them. \u201cThe majority rule concept is today unquestionably at the center of our federal labor policy.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1249-11\">It was in this context that the Court proceeded to acknowledge the importance of a union\u2019s power to discipline its members to protect against erosion of its status. \u201cThe power to fine or expel a strikebreaker \u2018is essential if the union is to be an effective bargaining agent.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1249-12\">In contrast, in the instant cases we are confronted with union discipline of <em>supervisor </em>members, which Congress said in the Taft-Hartley amendments were to be \u201cdeemed a part of management.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> It was largely for the reason that because a usual union member <em>is </em>subservient to the will of the majority, Congress took supervisors out of the operation of the Act \u2014 to make them subservient to the will of the employer and <em>not </em>the union.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Certainly management has an equal right under our federal labor policy to promote strike solidarity among its supervisory personnel as does a union to promote solidarity from its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1182\">*1182</page-number>members.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Where these two rights clash, as they do here, the legislative pronouncements of sections 2(3), 14(a) and 8(b)(1)(B) indicate to me that the interest of the employer in having loyal supervisors under his control must prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-4\">Further, as the majority acknowledges, Supreme Court decisions subsequent to <em>Allis-Chalmers </em>have emphasized that the <em>Allis-Chalmers </em>rationale only permits \u201ca union * * * to enforce a properly adopted rule which reflects a legitimate union interest [and] <em>impairs no policy Congress has imbedded in the labor laws.\u201d </em>Scofield v. N. L. R. B., 394 U.S. 423, 430, 89 S.Ct. 1154, 1155, 22 L.Ed.2d 385 (1969) (emphasis added), <em>and see </em>394 U.S. at 429, 432, 89 S.Ct. 1154. <em>See </em>N. L. R. B. v. The Boeing Co., 412 U.S. 67, 93 S.Ct. 1952, 36 L.Ed.2d 752 (1973); N. L. R. B. v. Marine Workers, 391 U.S. 418, 88 S.Ct. 1717, 20 L.Ed.2d 706 (1968); Booster Lodge No. 405, Int. Assn. of Machinists v. N. L. R. B., 148 U.S.App.D.C. 119, 126, 459 F.2d 1143, 1150 (1972), aff\u2019d in part, 412 U.S. 84, 93 S.Ct. 1961, 36 L.Ed.2d 764 (U.S. May 21, 1973).<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> And, as previously developed, sections 2(3), 14(a) and 8(b)(1)(B) do embody such a congressional policy \u2014 to ensure the undivided loyalty of supervisors to their employer without interference from unions \u2014 which would be impaired by these disciplinary fines. Whenever union action has the effect of impermissibly inhibiting an employer with respect to his choice of loyal representatives it is apparent that an express federal labor policy is being violated, and it necessarily follows that the rationale underlying <em>Allis-Chalmers </em>and <em>Scofield </em>cannot be availed to nullify the section 8(b) (1) (B) violation.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1215-13\">. <em>See </em>Int.

This is relevant in that it counsels wariness in finding by construction a broad policy against secondary boycotts as such when, from the words of the statute itself, it is clear that those interested in just such a condemnation were unable to secure its embodiment in enacted law. The problem raised by these cases affords a striking illustration of the importance of the truism that it is the business of Congress to declare policy and not this Court\u2019s. The judicial function is confined to applying what Congress has enacted after ascertaining what it is that Congress has enacted. But such ascertainment, that is, construing legislation, is nothing like a mechanical endeavor. It could not be accomplished by the subtlest of modern \u201cbrain\u201d machines.
