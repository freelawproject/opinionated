Gissel Packing Co., 395 U.S. 575, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969). The cases require review of two orders of the National Labor Relations Board. The factual settings are closely, related. We shall set out the background in each case before considering the pertinent legal principles.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1168-20\">1. STATEMENT OF FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-21\">A. <em>Wilder Manufacturing Co.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1168-22\">On the morning of October 12, 1965, representatives of the Textile Workers presented Walter Derse, secretary and general manager of Wilder, with 11 signed and two unsigned union membership cards <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and requested recognition as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1101\">*1101</page-number>bargaining agent of the Company\u2019s production and maintenance employees. Of the 30 employees then on the Company\u2019s payroll, 18 were in the production and maintenance unit, which the Board found to be appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Failing to receive an immediate answer to the request, the eleven employees who had signed the authorization cards left the plant and established a picket line. They were joined the next day by the two employees whose blank cards were among the thirteen presented to Derse.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1169-5\">During the evening of the next day, October 13, the Company\u2019s officers met. Walter Derse reported that there were ten or eleven employees on the picket line .and as \u201cwe are about 30 (not including the officers of the Company) it appears that they do not represent a majority.\u201d The officers decided not to recognize the union.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The picketing continued for at least five months thereafter. Subsequent demands for recognition were made without response, from the Company.-</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-16\">On May 9, 1966, the Board\u2019s General Counsel filed a complaint charging Wilder with violations of \u00a7 8(a)(1) and (5) of the Act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Trial Examiner, on September 22, 1966, upheld the complaint on the \u00a7 8(a)(5) and dismissed the 8(a)(1) charge.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Board, however, concluded that the 8(a)(5) charge should be dismissed since \u201cthere is no showing whatsoever that Respondent had rejected the collective-bargaining principle or engaged in any interference, restraint, or coercion of employees to undermine the Union. Nor does the record show that Respondent has en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1102\">*1102</page-number>gaged in any other conduct which would prevent the holding of a fair election.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On petition for review to this court, we held per curiam, 137 U.S.App.D.C. 67, 420 F.2d 635 (Nov. 14, 1969), that in light of the intervening <em>Gissel </em>decision, <em>supra, </em>and possible conflicts between the \u201ccurrent practice\u201d of the Board, as represented to the Supreme Court, and the decision reached, the case should be remanded for \u201cfurther consideration by the Board in the first instance in light of <em>Gissel, </em>but without limitation.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A0i\">On August 27, 1970, 185 NLRB 175, the Board issued a Supplemental Decision and Order, after a review of the entire record, and now found that Wilder\u2019s course of conduct did constitute a violation of \u00a7 8(a)(5). In reaching this result the Board declined to rest on a finding that the case presented an employer who refused to bargain and \u201cstands upon his doubt as to the appropriateness of the unit,\u201d stating that \u201cthe Respondents\u2019 response \u2014 or lack of response \u2014 to the Union demand did not assert this as the ground of the refusal . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Instead the Board focused on these findings: (1) There was evidence, in addition to mere cards, sufficient to communicate to the employer convincing knowledge of majority status (the independent knowledge test). (2) The evidence was insufficient to show that the employer\u2019s refusal to grant recognition was based upon genuine willingness to resolve any doubts concerning majority status through the Board\u2019s election process. On finding both these conditions met, the Board concluded that the refusal to bargain constituted a violation of 8(a)(5).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Board then filed an ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1103\">*1103</page-number>plication for enforcement of its supplemental order in this court on September 21, 1970. While the petition was pending, the Company moved to dismiss this petition on jurisdictional grounds, and subsequently the Board moved to have the case remanded to it for reconsideration in light of its decision in Linden Lumber, 190 NLRB No. 116, 77 LRRM 1305 which issued on June 7, 1971 and is the companion case in this litigation. Our court upheld the jurisdictional objections of the company and transferred the case to the Second Circuit,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> which on February 1, 1972, remanded to the Board for the requested reconsideration.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1171-5\">The Board on August 21, 1972, 198 NLRB No. 123, then issued its Second Supplemental Decision and Order in <em>Wilder </em>which reversed the First Supplemental Decision and Order. The Board, one member dissenting, rejected the \u201cindependent knowledge\u201d test and held that absent voluntary measures by the employer, through an attempt<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> or agreement<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> to determine majority status by any means other than a Board election, and in the absence of any independent unfair labor practices, the predicate could not be established for an 8(a)(5) violation.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> After over 7 years, and three Board decisions representing a series of reversals in position, the Board now seeks to limit sharply the scope of any duty to bargain on the basis of authorization cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-13\">B. <em>Linden Lumber</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1171-14\">The procedural history of <em>Linden Lumber </em>is shorter \u2014 there is only one Board decision \u2014 but pointed, for it is on the basis of the Board\u2019s decision in this case, issued June 7, 1971, that the decision in <em>Wilder </em>rests. The time elapsed since the underlying events, however, is more than six years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-15\">On December 28, 1966, employee Martin contacted Local 413 representative Dow Norman about organizing the employees of Linden Lumber (the Company). Next day, Norman held a meeting during which 12 employees, including 2 alleged supervisors, Shafer and Marsh, signed authorization cards. In the proceeding before the Trial Examiner, \u201cthe parties stipulated that at all times material there were 10 employees\u201d within the appropriate bargaining unit<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> On Jan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1104\">*1104</page-number>uary 5, 1967, Local 413 (\u201cthe Union\u201d) sent a letter to the Company requesting recognition. On February 3, at a prehearing conference on the Local\u2019s representation petition, the Company declined the Union\u2019s request to enter into a consent election agreement. Instead the Company raised threshold questions as to the Union\u2019s showing of interest, on the basis that the union had been organized by supervisors (Marsh and Shafer).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Based upon the Company\u2019s alleged fear of recognizing a supervisor \u2014dominated union, the Company stated that unless it could settle the 8(a)(2) violation in the context of the petition for an election \u2014 a request refused by the hearing officer \u2014 it would refuse to recognize the union, even after a Board \u2022 \u2014 conducted election.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Immediately after this statement by the representative of the Company (Mr. Rector), the Union\u2019s representatives withdrew the representation petition.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> After the withdrawal was approved, Rector told Mr. Smedstad, the Union attorney, that if the Union submitted a new petition supported by a \u201cfresh\u201d 30 percent showing of interest, the company would go to a consent election. By March 4, the Union had obtained 9 signatures (leaving out the two alleged supervisors, Shafer and Marsh). The Company still refused to recognize the Union \u201cbecause its membership included supervisors who influenced employees,\u201d again raising the spectre of the 8(a) (2) violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-9\">On February 15, the employees struck in support of the Union demand for recognition.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The ' Union filed its charge of refusal to bargain on February 23, and the strike ended on June 1. At the end of the strike the Company refused to reinstate Marsh and another striker, Alexander. Marsh was refused reinstatement on the ground that he had quit. Alexander was refused on the strength of the Company\u2019s belief that he had provoked and participated in a violent incident related to the picketing at the plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-10\">On these facts, the Trial Examiner concluded that the Company violated Section 8(a) (5) by refusing to recognize the Union, that the strike was an unfair labor practice strike, and that Marsh and Alexander were unlawfully denied reinstatement in violation of Section 8(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-11\">The Board concluded that Marsh and Alexander, as economic strikers, were wrongfully denied reinstatement in violation of Section 8(a)(3). It further determined, two members dissenting, to reject the Examiner\u2019s conclusion, and held that the Company did not violate \u00a7 8(a)(5) and (1) of the Act by refusing to bargain with the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-12\">The Board majority began its analysis by noting that the \u00a7 8(a)(3) violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1105\">*1105</page-number>did not amount to a serious independent unfair labor practice, and that it could not make a finding that \u201cthe possibility of erasing the effects of past practices and of ensuring a fair election (or a fair rerun) by the use of traditional remedies, though present, is slight and that employee sentiment once expressed through cards would, on balance, be better protected by a bargaining order . .\u201d <em>(Gissel, supra, </em>395 U.S. at 614-615, 89 S.Ct. at 1940). This conclusion is not challenged in this petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-5\">Noting that <em>Gissel </em>left open \u201cwhether, absent election interference, an employer who insists on an election must initiate the election by his own petition,\u201d the Board reviewed the \u201ccurrent practice\u201d on this question alluded to in Gissel,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The Board then questioned whether the Supreme Court summary \u201cis entirely accurate,\u201d particulary whether the Board had ever used the \u201cindependent knowledge\u201d test as a basis for a bargaining order. It stated that Snow &amp; Sons, 134 NLRB 709, enf\u2019d, 308 F.2d 687 (9th Cir. 1962) did not rest only on the fact of employer <em>knowledge, </em>but \u201calso upon the fact that the employer breached his agreement to permit majority status to be determined by means other than a Board election.\u201d The Board also distinguished its decision in Wilder<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> observing \u201c[t]here we found an 8(a)(5) violation not only because of admitted employer knowledge of majority status, but also because of the absence of any evidence that the employer was willing to resolve any lingering doubts of majority status through our election procedures.\u201d The Board then argued that the \u201cindependent knowledge\u201d test was unworkable, and also questioned how it could determine the \u201cwillingness\u201d to have majority status determined by an election. The Board stated, \u201chow are we to judge \u2018willingness\u2019 if the record is silent, as in <em>Wilder, </em>or doubtful, as here, as to just how \u2018willing\u2019 the Respondent is in fact? We decline, in summary to re-enter the \u2018good faith\u2019 thicket of <em>Joy Silk . </em>. . .\u201d <footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The Board indicated that it intended to restrict the scope of \u00a7 8(a)(5) to those situations in which the company and union had \u201cvoluntarily\u201d agreed \u201cupon [a] mutually acceptable and legally permissible means, other than a Board-conducted election, for resolving the issue of union majority status.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-11\">C. <em>Contentions of the Parties</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1173-12\">The petitioner unions contend that the language and history of \u00a7\u00a7 8(a)(5) and 9(a), and subsequent court decisions, establish that an employer has a duty to bargain whenever the union representa*-tive presents \u201cconvincing evidence of majority support,\u201d that this requires an evaluation of whether \u201ca reasonable man\u201d would consider any particular evidence convincing, and that such convincing evidence was supplied in the instant cases by the recognitional strikes, joined by a majority of their employees. They submit that retention of an independent knowledge test is not inherently unworkable, at least when knowledge is deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1106\">*1106</page-number>mined on the basis of a recognitional strike.</p>\n<p id=\"Aa9\">The Board, on the other hand, has adopted a \u201cvoluntarist\u201d view of the duty to bargain. Absent unfair labor practices or an agreement to determine majority status through means other than an election, such as a poll, the employer has no duty to recognize the union. This means, in effect, that as a matter of law, the decision to recognize a union on the basis of cards is entirely within the control of the employer; neither \u201cbad faith\u201d or \u201cindependent knowledge\u201d can lay the predicate for recognition because those concepts are deemed unworkable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-5\">II. THE STATUTORY FRAMEWORK</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-6\">While there is certainly wide latitude for Board policy in interpreting the requirements of statutory obligations, \u201cThe policy of Congress . . . cannot be defeated by the Board\u2019s policy,\u201d Machinists Local 1424, 362 U.S. 411, 429, 80 S.Ct. 822, 833, 4 L.Ed.2d 832 (1960). We therefore begin with a brief examination of the legislative materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-8\">Section 9(a) provides that: \u201cRepresentatives designated or selected for the purposes of collective bargaining by the majority of the employees in a unit appropriate for such purposes, shall be the exclusive representatives of all the employees ......\u201d Section 8(a)(5) then provides that it shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer \u201c(5) to refuse to bargain collectively with the representatives of his employees, subject to the provisions of section 9(a).\u201d <em>Gis-sel, </em>aside from its specific holdings,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> is important in recognizing that :<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1174-10\">Since \u00a7 9(a) . . . refers to the representative as the one \u201cdesignated or selected\u201d by a majority of the employees without specifying precisely how that representative is to be chosen, it was early recognized that an employer had a duty to bargain whenever the union representative presented \u201cconvincing evidence of majority support.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1174-16\">The view that an election was not the only predicate for a union claim to majority status is given added emphasis by the Conference Committee rejection of that proposal when the basic Act was under revision in 1947. The House version of \u00a7 8(a)(5) would have made a refusal to bargain an unfair labor practice only if the union were already certified under \u00a7 9(a). This was rejected in favor of the broader Senate version.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The language was not changed as the House proposed, even though, as <em>Gissel </em>points out, it had been early recognized, by interpretation of the outstanding law, that the employer had a duty to bargain whenever the union representative presented convincing evidence of majority support.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-17\">What Congress did do in 1947 was to add a provision, in \u00a7 9(c) (1) (B), to give employ\u00e9rs the right to file their own representation petitions. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"alp-dedup-1\">Whenever a petition shall have been filed, in accordance with such regulations as may be prescribed by the Board\u2014 ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ake-dedup-0\">(B) by an employer, alleging that one or more individuals or labor organizations have presented to him a claim to be recognized as the representative defined in section 9(a);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASvC\">the Board shall investigate such petition and if it has reasonable cause to believe that a question of representation affecting commerce exists shall provide for an appropriate hearing\u2019 upon due notice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1175-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1107\">*1107</page-number>These statutory provisions plainly contemplate employer duty of recognition even in the absence of election, and give a safeguard to the employer who has doubts about majority status by assuring him the right to file his own petition for an election. There is no clear cut answer, however, either in the text of the statute or the legislative history, to the question of when and in what circumstances an employer must take evidence of majority support as \u201cconvincing.\u201d That is the focal issue of these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-4\">III. STANDARDS FOR CARD RECOGNITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-5\"> In approaching the question of a possible standard for card recognition, we must begin by recognizing that \u201ccards are not the functional equivalent of a certification election,\u201d <footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and elections have a \u201cpreferred status\u201d as a means of determining representation.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Three reasons are primary in the Board\u2019s conclusion that cards do not have the same standing as certification election. (1) There is greater opportunity for coercion of employees by union organizers, as compared with a secret ballot.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> (2) Arguably, employees may misunderstand the import of signing an authorization card, because of misreading, failure to read, or union misrepresentation.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> (3) When cards are used, the employer has no opportunity to speak to his employees concerning their determination to have union representation, and an employer\u2019s right to communicate to employees concerning representation is arguably guaranteed under \u00a7 8(c) of the Taft-Hartley Act.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Out of these considerations arises an inhibition on the part of the Board to expand the mandatory scope of a duty to bargain on the basis of cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-10\">A. <em>The Independent Knowledge Standard</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1175-11\">Prior to the present litigation, the Board implemented the policy favoring elections over cards by adopting a limited scope for a duty to bargain in the absence of election. The rule adopted by the Board has been described as the \u201cindependent knowledge\u201d standard.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1175-12\">This rule developed from the case of <em>Snow &amp; </em>Sons<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> where the employer, upon being presented with an apparent card majority, at first refused to recognize the union and insisted that it petition for an election. Subsequently, the employer agreed to submit the cards to an impartial third party, but after authentication, the employer refused recognition claiming he never considered the agreement binding. The Board held that, given the authentication, the refusal to bargain was not based on a reasonable doubt as to the union\u2019s majority. During the 1960\u2019s the <em>Snow &amp; Sons </em>doctrine was applied where an employer had reneged on an agreement to have the cards authenticated by an impartial par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1108\">*1108</page-number>ty and to be bound by such <em>authentication.</em><footnotemark><em>35</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1176-4\"><em>We </em>interject to note that at this time \u2014prior to <em>Gissel </em>in 1969 \u2014 the applicable doctrine defined an employer\u2019s right of non-recognition as applicable only in case of a \u201cgood faith doubt as to the unions\u2019 majority status.\u201d Joy Silk Mills, Inc. v. NLRB, 87 U.S.App.D.C. 360, 185 F.2d 732 (1950); Retail Clerks Union, Local No. 1179 v. NLRB, 376 F.2d 186 (9th Cir. 1967). In <em>Gissel, </em>the Board announced \u201cat oral argument that it had virtually abandoned the <em>Joy Silk </em>doctrine altogether.\u201d <footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The Court further stated the Board\u2019s position at that time (395 U.S. at 594, 89 S.Ct. at 1930):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1176-5\">Thus, an employer can insist that a union go to an election, regardless of his subjective motivation, so long as he is not guilty of misconduct; he need give no affirmative reasons for rejecting a recognition request, and he can demand an election with a simple \u201cno comment\u201d to the union. The Board pointed out, however, (1) that an employer could not refuse to bargain if he <em>knew, </em>through a personal poll for instance, that a majority of his employees supported the union, and (2) that an employer could not refuse recognition because of questions as to the appropriateness of the unit and then later claim, as an afterthought, that he doubted the union\u2019s strength.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1176-6\">Subsequent to <em>Gissel, </em>two Board decisions expanded on the <em>Snow </em>rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-9\">In <em>Pacific Abrasive,</em><footnotemark><em>37</em></footnotemark><em> </em>presentation of the card majority was accompanied by the employer\u2019s verification of the signature on the cards, an acknowledgement of authenticity, conversations with employees who indicated union support, and a strike in support of recognition by a majority of the unit. The Board was thus relying on conduct of the employer or employees, in drawing the inference that the employer must have known that the union had a majority.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> <em>Pacific Abrasive </em>was followed by the second decision in the instant case, <em>Wilder, </em>where the Board established \u201cindependent knowledge\u201d on the basis of evidence in addition to mere cards, sufficient to communicate to the employer \u201cconvincing\u201d knowledge of majority status.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> In the Board opinions now before us for review, the Board has retreated to the facts of <em>Snow &amp; Sons, </em>the fact of an agreement to be bound by an independent authentication, as offering the only valid basis for an employer duty to bargain on the basis of \u201cindependent knowledge.\u201d Thus, \u201c[ujnless, as in <em>Snow &amp; Sons, </em>the employer has agreed to let its \u2018knowledge\u2019 of majority status be established through a means other than a Board election\u201d (JA at 53-54) the facts will not justify an 8(a)(5) bargaining order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-10\">It is important to understand, however, that it was represented to the Supreme Court in <em>Gissel </em>that the facts of <em>Snow &amp; Son </em>laid the predicate for a finding of independent knowledge, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1109\">*1109</page-number>that a finding of \u201cindependent knowledge\u201d was restricted to such facts.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The Board in its decision questions whether the Supreme Court accurately summarized its position.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> This is not just a matter of historical detail; inherent in the two positions is a difference which goes to the heart of the Congressional policy established by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-4\">The abandonment of <em>Wilder II </em>means that even if an employer acts in total disregard of \u201cconvincing evidence of majority status,\u201d he has no duty to recognize a union. That duty can only be triggered by his own permission, in allowing an impartial party to assess union strength.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-5\">There were a number of indices in both <em>Wilder </em>and <em>Linden Lumber, </em>which could have laid the predicate for \u201cconvincing evidence of majority status\u201d; in <em>Wilder, </em>there was a strike in support of the cards, and an admission of Respondent that the Union had \u201c10 or 11\u201d of his employees; in <em>Linden Lumber, </em>there was a recognitional strike, and a renege on the employer\u2019s agreement to abide by an election outcome after a \u201cfresh\u201d showing of a thirty percent support.

Arkansas Oak Flooring Co., 351 U.S. 62, 76 S.Ct. 559, 100 L.Ed. 941 (1956), but that case merely established that \u2019a state court could not enjoin a recognitional strike where there was a card majority, solely because the union had failed to take necessary steps toward securing a Board election. The issue as to whether a recognitional strike laid the foundation for an 8(a)(5) charge was not before the court.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> While there are circuit court decisions indicating that a strike supported by a unit majority undermines a good faith claim of doubt as to majority status, these cases are distinguishable <footnotemark>43</footnotemark> There is no case holding that the statute requires the Board to use recognitional strikes as conclusive evidence, and it is that position for which the union contends.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1110\">*1110</page-number>Even assuming some test such as \u201cindependent knowledge\u201d is required by the statute, that does not mean the Board must attach conclusive weight to recog-nitional strikes. As the Court described the role of the Labor Board in Republic Aviation Corp. v. NLRB, 324 U.S. 793, 800, 65 S.Ct. 982, 986, 89 L.Ed. 1372 (1945), \u201cOne of the purposes which lead to the creation of such boards is to have decisions based upon evidential facts under the particular statute made by experienced officials with an adequate appreciation of the complexities of the subject which is entrusted to their administration.\u201d It is certainly permissible for the Board to avoid encouraging recognitional striking and picketing by refusing to regard them as an independent and conclusive method of demonstrating a majority, particularly since workers might well honor a picket line without necessarily supporting the union.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1178-4\">\n<em>Other Evidence of Majority Support</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-5\">Aside from the fact that in <em>Linden Lumber </em>the employer refused to acknowledge the \u201cfresh\u201d showing of majority support \u2014 which we deal with below in a different context \u2014 the only other indication of majority support was the admission of the employer in <em>Wilder </em>to other officers of the Company, that the Union \u201chad 10 or 11 of his employees.\u201d While the Second Supplemental Decision of the Board did not comment directly on this evidentiary point, relied upon in its First Supplemental Decision, disregard of this evidence was apparently related to the Board\u2019s rejection of \u201cthe wisdom of attempting to divine, in retrospect the state of employer (a) knowledge, depicting this as re-entry into the \u201cgood faith thicket.\u201d We assume the \u201c10 or 11\u201d statement was made by the employer, for the Board seemingly does not contest this prior Board finding. While it may be that there would be difficulties in determining the state of past employer knowledge, in this case and in others, we cannot accept the view that this requires a union petition for an election as the only means for obtaining recognition. We turn, at this juncture, to another predicate for issuing a bargaining order, related to \u201cindependent knowledge\u201d and its \u201cgood faith\u201d predecessor: the failure of the company to evidence its own \u201cgood faith doubt\u201d by itself petitioning for an election.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-9\">B. <em>Failure of Employer' to Petition for Election as Pertinent to \u201cGood Faith\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1178-10\">In <em>Gissel, </em>the Court reviewed the legislative history of \u00a7 9(c) (B) of the 1947 Taft-Hartley Amendments. The Supreme Court stated, 395 U.S. at 599, 89 S.Ct. at 1932:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-11\">That provision was not added, as the employers assert, to give them an absolute right to an election at any time; rather, it was intended, as the legislative history indicates, to allow them, after being asked to bargain, to test out their doubts as to a union\u2019s majority in a secret election which they would then presumably not cause to be set aside by illegal antiunion activity [footnote 16 omitted].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1178-12\">In footnote 16, the Supreme Court noted that the Senate Report clearly indicates that the right to petition for an election was a way in which the employer could remove his doubt<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Neither Wilder nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1111\">*1111</page-number>Linden indicated that it wishes to have a doubt resolved by petitioning for an election. In the First Supplemental Decision in <em>Wilder, </em>two reasons were given for finding a violation of the duty to bargain. Besides holding that the employer had \u201cindependent knowledge\u201d of the union\u2019s majority statute, the Board found that there was \u201cinsufficient evidence that the employer\u2019s refusal to grant recognition was based upon genuine willingness to resolve any doubts concerning majority status through the Board\u2019s election process,\u201d noting that \u201cthe Employer did not itself file an election petition or urge or even suggest to the employees or the Union the use of such procedures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-5\">In <em>Linden, </em>of course the union did file a petition for an election simultaneous with its demand for recognition. The employer, however, after refusing to recognize on the basis of cards, indicated that he would not recognize the union even if it were victorious in an election. This led the Union to withdraw their petition and go straight to the 8(a)(5) proceeding, which was inevitable, in any event, at the end of the election process.</p>\n<p id=\"ARu\">Of course, in <em>Linden, </em>the Board indicated that this fact would play no part in its decision since it was reassessing \u201cthe wisdom of attempting to divine, in retrospect, the state of employer (a) knowledge\u201d and \u201c(b) intent at the time he refuses to accede to a union demand for recognition.\u201d The Board went on to state \u201c. . . if we are to let our decisions turn on an employer\u2019s \u2018willingness\u2019 to have majority status determined by an election, how are we to judge \u2018willingness\u2019 if the record is silent, as in <em>Wilder, </em>or doubtful, as here, as to just how \u2018willing\u2019 the Respondent is, in fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"aqs-dedup-1\">Whatever the merit of abandoning the \u201cindependent knowledge\u201d doctrine because of the difficulty of reaching judgments required as to state of mind, the same cannot be said as to \u201cwillingness to have majority status determined by an election.\u201d One simple act, a petition by the employer for an election,<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> could evidence such \u201cwillingness.\u201d Indeed it was the premise of the Taft-Hartley Amendment to \u00a7 9(c) (B) that employers could \u201ctest out their doubts as to a union\u2019s majority status\u201d by petitioning for an election. In ignoring that opportunity, the Board ignores the very intent behind the statutory provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-11\">It is our view that the Board order cannot be enforced where both tests have been abandoned. It is conceivable that a restriction of \u201cindependent knowledge\u201d to an agreement to abide by an authentication would be acceptable, if the employer was required to evidence his good faith doubt as to majority status, by petitioning for an election. The Board, on the other hand, is willing to resolve every assertion of doubt in the employer\u2019s favor, without permitting any \u201ctest\u201d of those doubts. The union, of course, argues that an employer would violate \u00a7 8(a)(5) by petitioning for an election without entertaining actual doubt. This is, however, an issue we need not reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-12\">While we have indicated that cards alone, or recognitional strikes and ambiguous utterances of the employer, do not necessarily provide such \u201cconvincing evidence of majority support\u201d so as to require a bargaining order, they certainly create a sufficient probability of majority support as to require an employer asserting a doubt of majority status to resolve the possibility through a petition for an election, if he is to avoid both any duty to bargain and any inquiry into the actuality of his doubt.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1179-13\">When an employer petitions for or consents to election, the election proc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1112\">*1112</page-number>ess is expedited.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> If he declines to exercise this option, he must take the risk that his conduct as a whole, in the context of \u201cconvincing evidence of majority support,\u201d may be taken as a refusal to bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-4\">As is only too often the case in litigation trenching on deep feelings, each of the parties focused on its extreme position \u2014 the unions, on their claim to an 8(a)(5) order based on an \u201cindependent knowledge\u201d test retained in full flower; the Board and the companies, on their claim that an 8(a)(5) obligation can flower only in case of employer consent to authentication. And so the position set forth in this opinion was not advanced by the parties. It was presented by the court during the course of argument, and counsel had an opportunity to develop whatever objections were seen. If objections had subsequently been visualized, leave to file a post-argument memorandum could have been sought, and properly so. Hearing no such objection, and seeing none ourselves on further reflection <footnotemark>49</footnotemark>, we conclude the principle herein set forth is sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1113\">*1113</page-number>IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-4\">We hold that if \u201cindependent knowledge\u201d is to be restricted, some alternative must be put in its place to prevent an employer\u2019s deliberate flouting and disregard of union cards without rhyme or reason. The complete lack of such an alternative would not be consistent with the Act. If no \u201cindependent knowledge\u201d or \u201cgood faith\u201d test is to be used by the Board, the employer must be put to some other kind of test to evidence good faith. <em>Compare </em>Food Store Employees Union v. NLRB, 155 U.S.App.D.C. 101, 476 F.2d 546, 554 (1973). The alternative such as employer petition for election retains primary emphasis on the election process, and its preferred status. The position adopted by the Board is inconsistent with the Act and its orders must be reversed.

Thus, an employer can insist that a union go to an election, regardless of his subjective motivation, so long as he is not guilty of misconduct; he need give no affirmative reasons for rejecting a recognition request, and he can demand an election with a simple \u2018no comment\u2019 to the union.

Petitioners point to the following passage in <em>Gissel, </em>395 U.S. at 596-597, 89-S.Ct. at 1931\u2019, as establishing the Court\u2019s acceptance of recognitional strikes as necessarily showing convincing support:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-9\">Almost from the inception of the Act, then, it was recognized that a union did not have to be certified as a winner of a Board election to invoke a bargaining obligation ; it could establish majority status by other means under the unfair labor practice provision of \u00a7 8(a)(5) \u2014 by showing convincing support, for instance, by a union-called strike or strike vote, or as here, by possession of cards signed by a majority of the employees authorizing the union to represent them for collective bargaining purposes.il [Footnote omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AdiD\">However, this passage merely begs the question here at issue, since the Court was simply using strike votes and cards as alterna-fives. Not even the union contends here, nor has it ever been Board practice, that a card majority <em>per se </em>invokes a duty to bargain. This is given added emphasis by footnote 11 to the above cited passage from <em>Gissel </em>which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-14\">The right of an employer lawfully to refuse to bargain if he had a good faith doubt as to the Union\u2019s majority status, even if in fact the Union did represent a majority, was recognized early in the Administration of the Act, see NLRB v. Remington Rand, Inc., 94 F.2d 862, 868 (C. A.2d Cir.), cert, denied, 304 U.S. 576 [58 S.Ct. 1046, 82 L.Ed. 1540] (1938).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"43\">\n<p id=\"b1177-15\">'. <em>See, e. g., </em>NLRB v. Harris-Woodson Co., 179 F.2d 720 (4th Cir. 1950 (recognitional strike, in context of refusal to negotiate witli an already certified unit) ; NLRB v.

Refusal to cross a picket line may reflect mere fear, <em>see </em>NLRB v. Union Carbide Corp., 440 F.2d 54, 56 (4th Cir. 1971), cert, denied, 404 U.S. 826, 92 S.Ct. 58, 30 L.Ed. 2d 55 (1971).

A man comes into his office and says \u201c1 represent your employees. Sign this agreement, or we strike tomorrow\u201d . . . . The employer has no way in which to determine whether this man really does represent his employees or does not. The bill gives him the right to go to the Board . . . and say, \u201cI want an election. I want to know who is the bargaining agent for my employees.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"46\">\n<p id=\"b1179-8\">. Or an employer\u2019s voicing of a consent to abide by an election ordered on union petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"47\">\n<p id=\"b1179-9\">. The Board might, in order to reduce litigation and delay in these matters, adopt the rule that an employer must, when presented with an authorization card majority, either recognize the union or, within a reasonable time, petition for a certification election. Comment, <em>supra </em>28, at 325. Without such a <em>per se </em>rule, of course, the Board would have to use some version of the \u201cindependent knowledge\u201d test it considers workable, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1112\">*1112</page-number>in order to define those conditions where a failure of an employer to petition' for an election would be a predicate for an 8(a)(5) bargaining order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"48\">\n<p id=\"b1180-6\">. Board member Fanning, dissenting in the Second Supplemental Decision in <em>Wilder, </em>observed that:</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-7\">[0]ur experience in conducting elections demonstrates that where employers are willing to go to an election, the election is held more expeditiously and with far less likelihood of interference in the conduct of the election than is the case where either party has to be forced to an election.</p>\n<p id=\"ALkq\">One commentator, on the basis of an interview with Martin Schneid, Assistant to the Regional Director, NLRB, has concluded that \u201can election contested through submission of objections at a pre-election hearing is likely to take sixty to sixty-tliree days between petition and balloting, while a consent election, in which the hearing is waived, is likely to take only twenty to twenty-three days. Comment, <em>supra </em>note 28, at 325 n.48.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-8\">The additional speed is obtained by the ability to dispense with objections at a pre-hearing conference. If an employer files a petition for an election, he would be required to define the appropriate unit and therefore would not be entitled, as ah objecting party, to request a hearing. Nor could the employer object to a sufficient (30%) showing of majority support.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-9\">The direct consequences of such a rule are immediately apparent in the context of <em>Wilder </em>where the employer challenged the appropriateness of the unit \u2014 this was, in fact, an asserted reason for not recognizing the union on the basis of cards \u2014 and in <em>Linden Lumber </em>where the employer raised his possible \u00a7 8(a)(2) liability for recognizing a union dominated by supervisors, as well as connected unit problems. Yet the trial examiners in both cases found there was no basis for such concerns, thus indicating how such issues may be used to delay elections.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"49\">\n<p id=\"b1180-11\">. We take note of the possibility that an employer may contend that he does not want to petition for an election because he fears that an agreement with the certified union may be challenged as a \u201csweetheart\u201d deal prohibited by \u00a7 8(a)(2). Such a contention is more likely to reflect a tactic than a genuine problem. This seems to have been the case in <em>Linden, </em>where the employer first objected to the Union petition for election on the ground of inclusion of supervisors in the unit, then promised to proceed with a consent election if the Union made a fresh start, yet later objected to a new Union showing of interest on a petition for election established without cards from the challenged persons, on the ground that the problem was not remediable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-12\">In any event, to the extent that an employer\u2019s petition for election may be followed by an issue under \u00a7 8(a)(2), on a \u201csweetheart\u201d objection, this is a modest and limited difficulty which was accepted by Congress as an objection lacking sufficient significance to override the value of employer petitions in arriving at labor peace and resolution of problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-13\">Of course, the possibility exists \u2014 indeed it was raised in <em>Linden Lumber </em>\u2014 that the employer would be subject to an 8(a)(5) violation if he did not recognize a. union, but subject to an 8(a) (2) charge if he did, and it was later found that the Union was employer-dominated. This possibility is significantly increased, it could be argued, by taking away the possibility of raising the 8(a) (2) defense to a union election petition, as a self-protection measure of the employer. <em>See </em>International Ladies\u2019 Garment Workers Union v. NLRB, 366 U.S. 731, 81 S.Ct. 1603, 6 L.Ed.2d 762 (1961). One possible reply to this dilemma is that it is less of a problem following an election, as compared to the situation which would exist if the only option was card recognition. See <em>id. </em>at 739, 81 S.Ct. 1603; <em>Compare </em>Shea Chemical Corp., 121 NLRB 1027 (1958).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
