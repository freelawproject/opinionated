See Stavrides v. Mellon National Bank &amp; Trust Co., 353 F.Supp. 1072, 1079-1080 (W.D. Pa.1973).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Similar reasons were advanced by the District Court for the District of Columbia in rejecting a similar claim under the Truth-In-Lending Act. See Graybeal v. American Savings &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, 59 F.R.D. 7, 18-20 (D.D.C. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-12\">Supplementing the reasons given in the district court opinion, we note the following :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-13\">(1) The term \u201cescrow\u201d has been used in the mortgage business to describe monthly tax and insurance prepayments even though such payments are not segregated and without regard to whether interest is paid to the mortgagor. See First Federal Savings &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n v. Board of Equalization, 182 Neb. 25, 26, 152 N.W.2d 8, 9 (1967);<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-14\">(2) The term \u201cescrow\u201d (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(e)(3)) has been used by courts where one of the parties to the escrow agreement held the escrow funds and no independent escrow holder of the fund was contemplated by the agreement. <em>See, e. g., </em>Gulf Petroleum, S. A. v. Collazo,\u2018316 F.2d 257, 261 (1st Cir. 1963);</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1023-15\">(3) Since the mortgagor has no right to withdraw his monthly tax and insurance payments, the arrangement challenged by plaintiffs-appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>lants complies with the following language of the Restatement (Second) of Trusts, \u00a7 12, Comment 1 (1959):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4t\">\u201cWhere the deposit is in escrow, that is where the money is to be paid to a third person on the happening of a designated event and in the meantime the depositor has no right to withdraw the money, it depends upon the manifestation of the intention of the parties whether the bank may use as its own the money deposited or whether the money shall be held in trust. Such a deposit ordinarily indicates an intention that the bank may use the money as its own . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1024-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court order will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1023-7\">. A May 3, 1973, district court order made the certification and determination contemplated by F.R.Civ.P. 54(b) and entered final judgment dismissing Counts Fourth through Ninth of such complaint. The parties agree that if final judgment for the defendants was correctly entered on the Fifth Count, the defendants are entitled to entry of judgment in their favor on the other counts related thereto (Counts Seventh-Ninth). Also, plaintiffs concede that they \u201chave not pursued Count Four in this appeal\u201d and that they have consented to the dismissal of \u201cCount Six\u201d (see page 3 of appellants\u2019 brief).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1023-8\">. Other federal courts have expressly relied upon the district court opinion in <em>gtavrides </em>in dismissing similar claims. See Kinee v. Abraham Lincoln Federal Savings &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, 365 F.Supp. 975 (E.D.Pa.1973) ; Munn v. American General Investment Corp., 364 F. Supp. 110 (S.D.Tex., 1973) ; Williams <em>v. </em>American Savings Ass\u2019n, No. CA-3-6350-D (N.D.Tex., March 26, 1973). See also Umdenstock v. American Mortgage &amp; Investment Co. of Oklahoma City, 363 F.Supp. 1375 (W.D. Okl.1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1023-17\">. The case of Liberty National Life Insurance Co. v. United States, 463 F.2d 1027, 1030 n. 6 (5th Cir. 1972), relied upon by appellants in interpreting the term \u201cescrow,\u201d is distinguishable from the instant case since in <em>Lib-berty National </em>the court was concerned with interpreting the word \u201cescrow\u201d as it applied to mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration, which are subject to requirements not applicable to private mortgages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">. We n\u00f3te that the staff of the Federal Reserve Board, which was designated by Congress to administer and interpret the Truth-In-Lending Act, has consistently concluded that the nonpayment of interest on such escrow deposits need not be taken into account in computation of the finance charge or the amount financed. In a Federal Reserve Board Public Information Letter dated July 15, 1971, No. 504, 4 CCH Consumer Credit Guide 1f 30,-707, Thomas J. O\u2019Connell, General Counsel of the Federal Reserve Board, stated :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-5\">\u201c[Y]ou inquire whether the failure to allow interest on escrow deposits under a real estate mortgage should be reflected in the finance charge disclosed under Regulation Z. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-6\">\u201cSection 226.4(e) . . . specifically excludes escrow deposits of the type you describe from the finance charge. In addition, although \u00a7 226.8(e) . . . provides that certain \u2018required deposit balances\u2019 must be excluded before determining the \u2018amount financed\u2019 (which would result in their being reflected in a higher annual percentage rate), that section specifically provides that it does not apply to escrow accounts of the type covered by \u00a7 226.4(e) .... By these two provisions it was the Board\u2019s intention to allow computation of the annual percentage rate on real estate mortgages without regard to whether escrows were required, and by extension, without regard to whether interest was paid on those deposits. Consequently, it is the staff\u2019s view that neither the requirement of escrow deposits, nor the failure to pay interest on them, must be reflected in the annual percentage rate or finance charges disclosed under Truth-In-Lending.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1024-10\">Similar conclusions have been expressed in Public Information Letters by J. L. Robertson, Vice-Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, the Board member given specific responsibility for Truth-In-Lending (Letter No. 265, February 24, 1970) and by Griffith L. Garwood, then Chief of the Truth-In-Lending Section (Letter No. 580, March 8, 1972). 4 CCH Consumer Credit Guide K 30,518 and 1f 30,820.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-13\">As recently as May 25, 1973, in another Public Information Letter, 4 CCII Consumer Credit Guide If 30,980, the Federal Reserve Board Staff reiterated its position. It was there stated :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-14\">\u201c . . . The Regulation, however,' does not provide that the loss of interest on an escrow account represents a charge for the credit transaction to the customer. Under the same line of reasoning, the Regulation provides in \u00a7 226.4(f) . . . that interest or dividends paid by a creditor on a customer\u2019s deposits or investments held by the creditor shall <em>not </em>be deducted from the amount of the finance charge or taken into consideration when computing the annual percentage rate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-17\">\u201cBy these provisions, it was the Board\u2019s intention to allow computation of the annual percentage rate on real estate mortgages without regard to whether escrows were required, and by extension, without regard to whether intei\u2019est was paid on those deposits. Consequently, neither the requirement of escrow deposits, nor the failure to pay the interest on them, must be reflected in the annual percentage rate or finance charges disclosed under Truth in Lending.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-18\">\u201cIt might be noted that the Act allows a creditor to round the annual percentage rate to the nearest quarter of 1%, so that it is unlikely that the effect of the failure to pay interest on escrow accounts would require a higher annual- percentage rate to be disclosed in most cases (See \u00a7 226.5(b)) . . . . Also any disclosures taking into account the lack of escrow interest would often soon become inaccurate because such disclosures would be based upon the escrow requirements at the time the transaction is entered into, while the amount required for escrowed items typically continues to increase during the life of the mortgage as taxes increase. Finally, viewing such lost interest as a finance charge would further complicate already complicated disclosures perhaps to the consumer\u2019s detriment, and would certainly increase the burden to the creditor.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
