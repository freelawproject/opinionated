Williams against Judge Alfonso C. Sepe, was terminated by the district court\u2019s granting summary judgment to Judge Sepe on the ground that the undisputed facts did not fall within the \u201cclear absence of all juris-, diction\u201d exception to the doctrine of judicial immunity. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-21\">The record clearly establishes that in attempting to investigate a report that Williams had misrepresented himself as the Judge\u2019s law clerk, Judge Sepe failed to comply with the procedure for prosecuting an indirect contempt' of court. Specifically, Williams was not given \u201cwritten notice of the criminal contempt charged,\u201d as required by Rule 3.840 of the Florida Rules of Criminal Procedure, 33 F.S.A., before he was ordered arrested by Judge Sepe. It is Williams\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>contention that the deviation from the statutory procedure resulted in an absence of subject matter jurisdiction and that the Judge, therefore, is not shielded by judicial immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\"> While it may be true that the procedural irregularities would necessitate a reversal of a conviction if one had been obtained on the facts of this case, see, e. g., State ex rel. Giblin v. Sullivan, 1946, 157 Fla. 496, 26 So.2d 509, the test for the abrogation of judicial immunity is whether there is a <em>clear </em>absence of all jurisdiction over the subject matter. Bradley v. Fisher, 1872, 13 Wall. 335, 80 U.S. 335, 20 L.Ed. 646. The policy underlying the doctrine requires that its application not depend on the determination of \u201cnice questions of jurisdiction.\u201d Sullivan v. Kelleher, 1 Cir. 1968, 405 F. 2d 486, 487. The defects in the procedure employed in this case will not support a conclusion that there was a clear absence of all jurisdiction. The judgment of the district court is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"AXW\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
