See 200 N.L.R.B. No. 19. The Board cross-petitions for enforcement. The refusal to bargain is admitted. Ramada's attack is on the Board\u2019s selection of an appropriate bargaining unit in an election conducted under \u00a7 9 of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-33\">Our decision in Westward-Ho Hotel Company v. National Labor Relations Board, 437 F.2d 1110 (9th Cir. 1971), is dispositive of this case and requires that the Board\u2019s order be set aside. The Board asks us to reexamine our position in <em>Westward-Ho </em>in light of the Board\u2019s asserted policy of applying the same standards for unit determinations in hotel and motel cases as are applied in other industries. We find such a reexamination unnecessary. Even assuming that the Board has further modified its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1335\">*1335</page-number>standards for unit determinations in the hotel industry, a review of the Board\u2019s decisions convinces us that it has not modified its established policy of single unit representation of manual employees in a highly integrated hotel operation where there is no local bargaining pattern of separate unit representation. The reasons assigned for the Board\u2019s unit determination in this case are insufficient to justify deviation from that policy. We are forced to the conclusion that the extent of union organization was the controlling factor. This is prohibited by \u00a7 9(c)(5) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 159(c)(5). Westward-Ho Hotel Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1403-4\">The Board\u2019s order is set aside. Enforcement is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
