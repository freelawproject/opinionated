Appellant Brown in 1967, and appellant Johnson in 1963, were committed as \u201cdependent wards of the court,\u201d 11 D.C.Code \u00a7 1551 (1967), by what was then called the District of Columbia Juvenile Court. Pursuant to their commitments, appellants were eventually sent to the Cedar Knolls School, a facility for delinquent youths. After the D.C. Court Reorganization Plan of 1970, Pub.L. 91-358, 84 Stat. 473, those designated \u201cneglected children\u201d (the new statute\u2019s equivalent of \u201cdependent wards\u201d) could not be confined in the same facility as \u201cdelinquent children.\u201d 16 D.C.Code 2320(b). As a result, Judge Braman of the D.C. Superior Court ordered, <em>sua sponte, </em>a hearing regarding the continued detention of appellants, and others similarly situated, at Cedar Knolls. In a hearing before Judge Ryan of the Family Division of the Superior Court, appellants were recommitted for two years as \u201cChildren In Need of Supervision\u201d (CINS), and sent to the Maple Glen School. (The CINS classification was created under the Court Reorganization Act as an intermediate category between \u201cneglected\u201d and \u201cdelinquent\u201d children. 16 D.C.Code \u00a7 2301.) Apellants were not notified of the hearing, nor were they present. They, and several others, were \u201crepresented\u201d by an attorney who had been appointed shortly before the hearing, and who acquiesced in all the CINS dispositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-14\">Appellants then filed writs of habeas corpus in D.C. Superior Court alleging that their CINS commitments were in violation of their constitutional and statutory rights. The Superior Court dismissed their writs. On appeal, the D.C. Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal. It found that the hearing which classified appellants as CINS \u201cwas one not required by law,\u201d and therefore they \u201cmust be viewed as continuing in the [dependent ward] status previously determined by the Juvenile Court.\u201d I.B. v. D.C. Dep\u2019t of Human Resources, D.C.App., 287 A.2d 827, 829-830 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-15\">Appellants next moved for writs of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that their commitments as CINS were in violation of their fifth amendment rights to notice and their sixth amendment rights to be present at the hearing. The District Court sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1212\">*1212</page-number>marily denied their writs without stating its reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-4\"> We affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of appellants\u2019 petitions because their constitutional claims are unavailing in light of the decision by the D.C. Court of Appeals. -Appellants maintain that they continued to suffer harm as a result of the CINS adjudication, despite the D.C. Court of Appeals -decision. They contend that they were confined in a facility in which they could not hav.e otherwise been kept, and appellant Brown claims that her commitment was extended seven and one half months because of the order issued pursuant to the hearing. The proper remedy in these circumstances, as the opinion of the D.C. Court of Appeals noted, was \u201can appropriate action delineating the issues\u201d in Superior Court. 287 A.2d at 830. In any event, appellants suffer no present harm cognizable by a writ of habeas corpus. The two year commitments ordered at the inoperative CINS hearing have now lapsed. And, since their CINS status was invalidated by the D.C. Court, they can suffer no adverse \u201ccollateral consequences\u201d as a result of that designation. <em>See </em>Carafas v. LaVallee, 391 U.S. 234, 88 S.Ct. 1556, 20 L.Ed.2d 554 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
