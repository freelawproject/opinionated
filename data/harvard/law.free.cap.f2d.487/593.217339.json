Mem. 1972-80, permitting appellant taxpayers to deduct one-third of the expense incurred by Mr. Coker in commuting by car to and from his job as a carpenter and shop steward at a construction site.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This deduction was held to be proper because Mr. Coker was required to carry his carpentry tools with him each day when driving between his home and the job site, and under this court\u2019s decision in Sullivan v. Commissioner, 368 F.2d 1007 (1966), a taxpayer may deduct from his commuting expenses an appropriate percentage allocable to the transportation of his tools.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-23\">On June 25, however, the Supreme Court affirmed a contrary decision of the Fifth Circuit and thereby resolved a conflict among the circuits on this <em>issue</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>by holding that commuting expenses are not deductible merely \u201cbecause by happenstance the taxpayer must carry incidentals of his occupation with him.\u201d Fausner v. Commissioner, 413 U.S. 838, 93 S.Ct. 2820, 37 L.Ed.2d 996 (1973) (per curiam). The Court did leave open the possibility that an appropriate amount may be deducted if \u201cadditional expenses\u201d are \u201cincurred for transporting job-required tools and material to and from work.\u201d (Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b662-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>In view of the intervening decision in <em>Fausner, </em>we grant the Government\u2019s petition for a rehearing and reverse the decision of the Tax Court insofar as it permits the Cokers to deduct part of Mr. Coker\u2019s commuting expenses. <em>Fausner </em>clearly overrules <em>Sullivan, </em>and holds that none of the commuting costs are deductible when, as in this case, the taxpayer would have used his automobile in any event. In addition, the Cokers presented no evidence to the Tax Court remotely suggesting that any additional expense was incurred because of the necessity of transporting Mr.^Coker\u2019s tools.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">The judgment is modified in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b661-17\">. We also rejected the Cokers\u2019 appeals from the Tax Court, in which they contended that they should be permitted to deduct all commuting expenses, rather than just one-third. The Cokers have petitioned for rehearing of that portion of the opinion denying their claim. We adhere to our prior holding on this point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b661-24\">. Compare Fausner v. Commissioner, 472 F.2d 561 (5th Cir. 1973), with Sullivan v. Commissioner, 368 F.2d 1007 (2d Cir. 1966), and Tyne v. Commissioner, 385 F.2d 40 (7th Cir. 1967), after remand, 409 F.2d 485 (7th Cir.), cert denied, 396 U.S. 833, 90 S.Ct. 88, 24 L.E'd.2d 83 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
