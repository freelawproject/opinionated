JOSEPH SMITH, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1075-11\">This is an appeal from denial of a petition by a state prisoner for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Irving Ben Cooper, <em>Judge. </em>We find error and remand for hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-12\">Perhaps the most difficult aspect of this case is the circumstance that its critical events occurred either before or . during what can .fairly be called a revolution in the rights of the indigent accused. Fortunately, recent legislative and judicial rules insure that criminal defendants receive the full panoply of constitutional rights. Accordingly, cases such as this, in which denials of the most fundamental rights are alleged, are largely confined to collateral attacks on trials conducted years ago. Nevertheless, when confronted with one of these anachronistic cases, a reviewing court must make certain that the accused was afforded all of the rights to which he was then entitled \u2014 even those which may not have been fully articulated until after his opportunity to invoke them. Because we believe the record in this case does not clearly demonstrate that petitioner was aware of all of his rights, we find it necessary to remand for a further hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-17\">Petitioner Nathaniel Williams was convicted of four counts of rape in New York State Supreme Court, New York County, on March 19, 1965. On May 10, 1965, he was sentenced by the trial judge, The Honorable Charles Marks, J. S. C., to a prison term of ten to twenty years. At the time of his sentencing, Williams was not advised by the court that he had a right to appeal his conviction <em>in forma pauperis, </em>that a notice of appeal had to be filed within thirty days, or that he had the right to appointed appellate counsel. As we shall discuss below, this absence of notice was the standard procedure in the New York courts in 1965. Even indigent defendants were not informed of their appellate rights or of how to exercise them. Rather, the prevailing law put the obligation to 'so inform a convicted defendant on the individual\u2019s trial counsel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1076-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>In this case, that appears to have been an exceedingly poor choice. At trial, Williams had been represented by an attorney retained by his wife, one John R. Sanders. Just prior to his sentencing, Sanders informed Williams, who was indigent,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that an appeal of his conviction would cost seven thousand dollars. Thereafter, contrary to all legal ethics, Sanders abandoned Williams entirely.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We must base this sordid account of legal malfeasance on the testimony of petitioner, since Sanders was subsequently disbarred for other unrelated unethical conduct, left the state, and could not be produced to testify.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1076-4\">In opposing this application for a writ of habeas corpus, which would do no more than restore Williams\u2019 right to appeal, the state stresses his admission that within two days of his sentencing a fellow inmate advised him of his right to appeal, in the words of the state\u2019s attorney, \u201cwithout paying any money.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, Williams denied that this jailhouse advice ever included any information about his right to appointed appellate counsel or the critical thirty-day time limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-11\">Undoubtedly confused by the conflicting advice of his private and jailhouse attorneys, Williams wrote to Sanders as late as May 21;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Sanders, true to form, never responded. At a state <em>coram nob-is </em>hearing held in 1968, Williams testified that by the end of May he had decided to attempt an appeal on his own and did, in fact, prepare his own appeal notices. At that hearing, Williams alleged that his attempts to mail the notices before the June 10th deadline were frustrated by prison officials. Not surprisingly, those officials categorically denied this serious charge; and the <em>cor-am nobis </em>judge, again Justice Marks, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1009\">*1009</page-number>clearly decided the factual question of official interference against Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-5\">In any event, Williams further stated that he did eventually deposit unstamped notice forms in the Sing Sing postal box on June 9, 1965 \u2014 the day he was transferred from Sing Sing to Attica.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He claims that it was not until August of 1965 that he learned \u2014 in response to his request for a trial transcript as part of his <em>pro se </em>appeal \u2014 that no notice forms, timely or otherwise, had ever been received. <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Since then, Williams has repeatedly attempted to have his right to appeal restored in both the state and federal courts.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1077-6\">For our purposes, the most important of these unsuccessful attempts was the <em>coram nobis </em>determination made in 1969. Following an evidentiary hearing held in the fall of 1968, Justice Marks \u2014on April 17, 1969 \u2014 denied the application in a brief opinion which focused, as did the hearing, on the question of official interference. Justice Marks\u2019 only finding with respect to Williams\u2019 knowledge of his appellate rights stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-7\">Even conceding defendant\u2019s indigence, his alleged ignorance of his right to appeal as a poor person was cured when he arrived at Sing Sing Prison on May 12, 1965. Defendant testified to this at the hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1077-13\">The <em>coram nobis </em>judge thus made no specific finding that Williams was ever advised of his right to appointed appellate counsel or of the thirty-day time limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-14\">After further exhausting his state remedies,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Williams'brought this habeas petition. In denying the petition without a hearing, Judge Cooper summarized the findings of Justice Marks and, based on the <em>coram nobis </em>record, concluded that Williams knew of his appeal rights:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"asz-dedup-0\">We find petitioner\u2019s failure to appeal either wilful, knowing or the result of his own negligence. He has failed completely to show any deprivation of a constitutional right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1077-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-16\">The primary question before us is whether, given all the facts and circumstances of this case, Judge Cooper placed undue reliance on the finding of Justice Marks. However, before we can consider that question, there is a preliminary issue that must be laid to rest: That is, the relevance of the underlying claims, petitioner will raise in his state appeal, if his right to appeal is restored. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>The state, citing two New York cases involving defendants who had pleaded guilty,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> suggests that this factor is relevant here. But as this and other federal courts have repeatedly held, the underlying merits have no bearing on the question of restoring fundamental appellate rights where they have been wrongfully denied. United States ex rel. Ran-dazzo v. Follette, 444 F.2d 625, 627-628 (2d Cir. 1971), cert, denied, 404 U.S. 916, 92 S.Ct. 232, 30 L.Ed.2d 191 (1971); United States ex rel. Smith v. McMann, 417 F.2d 648, 654 (2d Cir. 1969) (en banc), cert, denied, 397 U.S. 925, 90 S.Ct. 929, 25 L.Ed.2d 105 (1970); United States ex rel. Singleton v. Woods, 440 F,2d 835, 838 (7th Cir. 1971); Wilbur v. State of Maine, 421 F.2d 1327, 1330 (1st Cir. 1970). Cf. Rodriquez v. United States, 395 U.S. 327, 89 S.Ct. 1715, 23 L.Ed.2d 340 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-7\">Conversely, it is, of course, equally true that should\u2019 the district court determine that petitioner is entitled to have his appeal rights restored, it will in no way reflect on the merits of that appeal. At this juncture, the federal courts are concerned only with the fundamental constitutional question of whether or not Williams was deprived of his rights on appeal \u2014 most notably, his right to appointed appellate counsel. Douglas v. California, 372 U.S. 353, 83 S.Ct. 814, 9 L.Ed.2d 811 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-14\">In support of Judge Cooper\u2019s reliance on Justice Marks\u2019 finding, the state correctly contends that, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in LaVallee v. Delle Rose, 410 U.S. 690, 93 S.Ct. 1203, 35 L. Ed.2d 637 (1973), the habeas court must accord such prior state findings great weight. <em>See also, </em>United States ex rel. Cole v. Mancusi, 429 F.2d 61, 65-66 (2d Cir. 1970), cert, denied, 401 U.S. 957, 91 S.Ct. 982, 28 L.Ed.2d 240 (1971); United States ex rel. Liss v. Mancusi, 427 F. 2d 225, 227 (2d Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-15\">However, it is equally true that the habeas court must itself insure that the relevant facts were found and that the correct legal standard was applied to them.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) (1, 3, 6-8); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>Townsend v. Sa\u00edn, 372 U.S. 293, 312-319, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.E.d.2d 770 (1963). It is only where \u201cit can scarcely be doubted\u201d that the relevant factual issues have been resolved against the petitioner <em>and </em>that \u201cthere is no evidence that the state trier utilized the wrong [legal] standard,\u201d that \u00a7 2254 requires the ha-beas court to dismiss a subsequent petition without an independent evidentiary hearing. LaVallee v. Delle Rose, 410 U.S. 690, 692, 695, 93 S.Ct. 1203, 35 L.Ed.2d 637 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-5\">Here we believe that the state judge \u2014through absolutely no fault of his own \u2014did not focus, and did not make specific findings, on factual questions which have subsequently emerged \u2022 as critical to petitioner\u2019s case. As a matter of law, logic, and reality, there were three distinct pieces of information that Williams \u2014 eoncededly an indigent \u2014 needed to effectuate his right to appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1079-6\">1. That he could appeal <em>in forma pauperis.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1079-7\">2. That he could obtain appointed appellate counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1079-8\">3. That he had to file his appeal within thirty days.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1079-9\">In determining whether Justice Marks meant to attribute each of these separate pieces of information to Williams in his cryptic finding that Williams knew he could appeal \u201cas a poor person,\u201d we must remember some relatively important dates in New York legal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-10\">First, as noted above, we must recall that when Williams was sentenced in 1965, no New York judge would have thought himself obligated to advise a convicted defendant of his rights to appeal <em>in forma pauperis </em>and to appointed appellate counsel. In 1965, if that obligation existed at all, it resided with the trial attorney. Indeed, in 1964, the New York Court of Appeals had even refused to restore the appellate rights of defendants whose counsel had promised, yet failed, to file timely notice. People v. Marchese, 14 N.Y.2d 695, 249 N.Y.S.2d 888, 198 N.E.2d 916 (1964); People v. Kling, 14 N.Y.2d 571, 248 N.Y.S.2d 661, 198 N.E.2d 46 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-14\">Such was the law in 1965 when Williams was-tried and sentenced; and such was the law in the fall of 1968 when his <em>coram nobis </em>hearing was held. Since, in the fall of 1968, only a finding of official interference would restore lost appeal rights, it is not surprising that Williams pinned his hopes on such a claim. Indeed in the fall of 1968, Williams\u2019 lack of knowledge and the malfeasance of his attorney were largely irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-15\">However, on February 27, 1969 \u2014 four months after the completion of the <em>cor-am nobis </em>hearing, but two months before Justice Marks\u2019 opinion \u2014 the New York Court of Appeals overturned Marchese and Kling. People v. Callaway, 24 N.Y.2d 127, 299 N.Y.S.2d 154, 247 N.E.2d 128 (1969). And, in a companion case, People v. Montgomery, 24 N.Y.2d 130, 299 N.Y.S.2d 156, 247 N.E. 2d 130 (1969), the court put the burden of advising defendants of their appeal rights squarely on the state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1079-16\"><em>The time has come for us to announce clearly that every defendant has a fundamental right to appeal his conviction and that, accordingly, basic fairness and due process require that the right not be dissipated either because the defendant was unaware of its existence or counsel failed to abide </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number><em>by a promise to either file or prosecute an appeal. </em>This determination in no way indicates that courts should or can attempt to second guess counsel. Our decision, very simply, demonstrates a fundamental concern that defendants be informed of their right to appeal, and that, where an attorney, whether assigned or retained, fails to apprise his client of his vital privilege, there is no justification for making the defendant suffer for his attorney\u2019s failing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1080-4\">The same result is required if this defendant\u2019s claim is analyzed in terms of equal protection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1080-5\">Since the State has provided an absolute right to seek review in criminal prosecutions it constitutionally follows that an indigent defendant cannot be deprived of this review simply because of his poverty. The condition precedent to appellate review. of a criminal prosecution is the filing of a notice of appeal. It is apparent that the 30-day period in which an appeal must be docketed is a critical time for the defendant. It cannot be successfully argued that an indigent defendant does not have the right to counsel at this stage of his proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1080-6\">It is not clear that, at the time this defendant was convicted, there was any positive obligation imposed on assigned counsel to inform defendants of their right to appeal. Presently, the rules of the Appellate Divisions do provide such an obligation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1080-7\">\n<em>Even with this obligation, however, we do not believe that an indigent defendant can lose his right to appeal simply because the State delegates its responsibility .to a member of the Bar to pass along the requisite information. The courts are the surrogates of the State\u2019s responsibility in this field. An indigent defendant cannot lose his right to appeal simply because the courts have deputized a lawyer to fulfill the function and he has failed properly to carry out his duties.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1080-8\">The petitioner, because of his indi-gency, was compelled in this case to accept the assistance of court-appointed counsel. He claims his counsel did not inform him of his right to appeal. Without such advice this petitioner, who had no previous experience with the law, could not be expected to file' a notice of appeal. <em>There is no question that the primary duty of furnishing legal advice to indigent defendants is a State responsibility. </em>Either by permitting assigned counsel\u2019s role to terminate at the end of trial, or failing to provide safeguards against lack of information, the State permitted a critical time period to lapse of which the defendant was unaware. Since, this lack of awareness occurred because of the defendant\u2019s poverty, he must be accorded a hearing to determine whether in fact no one informed him of his right to appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1080-10\">24 N.Y.2d 130, 132-134, 299 N.Y.S.2d 156, 159-161, 247 N.E.2d 130, 132 (1969) [citations omitted; emphasis added].</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-11\">We have'quoted <em>Montgomery </em>almost <em>in toto </em>not only for what it says, but also to demonstrate what it does not say. Most notably, it does not hold that, as part of their responsibility to an indigent with private counsel, a trial court must advise such a defendant of his right to different, appointed appellate counsel. And it is, therefore, quite reasonable to assume that when, in April of 1969, Justice Marks found that Williams knew he could appeal \u201cas a poor person,\u201d the state judge did not intend to imply any finding that Williams further knew of his right to appointed appellate counsel. It was not until October 10, 1969 \u2014 \u2022 some six months after Justice Marks\u2019 decision \u2014 that this court declared that even in 1965 the State of New York had been obligated, as a necessary consequence of Douglas v. California, 372 U.S. 353, 83 S.Ct. 814, 9 L.Ed.2d 811 (1963), to insure that every indigent defendant was informed of his right to appointed appellate counsel. In United States ex rel. Smith v. McMann, 417 F.2d 648 (2d Cir. 1969) (en banc), cert, denied, 397 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>925, 90 S.Ct. 929, 25 L.Ed.2d 105 (1970), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-5\">We think the only practical, logical and fair interpretation to be given to Douglas v. California is that it imposes upon the state a duty to warn every person convicted of crime of his right to appeal and his right to prosecute his appeal without expense to him by counsel appointed by the state, if he is indigent. The right to appeal at the expense of the state is mere illusion if the convicted indigent defendant does not know such a right exists. And the one way to make sure that he does know is to tell him so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1081-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-7\">Moreover, we were careful to hold in <em>Smith </em>that even the presence of retained counsel did not remove this burden from the state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-8\">We need not inquire, nor is it of any relevance to the decision of this appeal, whether the prisoner\u2019s counsel, retained or assigned, was competent or not competent, or whether he thought the appeal if taken would be successful or dismissed as frivolous. We are dealing here with the duty of the State of New York to afford constitutional protection to the prisoner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8o\"><em>Id. </em>at 655.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-9\">It is against this backdrop of the changing law that we must decide whether it can realistically be said that Justice Marks\u2019 brief finding that Williams knew he could appeal \u201cas a poor person\u201d necessarily implies that Williams also knew he had a right to appointed appellate counsel. For as this court stated in <em>Smith, </em>the right to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>and the right to appointed counsel are distinct:.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-10\">Thus the critical findings in this case must be: Was [the defendant] indigent at the time he was sentenced by the New York State court? And, was [the defendant] informed or did he know prior to the expiration of his time to appeal that he could appeal without cost to himself <em>and </em>with counsel appointed by the state?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1081-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 655. [emphasis added]</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-12\">First, it must be noted that an appeal \u201cas a poor person\u201d is roughly the linguistic equivalent of an appeal <em>in forma pauperis. </em>Yet as suggested in <em>Smith, </em>the right to appeal without paying normal court fees is something very different from the further right to a free attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-13\">Were this linguistic equivalence our only evidence that the state <em>coram nobis </em>finding encompasses no more than the right to appeal <em>in forma pauperis, </em>we might permit the broader interpretation that Williams also knew of his right to appointed counsel. But. in the finding itself, there is unmistakable evidence that such a broader interpretation is incorrect. For the sake of clarity, let us repeat exactly what Justice Marks found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-14\">Even conceding defendant\u2019s indigence, his alleged ignorance of his right to appeal as a poor person was cured when he arrived at Sing Sing Prison on May 12, 1965. <em>Defendant testified to this at the hearing,</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1081-15\">[emphasis added].</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-16\">However, a careful review of the <em>cor-am nobis </em>record indicates that while Williams did testify that he had been advised that he could appeal \u201cwithout paying any money,\u201d he had, on cross-examination, categorically denied that this information had included his right to appointed appellate counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-17\">Q. Are you telling this Court that you understood in May of 1965, that the only lawyer that you could have as your lawyer was Mr. Sanders ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-18\">Mr. Feldman: Objection, your Hon- or. It is argumentative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-19\">The Court: I will let him answer. Is that what you understood?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-20\">* * * -X- * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-21\">A. I didn\u2019t understand anything, to tell you the truth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-22\">Q. You didn\u2019t understand anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-23\">A. I didn\u2019t understand anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1082-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number>Q. Were you aware of the existence, in May of 1965, of the Legal Aid Society?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1082-4\">A. I wasn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1082-5\">Transcript at 53-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-6\">Of course, Justice Marks was not bound to accept Williams\u2019 account. But the fact that the state judge explicitly based his finding on. Williams\u2019 own testimony \u2014 together with the fact that <em>Smith </em>did not articulate the rule on advising defendants of their right to appointed appellate counsel until after Justice Marks\u2019 decision \u2014 certainly suggests that he did not intend his finding to include timely knowledge of the right to counsel.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Similarly, Justice Marks made no finding that Williams knew of the thirty-day time limit \u2014 again, despite Williams\u2019 clear testimony that he did not.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1082-7\">In sum, we believe that there is substantial doubt that the state judge here, unaware of a legal standard yet to be announced, made any finding adverse to the petitioner on the critical questions of whether he had timely knowledge of his right to appointed appellate counsel or of the thirty-day time limit. We must, therefore, remand to the district court for an evidentiary hearing on these unresolved issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-16\"> In so doing, we wish to note that only in a relatively small number of cases will a prisoner be able to raise a credible claim that he was not advised of his right to free appellate counsel. Since Smith v. McMann, the trial courts have routinely so advised convicted defendants at the time of their sentencing.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> And even before <em>Smith, </em>the rules of practice and legal ethics raise a clear presumption that a defendant with ethical counsel was given such advice. Here, of course, petitioner\u2019s testimony and the subsequent disbarment of his attorney rebut that presumption and put the burden on the state to show that, as Smith v. McMann\u2019 requires, the indigent petitioner knew, yet waived, his fundamental right to appointed appellate counsel.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> If the state cannot meet this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>burden, the district court must act to restore petitioner\u2019s right to appeal.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1083-4\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1075-13\">. Appellant cites the 1968 version of what is now 22 New York Codes, Rules and Regulations \u00a7 606.5. In relevant part, the 1968 version provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1075-14\">Where there has been a conviction after trial or otherwise ... it shall be the duty of counsel, retained or assigned, and of the public defender, immediately after the pronouncement of sentence to advise the defendant in writing of his right to appeal, the time limitations involved, in the manner of instituting an appeal and of obtaining a transcript of the testimony, and of the right of a person who is unable to pay the cost of an appeal to apply for leave to appeal as a poor person.

However, a review of prior compilations of the rele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>vant court rules suggests that any such earlier version was substantially revised in 1967 to take the form quoted above. <em>See generally, </em>Rules of the Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department, reproduced in Civil Practice Annual of New York (1964 through 1967). <em>But, see, </em>Leon Polsky, Representation of Defendants, 36 F.R.D. 129, 154 (1964) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1076-6\">[The First Department has proposed, though not yet adopted, a ruling] that it is the obligation of an assigned counsel to inquire of his client whether or not he wishes to appeal and that he must advise him in writing of his right to appeal, and it is counsel\u2019s obligation to file a notice of appeal on behalf of his client if the client so requests.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1076-7\">In any event, whether or not there was such a legal duty on counsel in 1965 is far less important than the fact that there was no such obligation on the courts. Moreover, there is substantial evidence that whatever legal or ethical duty Williams\u2019 counsel had to advise his client, he failed to meet it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1076-8\">.

It is undisputed that on July 6, 1965, Williams petitioned for a transcript of his trial.

On May 12, 1966, Justice Marks rejected, as a matter of law, Williams\u2019 claim that he had been misled by Sanders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-11\">We think this prior adjudication by the same state judge is significant for three reasons. First, it rebuts any suggestion that Williams fabricated his account of Sanders\u2019 malfeasance only after learning of his former counsel\u2019s disbarment. In May of 1966, Sanders was a practicing attorney in New York. Secondly, it suggests that the state\u2019s inability to produce Sanders in 1968 was due to its own negligence in not questioning him in 1966 when he was well within the court\u2019s jurisdiction. Finally, the 1966 decision is significant in that Justice Marks \u2014 citing <em>M\u00e1rchese </em>and <em>Kling </em>\u2014 clearly embraced the then existing but, as it has now developed, invalid view that only official interference could lead to the restoration of lost appeal rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-18\">This initial ruling by Justice Marks was subsequently reversed by the Appellate Division, to the extent of granting Williams an evidentiary hearing.

Since we find that here there was not even such . a minimal finding of knowledge of the specific right to appointed appellate counsel, we need not consider this matter directly. We wish to note, however, that other courts conducting the type of inquiry the district court will hold on remand have looked to a number of factors \u2014 most notably, the experience of the defendant with criminal procedure and the eventual timing of his appeal \u2014 in determining whether- the initial failure to appeal constituted a \u201cknowing and intelligent\u201d waiver. <em>Compare, </em>Bartley v.

The dissent\u2019s suggestion that Williams should be remanded to the state courts for further exhaustion of his state remedies deserves some comment. First, it should be noted that far from raising the exhaustion requirement before either this or the district court, the state has emphatically maintained that Williams has pursued every conceivable state remedy in attempting to have his appeal rights restored. In his affidavit to the district court, counsel for the state swore that \u201cWilliams has already exhausted his present contention in numerous, repetitive state court proceedings.\u201d This averment, which referred the court to <em>\u201cat least </em>six, separate state court proceedings,\u201d is significant, since exhaustion is not jurisdictional and may therefore be waived where the state is willing to litigate the petitioner\u2019s claim in federal court. Tolg v. Grimes, 355 F.2d 92, 97 (5th Cir. 1966), cert, denied, 384 U.S. 988, 86 S.Ct. 1887, 16 L.Ed.2d 1005 (1966) ; Hines v. Baker, 422 F.2d 1002, 1004 n. 1 (10th Cir. 1970) ; Jenkins v. Fitzberger, 440 F.2d 1188, 1189 (4th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-7\">Secondly, apart from this waiver, we believe that Williams has sufficiently exhausted his state remedies. The dissent cites six cases for the proposition that after a significant change in criminal constitution law, the state courts must be given an opportunity to reconsider their rejection of a prisoner\u2019s prior petition. But each of these decisions is inapposite because in each the fundamental change in the law occurred well after the final consideration by the state courts. Pennsylvania ex rel. Raymond v. Rundle, 339 F.2d 598 (3rd Cir. 1964) ; Blair v. California, 340 F.2d 741, 743-744 (9th Cir. 1965); United States ex rel. Walker v. Fogliani, 343 F.2d 43, 45 (9th Cir. 1965) ; United States ex rel. Sloan v. McMann, 415 F.2d 275, 276 (2d Cir. 1969); James v. Copinger, 428 F. 2d 235, 241-242 (4th .Cir. 1970) ; Donlavey v. Smith, 432 F.2d 940, 941 (5th Cir. 1970). Here, by contrast, Justice Marks\u2019 decision was affirmed by the Appellate Division \u2014 and further review by the New York Court of Appeals was denied \u2014 some six months after <em>Smith </em>clarified the applicable legal standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-9\">Finally, it must be remembered that the exhaustion doctrine will not be invoked where it would result in a fundamental injustice. <em>See, e. g., </em>Thomas v. Cunningham, 335 F.2d 67, 69-70 (4th Cir. 1964) ; United States ex rel. Graham v. Mancusi, 457 F.2d 463, 468 (2d Cir. 1972). It seems appropriate to note that Williams has already spent eight years in fairly constant litigation in seeking no more than his right to appeal. The one state review at issue here took more than four years. Furthermore, it must also be remembered that under New York law the mere consideration of a second <em>coram nobis </em>petition based on substantially similar grounds is a matter entrusted to the trial judge\u2019s discretion. People v. Mazzella, 13 N.Y.2d 997, 245 N.Y.S.2d 6, 194 N.E.2d 835 (1963) ; People v. Sullivan, 4 N.Y.2d 472, 176 N.Y.S.2d 316 (1958) ; N.Y.Crim. Pro. Law \u00a7 440.20(3) (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-10\">Thus, if we send Williams back to the state courts, we may be asking him to spend additional years litigating his right to file a second <em>coram nobis </em>petition in order to seek the restoration of his right to appeal his conviction. In view of the fact that Williams has already done everything he could to assert his claim in the state courts, we think such an order \u201cmight well invite the reproach that it is the prisoner rather than the state remedy that is being exhausted.\u201d United States ex rel. Kling v. LaVallee, 2 Cir., 306 F.2d 199, 203 (Friendly, -J., concurring).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"AWt\">MULLIGAN, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Afms\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"AQtn\">The majority here holds that the New York State <em>coram, nobis </em>proceeding is not dispositive because the judge who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>conducted the evidentiary hearing and wrote the opinion applied the wrong constitutional standard. The majority says that, in the fall of 1968, the state of the law in New York was such that \u201conly a finding of official interference would restore lost appeal rights;\u201d that Williams therefore \u201cpinned his hopes\u201d on his claim that prison officials interfered with his right to appeal; and that Williams\u2019 \u201clack of knowledge [of his appeal rights] and the malfeasance of his attorney\u201d were largely irrelevant. Hence, the majority concludes that Justice Marks did not focus on the factual questions now in issue since they only emerged as critical subsequently, with the issuance of our opinion in United States ex rel. Smith v. McMann, 417 F. 2d 648 (2d Cir. 1969) (en banc), cert, denied, 397 U.S. 925, 90 S.Ct. 929, 25 L. Ed.2d 105 (1970). The argument runs that since the proper constitutional standard had not been articulated until after the state hearing and after the opinion of Justice Marks was filed, our state court brother could hardly have been able to apply it. If the majority is correct in this position, then I submit that the proper relief in this case is a dismissal of the petition rather than a remand to the district court for a further evidentiary hearing. This is so because if the majority is correct in its analysis, the state court did not have a \u201cfair opportunity\u201d to consider the constitutional defect, and petitioner has thus not exhausted his state remedies. Picard v. Connor, 404 U.S. 270, 276, 92 S. Ct. 509, 30 L.Ed.2d 438 (1971); United States ex rel. Nelson v. Zelker, 465 F.2d 1121 (2d Cir.), cert, denied, 409 U.S. 1045, 93 S.Ct. 544, 34 L.Ed.2d 497 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-4\">In Blair v. California, 340 F.2d 741 (9th Cir. 1965), the basis of petitioner\u2019s claim was, like that of petitioner Williams here, that his rights with respect to assigned counsel on appeal of his conviction in the state court had been denied. Blair had raised this claim in his state proceedings, but his contention had been rejected. In the federal habeas proceeding, Blair relied on Douglas v. California, 372 U.S. 353, 83 S.Ct. 814, 9 L.Ed.2d 811 (1963), the seminal case which held that indigent defendants have a right to assigned counsel on appeal. Since <em>Douglas </em>was decided after the denial of his state claim, the circuit court held that his constitutional right to counsel had not been passed on by the state court, that he therefore had not exhausted his state remedies and that if he did not proceed within 90 days in the state court, his petition should be dismissed. This doctrine has been recognized in a number of other cases. See Donlavey v. Smith, 432 F.2d 940 (5th Cir. 1970) (per curiam); James v. Cop-inger, 428 F.2d 235 (4th Cir. 1970); United States ex rel. Sloan v. McMann, 415 F.2d 275 (2d Cir. 1969); United States ex rel. Walker v. Fogliani, 343 F. 2d 43 (9th Cir. 1965); Comment, Ha-beas Corpus \u2014 Effect of Supreme Court Change in Law on Exhaustion of State Remedies Requisite to Federal Habeas Corpus, 113 U.Pa.L.Rev. 1303 (1965). In Pennsylvania ex rel. Raymond v. Rundle, 339 F.2d 598 (3rd Cir. 1964) (per curiam), the court stated the basis upon which this doctrine rests:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1084-6\">[A] decent regard for the position and responsibilities of the state courts requires that they be afforded an opportunity to consider and decide these questions before the federal district court is called upon to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1084-7\">Id. at 599.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-8\">The circuit court there simply dismissed the petition without conditions. The same result is mandated here if the majority thesis is sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-9\">If, on the other hand, the issue of Williams\u2019 knowledge or lack of knowledge of the thirty-day time limitation and the right to \u2022 free counsel was squarely placed before the state court, I do not think that my brothers have here accorded the state court decision the respect to which it is entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-10\">In Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963), the Supreme Court stated that \u201cthe coequal responsibilities of state and federal judges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>in the administration of federal constitutional law are such that we think the district judge may, in the ordinary case in which there has been no articulation [of the governing legal standard], properly assume that the state trier of fact applied correct standards of federal law to the facts, in the absence of evidence . . . that there is reason to suspect that an incorrect standard was in fact applied.\u201d Id. at 314-315, 83 S.Ct. at 758 (footnote omitted). The Court\u2019s recent reversal of this court in LaVallee v. Delle Rose, 410 U.S. 690, 93 S.Ct. 1203, 35 L.Ed.2d 637 (1973) (per curiam) emphasizes our obligation to recognize the state courts as coequal and not inferior tribunals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-6\">It is necessary to inquire as to what evidence my brothers in the majority find to overcome the presumption that the state court recognized the proper standard to be applied. The first claim is that the state court could not have known the proper standard because our opinion in <em>Smith </em>had not as yet been published. However, as we have pointed out, this mandates dismissal of the petition. Even if that were not so, I do not think that <em>Smith </em>is controlling here. The history of the right of the indigent to free counsel from <em>Douglas </em>to <em>Smith </em>is set forth in the majority opinion. It was not until <em>Smith </em>that a federal court held that, as a necessary corollary of <em>Douglas, </em>the State of New York had the obligation, even in 1965, to advise an indigent client of his right to assigned counsel. However, the New York Court of Appeals in People v. Montgomery, 24 N.Y.2d 130, 299 N.Y.S.2d 156, 247 N.E. 2d 130 (1969), in the words of the majority, put the burden of advising defendants of their appeal rights squarely on the state. This case was decided after the state coram nobis proceeding in this case but two months before Justice Marks rendered his opinion. Since it was a sharp departure from the prior practice of the state courts, which had placed the onus on trial counsel to advise convicted indigent defendants of their appellate rights, we must assume that the case did not escape the attention of an experienced state trial judge who was then bound to advise defendants of their rights to appeal as indigents. The majority, however, says that <em>Montgomery </em>\u201cdoes not hold that, as part of their responsibility to an indigent with private counsel, a trial court must advise such a defendant of his right to different, appointed appellate counsel.\u201d Since this precise proposition was not before the Court of Appeals, it was of course not \u201cheld,\u201d but I cannot accept the conclusion that it was not necessarily implicit in the holding of the state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-8\">The Rules of the Appellate Division, First Department, in effect when Justice Marks rendered his decision and when he conducted the evidentiary hearing, specified that it was the obligation of trial counsel, <em>retained or assigned </em>to advise a defendant who was unable to pay the cost of an appeal of his rights to apply for leave to appeal as a poor person.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Montgomery </em>shifted that burden from counsel to the court. I cannot assume that the burden on the court was any less than that which had been on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1018\">*1018</page-number>counsel, and, therefore, the state court would have known that Williams was entitled to be advised of his right to free assigned counsel whether he had retained counsel on trial or not. The right of a defendant to be advised of his right to appeal as a poor person obviously does not depend upon some presumption that, since he could afford to retain trial counsel, he could afford appellate counsel and was stuck with him on appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The distinction here proffered is too precious, and I cannot accept that <em>Montgomery </em>can reasonably be interpreted so academically. Judge Friendly, in his dissenting opinion in <em>Smith, </em>observed :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1086-4\">Today\u2019s ruling may not be of great practical importance with respect to New York prisoners in light of Judge Keating\u2019s sweeping language in People v. Montgomery . . . which the majority applauds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1086-6\">417 F.2d at 659.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-7\">In any event, the State here does not contend that Williams was ever advised by the court or by counsel of his right to appeal as an indigent. The claim is made that, either at the detention center in New York City or at Sing Sing Prison, he was so advised by jailhouse lawyers and that therefore he knew of his rights. <em>Smith </em>makes it abundantly clear that the critical question in cases such as this is \u201cwas [the defendant] informed or <em>did he know </em>prior to the expiration of his time to appeal that he could appeal without cost to himself and with counsel appointed by the state?\u201d 417 F.2d at 655 (emphasis added). See also United States ex rel. Roldan v. Follette, 450 F. 2d 514, 516 (2d Cir. 1971); United States ex rel. Witt v. LaVallee, 424 F.2d 421, 423-24 (2d Cir. 1970) (en banc). <em>Douglas </em>held that the indigent defendant had the right to free counsel on appeal, and, while <em>Montgomery </em>and <em>Smith </em>held that the obligation to advise the indigent rests on the State, the position of the State here is that, if in fact Williams knew that he had the right to free counsel, the question of whether or not he was officially advised is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-10\">To establish that Justice Marks did not focus on Williams\u2019 right to free counsel on appeal, the majority emphasizes the last sentence of the pertinent portion of his opinion. He held that Williams\u2019 ignorance of his right to appeal as a poor person was cured when he arrived at Sing Sing Prison on May 12, 1965. The court stated: \u201cDefendant testified to this at the hearing.\u201d But, says the majority here, Williams denied at his state evidentiary hearing that he knew he could have any counsel on appeal other than his retained trial counsel. Reference is then made to the <em>cor-am nobis </em>hearing, in which Williams did testify: \u201cI didn\u2019t understand anything, to tell the truth.\u201d Justice Marks, who not only had the opportunity to observe the defendant at the evidentiary hearing, but also was the judge at trial, during which Williams was independently identified as a rapist by four of his victims, obviously had the right to find this testimony incredible. Williams\u2019 story that he was denied stamps to mail his notice of appeal was demonstrated to be a total fabrication, and this placed his credibility \u2018 seriously in doubt. Moreover, the state judge was not required to articulate credibility findings in his opinion. LaVallee v. Delle Rose, <em>supra, </em>410 U.S. at 692, 93 S.Ct. 1203.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-11\">Williams further testified that he did know from jailhouse lawyers that he could appeal \u201cwithout paying any money.\u201d The majority interprets this as an admission only that he knew he could appeal without paying court costs. He did know something of significance, therefore, even on the assumption of the majority. Since any prisoner knows that the major and primary cost of an appeal is counsel fees, I cannot agree that his answer is susceptible to the lim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number>ited interpretation of the majority. Justice Marks could well have found that his answer meant what it said, and that when Williams testified that he knew he could appeal without paying money, he meant free counsel as well as free costs. It certainly does not fulfill the petitioner\u2019s burden \u201cto establish in the District Court by <em>convincing evidence </em>that the state court\u2019s determination was erroneous.\u201d Lavallee v. Delle Rose, <em>supra, </em>410 U.S. at 695, 93 S.Ct. at 1206 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-4\">The majority\u2019s only other evidence that Justice Marks did not address himself to Williams\u2019 right to free counsel on appeal is the language of his opinion finding that Williams knew of his right to appeal as \u201ca poor person.\u201d This is found to be linguistically equivalent to <em>\u201cin forma pauperis,\u201d </em>and, it is said, since the broad right to free counsel on appeal was only enunciated in <em>Smith, </em>the state court\u2019s use of the poor person terminology could not have been intended to indicate a finding that Williams knew his appeal rights had to be exercised within thirty days and included free counsel.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This is pure <em>petitio principii. Douglas </em>had already enunciated the rights of an indigent on appeal and <em>Montgomery </em>was the precursor of <em>Smith.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1087-5\">Aside from this, the majority must assume that Williams\u2019 claim was that he did not know of the time limit or the free appeal (else we must dismiss for lack of state exhaustion of remedies). How can we assume that the <em>coram nob-is </em>judge did not address himself to those contentions? On the contrary, the following colloquy between Williams\u2019 counsel and Justice Marks indicates that he did:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1087-10\">And it is claimed he was denied his constitutional rights to counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1087-11\">And may I further submit that the fact that the defendant may have been informed about certain of his legal rights does not necessarily mean that he knew that he had a right to appeal, that he had a right to appeal as a poor person, and that he had 30 days in which to file a notice of appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1087-12\">THE COURT: Those are the questions which the Court will have to try.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1087-13\">The majority properly insists that as a matter of law, logic and reality, an indigent needs three distinct pieces of information to effectuate his right to appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-14\">1) that he could appeal <em>in forma pau-peris,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1087-15\">2) that he could obtain appointed appellate counsel,</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-16\">3) that he had to file his appeal in thirty days.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1088-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number>I totally agree. It is so clearly logical that it could not have escaped the attention of the state court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Adu\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1085-9\">. The Rules of the Appellate Division, First Department provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1085-10\">(b) <em>Notification of right to appeal. </em>(1) <em>After conviction and sentence. </em>Where there has been a conviction after trial or otherwise ... it shall be the duty of counsel, <em>retained or assigned, </em>and of the public defender, immediately after the pronouncement of sentence or the service of a copy of the order disposing of the application in the nature of a writ of error coram nobis or a writ of habeas corpus, to advise the defendant in writing of his right to appeal, the time limitations involved, the manner of instituting an appeal and of obtaining a transcript of the testimony, <em>and of the right of a person who is unable to pay the cost of an appeal to apply for leave to appeal as a poor person. </em>It shall also be the duty of such counsel to ascertain whether defendant wishes to appeal and, if so, to serve and file the necessary notice of appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1085-12\">22 New York Codes, Rules &amp; Regs. \u00a7 606.5 (1968) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1086-8\">. As Judge Medina indicated in <em>Smith, </em>the only practical method of handling the problem is to require that notification of the right of a poor person on appeal be given to indigents and non-indigents alike. 417 F.2d at 654 n. 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1087-6\">. While the term <em>\u201cin forma pauperis\u201d </em>initially referred only to the right to sue \u201cwithout liability for costs\u201d (Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 895 (Rev. 4th ed. 1968)), the term has assumed a much broader meaning since <em>Douglas. </em>Buie 32(a)(2) of our own Buies of Criminal Procedure provides that the court \u201cshall advise the defendant of his right to appeal and of the right of a person who is unable to pay the cost of an appeal to apply for leave to appeal in <em>forma pauperis.\" </em>The rule does not mention free counsel. However, in Johnson v. Norton, 435 F.2d 842, 843 (1st Cir. 1970), the court said: \u201cthe trial court did not inform [defendant] of his right of appeal from his conviction and, if indigent, to court-appointed counsel, as required by Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(a)(2).\u201d In <em>Smith, </em>Judge Medina stated that the New York and the federal rules \u201cdo no more than implement what we think was at all times implicit in the landmark case of Douglas v. California.\u201d 417 F.2d at 655. <em>Douglas </em>held that the appointment of counsel on appeal for the indigent was constitutionally mandated. <em>Montgomery </em>and <em>Smith </em>simply put the onus on the state to so advise the indigent. As we have pointed out, that is not in contention here. The State only claims that Williams knew of this right.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1087-18\">. The majority position that Justice Marks made no finding that Williams knew of the \u25a0 thirty-day time limit is not substantial, as footnote 15 suggests. If Justice Marks found, in the view of the majority, that Williams knew that he did have the right to appeal without costs, it must have been obvious that that information was totally worthless if he was unaware that he had to exercise this right in timely fashion. A specific finding to this effect is not necessary. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number>Townsend v. Sain, <em>supra, </em>372 U.S. at 314, 83 S.Ct. 745. Further, in <em>Montgomery </em>Judge Keating had emphasized the importance of the time question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1088-12\">The condition precedent to appellate review of a criminal prosecution is the filing of a notice of appeal. It is apparent that the 30-day period in which an appeal must be docketed is a critical time for the defendant. It cannot be successfully argued that an indigent defendant does not have the right to counsel at this stage of his proceedings (see Hamilton v. Alabama, 368 U.S. 52, 82 S.Ct. 157, 7 L.Ed.2d 114).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1088-13\">24 N.Y.2d at 133, 299 N.Y.S.2d at 160, 247 N.E.2d at 132.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1088-14\">. With respect to the argument in footnote 18 of the majority opinion: I agree that Williams made largely the same contentions in the state court as he makes here in the federal courts, although they were of course all made prior to <em>Smith. </em>The holding of the majority, however, that the <em>coram nobis </em>court did not apply the proper federal constitutional criterion since it had not yet been articulated, prompted the counter-argument that the petition should therefore be dismissed for failure to exhaust. If the majority\u2019s position is that the affirmance of the <em>coram nobis </em>decision by the Appellate Division and the denial of review by the Court of Appeals were <em>post-Smith </em>and therefore meaningful, then the argument that the state court could not have applied the proper constitutional criterion evanesces. It must be assumed on this theory that the New York appellate courts considered that the <em>Smith </em>criteria had been applied and were satisfied. The majority cannot have it both ways. <em>Ilaec reputent, videbunt.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
