Defendant received gifts of meat products from the hands of employees of a firm whose products he was assigned to inspect. There was no proof that the employees themselves were engaged in commerce. In United States v. Seuss, 1 Cir., 1973, 474 F.2d 385, cert, denied, 412 U.S. 928, 93 S.Ct. 2751, 37 L.Ed.2d 155, we upheld, after extensive analysis, the validity of section 622, and its applicability to a substantially identical fact situation. We would have affirmed the present conviction without opinion on the government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance pursuant to Local Rule 12, except that we feel obliged to comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-19\">In <em>Seuss </em>we stated that employees of a firm engaged in commerce were included in the statutory term \u201cperson [s] . engaged in commerce\u201d in section 622. Defendant argues that this language in <em>Seuss </em>should not govern because his offenses were less extensive than those of Seuss. It is true that defendant was acquitted on some counts of his indictment (alleged gifts of money, as distinguished from meat products), but to argue that the statutory interpretation in <em>Seuss </em>is here inapplicable because Seuss was \u201ca more flagrant and serious offender,\u201d and was also convicted of conspiracy, is an inexcusable attempt to confuse differences in the number of offenses with differences in the qualitative acts and circumstances of each offense. Examination of the <em>Seuss </em>opinion refutes any thought that these purported distinctions are of conceivable moment. As a final irrelevancy, defendant refers to the fact that in <em>Seuss </em>evidence was given indicating that Seuss had violated federal sampling procedures, whereas here the government failed to show defendant \u201crendered a quid pro quo by way of lessening his diligence.\u201d Such a showing was relevant to Seuss\u2019 conspiracy offense. In this prosecution there is no such issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-21\">Equally unsupportable is defendant\u2019s position on a question asked of a government witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-22\">\u201cQ. Mr. Scalesse, on what facts did you rely in making these payments of money to Inspector Forgione <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>from August 28, 1968 to and including October 15, 1968 ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">When defendant\u2019s objection had been overruled, the witness answered,</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">\u201cA. So that we wouldn\u2019t be held up or slowed up in any production. That is the reason we made these payments and those are the facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Review of thirty pages of bench conferences preceding the framing of this question discloses that the defense agreed that it was relevant whether \u201cany facts existed which entitled this defendant to the $100 a week,\u201d but stated that it would object to questions calling for the witness\u2019 \u201cstate of mind,\u201d or his \u201creasons\u201d for making the payments. The objection to \u201creasons,\u201d as best we can discover, was that they might reflect the witness\u2019 \u201cstate of mind\u201d rather than \u201cfacts.\u201d When, following this discussion, the question was asked in terms of facts, defendant objected, but did not explain. Now he argues that the question was \u201cclearly erroneous for the reason that the question called for facts not within the witness\u2019 knowledge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">Nothing could be clearer than that the question did not \u201ccall\u201d for facts of which witness lacked personal knowledge. True, it was broad enough to permit them. This is an objection to form, which could have been cured, if made. It is elementary that it is now too late. <em>See, e. g., </em>5A Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00a7 46.02, at 1904 (1971); Roberts v. United States, 3 Cir., 1963, 316 F.2d 489, at 497; Reck v. Pacific-Atlantic S. S. Co., 2 Cir., 1950, 180 F.2d 866, 870; <em>cf. </em>New York, N. H. &amp; H. R. Co. v. Zermani, 1 Cir., 1952, 200 F.2d 240, 245, cert, denied, 345 U.S. 917, 73 S.Ct. 729, 97 L.Ed. 1351.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">Parenthetically, whatever possible defect there might have been in this question, we would find it difficult to see what is left of defendant\u2019s objection after the court, by unobjected-to questions at the close of the examination, brought out the basic fact that there was no reason for the alleged payments other than the facts that defendant was an inspector and had requested them. But, however that may be, defendant faces a more serious difficulty. He was acquitted on all the counts on which the question bore. He thus finds himself compelled to argue that the answer to a question which proved to have no direct consequences somehow carried the day in an area to which it did not relate. Even to state this contention would seem to answer it. We find unpersuasive defendant\u2019s suggestion that the jury\u2019s view of the entire case may have been colored by this one answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">Unsupportable, too, is defendant\u2019s objection to the fact that a government witness\u2019 explanation of his conduct involved a reference to criminal acts (if established) other than those for which defendant was on trial. Again, it is elementary that evidence of other criminal acts, inadmissible to prove the defendant\u2019s bad character, is admissible when of independent relevancy. We are not taken by defendant\u2019s plea that the correctness of United States v. Jones, 7 Cir., 1971, 438 F.2d 461, is an open question in this circuit. <em>See </em>United States v. Plante, 1 Cir., 1973, 472 F.2d 829, at 831, cert, denied, 411 U.S. 950, 93 S.Ct. 1932, 36 L.Ed.2d 411; Dirring v. United States, 1 Cir., 1964, 328 F.2d 512, 514-515, cert, denied, 377 U.S. 1003, 84 S.Ct. 1939, 12 L.Ed.2d 1052.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-11\">We see no need to devote space to demonstrate the lack of merit in defendant\u2019s complaint that the \u201cjury may have been confused whether a government witness used certain papers as past recollection recorded or present recollection refreshed,\u201d and that the court abused its discretion in permitting leading questions. As to the former we can best quote Professor Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed. 1970) \u00a7 755, that such distinctions tend to become \u201cvain quibbles, having no relation to probative value.\u201d The witness evidenced no more confusion than any lay witness might. We see no error, and no possible prejudice if there were one. As to the latter, the questions, if leading at all, were routinely within the court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>We recognize, we hope fully, the right, indeed the duty, of counsel to resolve all issues of any possible doubt in favor of his client, and to be a vigorous, sometimes even abrasive advocate. See discussion in In re Samuel A. Bithoney, 1 Cir., 1973, 486 F.2d 319. In the case of appointed, as distinguished from, as here, retained counsel, we have recognized the heightened dilemma of being caught between an unreasoning client and counsel\u2019s own good judgment. <em>See </em>Belbin v. Picard, 1 Cir., 1972, 454 F.2d 202, at 204. But there must be a limit. In re Samuel A. Bithoney, ante; United States v. Plante, ante, 472 F.2d at 833; <em>cf. </em>Anders v. California, 1967, 386 U.S. 738, at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493. The empty contentions made in the present case go far beyond that limit. We publish this opinion not because of any contribution it makes to the law, but so that the bar may be in no doubt as to our views.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed, and, pursuant to Local Rule 17, it is ordered that defendant\u2019s bail be terminated forthwith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
