The lower court dismissed the action for failure of the complaint to state a claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>upon which relief could be granted, We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-3\">Appellant\u2019s claims grow out of his indictment, trial and conviction by a jury of the crime of depositing in a United States Post Office an envelope containing a communication that thr\u00e9atened to injure the persons of those in charge of the Adjudication Division of the Veterans Administration Center, Togus, Maine. [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 876]. Appellee Sharpe was the sheriff of Cumberland County, Maine where appellant was incarcerated while awaiting sentencing in the United States District Court. Ap-pellee Miller was Sharpe\u2019s deputy. Ap-pellee Brennan represented appellant in the early stages of the prosecution. Ap-pellee Connellan was appellant\u2019s attorney during the trial. Appellee Guy Gan-nett Publishing Company is the publisher of the Portland Press Herald, a newspaper.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">We consider appellant\u2019s arguments <em>se-riatim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">CLAIMS AGAINST SHARPE &amp; MILLER</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">In substance, appellant attempts to charge Sharpe and Miller with: (1) failure to provide proper medical care; (2) failure to provide law books; and (3) with censorship of mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">(1) We are impressed with the rule stated in Church v. Hegstrom, 416 F.2d 449 (C.A.2 1969), i. e. that a denial of medical care to a prisoner is actionable under \u00a7 1983 only if the complaint alleges: (1) either an intent to harm the inmate, or (2) an injury or illness so severe or obvious as to require medical attention. Mere negligence, in the absence of conduct which shocks the conscience, in giving- or failing to supply medical treatment to prisoners will not suffice. Church v. Hegstrom, <em>swpra. </em>We search in vain for anything in the complaint which would bring appellant within the rule stated in <em>Hegstrom. </em>Martinez v. Mancusi, 443 F.2d 921 (C.A.2 1970), reaffirms the doctrine enunciated in <em>Hegs-trom.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">(2) The claim of unavailability of law books has even less merit. Under no stretch of the imagination is a county sheriff, or his subordinates, required to supply law books. Hatfield v. Bailleux, 290 F.2d 632 (C.A.9 1961). Needless to say, an entirely different issue would be presented if we were faced with an allegation that law books were available and that appellant was refused access. We are not here concerned with issues like those presented in Gilmore v. Lynch, 319 F.Supp. 105 (N.D.Cal.1970), aff\u2019d sub nom., 404 U.S. 15, 92 S.Ct. 250, 30 L. Ed.2d 142 (1971), featuring jailhouse lawyers and in Johnson v. Avery, 393 U.S. 483, 89 S.Ct. 747, 21 L.Ed.2d 718 (1969), presenting similar issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">(3) On the charge of mail eonsorship, the appellant seems to be playing with words. The closest' he comes to a factual statement is that he wrote two letters to a Boston attorney, that the letters were censored and that the attorney never received them. He does not charge that appellees censored the letters or that they were in any way responsible for the failure of delivery. Moreover, the complaint makes it clear that appellee Brennan was then representing the appellant as his attorney. The letters were not addressed to Brennan. Obviously, appellant suffered no harm by reason of the failure of the letters to reach an attorney who was in no way associated in the defense. Our holding on this issue in no way limits or detracts from the expressions of this court on the same general subject in Smith v. Robbins, 454 F.2d 696 (C.A.1 1972); Nolan v. Scafati, 430 F.2d 548 (C.A.1 1970); Tyree v. Fitzpatrick, 325 F.Supp. 554 (D.Mass.1971), aff\u2019d. 445 F.2d 627 (C.A.l 1971), and Nolan v. Fitzpatrick, 451 F.2d 545 (C.A.l 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">CLAIMS AGAINST BRENNAN</p>\n<p id=\"b637-12\">Appellee Brennan was appellant\u2019s court appointed attorney on October 5, 1970, when appellant withdrew his previously entered plea of not guilty and agreed in open court that the arraignment and further prosecution on the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>dictment would be postponed and appellant placed on informal probation for a period of two years under the usual conditions. At the time, the United States Attorney indicated that upon successful completion of the informal probation period, the indictment would be dismissed. Appellant was unable to live up to the conditions of the probation and on February 26, 1971, was again before the court for arraignment. He requested new counsel. However, on investigation, the court found that he was financially able to employ his own attorney. On March 18th, the informal probation was terminated. Appellant was then arraigned and entered a plea of not guilty. He charges Brennan with \u201ctortious malpractice\u201d in recommending acceptance of the informal probation. He says that on the revocation of the \u201cunofficial probation\u201d: \u201c . . . [H]e was quite disturbed to learn for the first time that the procedure was not authorized by federal statute.\u201d Evidently, in proceeding under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985, appellant is of the impression that an appointed attorney representing a client in the defense of a criminal charge in federal court is acting under color of state law, within the meaning of the statute. He cites no authority and we find none which supports this view. To the contrary, even under state court appointments, the courts have uniformly held that ah attorney, whether appointed or retained, is not acting under color of law. Szijarto v. Legeman, 466 F.2d 864 (C.A.9 1972); French v. Corrigan, 432 F.2d 1211, 1214 (C.A.7 1970), cert, denied 401 U.S. 915, 91 S.Ct. 890, 27 L. Ed.2d 814 (1971); Mulligan v. Schlachter, 389 F.2d 231, 233 (C.A.6 1968); Kregger v. Posner, 248 F.Supp. 804, 806 (E.D.Mich.1966). Appellant\u2019s contention that Brennan .conspired with the United States Attorney is conclusory only and completely devoid of an allegation of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Additionally, even assuming that Brennan was an officer acting under color of state authority, the vague charges in the complaint defy intelligent analysis and do not state a claim on which relief can be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">CLAIMS AGAINST CONNELLAN</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">After the probation was revoked in February, 1971, appellee Connellan, an attorney,\\was engaged to defend appellant. Connellan is likewise charged with \u201ctortious malpractice.\u201d What we have said about the Brennan claim with reference to it not being subject to the provisions of either 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 or 1985, is equally applicable to the claim against appellee Connellan. Simply stated, the complaint does not state a claim against appellee under either section. A detailed statement of the charges would serve no useful purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">CLAIM AGAINST GUY GANNETT PUBLISHING COMPANY</p>\n<p id=\"b638-10\">In substance, appellant claims that: (1) Gannett suppressed judicial scandals in Maine and New Hampshire, although he does not allege the facts disclosing the alleged scandals; (2) appel-lee assured appellant that it would have a reporter available for his trial on July 12, 1971, and that such a reporter was not present; (3) although there was no reporter present, the appellee printed a story in its newspaper which was \u201ccolored\u201d in that it did not, in fact, cover the trial and suppressed the facts with reference to law book deficiencies and appellant\u2019s other claims; (4) appellee did not get its story from covering the trial with a reporter, but from an interview with the United States Attorney which did not report all of the facts with reference to the theory of his defense; and (5) that Gannett was guilty of \u201ctortious misuse, abuse, non-use, and with improperly safeguarding the appellant\u2019s rights in connection with the publication of the material on his trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-12\">The most that can be said of the charges against Gannett is that it may have been careless in not having a reporter present and may have been negligent in failing to report appellant\u2019s contentions. We find nothing in the charges which would even remotely sug<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>gest a claim of actual malice. Gannett\u2019s First Amendment rights preclude a recovery unless actual malice is alleged. New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 279, 283-284, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L. Ed.2d 686 (1964), and its progeny. The complaint does not state a claim, civil rights or otherwise, against Gannett.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">CONCLUSIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Utilizing, as we must, the well established rule that appellant\u2019s <em>pro se </em>complaint must be liberally construed, we find nothing in it which even remotely states a claim against any one or more of the appellees. Accordingly, the judgment of the lower court must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
