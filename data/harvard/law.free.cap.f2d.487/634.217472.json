A. \u00a7 844(e). He urges that four errors by the court below require reversal: (1) that Cox\u2019s confession given to United States Special Agents was erroneously admitted due to its involuntary nature; (2) that the court erred in refusing to grant a mistrial following prejudicial testimony of a Government witness to the effect that Cox was a convicted felon; (3) that the trial court\u2019s failure to specifically instruct the jury to disregard the prejudicial portion of the Government witness\u2019 testimony constituted error; and (4) that the court erroneously overruled an objection to the testimony of another Government witness regarding a previous telephone threat made by Cox. Finding each objection unmeritorious, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">On April 3, 1972, the switchboard operator at the Reserve Life Insurance Company in Dallas, Texas, received a telephone call conveying an ominous message: \u201cA bomb will go off in one hour if you don\u2019t get rid of Connie Pate.\u201d Fortunately, the threat proved to be a hoax. On the morning of April 6, 1972, two Special Agents went to the Dallas City jail to interview David Cox, the defendant, in connection with an unrelated offense involving a violation of federal firearms regulations. At the outset of this interview, the agents advised Cox of his rights and obtained from him a signed waiver. The ensuing interrogation related exclusively to the alleged firearms violation, and no reference was made to the telephone threat of April 3. At approximately 5:00 P.M. on the same day, the two agents returned to Cox\u2019s cell and questioned him concerning the bomb threat. At this time, the officers again advised Cox of his rights and obtained a signed waiver, which was subsequently lost or destroyed. During the course of this interview, Cox confessed that he made the unlawful call.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">At the time of the second interview, Cox appeared nervous and restless to the interrogators, which prompted Special Agent Arnold to inquire whether the defendant was perhaps \u201cstrung out.\u201d Cox apparently indicated to the agents that he had been under medication for asthma and that his arrest had prevented further access to prescribed drugs. However, Cox at no time during the interrogation indicated any desire to terminate the interview, nor did he complain of any discomfort except to inform the agents as they were leaving that he was cold. The agents were persuaded that Cox was coherent and rational since he was fully able to carry on a lengthy conversation after having expressly waived his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">During the course of Cox\u2019s trial, the two agents testified with respect to the defendant\u2019s jail-cell confession over the objection that the statement was rendered involuntary by Cox\u2019s drug-influenced condition. Further, during cross-examination, Agent Griffin stated that the first interview with Cox on April 6 was in connection with the offense of \u201cPossession of a Firearms [sic] By a Convicted Felon.\u201d This description erroneously related the exact nature of the pending charge against Cox, since the relevant offense did not pertain simply to possession of firearms by convicted felons.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Cox\u2019s prompt objection to that portion of the testimony concerning the defendant\u2019s being a convicted felon was sustained by the court, and the jury was instructed upon counsel\u2019s request to disregard the statement. The defendant thereupon moved unsuccessfully for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>mistrial on the grounds of the prejudicial nature of the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">Later in the trial, the Government called Mrs. Mattie Evelyn Carson, Connie Pate\u2019s mother, who testified that the defendant had previously telephoned her and threatened to kill several persons, including Connie. This testimony was allowed over Cox\u2019s objection that Mrs. Carson was relating an account as to \u201cextraneous acts\u201d which were highly prejudicial to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">\n<em>Admissibility of Cox\u2019s Confession</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">On appeal, Cox invokes a wholly inapplicable principle of law in attacking the court\u2019s finding of voluntariness. He contends that the Government failed to prove with \u201cunmistakable clarity\u201d that the confession was voluntary, as required by Sims v. Georgia, 1967, 385 U. S. 538, 87 S.Ct. 639, 17 L.Ed.2d 593. <em>Sims </em>is singularly inapposite to the case <em>sub judice </em>inasmuch as that decision simply required that the <em>judge\u2019s conclusion </em>of voluntariness appear with unmistakable clarity on the record. 385 U.S. at 544, 87 S.Ct. 639.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\"><em>Sims </em>aside, t'he relevant standard governing proof of voluntariness was enunciated by the Supreme Court in Lego v. Twomey, 1972, 404 U.S. 477, 92 S.Ct. 619, 30 L.Ed.2d 618, which held that the Government\u2019s burden in such cases is to prove voluntariness by a preponderance of the evidence, not beyond a reasonable doubt. 404 U.S. at 489, 92 S.Ct. 619.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">Turning to the evidence adduced at trial, three pertinent facts are somewhat supportive of Cox\u2019s position. Unlike the results of the first interview with the defendant on April 6, the Government was unable to produce the written waiver of rights which Cox signed at the outset of the afternoon interview. Second, and more importantly, Cox appeared nervous and restless during the interview, causing one agent to inquire of Cox whether he was \u201cstrung out.\u201d Finally, certain details, e. g., the cost of the telephone call, related by Cox in his confession were not substantiated by the Government, and, indeed, considerable doubt as to their accuracy was raised at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-10\">The Government\u2019s evidence, on the other hand, showed that Cox was fully informed of his rights and signed the waiver form. Throughout the lengthy interview, which Cox' never sought to terminate, the defendant appeared fully coherent and rational. Moreover, Cox at no time complained of nervousness or incapacity or that his restlessness affected his comprehension.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-11\">Under the <em>Lego </em>standard, it seems clear that the Government carried its burden. Cox\u2019s apparent nervousness was not so severe as to prevent his coherent participation in the interview or even to elicit a complaint from the defendant concerning his state of mind. In this regard, this Court recently held in a similar case that the defendant\u2019s complaint to FBI interviewers of mild symptoms resulting from withdrawal from methadone did not support a conclusion that the defendant was so incapacitated as to render his statement involuntary. United States v. Harvey, 5 Cir. 1973, 483 F.2d 448. Moreover, even assuming the falsity of certain details related by Cox, these inaccuracies could have been intentional, or could have stemmed simply from a faulty recollection of specific details. It strains credulity to suggest that such immaterial discrepancies as the cost of the telephone call contained in a detailed confession strongly indicates the involuntary nature of the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-12\">\n<em>Testimony of Agent Griffin</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b704-13\">When, during cross-examination, Agent Griffin stated that Cox had previously been charged with \u201cPossession of a Firearms by a Convicted Felon,\u201d defense counsel promptly interposed an objection, which the court sustained. Moreover, upon counsel\u2019s request, the court immediately instructed the jury to disregard the contested statement. This instruction, despite Cox\u2019s protestations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>on appeal, was sufficient to accommodate' counsel\u2019s request. Indeed, counsel failed to move for more specific instructions after the court\u2019s charge, electing instead to move for a mistrial. In any event the mistaken response was clearly \u201cinvited by appellants\u2019 own counsel. .\u201d United States v. Pentado, 5 Cir. 1972, 463 F.2d 355, 362, and if there was error we are firmly convinced that the court\u2019s immediate instruction to the jury to disregard the contested portion of Griffin\u2019s statement sufficiently cured the testimony of any prejudicial effect.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">\n<em>Testimony of Mrs. Carson</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ast-dedup-1\">Finally, Cox contends that the court erred in overruling the objection to the testimony of Mrs. Carson regarding Cox\u2019s previous threats against Connie Pate, among others, made to the witness in a telephone conversation. The defendant argues that this testimony related to \u201cextraneous offenses\u201d inasmuch as Cox was threatening to commit homicide in his conversation with Mrs. Carson, whereas during the call which is the subject of the present charge Cox made a false bomb threat. This argument will simply not withstand scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\"> Although otherwise inadmissible to prove criminal propensities or character, evidence of similar acts by a defendant is properly allowed where the proffered testimony tends to demonstrate intent, motive, or a pattern of conduct. See United States v. Goldsmith, 5 Cir. 1973, 483 F.2d 441; United States v. Gossman, 5 Cir. 1972, 455 F. 2d 967; United States v. Pittman, 5 Cir. 1971, 439 F.2d 906. In this case, Mrs. Carson\u2019s testimony tended to prove a pattern of conduct by Cox in engaging in threats by telephone, which is, of course, the basis of the offense charged against him by the Government. Moreover, as the court below properly noted, Mrs. Carson's testimony also tended to prove Cox\u2019s intent or motive in making the bomb threat, a necessary inquiry since 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 844(e) expressly prohibits only willful misconduct. Consequently, despite its probative dangers, the testimony was properly allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-11\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b703-6\">. The exact charge pressed against Cox, although not entirely clear from the record, was apparently \u201cUnlawful possession or receipt of firearms.\u201d Appellant contends that the only act proscribed by the United States Code resembling the alleged offense attributed by Griffin to Cox is \u201cFirearms possessed by a convicted felon,\u201d 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3611, and that the section is completely inapplicable to the circumstances in Cox\u2019s case. Hence, appellant argues that the agent\u2019s reference to \u201cconvicted felon\u201d was completely unnecessary and erroneous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b705-8\">. Our conviction is reinforced by the fact that disposition of a motion for a mistrial is a matter entrusted to the sound discretion of the trial court. United States v. Prit-chard, 5 Cir. 1969, 417 F.2d 327, 328. We cannot agree that the court\u2019s failure to grant the appellant\u2019s motion constituted an abuse of discretion under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
