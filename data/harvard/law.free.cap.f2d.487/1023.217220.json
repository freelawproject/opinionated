Brieant, Jr., J., appellant Michael Farr, along with co-defendants Enriquito Alsondo, Ralph Feola and Henry Rosa, was convicted of assaulting federal narcotics agents engaged in their official duties and conspiring to do so, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 111 and 371.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was sentenced under the Youth Corrections Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5010(b), 4209, and now appeals his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-12\">On July 13, 1973, this court handed down an opinion in the consolidated appeals of Alsondo, Feola and Rosa, United States v. Alsondo, 486 F.2d 1339; that decision recounts the underlying facts with respect to Farr as well as his three associates. Subsequently, we granted the Government\u2019s petition for a rehearing in the cases of Feola and Rosa, and, on the same day as this opinion, modified our earlier opinion. United States v. Alsondo, 486 F.2d 1339 (November 1973). On reconsideration in <em>Alsondo, </em>we left standing our prior reversal of the conspiracy convictions \u2014 a point not challenged by the petition for rehearing \u2014but reinstated the assault convictions. (Alsondo\u2019s substantive convictions had previously been affirmed, at 1346 n. 13 (2d Cir. July 13, 1973), and were not at issue on the rehearing.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-16\">. Our original decision in <em>Alsondo </em>reversed the conspiracy convictions, dismissing the counts, because the rationale of United States v. Crimmins, 123 F.2d 271 (2d Cir. 1941), requires proof of scienter of the federal element of the crime (here, the victims\u2019 identity as government agents), which was lacking in that case. Because of the same evidentiary defect, we likewise reverse Farr\u2019s conviction of conspiring to assault federal officers, and dismiss the charge as to him.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Similarly, for reasons stated in the supplemental <em>Alsondo </em>opinion filed today, we reject Farr\u2019s appeal on the substantive issue and affirm his conviction of assault under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1092-17\">Judgment of conviction for conspiracy reversed and charge dismissed. Judgment of conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111 affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1092-13\">. Alsondo was also convicted of unlawfully carrying a deadly weapon during the commission of a felony, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1092-14\">. The Government\u2019s brief concedes the need to reverse appellant\u2019s conspiracy conviction on the authority of United States v. Alson-do, 486 F.2d 1339 (2d Cir. July 13, 1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1092-19\">. As the trial court stated^ in its charge, Farr and Feola are in the same position since no evidence was adduced that either <em>personally </em>assaulted the officers.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
