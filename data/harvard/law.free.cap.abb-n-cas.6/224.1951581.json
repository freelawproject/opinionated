G-allaudet against William G-. Steinmetz.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-14\">The case was on the calendar June 6 and 7, 1878, but was not called until June 10. Charles Leliva, a witness for defendant, was duly subpoenaed, but did not attend on the 10th or 11th, although he had attended on June 6 and 7. On June 11, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>this case was called for trial, defendant presented to the court the affidavit of Alfred P. Reeves, showing service of subpoena, and of defendant, showing materiality of the absent witness\u2019s testimony, &amp;c., and moved that the trial be postponed on account of his absence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-4\">The motion was denied, defendant excepted, and the trial proceeded and resulted in a verdict for plaintiff by direction of the court, and defendant appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-5\">The defendant\u2019s attorney handed the affidavit of the defendant to the stenographer, and requested him to note the motion, decision and exceptions, in his minutes. The affidavit of said ReeVes was filed in the office of the clerk of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-6\">The stenographer failed to furnish to the defendant\u2019s attorney any minutes of said motion, decision or exception. The attorney having forgotten that he had handed the defendant\u2019s affidavit to the stenographer, made diligent search among his papers for it, but not finding it, made a copy from recollection and embodied it with the motion, decision and exceptions in the case on appeal which he served upon the plaintiff\u2019s attorney. On the settlement of the case in October, 1878, the affidavits, motion, decision and exceptions were stricken out.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-7\">A few days thereafter, the defendant\u2019s attorney obtained the original affidavit from the stenographer, and, upon an examination of his minutes of the trial, found that they contained an account of the motion to postpone, and obtained a copy thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-8\">Thereupon he made a motion for a re-settlement of the case, allowing said affidavits and minutes of motion and exceptions to be embodied in case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-9\">From the order denying this motion, the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b245-10\"><em>E. E. Dana, </em>for defendant, appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKO\">The decision of a motion to put off the trial of a cause is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>conclusive, but may be reviewed either by motion at special term, or by appeal from the judgment (Gregg v. Howe, 37 N. <em>Y. Super. Ct. </em>[J. <em>&amp; </em>S.] 420 ; Howard v. Freeman, 7 <em>Robt. </em>2 ; 3 Abb. <em>Pr. </em>N. S. 292; Martin v. Hicks, 6 Hun, 74; Ogden v. Payne, 5 Cow. 15; Hooker v. Rogers, 6 <em>Id. </em>577; People v. Vermilyea, 7 Id. 369 ; Miller v. Porter, 17 How. Pr. 526 ; Starin v. People, 45 N. Y. 333). The general term has power to review the order appealed from, as it was not a question of discretion, and does affect a substantial right of defendant (Marckwald v. Oceanic Steam Navigation Co., 8 <em>Hun, </em>547; People v. Baker, 35 <em>Barb. </em>106 ; <em>Laws of </em>1873, p. 153, c. 70; <em>Id. </em>p. 239, c. 239; Ryan v. Green, 58 N. <em>Y. </em>295 ; <em>Code of Civ. Pro. </em>\u00a7 263 ; Tweed v. Davis, 1 <em>Hun, </em>252).</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b246-5\"><em>W. W.

The decision made by the learned judge upon the motion of the defendant\u2019s counsel, before the impaneling of the jury, upon affidavits for the postponement of the trial, on the ground of the absence of a material witness, and to which decision an exception was taken, is the subject of review. The defendant may, upon a case containing his exceptions to the decision, move for a new trial at special term, or present the exceptions for review by appeal from the judgment. In either case the affidavits used on the motion properly form a part of the case (Gregg v. Howe, 37 <em>Super. Ct. </em>420). The sufficiency of the affidavits cannot be determined on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">The defendant\u2019s case should be re-settled by incorporating therein the affidavits used on the motion to postpone, and his exceptions. The order appealed from is reversed, with $10 costs, and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
