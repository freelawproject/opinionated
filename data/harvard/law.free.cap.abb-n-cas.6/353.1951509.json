Nehrbas was appointed guardian <em>ad </em>litem, to institute and prosecute the suit for him. The petition for such appointment showed when the plaintiff would come of ageand the complaint specially referred to said petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-8\">Plaintiff, on arriving at majority, in 1875, assumed the management of the cause, continuing it by the same attorneys as before, with whom he remained in constant communication concerning the matter; but no change in the title of the action was made. The cause was tried in March, 1877, and re-tried in April, 1878, at both of which trials the plaintiff was present, and took general control thereof; he also testified there in his own behalf.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-9\">It duly appeared in evidence, on such trials, that plaintiff became of age October 2, 1875.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-10\">Plaintiff was nonsuited, and his exceptions were ordered for hearing at general term, where the same were overruled, with costs against plaintiff. Judgment was entered in favor of defendant, November 13, 1878, for the costs against plaintiff, and execution issued thereon, which the sheriff returned unsatisfied; whereupon payment of such judgment for costs was demanded by defendant, in writing, of said Charles J. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Nehrbas, who had so been appointed plaintiff\u2019s guardian <em>ad litem.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b375-5\"><em>Leonard E. </em>Curtis, for defendant, and the motion.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A34\">I. Mr. Nehrbas is liable, under <em>2 R. S. </em>446, \u00a7 <em>2, </em>for the costs against plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b375-6\">II. If the action by a guardian fails, he is liable to be attached for the non-payment of the <em>costs </em>given against the plaintiff (Grantman <em>v. </em>Thrall, 31 <em>How. Pr. </em>464 ; see same case on another point, 19 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>308).</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b375-7\">III. The guardian <em>ad litem </em>is directly responsible for the costs herein up to time when plaintiff became an adult; for such guardian conducted the proceedings thus far.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b375-8\"><em>Wm. F. </em>PitsTike, for guardian <em>ad </em>litem, opposed.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AU2K\">I. It is only where costs are adjudged against an infant plaintiff, that his guardian is liable therefor <em>(Code of Pro. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 115, 116, 316). The revised statutes, so far as they relate to this subject, have been abrogated (Linner v. Crouse, 61 <em>Barb. </em>289; Grantman <em>v. </em>Thrall, 29 <em>How. Pr. </em>344). In case plaintiff, after majority, continues and loses the suit, the costs are then adjudged against an <em>adult </em>plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b375-9\">II. Defendant\u2019s theory of this motion would give him two persons liable for the costs <em>(i. e., </em>the plaintiff and such ex-guardian). This is unreasonable, and was certainly never intended by the legislature. \u201c On principle, there is no more reason why a defendant should have more security for his costs, when litigating with an infant plaintiff than with an adult plaintiff\u201d (61 <em>Barb, supra).</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b375-10\">III. The point on this motion is settled against defendant, by the authorities, to wit, on arriving at majority, the plaintiff might have repudiated the present suit, and thrown the costs upon his guardian (6 Paige, 53). Plaintiff, by going on after majority, is liable for <em>all </em>the costs of the suit (1 <em>McDaniell Ch. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number><em>Pr. 78, </em>4 ed.), viz., \u201cin the same way, as if the suit had not been instituted until after he was of age\u201d <em>(Cooper Eq. Pl. </em>29). By plaintiff\u2019s proceeding in the cause, after attaining majority, the guardian is discharged from liability; that adopts and <em>affirms </em>the acts of his guardian in bringing the suit, &amp;c., and <em>terminates </em>the guardianship thenceforth (Waring <em>v. </em>Crane, 2 <em>Paige, </em>82; Brown <em>v. </em>Brown, 11 <em>Beav. </em>564). The guardian is liable for none of the costs herein\u2014the guardianship having expired at plaintiff\u2019s majority (October 2, 1875, while the old code was in force), plaintiff thereupon adopting and continuing the cause. Plaintiff is alone liable for these costs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b376-5\">IV. That the title of the action was not changed is unimportant; a mere suggestion of the time of cessation of plaintiff\u2019s infancy, somewhere on the record, sufficed (People <em>ex rel. </em>Baker <em>v. </em>New York Common Pleas, 11 <em>Wend. </em>166).</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b374-11\"> See also Wice v.
