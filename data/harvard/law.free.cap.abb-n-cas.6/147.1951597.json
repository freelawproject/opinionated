That afterwards it was agreed that he should have nine lots, which were selected and designated, and the defendant had offered to convey and tendered a deed thereof, and had at all times been and still was ready and willing to convey them to the plaintiff, but he refused'to receive the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-9\">The jury found specifically that the plaintiff agreed to take in land the commissions for his services in effecting the exchange, and also, that he had selected the lots which he would receive, and in addition thereto gave a general verdict for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-10\">Thereupon the plaintiff made this motion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b168-11\"><em>Thomas M. </em>Tyng, for plaintiff and motion.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b168-12\"><em>Jacob IP.

But, even if specific performance could not be enforced, it does not follow that an action for money will lie against the defendant until he is in default (Burlingame <em>v. </em>Burlingame, 7 <em>Cow. </em>92 ; Lisk <em>v. </em>Sherman, 25 <em>Barb. </em>437; Fort <em>v. </em>Hooding, 9 <em>Id. </em>371, 375; Thomas <em>v. </em>Dickinson, 12 <em>N.

Mr. Bailey having performed his part of the contract and induced the defendant to believe that he did it in pursuance of the contract, cannot now repudiate it and claim money instead of land (Bennett v.

Daly, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AlG\">The plaintiff having agreed, before his commission was earned, that it should be paid him by the conveyance of lots ; having selected the lots he would take; and defendant having duly tendered him a deed thereof ; no action can be maintained by plaintiff for the recovery of his commissions in money. Even though the contract to convey lots in such a case be void under the statute, it is only where the defendant <em>refuses to convey </em>that plaintiff may sue and recover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>for the value of his services. All the cases cited by plaintiff present this feature (7 <em>Cow. </em>92; <em>2 Hill. </em>485 ; 25 <em>Barb. </em>433 ; 32 <em>Id. </em>576 ; 19 <em>N. Y. 299). </em>In the last case, Erben <em>v. </em>Lorillard (19 <em>N. Y. </em>299), it is said that: \u201cThe contract being void and incapable of enforcement in a court of law, the party paying the money or tendering the services in pursuance thereof, may treat it as a nullity, and recover the money or the value of the services. This is the universal rule in cases where the contract is void for any cause not illegal, <em>if the defendant be in </em>default.\u201d The last clause suggests the controlling point in every such case. A parol contract for the conveyance of lands is void but not illegal (Lisk <em>v. </em>Sherman, 25 <em>Barb. </em>438). Had defendant refused to convey the lots plaintiff would then have had the right to disaffirm the contract and recover for his services, because, by reason of its invalidity he could not enforce it against defendant\u2019s objection. The right to disaffirm, however, springs from defendant\u2019s default; without such default no promise can be implied on his part by the law, to pay otherwise than as he has agreed and is willing to pay (Abbott <em>v. </em>Draper, 4 <em>Den. </em>53 ; Dowdle <em>v. </em>Camp, 12 <em>Johns. </em>451).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Motion denied with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
