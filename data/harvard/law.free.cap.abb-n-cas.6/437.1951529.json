Whitney, </em>counsel to the corporation) for the motion.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AiZ\">The only fee which the statute prescribes is a fee of 50 cents. <em>L </em>1840, c. 386, \u00a7 40, repeals \u00a7 33 of tit. 3 of c. 10 <em>of </em>part III. of the Revised Statutes. The provision of <em>L. </em>1840, c. 386, \u00a7 8, is the only one in force (see <em>R S. </em>[6 ed.] \u00a7 26 of c. 10 of tit. 3 of part III. [643]. Also to the same substantial effect, <em>Code Civ. Pro. </em>\u00a7 852)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b458-6\"><em>P. A. Hargous, </em>opposed.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b457-15\"> The fee in question was paid prior to the enactment of the Code of Civil Procedure. The point here determined seems to be confirmed by section 853 of that statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b458-7\">Donohue, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AR_m\">In this case the matter in dispute is small, but as the same principle applies to a number of cases, the corporation desires a formal decision. The item appealed from is the allowance of $1.25 for witness fees on a <em>subpcena duces tecum.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">Prior to the act of 1840, chapter 386, there were two classes of witness fees recognized and paid, the one 25 cents per day for attendance, and the other, under a <em>duces </em>tecum, $1.25. The act of 1840 provided for but one class, including all witnesses, and raised the allowance to 50 cents. That act prohibited any other fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">It necessarily follows, that that is the only fee to be allowed by the act of 1840, that the clerk erred in allowing the $1.25, and that the taxation must be corrected.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
