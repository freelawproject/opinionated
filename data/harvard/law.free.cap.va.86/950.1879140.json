There is no objection to the first count in the indictment, specially; but it is alleged as error, that the second count is defective, in not stating that the offence charged was committed in the county of Wise and state of Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-4\">The indictment is as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-5\">\u201cVirginia\u2014Wise county, to-wit: The jurors of the grand jury of the commonwealth, of Virginia, empaneled and sworn in and for the body of Wise county at a term of the county court of said county, commencing on Tuesday, the 25th day of March, 1890, and now attending upon said court, upon their oaths present that Robert Jones did on the \u2014\u2022 day of-, 18\u2014, in the said county of Wise, with a certain pistol, then and there loaded with gunpowder and leaden bullets, feloniously and maliciously, did shoot one Pat Fugate, then and there being, with intent him the said Pat Fugate then and there to maim, disfigure, disable and kill, against the peace and dignity of the commonwealth of Virginia.
