E. Knopff, 0. G. Knopff and M. M.' Knopff:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1020-19\">\u201c Upon an appeal upon the part of the defendants from an award made by John W. Woolfolk, Wm. IT. Ball and John L. White, freeholders and commissioners appointed by John G. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>Rowe, a justice of the peace for Caroline county, on the application o\u00ed said company, to assess damages, &amp;c., for taking certain land of the defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1021-5\">\u201cThis day came the parties by their attorneys, and the defendants moved the court to quash the proceedings and award, because the notice upon which the award was made sets forth the purposes to be for the condemning land to be hereafter taken, and specifying that it is a motion and proceeding under the 21st section of the charter of said company, and the award of the commissioners assessed damages in taking-gravel from four and a half acres of the land mentioned; whereupon the court sustains said motion to quash, and doth order that said proceedings be dismissed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1021-6\">At the hearing of said motion before the county court, the said C. E., O. G. and M. M. KnopfF, to support same, introduced one. witness, W. H. Ball, one of the said commissioners, and proved by him that said commissioners in assessing the damages in said cause only took into consideration prospective damages, and not anj' past damages, and introduced no other parol evidence. To the introduction of said witness for such purpose only, the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac .railroad company objected, but the court overruled the objection and admitted said evidence, and then, after hearing argument. on both sides, sustained said motion and dismissed said proceedings. To which ruling and judgment of .the court the said railroad company excepted; and thereupon said company presented its petition to the judge of the circuit court of said county for a writ of error, which was refused, and thereupon said railroad eompauy applied to, and obtained from one of the judges of this court a writ of error and <em>supersedeas </em>to said j udgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-7\">In the notice hy which this proceeding was instituted, in-the order made by the justice appointing the commissioners, and in the oath administered by the justice to said commissioners, it distinctly appears that the proceeding was to condemn land, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>and. not to ascertain a fair and reasonable compensation to be paid to tlie land owners for material theretofore taken from such land, as provided by said twenty-first section of said company\u2019s charter act, amended as aforesaid. In other words, section 21 of the company\u2019s charter, amended as aforesaid, does not provide for condemning land, nor for ascertaining compensation for taking material from the lands of others in anticipation of the actual taking thereof, but in view of exigencies likely to arise either in the construction or after repairs of its road, authorized said company, under certain restrictions named, to <em>\u201c </em>enter upon any convenient lands, and to cut, quarry, dig, take and carry away therefrom, any wood, stone, gravel, or earth, which might be deemed necessary, &amp;e. And said section provides that for all material thus taken, and for incidental injuries done to enclosures, crops, woods or grounds, in taking or carrying away the same, the president and directors shall make to the owner a fair and reasonable compensation, to be ascertained, if the parties cannot agree, by any three impartial, intelligent and disinterested freeholders, who being appointed for that purpose by any justice of the peace, thereto required by either of the parties, shall be sworn by said justice, and shall then ascertain, &amp;c., the statute giving to either party the right of appeal to the county court, &amp;e.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">This proceeding was instituted to condemn, out and out, land containing gravel, &amp;c., needed for repair of its road by said company, when the act simply authorized the taking of such material, and the compensation to be afterward ascertained as provided thereby. In other words, the company undertook to do what was not authorized by its charter; and hence the proceeding was properly dismissed on appeal by the county court; and so, too, the judge of the circuit court properly refused the writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">It has been deemed proper to say this much on the merits in order that like mistakes may be avoided in any future proceeding under the same section of the company\u2019s charter. The case must, however, go off upon a jurisdictional question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>The only matter in controversy is the amount of compensation ascertained, which is only $300, whereas by the constitution of Virginia (article 6, section 2) this court is denied jurisdiction in civil cases where the matter in controversy, exclusive of costs, is less in value or amount than $500, except in certain cases therein mentioned; and it cannot be pretended that this case comes within either of the enumerated exceptions. For can it be said that jurisdiction is conferred by any provision contained in section 3455, Code of 1887. The writ of error must, therefore, be dismissed as having been improvidently allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">Appeal bismisseb.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
