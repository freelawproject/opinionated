Those persons are described as qualified Medicare beneficiaries, or \u201cQMB\u2019s.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> New Jersey participates in Medicaid and therefore is subject to cost-sharing for QMB\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">Medicare normally pays a physician-provider 80% of the federally adopted Medicare reimbursement rate. Ordinarily, the patient is responsible for an initial deductible and the 20% copayment, and the provider is limited to those amounts. With respect to QMB\u2019s, the provider is limited to the state Medicaid program\u2019s cost-sharing contribution in lieu of the QMB patient\u2019s share. The question before us is the same question the District of Columbia Circuit recently faced: \u201cAre Medicare providers performing Part B services to QMBs entitled to state reimbursement for the entire twenty percent copayment that a non-QMB Medicare patient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>would normally pay, or may states limit reimbursement such that providers receive no more than the state\u2019s Medicaid rate for the same service?\u201d <em>McCreary v. Offner, </em>172 F.3d 76, 78 (D.C.Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Plaintiff is a physician who has treated QMB\u2019s for a number of years and received payments from the State Medicaid program pursuant to its cost-sharing responsibility. However, for the period between 1988 and February 10, 1995, the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services (the \u201cDivision\u201d) allowed co-payments to providers such as plaintiff only at the generally lower Medicaid rates established pursuant to 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396a(a)(13), and not at the rates allowed under Medicare for non-state-subsidized patients. The Division interpreted the then controlling federal law, 42 <em>U.S.C.A </em>1396a(n),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to permit the lower Medicaid reimbursement rates to govern cost-sharing payments for QMB\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">As of February 10,1995, the State conformed its Medicare cost-sharing plan to the ruling of the Third Circuit in a case challenging Medicaid rates paid for QMB\u2019s under a similar Pennsylvania plan. <em>See Pennsylvania Medical Soc\u2019y. v. Snider, </em>29 F.3d 886 (1994). From February 10, 1995 until July 20, 1998, New Jersey\u2019s Medicare co-payments for QMB\u2019s were based upon the higher Medicare m\u00e1ximums. The Department of Human Services amended <em>N.J.A.C. 10</em>:49-7.3(e)(1)(i) after Congress enacted \u00a7 4714 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Pub.L. 105-33, Title IV, 111 Stat. 509-510 (1997), to again limit co-payments for QMB\u2019s to the lower Medicaid m\u00e1ximums as of July 20, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">Plaintiff claims that he and others similarly situated<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> were entitled to payments at the higher Medicare levels prior to February 10, 1995. Section 4714(a) of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>codified at 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>1396a(n)(2), explicitly permits states to limit their Medicare cost-sharing payments to Medicaid rates. Section 4714(c) provides that \u00a7 4714(a) applies to pending lawsuits raising the issue. Plaintiffs complaint was pending in the Law Division when \u00a7 4714 was enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The Law Division Judge granted defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim and for summary judgment, citing decisions of the Seventh and Ninth Circuits. <em>See Paramount Health Sys., Inc. v. Wright, </em>138 F.3d 706, 711 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>-, 119 <em>S.Ct. </em>335, 142 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>276 (1998); <em>Beverly Community Hosp. Ass\u2019n v. Belshe, </em>132 F.3d 1259 (9th Cir.1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>-, 119 <em>S.Ct. </em>334, 142 L.Ed.2d 276 (1998). Both courts held that federal law applicable to the period in dispute permits states to limit their cost-sharing obligation to Medicaid levels.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">Plaintiff argues before us that \u00a7 4714 is not a binding interpretation of prior law; that Congress\u2019s attempt to clarify a prior statute violates constitutionally mandated separation of powers; that \u00a7 4714 violates his Fifth Amendment right to substantive due process; and that his complaint states claims for breach of contract and violation of 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1983. We have carefully considered the briefs and arguments of counsel in light of applicable law. We are satisfied that the Division was authorized to limit reimbursement to medical providers such as plaintiff to the maximum Medicaid rate. Plaintiff is not entitled to any further payments, and we affirm the judgment dismissing plaintiffs complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b466-12\">The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has recently set forth the relevant statutory background in a case raising virtually the same issues we face. <em>See Briggs v. Commonwealth, </em>429 <em>Mass. </em>241, 707 <em>N.E.2d </em>355 (1999).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-13\">Because this case concerns the interplay between two complex statutory schemes, Medicare and Medicaid, a discussion of the relevant aspects of each will provide the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>context for the dispute. Medicare, Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1395 <em>et seq., </em>first enacted in 1965, provides two types of federally funded medical benefits to certain disabled individuals and people over the age of sixty-five years, regardless of financial need. 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 426(a), 1395c. Medicare Part A essentially covers hospital, post-hospital, and other inpatient services, and coverage is automatic. 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1395c-1395i-4. Medicare Part B is a supplemental, voluntary insurance program providing coverage for physician and outpatient services. To obtain Part B coverage, patients must pay monthly premiums, and coverage does not begin until patients meet an annual deductible (\u00a7 100). 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 13951(b), 1395r, 1395s. Most important, once the deductible is met, Medicare covers only eighty per cent of the \u201creasonable charges\u201d for a covered service; the patient is responsible for the remaining twenty per cent, known as the copayment. 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 13951(a), 1395w-4. Collectively, the premium, deductibles, and copayment are referred to as \u201ccost-sharing.\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1396d(p)(3). Medicaid, Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1396 <em>et seq., </em>also enacted first in 1965, provides necessary medical assistance for certain low-income individuals, based on financial need. Administered by the States, the program provides Federal financial assistance to States that elect to provide medical services to low-income individuals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-6\">Because the State Medicaid reimbursement rates generally are lower than the Federal Medicare rates, service providers who participate in the Medicaid program generally receive less than the \u201creasonable charge\u201d determined by the Secretary for the same service covered under Medicare. <em>See Rehabilitation Ass\u2019n of Va., Inc. v. Kozlowski, </em>42 F.3d 1444, 1447 (4th Cir.1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 <em>U.S. </em>811, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>60, <em>133 L.Ed.2d </em>23 (1995). The Medicaid rate frequently is even <em>less </em>than the eighty per cent of the \u201creasonable charge\u201d paid to providers by the Federal government under Medicare. <em>Id. </em>The Medicare and Medicaid statutes overlap for coverage of the population of elderly or disabled persons (eligible for Medicare) who are also poor (eligible for Medicaid). Referred to as QMBs, they are individuals who qualify for Medicare but who cannot afford to pay for the optional Medicare Part B premiums, deductibles, and copayments. 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1396d(p)(1). QMBs, in turn, fall into two groups: those who are not poor enough to qualify for Medicaid (\u201cpure\u201d QMBs) and those whose level of financial need is so great as to qualify them for Medicaid (\u201cdual eligibles\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-7\">Of relevance to this lawsuit, QMBs no longer have to pay for Medicare Part B cost sharing. The State bears these costs because, since 1988, Federal law has made a State\u2019s participation in the Medicaid program conditional on the State\u2019s agreeing to pay on behalf of all QMBs the Part B costs that Medicare does not reimburse, 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1396a(a)(10)(E)(i), 1396d(p)(3).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 356-57 (footnotes omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Four federal courts of appeal, including the Third Circuit, interpreted 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396a(n) to require states within their jurisdiction to make co-payments to eligible providers up to the Medicare maximum levels. <em>See Pennsylvania Medical Society v. Snider, supra, </em>29 F.3d at 889-90; <em>Rehabilitation Ass\u2019n. of Virginia, Inc. v. Kozlowski, </em>42 F.3d 1444 (4th Cir.1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 <em>U.S. </em>811, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>60, 133 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>23 (1995); <em>Haynes Ambulance Service, Inc. v. Alabama, </em>36 F.3d 1074 (11th Cir.1994); <em>New York City Health and Hospitals Corp. v. Perales, </em>954 F.2d 854 (2d Cir.1992). Thereafter, presumably in reaction to those decisions, Congress enacted \u00a7 4714, entitled \u201cClarification Regarding State Liability for Medicare Cost-Sharing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">The original \u00a7 1396a(n), prior to its amendment by \u00a7 4714, was less than clear with respect to the required level of cost-sharing for QMB\u2019s. We agree with the <em>Briggs </em>court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-7\">We need not conclude for ourselves which of the many plausible interpretations of \u00a7 1396a(n) represents the most probable intent of Congress. Our own review of the statutory provisions at issue, their accompanying legislative histories, and the numerous judicial interpretations of the statute before and after the 1997 \u201cclarification\u201d of the BBA, confirms for us that ... Congress was not clear in its intentions regarding the reimbursement rate for providers of Part B medical services to QMBs prior to the 1997 enactment of the BBA. We are not alone in reaching that view.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-8\">[707 <em>N.E.2d </em>at 361-62.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">As the Massachusetts court said, \u201c[w]e certainly have little difficulty in rejecting [plaintiffs] claim that between 1988 and [1995] Federal law unambiguously mandated the division to reimburse providers for Medicare Part B services provided to QMBs at the Medicare rate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 362. <em>See also Paramount Health Sys., Inc. v. Wright, supra, </em>138 F.3d at 711 (\u201cThe Act is a hopeless muddle so far as [QMB] reimbursement is concerned____\u201d); <em>Beverly Community Hosp. Ass\u2019n v. Belshe, supra, </em>132 F.3d at 1266 (\u201cany quality of crystal clarity is uniformly recognized as totally absent from the Medicaid and Medicare statutes (thus even one of the cases relied on by appellees, <em>Kozlowski, </em>42 F.3d at 1450, has pungently \u2014 and accurately \u2014 characterized the provisions detailing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Medicaid and Medicare financing as \u2018among the most completely impenetrable texts within human experience\u2019 \u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The issue before us, as it was in <em>Paramount Health Systems, Beverly Community Hospital Ass\u2019n, McCreary, </em>and <em>Briggs, </em>is whether \u00a7 4714 merely clarifies rather than changes \u00a7 1396a(n), avoiding any retroactivity challenge and validating interpretations of \u00a7 1396a(n) to allow Medicaid rates as the maximum reimbursement for QMB\u2019s prior to enactment of \u00a7 4714.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We are satisfied that \u00a7 4714 is a clarifying act, and that the Division was entitled to limit payments as it did. Our intervention is unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">Defendants interpreted the unclear federal statute governing cost-sharing levels just as did several other states\u2019 agencies and the federal Department of Health and Human Services. <em>See McCreary, supra. </em>Moreover, the enactment of \u00a7 4714 itself is evidence that the text of the original statute reasonably allowed more than one interpretation, including the Division\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-9\">Given the extraordinary difficulty that the courts have found in divining the intent of the original Congress, a decision by the current Congress to intervene by expressly clarifying the meaning of Section 1396a(n) is worthy of real deference. Appellees\u2019 arguments that Act \u00a7 4714 is new law, despite Congress\u2019 unambiguous title for that section, cannot override that deference, because those arguments incorrectly presume a clearly established meaning for Section 1396a(n)-something that simply did not exist before Act \u00a7 4714 was adopted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-10\">We therefore honor Congress\u2019 \u201cclarification\u201d label and accept Act \u00a7 4714\u2019s provisions as a statement of what Section 1396a(n) has meant all along. That moots all of appellees\u2019 constitutional objections to the new legislation, because those objections rest entirely on the assertedly retroactive, rather than declaratory, nature of Act \u00a7 4714. But it is worth adding that we have, en route to our decision, carefully explored the litigants\u2019 arguments both as to the pre-Act version of Section 1396a(n) and as to the constitutional issues raised by appellees if Act \u00a7 4714 were to be viewed as a retroactive change in, rather than a declaratory clarification of, the prior law-questions implicating the separation of powers, the Contract Clause and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>the Due Process Clause. And that exploration, which necessitated an effort on our part to parse the intricate and complex provisions of the pre-Act legislation, has only deepened our conviction that Congress\u2019 stated intention of clarifying that preexisting law should be credited.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-5\"><em>[Beverly Community Hosp. Ass\u2019n., </em>132 F.3d at 1266-67.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">When an administrative agency interprets and applies a statute it is charged with administering in a manner that is reasonable, not arbitrary or capricious, and not contrary to the evident purpose of the statute, that interpretation should be upheld, irrespective of how the forum court would interpret the same statute in the absence of regulatory history. <em>See Chevron U.S.A Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 <em>U.S. </em>837, 842-45, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>2778, 2781-83, 81 L.Ed.2d 694, 702-04 (1984). The <em>McCreary </em>and <em>Paramount </em>courts have followed the <em>Chevron </em>rule to reject challenges to the Medicaid level reimbursement rate for QMB\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">Federal circuit court decisions interpreting federal statutes are not binding upon our state courts. Nevertheless, decisions of those courts are entitled to respect as a matter of comity and in the interest of uniformity, especially where they are in agreement with each other. <em>See Dewey v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>69, 79-80, 577 A.2d 1239 (1990). We deem that course appropriate here.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">It has been held that \u201c[sjubsequent legislation declaring the intent of an earlier statute is entitled to great weight in statutory construction.\u201d <em>Loving v. United States, </em>517 <em>U.S. </em>748, 770, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>1737, 1749, 135 L.Ed.2d 36, 57 (1996); <em>(quoting Consumer Prod. Safety Comm\u2019n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., </em>447 <em>U.S. </em>102, 118 n13, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>2051, 2061 n. 13, 64 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>766, 778 n. 13 (1980)). <em>See also Federal Housing Administration v. The Darlington, Inc., </em>358 <em>U.S. </em>84, 96, 79 <em>S.Ct. </em>141, 145, 3 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>132, 137 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">The <em>Loving </em>doctrine\u2019s continued vitality has been questioned by the Seventh Circuit in <em>Paramount, </em>138 F.3d at 711:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>So we\u2019re in a quandary concerning the continued vitality of the <em>Loving </em>line, and would welcome clarification from the Supreme Court \u2014 pending which we feel constrained by <em>Loving </em>to give <em>some </em>weight to Congress\u2019s declaration in the Balanced Budget Act that providers of services to quimbies are not entitled to reimbursement at full Medicare rates. Although we don\u2019t how much weight to give it \u2014 probably rather little in the circumstances \u2014 it is enough to tip the balance in favor of <em>Chevron </em>deference. The Act is a hopeless muddle so far as quimby reimbursement is concerned, and while it seems to us that Paramount has the better interpretation, there is sufficient ambiguity to require us to defer to the government. The judgment of the district court must therefore be reversed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">We need not resolve the status of the <em>Loving </em>doctrine. We conclude that \u00a7 4714(a) clarifies the meaning of the earlier enactment and adds weight to the Division\u2019s reasonable interpretation of \u00a7 1396(a)n, which is entitled to <em>Chevron </em>deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">Plaintiff challenges on constitutional grounds that portion of \u00a7 4714 that provides for its retroactive application to all pending cases. None of the Circuit Courts that have addressed the issue before us has credited similar constitutional arguments raised before it. <em>See McCreary, supra, </em>172 F.3d at 83; <em>Paramount, supra, </em>138 F.3d at 711; <em>Beverly Comm\u2019y Hosp. Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>132 <em>F.3d </em>at 1265, 1266-67 (as clarifying legislation, \u00a7 4714 raises no retroactivity problem). Nor has Massachusetts\u2019 highest court sustained a constitutional challenge. <em>Briggs, supra, </em>707 <em>N.E.</em>2d at 364. We see no reason to depart from the path each of those courts has taken. Plaintiff had no property right and no vested interest in the higher payments he claims. <em>See Paramount Health Systems, Inc., supra, </em>138 F.3d at 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">We are satisfied that the original enactment was unclear and subject to more than one interpretation; that \u00a7 4714 clarified rather than changed the law; that the defendant\u2019s Division\u2019s interpretation was reasonable; and that the <em>Chevron </em>doctrine supports deference to that interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">We affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b464-10\"> This case concerns only those persons who are not poor enough to qualify for Medicaid (so-called \"pure\u201d QMB\u2019s) and not those whose financial need qualifies them for both Medicare and Medicaid coverage (\"dual eligibles\u201d). <em>See 42 U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396d(p)(l).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b465-9\"> That section provided that States \u201cmay provide payment in an amount ... exceeding the amount that is otherwise payable\u201d under Medicaid.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b465-10\"> Although filed as a class action, defendants' dispositive motions resulted in a judgment of dismissal before the issue of certification could be addressed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b469-11\"> Plaintiff does not challenge the prospective application of \u00a7 4714.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
