On January 27, 1998, the arbitrator found no liability and made no award to plaintiff as \u201cplaintiff has failed to prove his case\u201d against either of the defendants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">We affirm the order substantially for the reasons expressed by Judge Edmond M. Kirby in his oral opinion of June 18, 1998. We add the following in light of the argument before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">Plaintiff argues that in the arbitration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-10\">Plaintiff was prejudiced by: (1) defendant[s\u2019l failure to respond to discovery thereby causing plaintiff to be unable to prove his case at arbitration; (2) by having the arbitrator misapply the law and not forcing defendant[sj to meet their burden; and (3) by being unable to properly evaluate this ease and the necessity of obtaining an expert because of defendantfs\u2019] unwillingness to supply certain discovery and the arbitrator[\u2019]s decision to reject any other theory of law that could have assisted plaintiff in proving his ease without an expert.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWr\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>.Plaintiff alleges that he suffered permanent injuries while operating a truck at the Maher Terminal when a Conrail locomotive \u201cderailed and collided with plaintiffs vehicle.\u201d Plaintiff emphasizes his view that the arbitrator incorrectly concluded that he needed an expert to prove the liability of either defendant involved in the arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">If plaintiff is correct, there is a remedy provided by <em>Rule </em>4:21A-6(b). Plaintiff cannot circumvent the Rule by contending that the arbitrator misapplied the law. If plaintiffs approach had merit, every unsuccessful party missing the deadline for challenging the result of an arbitration could make a similar argument, and the <em>Rule </em>would have no impact. Because plaintiff did not file his demand for trial <em>de novo </em>within thirty days of the arbitrator\u2019s award, <em>R. </em>4:21A-6(b)(l), and no action was taken by any party within fifty days, <em>R. </em>4:21A-6(b)(2),(3),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> dismissal was required. <em>R. </em>4:21 \u2014 6(b). Plaintiffs complaints concerning the arbitration proceedings and the result of the arbitration do not present \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d excusing his tardy application or justifying same. <em>Hartsfield v. Fantini, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>611, 618-19, 695 A.2d 259 (1997); <em>Wallace v. JFK Hartwyck at Oak Tree Inc., </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>605, 609, 695 A.2d 257 (1997). His assertion of a meritorious claim does not suffice as an excuse for the tardy filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The parties argue whether the dismissal must be with prejudice. Defendants contend that because plaintiffs failed to show \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d warranting the late filing of the demand for trial <em>de novo, </em>the dismissal of his complaint must be with prejudice. Plaintiff argues that <em>R. </em>4:21A-6(b) requires \u201cdismissal,\u201d it does not require it with prejudice; that because \u201cneither party requested\u201d the dismissal, <em>R. </em>4:37-2(a) requires the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>dismissal to be \u201cwithout prejudice,\u201d particularly because the dismissal order of April 1, 1998 did not state that it was entered \u201cwith prejudice\u201d; and that <em>R. </em>4:21A-6 requiring dismissal \u201cdoes not state that the arbitrator\u2019s award shall be automatically converted to a final judgment\u201d when there is no motion to confirm filed within fifty days. Plaintiff contends that a dismissal \u201cwith prejudice\u201d would have the effect of a confirmation because of the finding of no liability, even though defendants did not move to confirm the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">We recognize that the Supreme Court has just held that the failure to move to confirm or vacate an arbitration within the statutory time limit permitted by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:24-7 does not bar a common law action for confirmation. <em>Policeman\u2019s Benevolent Ass\u2019n, Local 292 v. Borough of North Haledon, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>392, 730 A.2d 320 (1999). But we do not believe that rationale permits plaintiff to go forward with this case merely because defendants did not move to confirm.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Here, a Superior Court case was already pending at the time of the <em>R. </em>4:21A arbitration, and the arbitration flowed from the case. Hence, we are not dealing, as in <em>PBA supra, </em>with a PERC or other arbitration for which judicial review is subsequently sought. <em>See PBA supra, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>at 393, 730 A.2d 320. Moreover, despite the fact that <em>R. </em>4:37-2(a) provides that dismissals for failure to comply with court rules shall be \u201cwithout prejudice unless otherwise specified in the order,\u201d the Supreme Court recently wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-7\">We have recognized that when a plaintiff fails to comply with a statute that creates a cause of action with both substantive and procedural requirements, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>consistent with imputed legislative intent, a dismissal for failure to comply with procedural requirements should be with prejudice unless there are \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d In Hartsfield, <em>v. Fantini, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>611, 695 A.2d 259 (1997), and the companion case <em>Wallace v. JFK Hartwyck at Oak Tree, Inc., </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>605, 695 A.2d 257 (1997), the Court considered a statute mandating automobile arbitration, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-24 to -35, that required that a motion for a trial <em>de novo </em>be filed within thirty days and that the failure to file within that time period would result in dismissal of any future court actions. <em>Hartsfield, supra, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>at 615, 695 A.2d 259. The Court held that, despite the language of the statute, a late motion would be permitted if the failure to file within thirty days was due to \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 618, 695 A.2d 259.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABF\">We perceive no basis for not imputing a similar legislative intent in the enactment of the Affidavit of Merit Bill. We conclude that a dismissal under the statute based on a violation of the affidavit requirement would be without prejudice only if there are extraordinary circumstances. Absent extraordinary circumstances, a failure to comply with the statute that requires a dismissal would be with prejudice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-6\"><em>[Alan J. Cornblatt, P.A. v. Barow, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>218, 246-47, 708 A.2d 401 (1998).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">We are satisfied that the reference to <em>Hartsfield </em>and <em>Wallace </em>in <em>Cornblatt </em>suggests that the <em>R. </em>4:21A-6 dismissal shall be with prejudice unless \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d are demonstrated. As there was no such demonstration in this case, the dismissal shall be deemed with prejudice.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b625-11\"> Angelo Accilien is described in the complaint as \"the wife of the Plaintiff, Willio Accilien,\u201d and as such, \u201cshe is responsible for the medical bills incurred by Plaintiff,\u201d as well as \u201cdeprived\u201d of Willio's \u201csociety, services and consortium due her.\" The appellant\u2019s brief before us refers to plaintiff in the singular, and we do the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b625-12\"> Plaintiff's complaint against the Port Authority was dismissed although the defendants' cross-claims were not.
