Hackett was convicted of fourth-degree lewdness, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-4b(l) (count one), and third-degree endangering the welfare of children, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>4a (count two). The victims were three girls: two, M.M. and A.S., both age eleven; and M.R.K., age thirteen. The girls observed defendant standing nude in his home located near a school bus stop where the victims waited each morning for the public school bus. The bus stop was actually in front of M.R.K.\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Following defendant\u2019s conviction, he was sentenced to a custodial term of four years on count two and to a concurrent term of eighteen months on count one. Appropriate statutory penalties were imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">On appeal, defendant raises four points of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-7\">\n<em>POINT I</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-8\">INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE WAS SUBMITTED TO SUSTAIN A CONVICTION FOR ENDANGERING WELFARE OF CHILDREN, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-9\">\n<em>POINT II</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-10\">THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY PERMITTING USE OF PRIOR BAD ACT EVIDENCE BY THE STATE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-12\">\n<em>POINT III</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-13\">THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN PROVIDING AN INSUFFICIENT PRIOR</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-14\">BAD ACT JURY INSTRUCTION.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-15\">\n<em>POINT IV</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-16\">[DEFENDANT\u2019S TRIAL COUNSEL] PROVIDED INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL TO DEFENDANT CHARLES HACKETT.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-17\">When defendant\u2019s appeal was first scheduled for appellate disposition, we requested counsel to provide supplemental briefs addressing \u201c[w]hether an actor\u2019s conduct that is completely encompassed by the fourth-degree crime as defined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-4b(l) (lewdness observed by a child less than 13 years of age) may also be prosecuted as a third-degree crime as defined by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4 (endangering the welfare of children) in the absence of any elements not already encompassed by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-4b(l).\u201d We also invited the Attorney General to file an <em>amicus curiae </em>brief addressing our specific inquiry. We conclude that, based on statutory construction, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-4b(l) and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a proscribe independent criminal conduct and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>defendant may be charged under the same indictment with a violation of each statute. However, the State presented insufficient evidence to convict defendant of violating <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Accordingly, we reverse defendant\u2019s conviction on count two for endangering the welfare of children. We additionally conclude that under the facts presented, even if defendant\u2019s convictions had been proper under both counts, the conviction for lewdness, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-4b(l), should have merged with the conviction for endangering the welfare of children, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a. Lastly, we conclude that defendant\u2019s contentions in Points II, III, and IV are without merit. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)2.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">On October 2, 1996, M.M. observed defendant standing nude inside his home approximately five feet from his front window. According to M.M., she was able to observe the entire front of defendant\u2019s body. She also thought that defendant had waved to her. M.M. testified that she had also observed defendant standing nude near the same window on or about September 4,1996. M.M. testified that during the earlier incident, defendant was talking on the telephone. At trial, M.M. testified that she had observed defendant standing nude on approximately ten occasions. After her observation on October 2, 1996, M.M. informed A.S.\u2019s mother, T.W. M.M. also testified that prior to the date when defendant moved to his residence, she had visited the former residents of that same home and was familiar with the floor plan. According to M.M., the front window in defendant\u2019s home was in the family room which adjoins an interior room used as a dining room and when she observed defendant he was standing in the dining room.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">M.R.K. testified that she had observed defendant standing nude and talking on a telephone on October 2,1996. She indicated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>the telephone was approximately three to four feet from the front window. M.R.K. also testified that she had observed defendant naked on other days prior to October 2, 1996. Additionally, on one occasion, she confronted defendant and informed him, \u201cI have been seeing somebody standing nude in your house, and I am getting sick of it because my friends are too young to see this.\u201d M.R.K. indicated that following that confrontation she never again saw defendant standing nude in his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">A.S. testified that she only saw defendant standing naked on one occasion \u2014 October 2, 1996. She indicated that on that date defendant\u2019s back was facing her and defendant was talking on a telephone a few feet from the window.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">T.W. testified that A.S. had informed her of the episode on October 2, 1996. T.W. indicated that in September and October 1996 there were no curtains on defendant\u2019s front window, but after M.R.K. confronted defendant, blinds were closed on defendant\u2019s front window.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">After T.W. reported the October 2, 1996, incident to the Middle Township Police Department, Detective Loefflad interviewed each girl and then interviewed defendant. . According to Loefflad, defendant indicated \u201che may have answered the phone without any clothes on\u201d; he did not know why he had been confronted by M.R.K., but he told her \u201che would look into it and take care of it.\u201d Defendant denied any wrongdoing and indicated that his curtains would be closed in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">Prior to defendant\u2019s trial, the State informed defendant that it intended to introduce evidence at defendant\u2019s trial of two prior convictions of defendant: a 1977 lewdness conviction in Pennsylvania and a conviction following a guilty plea on January 4,1996, for lewdness as a disorderly person, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-4a, occurring on September 10, 1995, in North Wildwood, New Jersey. On June 13, 1995, Judge Carmen Alvarez ruled that defendant\u2019s 1977 conviction was too remote, but the State would be permitted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>introduce at trial evidence of defendant\u2019s 1996 conviction pursuant to <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Based on the pre-trial ruling, the State produced two witnesses, Officers McNulty and Porch, both members of the North Wild-wood police. McNulty testified he and Officer Porch responded to an anonymous telephone call reporting that a man was masturbating under the North Wildwood boardwalk. The two officers approached the boardwalk area from different directions. Each officer indicated that defendant was masturbating and Officer Porch testified that defendant\u2019s genitals were in full view.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">At defendant\u2019s trial, he presented only two witnesses: his wife and a private detective, James G. Brennenstuhl. Defendant did not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">Defendant\u2019s wife testified that defendant and their two children moved to their residence on September 19, 1996. She indicated her normal schedule involved: waking at 6:00 a.m., driving her children to school at approximately 7:00 a.m., and returning to the residence at about 7:30 a.m. She also testified that the only telephone in the residence was located in the kitchen.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">Detective Brennenstuhl authenticated a series of photographs taken by him at defendant\u2019s residence between 6:48 and 7:20 a.m. which included defendant standing either in the living room or the dining room. He also testified that the distance from the street to defendant\u2019s home is approximately fifty to sixty feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">We first address defendant\u2019s first point of error. Defendant argues in Point I of his brief that his conviction should be reversed because endangering the welfare of children as a third-degree offense \u201cis targeted at defendants who have assumed a role in a child\u2019s life but one that does not rise to the level of parent or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>guardian.\u201d The argument is misplaced. The statute states that when a person who is either the parent or who stands <em>in loco parentis </em>violates the endangering statute, it is a second-degree offense. Defendant completely overlooks the import of the second sentence in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a providing, <em>\u201cAny other person who engages in conduct or who causes harm, as described in this subsection to a child under the age of 16 is guilty of a crime of the third </em>degree.\u201d (emphasis added). However, the point of error raised permits our discussion of the question we posed <em>sua sponte: </em>whether a defendant may be prosecuted under both <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-4b(l), lewdness as a crime of the fourth degree, and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a, endangering the welfare of children as a crime of the third degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">As originally enacted as part of the Criminal Code, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-4 classified all acts of lewdness as disorderly persons offenses. The statute then provided that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-6\">A person commits a disorderly persons offense if he does any flagrantly lewd and offensive act which he knows or reasonably expects is likely to be observed by other nonconsenting persons who would be affronted or alarmed. \u201cLewd acts\u201d shall include the exposing of the genitals for the purpose of arousing or gratifying the sexual desire of the actor or of any other person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-4 was amended by <em>L. </em>1992, c. 8, \u00a7 1, by designating certain acts of lewdness not as disorderly persons offenses but as fourth-degree crimes. Thus, paragraph b(l) of the 1992 version provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-8\">b. A person commits a crime of the fourth degree if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-9\">(1) He exposes his intimate parts for the purpose of arousing or gratifying the sexual desire of the actor or any other person under circumstances where the actor knows or reasonably expects he is likely to be observed by a child who is less than 13 years of age where the actor is at least four years older than the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">Paragraph (b)(2) is an analogous provision addressed to a likely observer \u201cwho because of mental disease or defect is unable to understand the sexual nature of the actor\u2019s conduct.\u201d The purpose of the 1992 amendment of the lewdness statute, as explained in the Senate Judiciary Committee Statement to Assembly Bill No. 850, was \u201cto upgrade acts of lewdness committed in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>presence of a child less than 13 of age ...\u201d or in the presence of a mentally disabled person.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">The separate crime of endangering the welfare of children is proscribed by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4, which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-7\">a. Any person having a legal duty for the care of a child or who has assumed responsibility for the care of a child who engages in sexual conduct which would impair or debauch the morals of the child, or who causes the child harm that would make the child an abused or neglected child as defined in <em>R.S. </em>9:6-1, <em>R.S. </em>9:6-3 and <em>P.L. </em>1974, c. 119, \u00a7 1 (C. 9:6-8.21) is guilty of a crime of the second degree. <em>Any other person who engages in conduct or who causes harm, as described in this subsection to a child under the age of 16 is guilty of a crime of the third degree. </em>[emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-8\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4b(2), (3), (4), (5) and (6) are clearly proscriptions against child pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">We initially note that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a proscribes engaging in \u201csexual conduct\u201d or, for one who does not stand <em>in loco parentis, </em>\u201cconduct;\u201d however, the statute does not define the proscribed \u201csexual conduct\u201d or \u201cconduct.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a specifically proscribes engaging in sexual conduct that would impair or debauch the morals of the child. The question before us is whether defendant\u2019s nudity is encompassed by the term \u201csexual conduct\u201d or \u201cconduct.\u201d The annotations in Cannel, <em>New Jersey Criminal Code Annotated, </em>comment 2 on <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4 (1998), note that \u201c[t]he term sexual conduct is not defined. Clearly included are sexual assaults and sexual contacts as those terms are used in Chapter 14____ The term seems not necessarily limited, however, to such conduct. Neither participation nor observation by the child is explicitly required.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-12\">In <em>State v. White, </em>105 <em>N.J.Super. </em>234, 251 A.2d 766 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>54 <em>N.J. </em>242, 254 A.2d 789 (1969), defendant was convicted of \u201cimpairing the morals of a child in violation of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:96-3,\u201d the predecessor statute to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4. Defendant showed \u201cphotographs of nude men and women in various postures\u201d to two minor children. <em>Id. </em>at 236, 251 A.2d 766. We affirmed the conviction, noting that \u201cthe actions of defendant and the methods employed by him to induce the minor girls to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>become exposed to them had the potential effect of debauching the children or impairing their morals, -within the meaning and contemplation of the statute under which defendant was indicted, tried, and convicted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 237, 251 A.2d 766. Thus, \u201csexual conduct\u201d includes showing nude explicit photographs to children. We consider defendant\u2019s nudity in the instant matter, in light of the holding in <em>White, </em>as conduct that falls within the meaning of \u201csexual conduct\u201d or \u201cconduct\u201d proscribed by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Prosecution for violations of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a, endangering the welfare of a child, as reported in published opinions, generally appears in conjunction with prosecution for other sexual conduct. Most illustrative is <em>State v. Zeidell, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>417, 713 A.2d 401 (1998), where defendant was convicted of sexual assault, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2b, endangering the welfare of a child, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a, and fourth-degree lewdness, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-4b(l). Defendant was observed masturbating while standing on a boardwalk in plain view of two children and an adult who were on the beach approximately seventy-five feet from the boardwalk. In a reported decision, 299 <em>N.J.Super. </em>613, 691 A.2d 866 (App.Div.1997), a majority of this court reversed defendant\u2019s convictions concluding that, because the State had failed to establish specific victimization and aggressive assaultive conduct, it had not proved the necessary relational component for sexual assault. <em>Id. </em>at 619-20, 691 A.2d 866. Our dissenting colleague concluded that no specific victimization was required and that all of the statutory elements of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2b had been established. <em>Id. </em>at 624-27, 691 A.2d 866. The Supreme Court reversed our decision and reinstated defendant\u2019s conviction stating in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-7\">When the controlling statutory provisions of the Code are read together, we find that a tender-years-sexual assault under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2b contains three key elements. They are: (1) a victim who is less than thirteen years old, (2) a defendant-actor who is at least four years older than the victim, and (3) a sexual contact with a victim under the critical age. The sexual contact with a victim involves an intentional or purposeful touching of an intimate part. There are three types of intentional sexual touching: the actor may touch himself or herself, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>actor may touch the victim, or the victim may touch the actor. Each such intentional touching must be for at least one of four purposes: either degrading or humiliating the victim, or sexually arousing or sexually gratifying the defendant-actor. Finally, if the touching is by the actor himself or herself, the sexual touching must be in view of the victim whom the actor knows to be present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-5\"><em>[Zeidell, supra, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>at 428, 713 A.2d 401.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">The Court also discussed <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-4 proscribing lewdness. It noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-7\">[U]nder the Code, lewdness can be either a disorderly persons offense or a fourth-degree crime. It is a disorderly persons offense whenever the actor engages in any flagrantly lewd and offensive act, including exposing the aetors\u2019s own genitals regardless of whether done for the actors\u2019s sexual arousal or gratification, which the actor knows or reasonably expects is likely to be observed by other non-consenting persons over the age of thirteen years who would be affronted or alarmed by the conduct. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:14-4a.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-8\">Whether such exposure becomes fourth-degree lewdness depends on the identity of the victim. Fourth-degree lewdness under subsection \u201cb(l)\u201d occurs when the victim is under thirteen and the actor is at least four years older than the victim. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-4b(1). When the victim suffers from a mental disease or defect that makes the victim unable to understand the sexual nature of the actor\u2019s conduct, an exposure is fourth-degree lewdness under subsection \u201cb(2).\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-4b(2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 430, 713 A.2d 401.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-10\"><em>Zeidell </em>did not discuss defendant\u2019s conviction on two counts of endangering the welfare of a child, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a, other than to note that the trial judge at sentencing had merged defendant\u2019s endangering convictions into defendant\u2019s tender-years-sexual assault convictions under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2b. <em>Id. </em>at 419, 713 A.2d 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">Other reported decisions involving endangering the welfare of a child, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4, include<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>State v. D.R., </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>348, 537 A.2d 667 (1988) (defendant convicted of aggravated sexual assault, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2a, sexual assault, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2b, and endangering the welfare of a child, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-Aa); <em>State v.

Davis, </em>229 <em>N.J.Super. </em>66, 550 A.2d 1241 (App.Div.1988) (defendant convicted of two counts of sexual assault, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2b, and two counts of endangering the welfare of a child, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">The significance of <em>Zeidell, supra, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>417, 713 A.2d 401, is the Court\u2019s discussion of the interrelationship between the sexual assault statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2b, and the lewdness statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-4b(l). <em>Id. </em>at 421, 423-34, 713 A.2d 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">We perceive that the issues posed by defendant\u2019s appeal may also be analyzed in a similar framework to that utilized in <em>Zeidell, </em>but instead comparing the relationship between the lewdness statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-4b(l), and the endangering statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a. We acknowledge that nudity itself in the privacy of one\u2019s home is not proscribed behavior under New Jersey law. However, nudity becomes a statutory offense when another person is subjected to the nudity. Nudity, if for the purpose of arousing or gratifying the actor\u2019s sexual desire, is a disorderly persons offense if the actor knows or reasonably expects he is likely to be observed by a nonconsenting person who would be affronted or alarmed, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-4(a). The same episode of nudity \u2014 for the purpose of arousing or gratifying the actor\u2019s sexual desire \u2014 is a fourth-degree offense if observed or where the actor reasonably expects he is likely to be observed by another noneonsenting person who is less than thirteen years old, where the actor is at least four years older than the child. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-4b.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">Nudity is a third-degree offense if observed by a child less than sixteen years old if such nudity causes harm to the child, that is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>debauches the morals of the child or causes the child to be abused or neglected. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a. Nudity by the parent or one who stands <em>in loco parentis </em>is a second-degree offense if it debauches the morals or causes the child to be abused or neglected. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a. Thus, the <em>actus reus </em>in the instant matter is the same and is proscribed by both statutes within <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C, but the effect on the child sought to be protected by the statutes determines the degree of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Our special inquiry questioned the prosecution of defendant\u2019s nudity under both lewdness, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-4b(l), and endangering the welfare of children, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a. The indictment in this case charges two separate types of criminal behavior. A fourth-degree conviction for lewdness requires observation by a child of defendant\u2019s lewd acts. A conviction for endangering the welfare of children requires observation by a child of defendant\u2019s conduct, and that the child\u2019s morals would be impaired or debauched by that conduct. Therefore, because the statutes proscribe two distinct types of behavior, and require distinct proofs, we hold that a defendant may be prosecuted under and convicted under both <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:14-4 as a fourth-degree offense and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a as a third-degree offense provided the evidence supports both distinct charges. The resolution of the issue before us, however, should <em>not </em>be based only on the question of sufficiency of evidence but, rather, requires consideration of the interplay between adequacy of evidence and statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">The dissent takes the position that where the defendant\u2019s culpable conduct is entirely embraced by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-4b(l) and although the State fails to prove that that conduct did impair or debauch the morals of the child, the defendant may nevertheless be convicted of the third-degree crime of endangering the welfare of a child pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a. The rationale seems to be that a jury would always be justified in finding beyond a reasonable doubt that the act of indecent exposure, as precisely defined by the lewdness statute and completely subsumed within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>that definition, also constitutes the third-degree endangering crime because the mere act of indecent exposure inherently and inevitably has a tendency to impair and debauch the morals of a minor whether it has in fact been specifically proved to have done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">If the dissent is correct, then there would be no fourth-degree lewdness conviction that would not also, <em>ipso facto, </em>sustain a third-degree endangering conviction. That is not what the Legislature intended in its 1992 amendment of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-4t. It seems that the Legislature then made a careful and deliberative decision that the mere act of exposure, with nothing more, if observed or likely to be observed by a child younger than thirteen years old, should constitute a fourth-degree crime---not a third-degree crime. To be sure, an act of exposure may well constitute the third-degree crime of endangering, but in order to do so, there must be proof either that the act in some way went beyond a mere exposure or that it did, in fact, have more than a theoretical capacity to have impaired or debauched the child\u2019s morals. Any other construction of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:14-4 would render it a nullity for any purpose other than an unfettered exercise of prosecutorial discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">It is clear, as the Criminal Code provides, that a defendant may not be convicted of two offenses based on the same conduct if \u201c[t]he offenses differ only in that one is defined to prohibit a designated kind of conduct generally and the other to prohibit a specific instance of such conduct.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:l-8a(4). The Code also provides, in the second paragraph of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-8a(4), that the \u201cdetermination barring multiple convictions shall be made by the court after verdict or finding of guilt.\u201d That is, however, not the issue here. The issue here is, rather, whether the third-degree crime should ever have gone to a jury in the first place. In the absence of any proof of conduct by the actor or effect on the victim beyond that comprehended by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-4, it should not have.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">The State adduced sufficient evidence to permit a jury to convict defendant of a fourth-degree violation of lewdness, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-4b(l). However, the State did not present any evidence that defendant\u2019s conduct would tend to debauch the morals of children as is required to convict under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">We note that a conviction for endangering the welfare of children requires a showing that defendant\u2019s conduct tends to debauch the morals of children. \u201cIt is not necessary for the State to prove ... that the child was not debauched'[prior to the act], or his morals more impaired after the act than they were before. The statute forbids the performance of acts which tend to debauch the child or impair his morals \u2014 whether they actually did so is immaterial.\u201d <em>State v. Raymond, </em>74 <em>N.J.Super. </em>434, 438, 181 A.2d 515 (App.Div.1962), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>39 <em>N.J. </em>241, 188 A.2d 305 (1963) (construing <em>N.J.S. </em>2A:96-3, the predecessor statute to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">Here, the only evidence presented by the State, aside from the testimony of each victim, was the very limited testimony of one victim\u2019s mother, T.W. The following colloquy was presented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-9\">Q. Did she tell you about what happened to her on October 2nd, 1996?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-10\">A. Yes, she did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-11\">Q. What did she say happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-12\">A. She told me that the man across the street was standing naked in front of the window and that he was posing for them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-13\">Q. After you learned that information, what, if any this did you do, [T.W.]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-14\">A. Well, at first I didn\u2019t know whether it was illegal or not. I knew it was disgusting, but I didn\u2019t know if it was illegal. So I called a friend of mine that works for the Cape May Police Department and I asked to get some clarification on it, and then I talked to [M.M.\u2019s] mother to let he know that I thought we needed to keep the girls away from there and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-15\">Q. Did you have an opportunity to speak [M.M.] and [M.R.K.] at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-16\">A. Yes, I did because at first I wanted to confirm before going to the police that\u2014 exactly the story. I wanted to make sure that it wasn\u2019t an accident that they saw him, but they told me explicitly that he was posing and waving to them and that he had been doing it for a couple of weeks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-17\">Q. I have no further questions, Your Honor. Thank you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>Based upon this very limited testimony, and in the absence of any expert opinion or any evidence offered by a representative of the Division of Youth and Family Services, the judge instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-5\">The third element, which I will define for you, must also have been done knowingly; and that is, that the sexual conduct was engaged knowing it would impair or debauch the morals of the children. <em>Sexual conduct which would impair or debauch the morals of a child is conduct which tends to corrupt, mar, or spoil the morals of a child under 16 years of age. </em>The law provides that sexual conduct would impair or debauch the morals of the child. It is not necessary to show that the sexual conduct actually resulted in impairing or debauching the morals of a child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-6\">[emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">The scant evidence presented at trial does not indicate that defendant\u2019s conduct \u2014 standing nude in front of a window in his house \u2014 would tend to \u201ccorrupt, mar, or spoil the morals\u201d of the victims. We thus conclude the trial judge erred in failing to <em>sua sponte </em>dismiss this count of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">The trial judge charged the jury, in pertinent part, as follows with reference to count two of the indictment charging third-degree endangering the welfare of the children, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-10\">Now the second count of the indictment charges endangering the welfare of a child. The defendant is charged in. the indictment with \u2014 with that offense, and the statute which makes that a crime reads as follows: Any person who engages in sexual conduct which would impair or debauch the morals of a child is guilty of a crime. In order to find the defendant guilty of this crime, the State is required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the following elements: One, that the victim or victims were children under the age of 16; two, that the defendant knowingly engaged in sexual conduct; three, that such conduct would impair or debauch the morals of a child or children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-11\">Now as to the first element, that the victims were children, the use of the term \u201cchild\u201d in the statute means any person under the age of 16 at the time of the offense. Now proof of the first element was shown by the proof of the ages of the alleged victims in this ease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-12\">As to the second element, that the defendant knowingly engaged in sexual conduct, sexual conduct is a phrase which includes various prohibited acts. The term \u201csexual conduct\u201d is a phrase which includes acts which would include, also, the offense charged in count one [lewdness] and/or the offense charged as al \u2014 an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>alternative to count one, which I just \u2014 both of which I just defined for you moments ago. You will recollect that this second element must be shown to have been done knowingly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-6\">The third element ... [is] that the sexual conduct was .engaged knowing it would impair or debauch the morals of the children____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-7\">Now as I have instructed you, both the second and third elements of the offense require the defendant acted knowingly. A person acts knowingly with respect to the nature of his conduct or the attendant circumstances if he is aware that the conduct \u2014 his conduct is of that nature or that such circumstances exist or the person is aware of a high probability of their existence. A person acts knowingly with respect to a result of his conduct if the person is aware that it is practically certain that the conduct will cause such a result.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-8\">In order to find the defendant guilty, the State must prove each and every element of the offense as I have just defined it for you beyond a reasonable doubt. If you find the defendant has failed to prove any of \u2014 or all of the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt, then you must find the defendant not guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">Although the judge\u2019s charge mirrors in part the Model Jury Charge for endangering the welfare of a child, we find the judge\u2019s charge and the Model Jury Charge both lack sufficient clarity and in fact both conflict with our analysis. The Model Jury Charge<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> explains \u201csexual conduct\u201d by utilizing a reference to \u201cnudity, if alone or depicted for the purpose of sexual stimulation or gratification of any person who may view it\u201d as defined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24 \u2014 4b(l)(i), a section of the statute designed to pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>scribe child pornography. The Model Jury Charge fails to recognize the distinction and differences between <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4b(2) to (5). <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-rib(2) to (5) proscribe child pornography, whereby a person is prohibited from \u201ccausing] or permitting] a child to engage in a prohibited sexual act or in the simulation of such an act.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4b(1) states that \u201cprohibited sexual act\u201d as used in that subsection includes nudity \u201cif depicted for the purpose of sexual stimulation or gratification of any person who may view such depiction.\u201d However, the term \u201cprohibited sexual act\u201d appears only in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4b(2) to (5), not in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a. Thus, the definition of nudity in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24 \u2014 4b(1)(i) applies only to nudity on the part of a child. The Model Jury Charge, by incorporating the definition of \u201csexual conduct\u201d by reference to nudity as described in <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:24 \u2014 4b(l)(i), is particularly problematic where, as here, the \u201csexual conduct\u201d charged is predicated upon defendant\u2019s own nudity.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">\u201cAccurate and understandable jury instructions in criminal cases are essential to a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.\u201d <em>State v.

We had concluded that defendant\u2019s conviction for endangering the welfare of a child, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a must merge with defendant\u2019s conviction for aggravated sexual assault, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2a, and sexual assault, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2b. 214 <em>N.J.Super. </em>278, 518 A.2d 1122 (App.Div.1986). Citing its earlier decision in <em>State v. Miller, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>at 122, 527 A.2d 1362 (1987), where defendant was convicted of endangering the welfare of a child, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24~ 4(a) and aggravated sexual assault of his iive-year-old daughter, the Supreme Court in <em>D.R. </em>noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-8\">In <em>Miller, </em>we held that \u201cthe crime of endangering the welfare of a child is aimed not only at specific conduct but also at the violation of the duty that a parent owes to a child.\u201d 108 <em>N.J. </em>at 118-19, 527 A.2d 1362. We noted that the critical factor in the merger question presented in <em>Miller </em>derived from the \u201cdifferent interests protected by the statutes violated,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 118, 527 A.2d 1362, and that although both convictions were \u201cbased on the same general conduct,\u201d the child endangerment conviction was \u201calso directed at the defendant\u2019s violation of his parental duty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 120-21, 527 A.2d 1362. Our reasoning and holding in <em>Miller </em>applies to the circumstances of this case and would preclude merger of the conviction under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4(a). The same result would be reached by application of the relevant provision of the Code of Criminal Justice, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:l-8(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-9\">[109 <em>N.J. </em>at 377, 537 A.2d 667.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">Despite the decision in <em>D.R. </em>and <em>Miller, </em>another panel of this court in <em>Still, supra, </em>257 <em>N.J.Super. </em>255, 608 A.2d 404, concluded that where a defendant is \u201cnot a parent\u201d and is \u201cnot even the baby sitter,\u201d and \u201cno legal duty is asserted to have been owed by [defendant] to the victim,\u201d then a conviction for sexual assault and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>fourth-degree endangering the welfare of a child do merge. <em>Id. </em>at 259-60, 608 A.2d 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Here, the jury convicted defendant of both counts of the indictment. As noted, the judge sentenced defendant on each count: four years under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a, and a concurrent term of eighteen months under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-4b(l). Although we reverse defendant\u2019s conviction for violating <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a due to an insufficiency of evidence, even were we to have affirmed his conviction, we would have concluded that the separate conviction for lewdness should have merged with the conviction for endangering the welfare of children. <em>See Still, supra, </em>257 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 259, 608 A.2d 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">We have carefully reviewed defendant\u2019s second and third points of error, the arguments of counsel, and the applicable law, and conclude that both arguments are clearly without merit and a written opinion would have no precedential value. <em>See R. </em>2:11-3(e)(2). We add these additional comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\"><em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-9\">Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the disposition of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith. Such evidence may be admitted for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity or absence of mistake or accident when such matters are relevant to a material issue in dispute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts may not be introduced into evidence to prove a defendant\u2019s criminal disposition as a basis for establishing guilt of the crime charged. <em>State v.

Such evidence must meet a four-prong test for admissibility: (1) the evidence must be relevant to a material issue in dispute; (2) the other crime, wrong, or act must be similar in kind and reasonably close in time to the crime presently charged; (3) the evidence of the other crime, wrong, or act must be clear and convincing; and (4) the probative value of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>such evidence must not be outweighed by the prejudice to the defendant. <em>State v.

The <em>Cusick </em>jury instruction as to <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b) evidence was specifically approved in <em>State v. G.S., </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>460, 471-72, 678 A.2d 1092 (1996). We can find no error in the jury instruction in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">Defendant contends he was provided ineffective assistance of counsel. The test for ineffective assistance of counsel is two-pronged: (1) counsel\u2019s performance must be deficient and (2) the deficient performance must prejudice the defense so as to create \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>668, 694, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>2052, 2068, 80 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>674, 698 (1984). <em>Accord State v. Fritz, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>42, 52, 519 A.2d 336 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">There is a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance. <em>Strickland, supra, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>at 688-89, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2065, 80 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d at 694. Although defendant\u2019s trial counsel may have failed to object to hearsay evidence, we conceive that failure to be harmless in light of the age of the victims and the sensitive nature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>of each victim\u2019s testimony. Viewed in its entirety, defendant\u2019s trial counsel provided defendant with a vigorous defense and quite adequately represented defendant in the pre-trial motion and at sentencing. We therefore reject defendant\u2019s fourth point of error. Our conclusion shall not deny defendant his right to assert a petition for post-conviction relief predicated upon allegations that lie outside the record. <em>State v.

For example, \u201csexual conduct\u201d includes causing or permitting a child to engage in a prohibited sexual act or the simulation of a prohibited sexual act. A prohibited sexual act, itself, includes sexual intercourse ... nudity, if alone or depicted for the purpose of sexual stimulation or gratification of any person who may view it. \u201cSexual conduct\u201d also includes sexual contact. Sexual contact means an intentional touching by the defendant, either directly or through clothing, of the victim's intimate parts. Intimate parts means the following body parts: sexual organs, genital area, anal area, inner thigh, groin, buttock or breast of a person. An intentional touching means a knowing or conscious touching and is to be distinguished from an accidental touching. An intentional act is an act done with the purpose to accomplish it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-12\">[footnotes omitted].</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b512-7\">STEINBERG, J.A.D.,</author>\n<p id=\"AXR\">concurring in part; dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">I respectfully dissent from that portion of the opinion that reverses defendant\u2019s conviction for third-degree endangering the welfare of a child. The majority concludes that the State did not present any evidence that defendant\u2019s conduct would tend to impair or debauch the morals of a child as is required to convict under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4(a). Like its predecessor, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:96-3, the statute is designed to protect children under the age of sixteen. <em>State v. White, </em>105 <em>N.J.Super. </em>234, 236, 251 A.2d 766 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>54 <em>N.J. </em>242, 254 A.2d 789 (1969); <em>State v. Raymond, </em>74 <em>N.J.Super. </em>434, 438, 181 A.2d 515 (App.Div.1962), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>39 <em>N.J. </em>241, 188 A.2d 305 (1963). The majority correctly recognizes that it is not necessary for the State to prove that defendant\u2019s acts did, in fact, impair or debauch the morals of a minor. Yet the majority goes on to suggest that nudity only becomes a third-degree offense (or second-degree offense depending on the relationship of the actor to the victim) if the act of nudity, in fact, either causes harm to the child, or debauches the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>morals of the child, or causes the child to be abused or neglected, further concluding that the effect on the child sought to be protected determines the degree of the offense. <em>State v. Hackett, </em>323 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 474-75, 733 A.2d at 562-63 (App.Div.1999). These conclusions are inconsistent with our prior decisions that the statute is violated if defendant\u2019s conduct tends to impair or debauch the morals of a minor; it is not necessary that defendant\u2019s conduct in fact impaired or debauched the morals of the victim. <em>See State v. White, supra, </em>105 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 237, 251 A.2d 766; <em>State v. Raymond, supra, </em>74 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 438, 181 A.2d 515. Those cases were correctly decided and I see no reason to vary from them when the acts complained of consisted solely of nudity. <em>State v. Raymond, supra, </em>74 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 438, 181 A.2d 515. The statute forbids the performance of acts which <em>tend </em>to debauch the child or impair his morals. (Emphasis added.) <em>Ibid. </em>Nor does the statute require proof of physical contact or physical abuse. <em>State v. White, supra, </em>105 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 237, 251 A.2d 766.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">In my view the victims\u2019 testimony that defendant, on more than one occasion, stood nude inside his home approximately five feet from his open front window enabling the victims to observe the entire front of his body was sufficient to present a jury question as to whether defendant\u2019s conduct tended to impair or debauch the morals of the victims. I respectfully part company with the majority\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[t]he scant evidence presented at trial does not indicate that defendant\u2019s conduct \u2014 standing nude in front of a window in his house \u2014 would tend to \u2018corrupt, mar, or spoil the morals\u2019, of the victims\u201d particularly in light of the judge\u2019s instructions that require the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant knowingly engaged in sexual conduct and further required the State to prove, again beyond a reasonable doubt, that the sexual conduct was engaged in knowing it would impair or debauch the morals of the children. The judge specifically advised the jury that the sexual conduct which was the core of the charge of endangering the welfare of a child was the act of lewdness that had previously been charged to the jury. In that portion of the charge the judge instructed the jury that they must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant exposed himself \u201cunder circumstances where he knew or reasonably expected that he would likely be observed\u201d by the victims. The majority correctly concludes that defendant\u2019s nudity is conduct that falls within the meaning of \u201csexual conduct\u201d or \u201cconduct\u201d proscribed by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4(a). There was sufficient testimony for the jury to infer and conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant\u2019s conduct had the capacity to impair or debauch the morals of the victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">The majority concludes that the limited testimony of one victim\u2019s mother, T.W., regarding the complaint made to her, coupled with \u201cthe absence of any expert opinion or any evidence offered by a representative of the Division of Youth and Family Services\u201d, was insufficient to present a jury question and the judge was required to <em>sua sponte </em>dismiss that count of the indictment. <em>State v. Hackett, supra, </em>at 477-78, 733 A.2d at 564. As I have already noted, I believe there was sufficient evidence to present a jury question. It was not necessary for the victims to testify that they were offended, humiliated, embarrassed, or that their morals were impaired or debauched. <em>See State v. White, supra; State v. Raymond, supra. </em>Indeed, <em>White, supra, </em>and <em>Raymond, supra, </em>demonstrate that a conviction would stand even if the morals of these victims were not impaired or debauched provided the jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant\u2019s conduct had the tendency to impair or debauch the morals of any child. Moreover, in <em>State v. South, </em>136 <em>N.J.Super. </em>402, 410, 346 A.2d 437 (App.Div.1975), <em>certif. denied, </em>69 <em>N.J. </em>387, 354 A.2d 315 (1976), we held that evidence that defendant exposed himself to an eleven-year-old victim was sufficient to sustain a defendant\u2019s conviction for open lewdness and impairing the morals of a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">The majority observes that if the dissent is correct, \u201cthere would be no fourth-degree lewdness conviction that would not also, <em>ipso facto, </em>sustain a third-degree endangering conviction\u201d. The majority then concludes that that is not what the Legislature intended in its 1992 amendment of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4. I disagree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>with that conclusion. Prior to the amendment, when all acts of lewdness were disorderly persons offenses, an act of lewdness could also support a conviction for endangering the welfare of a child if a jury concluded, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant\u2019s conduct tended to impair or debauch the morals of a child. At the same time <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-4 was amended to specifically provide that an actor, who exposes his intimate parts for the purpose of arousing or gratifying his sexual desire, or the sexual desire of any other persons, under circumstances where the actor knows or reasonably expects he is likely to be observed by a child who is less than thirteen years of age is guilty of a crime of the fourth-degree if the actor is at least four years older than the child, the Legislature also amended <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4(a), upgrading the crimes to second-degree and third-degree from third-degree crimes and fourth-degree crimes. Both amendments took effect on March 13, 1992. I cannot conceive that the Legislature, at the same time it made lewd conduct likely to be observed by a child under the age of thirteen a fourth-degree offense in order to be punished more severely, and made endangering the welfare of a child also subject to more severe penalties, also intended to make it more difficult to prosecute for endangering the welfare of a child when the acts giving rise to the prosecution consisted strictly of acts of lewdness.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The paramount question in every case in which conflicting interpretations of a statute are advanced is which interpretation more fully accords with the legislative intent. <em>State v. Galloway, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>631, 658, 628 A.2d 735 (1993); <em>Brock v. Public Service Elec. &amp; Gas Co., </em>290 <em>N.J.Super. </em>221, 227, 675 A.2d 668 (App.Div.1996), re<em>v\u2019d on other grounds, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>378, 693 A.2d 894 (1997). A court\u2019s duty in construing a statute is to determine the intent of the Legislature. <em>Jacobitti v. Jacobitti, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>571, 579, 641 A.2d 535 (1994). In attempting to determine the legislative intent, the court should consider the statutory language, the policy behind the statute, concepts of reasonableness as well as legislative history. <em>Atlantic Commercial Gp. v. Dunham, </em>303 <em>N.J.Super. </em>122, 128, 696 A.2d 85 (App.Div.1997). The goal in statutory construction is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>determine the intent of the Legislature and to make sense of a statute. <em>Kenney v. Meadowview Nursing Center, </em>308 <em>N.J.Super. </em>565, 570, 706 A.2d 295 (App.Div.1998). Court\u2019s should avoid interpreting a statute in a manner that'leads to an absurd, anomalous, or unreasonable result. <em>County of Camden v. South Jersey Port., </em>312 <em>N.J.Super. </em>387, 396, 711 A.2d 978 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>542, 724 A.2d 801 (1998). In interpreting a statute a court should read it sensibly and not arrive at a construction which distorts its true intent. <em>Stonehill Prop. Owners v. Vernon, </em>312 <em>N.J.Super. </em>68, 76, 711 A.2d 346 (App.Div.1998). Statutes are to be read sensibly rather than literally and the controlling legislative intent is to be presumed as consonant to reason and good discretion. <em>Matter of Adoption of N.J.A.C. 7:11, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>119, 128, 693 A.2d 97 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">In my opinion the Legislature clearly set forth its intention when it amended <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14r4 and N.J.S.A 2C:24-4(a) at the same time. In each instance the potential punishment for sexual conduct involving children became more severe, clearly evidencing the Legislature\u2019s intent to punish more severely those convicted of acts of sexual misconduct involving minors. The majority, rather than respecting that legislative intent, concludes that the Legislature made a careful and deliberative decision that the mere act of exposure, with nothing more, if observed or likely to be observed by a child younger than thirteen years old, constitutes solely the fourth-degree offense of lewdness, a fourth-degree crime \u2014 not the third-degree or second-degree crime of endangering the welfare of a child. I disagree. If the majority is correct we have the anomalous result that an act of exposure committed in front of a child less than thirteen years of age is a fourth-degree offense; however, if the actor exposes himself in front of a child over the age of thirteen but under the age of sixteen he is guilty of a crime of the third-degree. That clearly does not reflect the intent of the Legislature. In my view, the Legislature never intended to make exposure that is likely to be observed by a child less than thirteen less serious than exposure that is likely to be observed by a child older than thirteen, but less than sixteen. If the majority is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>correct, does that also mean that an act of exposure that is likely to be observed by a child more than thirteen, but less than sixteen is only a disorderly persons offense? My answer is a resounding no. Again, that result would be absurd. While I agree with the majority that <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:l-8(a)(4) provides that a defendant may not be convicted of two offenses based on the same conduct if the offenses differ only in that one is defined to prohibit a designated kind of conduct generally and the other to prohibit a specific instance of such conduct, I believe a defendant is amply protected by utilizing the flexible approach to merger and requiring that the fourth-degree conviction merge into the third-degree conviction. <em>See State v. Cole, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>321, 327, 576 A.2d 864 (1990); <em>State v. Davis, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>69, 81, 342 A.2d 841 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">I also disagree with the majority\u2019s suggestion that expert opinion or evidence offered by the Division of Youth and Family Services was required due to the very limited testimony of T.W. This is not a case calling for scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge in order to assist the jury to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue. <em>See N.J.R.E. </em>702. A jury is perfectly capable of concluding, without the assistance of an expert, as to whether defendant\u2019s conduct tended to impair or debauch the morals of a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Finally, I agree with the majority\u2019s observation that the Model Jury Charge fails to recognize the distinction and differences between <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4(a) and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4(b)(2) to (5). However, here, the judge\u2019s charge did not suffer from that infirmity since he specifically limited the jury\u2019s consideration of sexual conduct to the acts of lewdness that formed the basis of count one of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">For the reasons set forth above I would affirm defendant\u2019s conviction for third-degree endangering the welfare of a child.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
