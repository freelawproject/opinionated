The injury did not arise out of his employment. It was not caused by it. The injury came from a hazard common to all who had occasion to use the public highway. It is impossible to distinguish this case from <em>Donahue\u2019s Case, </em>226 Mass. 595, where it was held that an employee could not recover for an injury caused by a fall on an icy street. The case is governed by <em>Donahue\u2019s Case. </em>See <em>Whitley\u2019s Case, ante, </em>211, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">The decree must be reversed and a decree entered for the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
