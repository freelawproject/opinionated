He was walking on a public sidewalk in the course of his employment, when he slipped on the ice and fell. He was awarded compensation. The insurer\u2019s appeal brings the case to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-14\">It was decided in <em>McNicol\u2019s Case, </em>215 Mass. 497, that an injury does not arise out of the employment unless it follows as a natural incident of the employee\u2019s work. If the injury cannot be traced to the employment as a contributing, proximate cause, but comes from a danger to which the employee is exposed, apart from his employment, or if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>danger causing the injury was not peculiar to his work, but was common to the neighborhood, then the injury does not arise out of the employment. This case was followed by <em>Donahue\u2019s Case, </em>226 Mass. 595. It was there held that an injury to an employee, caused by slipping upon ice in a public street, did not arise out of his employment, although he was called upon to use the street in the performance of his work; that the risk of falling upon a slippery street or sidewalk was common to everyone travelling on a street or on a highway, and was not peculiar to the employment. That case is decisive of the law of the Commonwealth. It has not been overruled. We are bound by it, and it must be followed in decisions arising under the workman\u2019s compensation act. That an employee cannot recover under the act for an injury resulting from a fall upon ice on a public street is settled by <em>Donahue\u2019s Case; </em>see <em>Hewitt\u2019s Case, </em>225 Mass. 1. The same principle was applied in <em>Braley\u2019s Case, </em>237 Mass. 105, and in <em>Gardner\u2019s Case, </em>247 Mass. 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The facts disclosed in <em>Moran\u2019s Case, </em>234 Mass. 566, and <em>Cook\u2019s Case, </em>243 Mass. 572, 573, distinguish them from the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">It follows that the decree must be reversed and a decree entered for the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
