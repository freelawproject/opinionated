At the employer\u2019s request he was appointed a special police officer, and each year it was necessary for him to go to police headquarters to be sworn to fulfil the duties of his office. On the last day of March, he was notified by his superintendent that he was to report the next morning at police headquarters, Pemberton Square, Boston. He left the employer\u2019s place of business about thirty minutes after nine o\u2019clock on the morning of April 1, and walked toward Pemberton Square. While crossing Tremont Street, near Scollay Square, he was struck by an automobile and injured. He was awarded compensation. The insurer appealed. The question in the case is, Did the injury arise out of his employment?</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">In this Commonwealth in proceedings under the workman\u2019s compensation act, to be entitled to compensation the injury must arise out of or be caused by the employment. It has been held that an injury resulting from a collision with an automobile, moving on a public street, is not an injury which under ordinary circumstances arises out of the employment; although at the time the employee is engaged in the employer\u2019s business. It has been held that the danger of being struck by a passing automobile does not arise out of the employment, but is a danger peculiar to public travel, to which all pedestrians upon the public ways are exposed. <em>Gardner\u2019s Case, </em>247 Mass. 308. See <em>Braley\u2019s Case, </em>237 Mass. 105; <em>Hewitt\u2019s Case, </em>225 Mass. 1; <em>Donahue\u2019s Case, </em>226 Mass. 595; <em>Whitley\u2019s Case, post, </em>211; <em>Blakely\u2019s Case, post, </em>212. The same principle has been applied in all these cases and is decisive of the case at bar. <em>Moran\u2019s Case, </em>234 Mass. 566, and <em>Cook\u2019s Case, </em>243 Mass. 572, are not controlling. The case is governed by <em>Gardner\u2019s Case, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">The decree must be reversed, and a decree entered for the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
