Under such circumstances there is no liability in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">The evidence fails to show any of. the facts which have been held to create liability in cases of injury from snow or ice.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">The building did not project over the way on which the plaintiff was passing so as to discharge snow or ice upon it as in <em>Smethurst </em>v. <em>Barton Square Independent Congregational Church, </em>148 Mass. 260, <em>Marston </em>v. <em>Phipps, </em>209 Mass. 552. It did not stand so near the way and it was not so constructed that snow or water necessarily fell from it upon the way, as in <em>Shipley </em>v. <em>Fifty Associates, </em>106 Mass. 194.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-11\">There was no accumulation and subsequent discharge of water from the defendants\u2019 building, as in <em>Hynes </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>194 Mass. 435, <em>Drake </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>203 Mass. 528, <em>Cerchione </em>v. <em>Hunnewell, </em>215 Mass. 588. There was no defective condition such that water was collected or ice was formed to create a nuisance or a condition of especial danger, as in <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>Goodall, </em>138 Mass. 533, <em>Coman </em>v. <em>Alles, </em>198 Mass. 99. The case more nearly resembles <em>O\u2019Donoghue </em>v. <em>Moors, </em>208 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>473. See also <em>Tiffany </em>v. <em>F. Vorenberg Co. </em>238 Mass. 183; <em>Sanborn </em>v. <em>McKeagney, </em>229 Mass. 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">We need not consider whether the plaintiff stood in the position of a trespasser or of a licensee. The judge was right in directing a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
