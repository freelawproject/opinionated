Upon the People\u2019s motion, count II was dismissed. Mat\u00f3la pleaded not guilty. On the date of trial Mat\u00f3la\u2019s counsel made a motion to sever his trial from that of his codefendant, Lotto. The motion was denied upon the prosecuting attorney\u2019s representation to the court that the confession could and would be edited to delete all reference to Mat\u00f3la. The motion was not renewed. The codefendants were both convicted. A jury found Mat\u00f3la guilty of grand theft from tlie person, in violation of subdivision 2, section 487 of the Penal Code, a lesser but necessarily included offense in that charged in count I of the information. His motion for new trial was denied, probation was denied, and he was committed to the Youth Authority for the term prescribed by law. Mat\u00f3la appeals from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">On appeal Mat\u00f3la contends: (1) The trial court erred in denying Mat\u00f3la\u2019s motion to sever his trial from that of his eodefendant, Lotto; (2) the trial court erred in failing to declare a mistrial when the prosecuting attorney elicited testimony from Lotto relating to the same subject matter which had been stricken from Lotto\u2019s confession; and (3) the trial court erred in failing to declare a mistrial when Lotto was allowed to answer his own counsel\u2019s questions concerning the portions of his confession theretofore stricken by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">\n<em>Summary of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b709-10\">According to the prosecution\u2019s witnesses the facts were these: On July 30, 1966, at 7 o\u2019clock in the evening Margaret Stanley was walking down Venice Boulevard. Two boys struck her in the back, knocked her down, and jerked on her purse. The purse fell to the ground, and the boys picked it up and ran. Miss Stanley tried to pursue them but she fell. She saw Messrs. McKenzie and Bilderback nearby and told them what had happened. The two men had seen the boys run by and had also seen one of the boj^s stooped down by a bush and the other, later identified as Mat\u00f3la, standing on the sidewalk. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>After Mat\u00f3la and Lotto left, McKenzie went over to the bush, retrieved the victim\u2019s purse and gave it to the police. McKenzie and Bilderback followed Mat\u00f3la and Lotto. Officer Lucia, at about 7:20 p.m., received a report of the purse snatching on his police radio. The two men flagged down the officer, who talked with them. Mat\u00f3la and Lotto were arrested shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">At the time of their arrest Officer Lucia advised Lotto and Mat\u00f3la of their constitutional rights in a manner adequate to comply with the <em>Dorado-Escobedo-Miranda </em>cases.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After the boys had been taken to the police station, Lotto was interrogated by Officer Rube, who again advised Lotto of his constitutional rights. Lotto said he understood his rights. Lotto made a confession, stating: \"What will happen to me if I confess to this? I guess I am just a stoop. S-t-o-o-p. I grabbed the old lady\u2019s purse. <em>Don\u2019t know whether Mitch [Tommy </em>Mat\u00f3la] <em>hit her or not. </em>No, I wasn\u2019t drunk, <em>but he kept egging me on to do it. </em>There was only a five Marlboro pack with smoked butts in it; so I laid it on the ground. <em>Suppose if someone told me to jump off the pier, I would. </em>Don't know why I did it. I have a job and make good money.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Outside the presence of the jury Lotto\u2019s counsel conducted a <em>voir dire </em>examination of the officer who took the confession, trying to establish that the confession was involuntary. The court denied his motion to suppress the confession. Immediately thereafter Mat\u00f3la\u2019s counsel moved to delete the italicized words from the confession. The court granted Mat\u00f3la\u2019s motion and Lotto\u2019s counsel promptly objected on Lotto\u2019s behalf, pointing out to the court, \"The statements that are being deleted are probably proper under the <em>Aranda </em>ease, but nevertheless would prejudice defendant Lotto, and I would like the record to so indicate.\u201d The court overruled his objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">At that moment the <em>Aranda</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>crunch was foreseeable, but no one saw quite how the impact would occur or how to avert it. Mat\u00f3la\u2019s counsel could have renewed his severance motion, but he had little reason to believe at that time that round two would be more successful than round one, particularly since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>the court had granted his motion to strike the italicized words' from the confession. If the words stayed erased, his client-had no cause to complain. He could not predict the strategy of counsel for the codefendant and until something else happened he could not move for a mistrial. Lotto\u2019s counsel did all he could to protect his record. If the trial court had had the gifts of Cassandra, it could have invited mistrial motions and, perhaps, aborted the proceedings without jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">The moment passed and the edited confession was introduced by the prosecution before the jury. Lotto\u2019s counsel did not attempt to bring out the deletions in cross-examining the police officer. The People rested and had the ease then closed, <em>Aranda </em>would have faded away. This was not to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">Lotto was called to the stand to testify on his own behalf and trouble began with the first question put to him.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-8\"><em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>Q. Mr. Lotto, tell us in your own words what happened as to the events that occurred on the 30th, of the events as testified by the previous witnesses. Start at the beginning and tell the jury what happened. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-9\">\u201cA. Well, Tommy and I was walking up . . . \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">The court interrupted by calling a recess. The 20-minute recess is a blank in the record. When service was restored, the direct examination began: \u201cMr. Lotto, directing your attention to the day of the alleged robbery, what time were you arrested by the police ? A. About 6 :30, 7:00 o \u2019clock. \u201c Q. . . . At the time you were arrested was the defendant Mat\u00f3la also arrested? A. Yes.\u201d The remainder of the direct examination was confined to the circumstances of Lotto\u2019s arrest and his subsequent interrogation and confession. Nothing more was said about Mat\u00f3la, and the deletions from the confessions were untouched.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-11\"><em>Aranda </em>started on its inexorable course with the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of Lotto. The prosecutor moved in slowly, working from the station-house interrogation backwards to the arrest and ultimately to the circumstances ante-ceding the arrest: \u201c Q. Had you been with Tommy all day ? \u2019 \u2019 Both codefendants\u2019 counsel objected on the ground that the examination was beyond the scope of direct. The court overruled the objections, and Lotto said, \u201cYes.\u201d Over repeated objections on the same ground, the court permitted the prosecutor to bore in on the activities of both defendants before their arrest. The prosecutor got Lotto to admit that he grabbed the victim\u2019s purse, but he denied that he struck her. Lotto testified that after he grabbed the purse, he and Mat\u00f3la <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>ran away. He was asked, \u201cWhen did you decide to rob her? A. By the time we got next to her. Q. Was it your idea? A. Not really, partly mine. Well, it was Tommy\u2019s idea in a way. Q. Who first brought up the subject of robbing Miss Stanley, taking her purse ? A. Tommy. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">With Mat\u00f3la named as the principal instigator by Lotto\u2019s testimony on cross-examination, Mat\u00f3la had little choice in strategy. He took the stand. His story was that he and Lotto were together, beginning in the midmorning on the day of the robbery. As they were walking down the street, Lotto told Mat\u00f3la that he was going to snatch the old lady\u2019s purse because he needed to make up a $10 loss he had had that day. Mat\u00f3la thought he was kidding, but when he saw Lotto approaching the lady, Mat\u00f3la began to run away. He ran past the victim and did not slow down until he reached the corner, then he ran two more blocks until he stopped to catch his breath. Lotto (who was carrying something) ran, too, and caught up with Mat\u00f3la. Mat\u00f3la denied any complicity in the robbery or the striking of the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">The denouement was inevitable. Lotto was recalled for redirect examination. His counsel took him word for word through the unexpurgated version of his confession. Mat\u00f3la\u2019s counsel interposed no objections. No further motions were made. The ease went to the jury, and both defendants were convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">\n<em>Error in Overruling Objections</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Aft\">Section 1323 of the Penal Code<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in relevant part states that where a defendant offers himself as a witness \u201che may be cross-examined by the counsel for the people as to all matters about which he was examined in chief.\u201d After quoting this language the court said, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Zerillo </em>(1950) 36 Cal.2d 222, 228 [223 P.2d 223] : \u201cThis does not mean that the cross-examination must be confined to a mere categorical review of the matters, dates or times mentioned in the direct examination. [Citations omitted.] It may be directed to the eliciting of any matter which may tend to overcome or qualify the effect of the testimony given by him on his direct examination. [Citations omitted.]\u201d Defendant, according to the leading case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Teshara </em>(1904) 141 Cal. 633, 638 [75 P. 338], \u201c. . . can be cross-examined with respect to facts or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>denials which are necessarily implied from the testimony in chief, as well as with respect to facts which he expressly states. And he cannot, by beginning his narrative at a particular moment of the occurrence, limit the cross-examination to the same exact period. The cross-examination may extend to the whole transaction, of which he gives a part, and which occurred in immediate connection with the part he relates, shortly before or after, and in which he must have been concerned, or of which he may be reasonably supposed to have had knowledge.\u201d (Quoted in part in <em>People </em>v. <em>Diaz </em>(1962) 206 Cal.App.2d 651, 669 [24 Cal.Rptr. 367]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Goldstein </em>(1948) 84 Cal.App.2d 581, 588 [191 P.2d 102].)</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Although the scope of cross-examination delineated by these rules is quite generous, it is not generous enough to justify the prosecutor\u2019s excursion into the circumstances anteceding the arrest of the codefendants. The fragment of Lotto\u2019s answer on direct examination, \u201cWell, Tommy and I was walking up . . . ,\u201d cut off as it was by the court, cannot he deemed to have opened the door exposing to the cross-examiner\u2019s probe the vista of everything that happened during the promenade. Lotto did not testify \u201cto a state of things contrary to and inconsistent with the evidence of the prosecution, thus indirectly denying the testimony against him,\u201d thus opening the inquiry into the facts which were impliedly denied. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Teshara, supra, </em>141 Cal. at p. 638.) Lotto\u2019s story amounted to an avoidance of the confession. not a denial of the prosecution\u2019s testimony against him. <em>(Cf. People </em>v. <em>Robinson </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 373, 392-393 [38 Cal.Rptr. 890, 392 P.2d 970].)</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">The court erred in overruling the objections based on the prosecutor\u2019s exceeding the hounds of proper cross-examination.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The error might not have been prejudicial to Mat\u00f3la, however, if the <em>Aranda </em>problem had not permeated the whole trial. It is the combination of <em>Aranda </em>with the improper cross-examination of Lotto which compels us to reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">\n<em>Application of Aranda</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">Section 1098 of the Penal Code provides that defendants jointly charged with any public offense must be tried jointly unless the court in its discretion orders separate trials. Recog<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>nizing that, th.e practice of permitting joint trials when the confession of one-defendant implicates a codefendant can be prejudicial and unfair, the Supreme Court adopted the following rules of practice to implement section 1098 in <em>People </em>v. <em>Aranda, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d 518, 530-531: \u20181 When the prosecution proposes to introduce into evidence an extrajudicial statement of one defendant that implicates a codefendant, the trial court must adopt one of the following procedures: (1) It can permit a joint trial if all parts of the extrajudicial statements implicating any codefendants can be and are effectively deleted without prejudice to the declarant. By effective deletions, we mean not only direct and indirect identifications of codefendants but any statements that could be employed against nondeclarant codefendants once their identity is otherwise established. (2) It can grant severance of trials if the prosecution insists that it must use the extrajudicial statements and it appears that effective deletions cannot be made. (3) If the prosecution has successfully resisted a motion for severance and thereafter offers an extrajudicial statement implicating a codefendant, the trial court must exclude it if effective deletions are not possible. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Criminal defendants thus cannot be jointly tried if the confession of one of them will be introduced and the confession cannot be effectively edited to remove any statement which can be used against the nondeclarant defendant. <em>Aranda </em>does not purport to spell out the mechanics of the editorial process, nor to delineate precisely the appropriate procedure for attacking a continued joint trial if a deletion reappears at the instance of anyone other than the prosecutor.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Bules (1) and (3) however, do recognize that initial editing may apparently sanitize a confession and yet, due to later events, may prove ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">In ruling upon a severance motion, the trial court must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>alert at the outset to factors which are harbingers of editorial failure. If the parts of the confession affecting a codefendant favor or may favor the confessing defendant, the deletion of those statements is not going to stick. The declarant\u2019s counsel will want to bring them out, either upon cross-examination of the person who testifies to the confession, or upon direct examination of the declarant if he takes the stand. Were he prevented from bringing out evidence favorable to his declarant client, to protect the nondeclarant, the declarant would himself be prejudiced by the joint trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">The trial court in this case denied the motion to sever solely on the basis that the prosecuting attorney represented that the confession could and would be successfully edited. The trial court had no reason to doubt the prosecutor\u2019s good faith in so stating, but all the prosecutor could assure the court was that he himself would not offer the offending passages. His own restraint could not affect defense counsel's duty or strategy. Had the trial court closely examined the confession, including the proposed excisions, the ineffectiveness of the prosecutor\u2019s assurance would have been evident. The court prejudicially erred in denying the severance motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">In view of our disposition of the central issues of the appeal, it is unnecessary to discuss the remaining contentions of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">Kaus, P.
