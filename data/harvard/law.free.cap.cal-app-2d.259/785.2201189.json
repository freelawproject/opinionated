Both offenses were allegedly committed on March 10, 1967. Defendant demurred to count II of the complaint on the ground that section 602.7 of the Penal Code is unconstitutional. The court sustained the demurrer and dismissed count II of the complaint. The People appealed from the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-11\">The appellate department of the superior court reversed the judgment and remanded the cause for further proceedings, and thereupon certified the appeal to this court pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>rufe'':63 ;ofv.the:.-f\u00edaU\u00a3Qrhia-_ Rules' .of. Court.- .We .accepted the transfer 'morder to settle an important question of law.- - \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">\u25a0 We have- concluded' that- section -602:7 of the Penal Code is constitutional for the reasons stated in the opinion prepared for the appellate department by Judge Aiso, in which Judges Meyer and Whyte concurred. We adopt the following portions of 'that opinion as our own, omitting only those portions which we do not believe to be necessary to the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">\u201cWe are asked to determine whether Penal Code \u00a7 602.7 is void for' vagueness upon its face. \u00a7 602.7 provides: \u2018(a) In any case in which a person who is not a student or officer or employee of a state college or state .university, and who is not required by his employment to be on the campus or any other facility owned, operated or 'controlled by the governing board of - any such state college or state university, enters such campus or facility,- and it reasonably appears to the chief administrative officer of such campus or facility or to an officer. or employee designated by him to maintain order on such campus or facility that such person is committing any act likely to. interfere with the peaceful conduct of the activities of such campus or facility or has entered such campus or facility for the purpose of committing any such act, the chief administrative officer or officer or employee designated by him to maintain order on such campus or facility may direct such person \"to'leave'such campus or-facility, and if such person fails to do so, he is guilty of a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">\u201c\u2018(h) As used in this section:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-8\">\u201c\u2018(1) \u201cState university\u201d means the University of California,- and includes any affiliated institution thereof and any campus or. facility owned, operated or controlled by the Regents of the University of California.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-9\">\u201c\u2018 (2) \u201cState college\u201d means' -any California state college administered by the Trustees of the California State Colleges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-10\">\u201c \u2018 (3) \u201cChief administrative officer\u201d means the president of a state college or the officer designated by the Regents of the University of California or pursuant to authority granted by.the Regents of the University of California to administer and be the officer in charge of a campus or other facility owned, operated or controlled by the Regents of the University of California. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-11\">\u2018<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Having concluded .that the claim of ambiguity or vagueness on the face of the statute lacks merit, we hold the section t\u00f3 be constitutionally immune from such attack.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-12\">\u201cIn Count II of a \u25a0 misdemeanor complaint, defendant (respondent) Michael Robert Agnello was accused, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>language of the statute, with a violation of \u00a7'602.7, on or about March 10, 1967, in the City of Los Angeles. Demurrer to the complaint was interposed claiming that \u00a7 602.7 deprived defendant of his rights under the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution in that it violated :\u2022 (1) the due process clause because of vagueness, (2) the equal protection clause because of an improper classification, and (3) his First Amendment right of free speech as incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment.1 The trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend and ordered Count II dismissed, being 1 of the opinion that Section 602.7 is very vague and indefinite and . . . unconstitutional. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-6\">\u201cThe People have appealed from this order of dismissal made prior to trial and at defendant\u2019s request. It is properly here. (Penal Code \u00a7 1466, subd. 1 (a) ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Finch </em>(1953) 119 Cal.App.2d Supp. 892, 899 [258 P.2d 1124.]  Appeal from a final order dismissing only one count of a criminal complaint is proper even though there may be another count pending trial. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Saffell </em>(1946) 74 Cal.App.2d Supp. 967, 971 [168 P.2d 497].)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-7\">\u201cDefendant more specifically contends: (1) the phrases \u2018any act\u2019, \u2018likely to interfere\u2019, and \u2018peaceful conduct\u2019 are vague and ambiguous, especially when combined with \u2018reasonably appears\u2019; (2) the word \u2018student\u2019 has not been used with adequate specificity; and (3) the phrase \u2018reasonably appears\u2019 is a subjective standard which -.permits arbitrary action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-8\">\u201cOur present concern is with the meaning of these words and phrases as they -appear on the face of the statute; no-application of the statute to any actual set of facts is before us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-9\">\u201cThe adequacy in terms of certainty of regulations governing nonstudent use of public educational facilities was consid^-ered in <em>American Civil Liberties Union </em>v. <em>Board of Education </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 203 [28 Cal.Rptr. 700, 379 P.2d 4], A unanimous court rejected a claim of vagueness.  Speaking through Justice Peters, at page 218, it said, \u2018 \u201cReasonable certainty is all that is required. A statute will not be held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>void for uncertainty if any reasonable and practical construction can be given its language. \u201d... It will be upheld if its terms may be made reasonably certain by reference to other definable sources. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-5\">\u201cEven in the First Amendment area, the United States Supreme Court held the following test applicable in <em>Roth </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1957) 354 U.S. 476, 491-492 [1 L.Ed.2d 1498, 1510-1511, 77 S.Ct. 1304] : \u2018. . . [L] aclc of precision is not itself offensive to the requirements of due process. \u201c. . . [T]he Constitution does not require impossible standards\u201d; all that is required is that the language \u201cconveys sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices \u201cThat there may be marginal cases in which it is difficult to determine the side of the line on which a particular fact situation falls is no sufficient reason to hold the language too ambiguous to define a criminal offense ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">\u201cThe words \u2018any act' have a history as old as the common law itself. They are of everyday usage in the criminal jurisprudence of both this State and Nation. Absent an issue of marginal application, further elaboration is superfluous. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Victor </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 280, 298 [42 Cal.Rptr. 199, 398 P.2d 391] ; <em>In re De La O </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 128, 153 [28 Cal.Rptr. 489, 378 P.2d 793, 98 A.L.R.2d 705] ; <em>Lorenson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1950) 35 Cal.2d49, 60 [216 P.2d 859].)</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">\u201cA reading of the section as a whole fairly imports that the word \u2018student\u2019 means a student of the particular institution whose campus or facility is involved. (Penal Code \u00a7 7, subd. 16; <em>Mazza </em>v. <em>Austin </em>(1938) 25 Cal.App.2d 85, 87-88 [76 P.2d 533]; <em>People </em>v. <em>King </em>(1952) 115 Cal.App.2d Supp. 875, 878 [252 P.2d 78].)</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">\u201cThe word \u2018likely\u2019 is also no stranger to our criminal law. (See, e.g., Penal Code \u00a7 245 [assault by means of a force \u2018likely\u2019 to produce great bodily injury] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fuqua </em>(1881) 58 Cal. 245, 247 [deadly weapon: one \u2018 likely\u2019 to produce death or great bodily injury].) Moreover, it has been judicially construed as meaning at least \u2018 probable \u2019 <em>(Nevis </em>v. <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. </em>(1954) 43 Cal.2d 626, 632 [275 P.2d 761]; <em>Hoy </em>v. <em>Tornich </em>(1926) 199 Cal. 545, 554 [250 P. 565]; <em>Horning </em>v. <em>Gerlach </em>(1934) 139 Cal.App. 470, 473 [34 P.2d 504]), if not a word conveying even a stronger meaning than \u2018probable\u2019. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Nowell </em>(1941) 45 Cal.App.2d Supp. 811, 814 [114 P.2d 81], it is stated, \u2018 \u201cLikely,\u201d it appears, is the stronger word; the chances are a bit greater if a thing is likely than if it is merely probable\u2019. \u2018Probable\u2019 in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>the context of \u2018probable cause\u2019 has been repeatedly defined especially of late in connection with arrests and searches and seizures.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">\u201cThe word \u2018interfere\u2019 is a word of \u2018well recognized, defined meaning. . . .\u2019 <em>{Haggerty </em>v. <em>Associated Farmers of Calif. </em>(1955) 44 Cal.2d 60, 71 [279 P.2d 734] [construed in conjunction with picketing].) It imports to \u2018disarrange\u2019, \u2018disturb\u2019, or \u2018hinder\u2019. <em>{Conger </em>v. <em>Italian Vineyard Co. </em>(1921) 186 Cal. 404, 407 [199 P. 503].) Both legislatively and judicially, it is used with frequence. (See, e.g., Pen. Code, \u00a7 602, subd. (j); Agr. Code, \u00a7997; <em>People </em>v. <em>Poe </em>(1965) 236 Cal.App.2d Supp. 928, 937 [47 Cal.Rptr. 670].)</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">\u201cThe words 1 peaceful conduct\u2019 here employed in conjunction with \u2018activities of such campus or facility\u2019 are commonly understood words. They should present no ambiguity to the average person.  \u2018Words used in a statute should receive sensible construction in accordance with their commonly understood meaning.' <em>{People </em>v. <em>King </em>(1952) <em>supra, </em>115 Cal.App.2d Supp. 875, 878, cert. den. 345 U.S. 396 [97 L.Ed. 1392]; accord: <em>In re Davis </em>(1936) 18 Cal.App.2d 291, 296, 63 P.2d 853]; <em>Great Western etc., Inc. </em>v. <em>J. A. Wathen D. Co. </em>(1937) 10 Cal.2d 442, 446 [74 P.2d 745].)  \u2018The requirement of reasonable certainty does not preclude the use of ordinary terms to express ideas which find adequate interpretation in common usage and understanding. \u2019 <em>{Smith </em>v. <em>Peterson </em>(1955) 131 Cal.App.2d 241, 246 [280 P.2d 522, 49 A.L.R.2d 1194].) \u2018. . .  [C]ourts will not give strained meanings to legislative language, torturing that which is clear (or can be made clear by common sense interpretation) into opacity through a process of imaginative hypothesizing. To do so would be to rule that all criminal statutes must be written by linguistic purists. \u2019 <em>{People </em>v. <em>Buese </em>(1963) 220 Cal.App.2d 802, 806 [34 Cal.Rptr. 102].)</p>\n<p id=\"b813-10\">\u201c Finally, contrary to defendant\u2019s contention that the words \u2018reasonably appears\u2019 permit undelimited subjective appraisals, these are the very words that infuse into this statute the objective standard of a reasonable man having to have \u2018reasonable cause to believe\u2019 that an act interfering with the peaceful conduct of the institution\u2019s activities is being committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-12\">\u201c \u2018Reasonable appearance\u2019 is a well developed doctrine in our criminal law, especially in the area of self-defense, where apparent danger of imminent violence must be quickly weighed and evaluated. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Turner </em>(1948) 86 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>Cal.App.2d <em>791, 799 [195 P.2d 809]; People </em>v. <em>Toledo </em>(1948) 85 Cal.App.2d 577, 580 [193 P.2d 953] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Keys </em>(1944) 62 Cal.App.2d 903, 903, 916 [145 P.2d 589].) The criterion is not what subjectively appears reasonable to the actor whose decision is in question, but what would appear to a reasonable man in the actor\u2019s situation to be reasonable. The phrase' 1 reasonably appears \u2019 is therefore equivalent to requiring a \u2018reasonable cause to believe\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Chambers </em>(1937) 22 Cal.App.2d 687, 704 [72 P.2d 746]), which is the same standard as that prescribed in Penal Code \u00a7 833 (peace officer\u2019s search for dangerous weapons), Penal Code \u00a7 835a (peace officer\u2019s use of force to effect arrest), and Penal Code \u00a7 836 - (required basis for arrest). Therefore, protection against ouster upon the personal whim or arbitrary judgment of a chief administrator or officer or agent charged with maintenance of order on a campus or facility is provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">\u2018 \u2018 In summary, \u00a7 602.7 is a statute which draws upon breach of the peace and trespass concepts, but the gravamen of the offense is conduct\u2014refusal to obey a direction of a chief administrator<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or an officer or employee of a state university or college charged with maintaining order on his campus and in its facilities, when there is reasonable and probable cause to believe acts of the person directed to leave are interfering with the peaceful conduct of the activities for which the institution is dedicated or that such person came onto the campus or facility for the purpose of committing such act of interference,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and when the person directed to leave is not a student, officer, or employee of that institution and furthermore whose employment does not require him to be on such campus or facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">\u201cWe perceive no constitutional infirmity for uncertainty in this statute which thus punishes a refusal to move upon an order by one authorized to so order in the limited circumstances prescribed in \u00a7 602.7 <em>{Cox </em>v. <em>Louisiana </em>(1965) 379 U.S. 536, 551 [13 L.Ed.2d 471, 482, 85 S.Ct. 453]), where the act is likely to interfere with public property <em>{In re Bacon </em>(1966) 240 Cal.App.2d 34, 46-47 [49 Cal.Rptr. 322]) being used for the purposes for which it was dedicated <em>{Adderley </em>v. <em>Florida </em>(1966) 385 U.S. 39 [17 L.Ed.2d 149, 87 S.Ct. 242]).
