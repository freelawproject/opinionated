Tucker was charged by complaint with the crime of robbery, a felony. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 211.) Bail was duly fixed at $7,500, plus $750 penalty assessment. Appellant, a corporate surety, posted its bail bond in the required amount of $8,250 on February 19, and Tucker was released. Upon arraignment in the Los Angeles Superior Court, Tucker entered a plea of not guilty and the case was set for trial in department 104 of that court on April 2, a Friday. Tucker remained free on bail pending the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">On March 30, the Tuesday preceding the April 2 trial date by three days, the district attorney appeared in department 104 and made a presentation to the court. The showing and its results are set forth in the court\u2019s minute order dated March 30. The order\u2019s full text, excepting only the court caption, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-11\">\u201c Mar 30 1965 19</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-12\">\u2018 \u2018 The People oe the State oe California, vs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-13\">Robert F Tucker 300738</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-14\">\u201cCause is advanced from April 2, 1965, on motion of the District Attorney. Deputy District Attorney A H Stovitz, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>present. It being represented to the Court that defendant is under arrest in Canada, a bench warrant is issued herein. Bail if forfeited. No bail is fixed on the bench warrant. Emmett C Lightner is sworn and testifies for the People. Trial date remains April 2, 1965, 9 AM. (Bench warrant is issued.) \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">In its brief, and without contradiction from respondent, appellant states that the March 30 order was entered \u201cupon representation being made by the district attorney\u2019s office, and the testimony of Officer Lightner, that Tucker was in custody in Canada, ...\u201d The record shows no more concerning the proof adduced on the subject of Tucker\u2019s whereabouts on March 30. Appellant states that it was given no notice of the March 30 proceeding, and the record\u2014which we have augmented, as will appear\u2014does not show that notice thereof was given to appellant, Tucker or anyone else.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">On June 2, appellant filed a notice of motion to vacate and set aside the order of forfeiture and to exonerate the bail. The notice referred to the order as \u201cthe order of forfeiture entered 4-2-65.\u201d After several continuances, the court denied the motion by order entered on October 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">On the appeal (which is from the October 5 order denying appellant\u2019s motion), the parties argue such questions as the competence of evidence that Tucker was in custody elsewhere and the effect of his detention by civil authorities in another jurisdiction. We do not reach these points, however, because appellant also challenges\u2014and respondent defends\u2014the court\u2019s jurisdiction to make the order of March 30: and upon jurisdictional grounds we conclude that the order forfeiting bail was void and that the order appealed from must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">The statute here applicable is Penal Code, section 1305, which provides in relevant part that <em>\u201cIf, without sufficient excuse, the defendant neglects to appear . . </em>. for trial . . . , or upon any other occasion when his presence in court is lawfully required, . . . the court <em>must direct the fact to he entered upon its minutes </em>and the undertaking of bail . . . must thereupon be declared forfeited. ...\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">\u201c [W]here a statute requires a court to exercise its jurisdiction in a particular manner, follow a particular procedure, or subject to certain limitations, an act beyond those limits is in excess of jurisdiction.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Black </em>(1961) 55 Cal.2d 275, 277 [10 Cal.Rptr. 459, 358 P.2d 915]; <em>Burtnett </em>v. <em>King </em>(1949) 33 Cal.2d 805, 807 [205 P.2d 657, 12 A.L.R.2d 333]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Stuyvesant Ins. Co. </em>(1963) 216 Cal.App.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>380, 382 [31 Cal.Rptr. 208].)  In the manner in which Penal Code, section 1305 applies in the present case, it requires the court to order a bail forfeiture subject to the limitation\u2014stated in the statute as an express condition precedent\u2014that the defendant has neglected to appear for trial. Manifestly, Tucker on March 30 had not neglected to appear for a trial which was set for April 2. Lacking the essential jurisdictional fact on March 30, the forfeiture order made on that date was in excess of jurisdiction and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">In this regard, respondent argues (1) that the order made on March 30 was in fact formally entered in the court\u2019s minutes on April 2, not on March 30; (2) that, according to authorities cited <em>(Talman </em>v. <em>Talman </em>(1966) 244 Cal.App.2d 799, 809 [53 Cal.Rptr. 514]; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Stein </em>(1956) 145 Cal.App.2d 381, 383-384 [302 P.2d 403]), it was not effective until it was entered; and that this court should presume that its jurisdictional prerequisites were met <em>on April 2 </em>because the record on appeal as requested by appellant did not show to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">The thrust of this argument is that the order made on March 30, becoming effective upon its entry on April 2, established on its face the defendant\u2019s failure to appear for trial on the later date. Because we were unwilling to accept the argument\u2019s third element\u2014which in effect urged us to presume from a silent record that Tucker was in fact missing on April 2\u2014we augmented the record on appeal (upon our own motion, pursuant to rule 12(a), Cal. Rules of Court) to include the full file of the superior court in the proceedings below.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">The augmented record invalidates respondent\u2019s argument entirely. The order made on March 30 was formally entered in the court\u2019s minutes on April 6, not April 2.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Since nothing in its text as made or entered refers to Tucker\u2019s appearance or nonappearance on April 2, it gains nothing from the date of its entry on April 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">The augmented record does contain an order which was actually made on April 2 (and formally \u201centered\u201d on April 9). It states only \u201cDefendant\u2019s counsel J Forno, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>present. Bench warrant heretofore issued on March 30, 1965. \u2019 \u2019 Thus, neither order\u2014March 30 or April 2\u2014recites the facts (1) that Tucker had failed to appear for trial on April 2 <em>and </em>(2) that his nonappearance was \u201cwithout sufficient cause.\u201d Under the express terms of Penal Code section 1305, both facts \u201cmust\u201d be entered upon the court\u2019s minutes in connection with a bail forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Upon nonappearance of the defendant, his surety becomes liable by operation of the statute, and the court\u2019s action in recording the essential facts is ministerial and mandatory. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Burton </em>(1956) 146 Cal.App.2d Supp. 878, 883 [305 P.2d 302].)  The March 30 forfeiture order was therefore in excess of the court\u2019s jurisdiction and void for the additional\u2014but closely related\u2014-reason that the court failed to comply with the statute in recording the essential facts: i.e., the court failed to \u20181 exercise its jurisdiction in a particular manner,\u201d or to \u201cfollow a particular procedure, . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Black, supra, </em>55 Cal.2d 275 at p. 277; <em>Burtnett </em>v. <em>King, supra, </em>33 Cal.2d 805 at p. 807<em>; People </em>v. <em>Stuyvesant Ins. Co., supra, </em>216 Cal.App.2d 380 at p. 382.)</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">The order appealed from is reversed. The lower court is directed to grant the motion to vacate the order forfeiting bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">Devine, P. J., and Christian, J\u201e concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b656-15\">A11 dates and events herein mentioned occurred in 1965.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b658-9\">In appellant\u2019s motion to vacate the forfeiture order made on March 30, the order was identified as \u201centered 4-2-65.\u201d In the clerk\u2019s transcript on appeal, a photocopy of the order did not legibly reproduce the entry date stamped on the original. It appears that respondent, for these reasons and in complete good faith, asserted to this court that the order . was entered on April 2. The date-stamp on the order in the superior court \u25a0file clearly shows that the order was entered on April 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
