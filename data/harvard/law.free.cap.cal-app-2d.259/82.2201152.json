He has appealed from \u201cthe judgment\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and from the order denying his motion for a new trial. We dismiss the attempted appeal from the nonappealable order denying the new trial and reverse the judgment (order granting probation).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">On February 24, 1966, the Lynwood Police Department received a report of a burglary at an address on Peach Street in that city. On investigation Officer Walker was told by Miss Young that a man, driving a light colored Ford, had been following her and had parked in front of her apartment building on several occasions. She reported that, returning to her apartment about 11 p.m., after a brief visit to the manager\u2019s office, she had discovered her door open and her purse missing. About midnight on February 26, 1966, she reported to Officer Walker that the same man had again parked in front of her apartment, that she and a male friend had accosted him but that, after a brief conversation, he had driven off. On that occasion she had secured the license number of his car, which she gave to the officer. At about 2 a.m. the next morning the same officer, then driving a patrol car, saw a light colored Ford carrying the license number given to him by Miss Young. He stopped the car, defendant alighted and, after a conversation, defendant was arrested on suspicion of burglary and robbery.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In plain sight on the seat of the car <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>was a loaded revolver.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> search of the car disclosed the object which forms the basis for the present prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">At the trial, objection was made to the introduction of the object in question, on the ground that it was the product of an illegal search. There was testimony that the search followed defendant\u2019s arrest and also followed the giving of the required <em>Dorado </em>warnings and that defendant, after his arrest and warning, had consented to the search. We need not determine whether or not the search was pursuant to a voluntary consent, since we hold that the trial court properly ruled that the arrest was lawful, thus sustaining the contemporaneous search of the car even absent defendant\u2019s consent. Defendant points to inconsistencies in the officers\u2019 testimony as to when the arrest occurred and when the warnings were given, but those matters went only to the issue of credibility and the determination of the trial court adverse to defendant binds us here. While the showing of probable cause is not strong, still we think that the trial court correctly decided that it existed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">On appeal, defendant argues that section 12020 is too vague to meet constitutional standards. That contention has heretofore been made and rejected in <em>People </em>v. <em>Grubb </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 614, 619-622 [47 Cal.Rptr. 772, 408 P.2d 100], and in <em>People </em>v. <em>Mulherin </em>(1934) 140 Cal.App. 212 [35 P.2d 174],</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b107-11\">However, while the statute itself is not too vague to satisfy constitutional standards, we conclude that a jury is entitled to some guidance as to the meaning of the statutory terms. As we shall point out, no such guidance was given in the case at bench.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-12\">The object herein involved is a self-designed object consist<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>ing of a metal bar, 334 inches long and %\u201d in diameter, to which has been welded a metal strap, 1 inch in width and about 6% inches long. The strap has been bent, with each end welded to the ends of the metal bar, so as to form an oblong object with a space between the bar and the strap about 1 inch in width. The outside of the strap has been roughened with a file or some similar device.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Defendant testified that it was constructed, at his order, for the purpose of welding it to his tool box as a handle and that the strap surface had been roughened in order to permit a clean weld. He was supported by a witness who testified that he had cut for defendant several lengths of metal bar of the type used in the object before us and by a witness who testified that, after defendant\u2019s arrest in this case, he had assisted defendant in manufacturing a similar object and welding it to a tool box. The box, with such a handle, was introduced in evidence and is before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Clearly, as the Attorney General points out, the box and its handle are open to the objection that they were manufactured after the event and that this may have been done in order to support the defense theory at the trial. Although defendant\u2019s conversation with police officers at the police station immediately after his arrest was not introduced by the prosecution, he testified, without contradiction, that he had then told the officers the same story as to the purpose and function of the metal object herein involved as he told at the trial. If his theory was invented after the arrest it was, at least, invented quite promptly. In any event, the importance of the box with its handle lies in the fact that they do prove that the object found in defendant\u2019s possession, and made the basis of the present charge, did have a possible legitimate use. To that extent, at least, they corroborate defendant\u2019s contention and raise the issue of the purpose and intended use of the object found.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">It will be noted that the statute contains no definition of the term \u201cmetal knuckles\u201d (nor of any of the other articles, the possession of which it proscribes). Dictionary definitions are not particularly helpful. The Third Edition of Webster\u2019s International Dictionary defines the more commonly used term \u201cbrass knuckles,\u201d as follows: \u201cA set of four metal finger rings or guards attached to a transverse piece and worn over the front of the doubled fist for use as a weapon.\u201d Other dictionary definitions are cast in substantially the same form. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>We set out illustrative definitions in the margin.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It will be noted that, except possibly the next to the last one quoted, none of them describe the object herein involved, which has no rings or finger holes, which, while it would \u201cenclose\u201d the knuckles, cannot be said to \u201cfit\u201d over the knuckles, and which, because of the wide area between the bar and plate, would be of doubtful value as a \u201cprotection\u201d to the hand of the user, however damaging it might be to the assailee.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Judicial construction is no more helpful. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Ferguson </em>(1933) 129 Cal.App. 300 [18 P.2d 741], the character of the object was admitted, the defense being that defendant possessed it only as a curio and without any intent to use it as a weapon\u2014a defense which the court rejected. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Quinones </em>(1934) 140 Cal.App. 609 [35 P.2d 638], the major issue was the contention that the instrument therein involved (described as consisting \u201cof alternate strips of sheet lead and gum tape, making a set of knuckles somewhat in the shape of a bracelet and of a size to fit over four finger knuckles\u201d) was not within the statute because not made entirely of metal. That contention the court rejected. In its discussion, it quoted (at page 611) from the Century Dictionary, saying: \u201cOne of the common English meanings of \u2018knuckle\u2019 is \u2018a piece of metal, usually brass worn over the knuckles in order to protect them in striking a blow and to make the blow more effective.\u2019 (Cent. Diet.)\u201d The court then pointed out that there was, in that case, expert testimony that the object therein in question was \u201ca pair of metal knuckles.\u201d We advert to the latter statement at a later place in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>Out-of-state eases, so far as the research of counsel and our own research disclose, add nothing to the above scanty authority. Of those found, two<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> decide only that a statute referring to \u201cbrass\u201d knuckles was violated by possession of a weapon made of some other metal; two<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> hold only that it was not a demurrable defect to use the slang term \u201cknucks\u201d instead of the statutory word \u2018 \u2018knuckles. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">We can find in the record only one piece of evidence that attempts to identify the object involved as being within the statutory prohibition. In describing the search of the ear that led to the finding of the article, Officer Walker testified: \u201cI observed a pair of vinyl gloves sticking out from the visor on the top. I reached up to remove the vinyl gloves and I got\u2014 the metal knuckle attachment came down with it.\u201d We recognize that, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Quinones, supra </em>(1934) 140 Cal.App. 609, the court held that the object therein involved was sufficiently shown to meet the statutory prohibition by the testimony of a police inspector \u201cof many years\u2019 experience,\u201d that the object he had found was \u201ca pair of metal knuckles.\u201d But in so holding, the court expressly relied on the inspector\u2019s rank and experience to give him the status of an expert. In the case at bench, we know nothing of Officer Walker\u2019s background or experience\u2014for all that appears in this record he may have been the department\u2019s newest recruit.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">We note one other item. The offer of evidence was of the object itself, and it was the object that was received in evidence.  But the exhibit before us has attached to it, by a piece of string, a form of the Lynwood Police Department, entitled \u201cRecovered Property,\u201d to which are stapled forms used by the clerks of the municipal and superior courts, showing the receipt of the object as \u201cExhibit 1,\u201d in each court. The physical condition of the entire exhibit is such that it is apparent that not only the metal object but also the three pieces of paper so stapled together had gone to the jury. The \u201cRecovered Property\u201d form, in handwriting, identifies the object attached thereto as \u201cone home made brass knuckle.\u201d When, how, or by whom, that classification was made we do not know. Clearly it adds nothing to the People\u2019s proof and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>may well have been prejudicial to defendant in the minds of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">As the Attorney General points out, the cases, both in California and elsewhere, have given to statutes such as section 12020 a liberal construction. As we read them, the cases distinguish between objects\u2014such as the metal knuckles involved in <em>People </em>v. <em>Quinones, supra </em>(1934) 140 Cal.App. 609, and the alleged \u201cslung shot\u201d involved in <em>People </em>v. <em>Mulherin, supra </em>(1934) 140 Cal.App. 212\u2014which clearly fall within dictionary definitions and which are so constructed as to have no possible legitimate use, and objects\u2014such as the alleged \u201cbilly\u201d involved in <em>People </em>v. <em>Grubb, supra </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 614\u2014which might be used either as a deadly weapon or as a legitimate tool or for legitimate sport.  As to eases involving objects of the latter and indeterminate type, the Supreme Court said in <em>Grubb, </em>at page 620: \u201cThe Legislature here sought to outlaw the classic instruments of violence and their homemade equivalents; the Legislature sought likewise to outlaw possession of the sometimes-useful object when the attendant circumstances, including the time, place, destination of the possessor, the alteration of the object from standard form, and other relevant facts indicated that the possessor would use the object for a dangerous, not harmless purpose. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">In cases where the object clearly is usable only as an illegal weapon, it may be sufficient to instruct the jury by giving them (in addition to an instruction such as was given here) only the dictionary definition.  And expert testimony that the object in evidence falls within such a definition meets any requirement of evidentiary support.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">But where the object may have a legitimate and lawful use, we conclude that <em>Grubb </em>requires (either with or without expert testimony) that there be evidence tending to show that, at the time and place of the alleged illegal possession, the possessor contemplated the unlawful and not the lawful use.  And, in such a case, the jury must be given, in addition to the instructions above discussed, an instruction covering the rule which the Supreme Court expressed in the language above quoted from the <em>Grubb </em>opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">In the case at bench, there was some evidence bearing on the purpose for which the object was carried in the car. The officers testified that they had first noticed a loaded pistol lying on the car seat and that, when asked as to the purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>of that article, defendant had replied that it was \u201cfor protection, \u2019 \u2019 with an explanation of fear of attack by certain ex-convicts. The officers\u2019 testimony was that, when the alleged metal knuckle was found, they had asked defendant as to its purpose and that he had replied that it was \u201cfor protection also.\u201d This defendant denied, claiming that the \u201cfor protection,\u201d remark had been made only in connection with the pistol and that he had, as to the alleged metal knuckle, given the same explanation as he gave later to the officers at the police station and at the trial. The issue as to purpose was, thus, squarely joined.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">But the jury was never told that this conflicting evidence was important, nor was it given any other guide to determine whether the object was a \u201cmetal knuckle\u201d and not a box handle. The sole instruction at all pertinent here<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> was as follows: 1 \u2018 The law just stated, which forbids the possession of certain types of weapons, although naming several such specifically, also includes all other weapons of the same kind, and it leaves to you, the jury, to determine from the evidence whether the defendant possessed any instrument or object so named in the law or of the same kind as those so named, as charged in the information. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Had there been legitimate evidence, from a proven expert, that the object was a \u201cmetal knuckle,\u201d and had no other possible use, and had the trial court instructed the jury in terms similar to the language above quoted from <em>People </em>v. <em>Grubb, </em>so that the jury\u2019s attention was properly directed to the elements which distinguish an illegal from a legal object, an implied finding that the object herein involved was possessed for a dangerous purpose and not for use as a box handle would have had support. But no such instruction was given.  We cannot say, on this record, that the jury returned its verdict because it believed that defendant had admitted an improper purpose for the object, or because it had relied on the non-expert opinion of Officer Walker, or on the anonymous classification on the property slip, or because it had evolved some definition of its own. A verdict resting only on such speculations may not stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">The attempted appeal from the order denying a new trial is dismissed; the judgment (order granting probation) is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">Piles, P. J., and Je\u00edferson, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b106-7\">\"Any person in this state who manufactures or causes to be manufactured, imports into the state, keeps for sale, or offers or exposes for sale, or who gives, lends, or possesses any instrument or weapon of the kind commonly known as a blackjack, slungshot, billy, sandclub, sandbag, sawed-off shotgun, or metal knuckles, or who carries concealed upon his person any explosive substance, other than fixed ammunition or who carries concealed upon his person any dirk or dagger, is guilty of a felony, and upon conviction shall be punishable by imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding one year or in a state prison for not less than one year nor more than five years. \u2019 <em>\u2019</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b106-8\">We treat the notice as being the permissible appeal from the order granting probation.
