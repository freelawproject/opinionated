Cole became ill in December of 1964, was hospitalized on December 8th, and his illness was diagnosed as being caused by cancer. Cole was disabled from thereafter making any public appearances, but payments were made to Farnon pursuant to paragraphs 4b and 4c of the contract to and through January 31, 1965. On February 1, 1965, Cole underwent surgery and on the same date a letter was sent giving plaintiff notice of termination of the contract. Cole died on February 15, 1965, and defendant Maria Cole became the duly appointed, qualified and acting executrix of Cole\u2019s estate. On March 31, 1965, plaintiff filed a claim against the estate upon the theory that the contract did not terminate with Cole\u2019s death, that paragraph 4f thereof guaranteed $25,000 for the term of the agreement, and that deducting the $11,900 paid to him through January 31, 1965, there remained due and payable to him the unpaid balance of $13,100. Defendant executrix did not act on the claim within 10 days of its filing; plaintiff elected to treat the claim as rejected and filed this action against defendant on May 25, 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">The trial court, sitting without a jury, found in favor of defendant executrix and against plaintiff on February 2, 1966. The court found \u201cthat as a result of the illness and resulting death of Nathaniel Cole, on February 15, 1965, the contract . . . was terminated by Act of God; that the obliga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>tions of the parties thereunder were suspended <em>by </em>operation of law, and there was a complete failure of consideration in connection with the completion of said contract.\u201d Plaintiff appeals from the adverse judgment thereafter entered on February 3,1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">We agree with the result reached by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">Under the rule enunciated by Chief Justice Traynor in <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>Bristol Dev. Co. </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 861, 865 [44 Cal.Rptr. 767, 402 P.2d 839], we proceed to make our independent construction of the contract which is in writing and concerning which the extrinsic evidence is not in conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">Where one engages another to render services to him personally for a specified period of time, his death before the end of the agreed time terminates the contract. <em>(Harrison </em>v. <em>Conlan </em>(1865) 92 Mass. (10 Allen) 85, 86.)  Where the terms of a contract and the surrounding circumstances indicate that each party entering into the agreement relied upon personal skills, talents or characteristics which no one other than the other contracting party could provide, the death of either terminates the contract prior to the termination date set forth in the agreement. <em>(Blakely </em>v. <em>Sousa </em>(1900) 197 Pa. 305, 330-331, 332 [47 286, 80 Am.St.Rep. 821].)</p>\n<p id=\"b880-9\">\u201cWhere distinctly personal considerations are at the foundation of the contract, the relation of the parties is dissolved by the death of him whose personal qualities constituted the particular inducement to the contract. The whole question in each case is one for construction, -and depends upon the intention of the parties. [Citation.] In contracts in which performance depends upon the continued existence of a certain person . . . , a condition is implied that the impossibility of performance arising from the perishing of the person . . . shall excuse the performance. The implication arises in spite of the unqualified character of the promissory words, because, from the nature of the contract, it is apparent the parties contracted upon the basis of the continued existence of the particular person . . . [citations.]\u201d <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Preston </em>(1897) 170 Ill. 179, 185 [48 N.E. 688] and see <em>Potts Drug Co. </em>v. <em>Benedict </em>(1909) 156 Cal. 322, 332 [104 P. 432, 25 L.R.A. N.S. 609] ; cf. <em>Masterson </em>v. <em>Sine </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 222, 230 [65 Cal.Rptr. 545, 436 P.2d 561] ; and <em>LaRue </em>v. <em>Groezinger </em>(1890) 84 Cal. 281, 285 [24 P. 42, 18 Am.St.Rep. 179].)</p>\n<p id=\"b880-10\">Since the contract contains the clause, \u201cIt is further understood and agreed that your [plaintiff\u2019s] services are rendered in the capacity of an employee . . . ,\u201d the follow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>ing from 6 Corbin on Contracts (1962) section 1335, page 381 is also pertinent: 11 The death of the master or employer does not necessarily have the same effect as the death of the servant. If an essential part of the master\u2019s duty is to direct and supervise the work personally, his death makes this impossible. Likewise, it makes performance of the agreed work by the servant impossible, for the work was to be work specified and directed by the master. The master\u2019s duty to pay wages does not require his personal performance and has not become impossible; but it is nevertheless discharged, because its condition precedent\u2014the rendition of the service\u2014has become impossible. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">The wording of the contract explicitly conveys an intent of the parties that the contract be conditioned upon Cole\u2019s continued existence and personal participation. No doubt Nat King Cole\u2019s artistic skill, talent and renown were inducements to plaintiff to enter into the contract. Plaintiff\u2019s services were to be rendered exclusively to Cole personally or to such corporation or company to which Cole would be rendering services, and at such times and places as Cole was to designate. Cole\u2019s personal appearance or personal recording was an implied condition precedent to plaintiff\u2019s rendition of services as a musical director. With Nat King Cole\u2019s untimely demise, both parties were excused from further performance and the contract terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">The only instance in which plaintiff rendered services in Cole\u2019s absence was a performance in connection with the dedication of the Music Center (Dorothy Chandler Music Pavilion) in Los Angeles Civic Center on December 11, 1964. Prank Sinatra appeared in lieu of Nat King Cole as a \u201clast minute substitute\u201d and plaintiff, who conducted performances while Cole was off stage in the past, conducted this particular performance. This arrangement was devised at Cole\u2019s request as his hospitalization on December 8, 1964, just three days prior to the scheduled performance permitted no complete change of program. This single instance of plaintiff rendering services in absence of Nat King Cole\u2019s personal participation cannot serve to alter the basic personal nature of the contract implicitly conditioned upon Cole\u2019s continued existence and personal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-9\">Kaus, P. J., and Hufstedler, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-10\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied May 15,1968.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b878-9\"> Assigned by the Chairman of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b878-10\"> ' <em>\u2018 </em>August 10, 1964 \u20181 Mr. Brian Farnon 12221 Hillslope Street Studio City, California Dear Mr. Farnon: <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>The following shall constitute an entire agreement between us. \"I agree to employ you, and you agree to render services to me as my musical director subject to the following terms and conditions: \"1.
