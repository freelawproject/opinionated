The action was brought to recover secret profits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>allegedly made by all defendants in the transaction, plus interest and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">Plaintiffs Joseph Loughlin and Frances Loughlin, husband and wife, commenced the action against the broker, George Turkmany, individually and doing business as Idora Realty Company; \u201cEloise Turkmany, also known as E. Mejia,\u201d alleged in the complaint to be \u201cin some manner related\u201d to Turkmany; and John Casserly, alleged to be a real estate salesman in Turkmany\u2019s employ. Four defendants\u2014George Turkmany, Eloise Turkmany, E. Mejia and Casserly-\u2014\u2022 appeared by answer. It was established at pretrial that Eloise Turkmany was George Turkmany\u2019s wife, -and that E. Mejia was his mother-in-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">After a nonjury trial the court made detailed findings of fact, in narrative form, in favor of all four defendants. The first several findings were -as follows (with some typographical changes, and with numerals added) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-6\">\u201c [1] On or about June 7, 1961 and prior thereto plaintiffs were the owners of the real property, improved with a residence, at 5028 Webster Street, Oakland, California; plaintiffs resided in Los Angeles -and said residence was rented to George Haggerty. [2] On said date plaintiff J. W. Loughlin, hereinafter referred to as Loughlin, entered the offices of defendant George Turkmany, hereinafter referred to as Turk-many, doing business as Idora Realty Company, a licensed real estate broker, and requested that said office list his property for sale and find a buyer for it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-7\">\u201c[3] Turkmany and his salesman, defendant John Casserly, hereinafter referred to as Casserly, were not present and in their absence Mrs. Hitchcock, a saleswoman of said firm, prepared a net sales contract for signature by Loughlin which he signed on that date. [4] Said contract provided that Loughlin granted to Turkmany -and his agents, for a period of 90 days from date thereof, the exclusive right to sell and dispose of said property for the sum of $14,000 net cash to Loughlin and as compensation for the services of the broker Loughlin agreed to pay said firm all money over the said net sum for which said property may be [sic] sold.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-8\">\u201c [5] Loughlin requested Mrs. Hitchcock to indicate on the contract that Casserly was to be credited with the listing and his name was so listed on the firm. [Sic: \u201cform\u201d?] [6] Loughlin at that time informed Mrs. Hitchcock that he wanted all cash and would not -accept any offer which required that he receive a note secured by deed of trust. [7] He wanted $15,000 for the property and after computing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>commission of 6% to be paid to the broker he agreed to accept $14,000 net cash. [8] Neither Turkmany, Casserly nor Mrs. Hitchcock made any representation to Loughlin prior to, or at the time of the signing of the contract, regarding the value of the property or the price Loughlin should ask for it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-5\">\u201c [9] ... [After June 7, 1961] . . . Turkmany and his agents attempted to sell the property for Loughlin and on or about August 14, 1961 Turkmany sent a letter to Loughlin and his wife informing them he had an all cash offer for $11,000, the property to be sold \u2018as is\u2019 thereby avoiding a termite inspection and any possible termite repairs. [10] Loughlin was requested to sign an acceptance to the written offer enclosed if satisfactory to him; [11] the offer was made by B. Mejia, mother-in-law of Turkmany. [12] Loughlin rejected the offer and returned the offer unsigned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-6\">\u201c [13] Loughlin came to Oakland on or about August 21, 1961 and talked to Casserly, stating that he would not accept any offer of $11,000; he and Casserly discussed the sale of the property further and Casserly asked Loughlin if he would accept an offer of $12,000 which would net him $11,280 cash. [14] Loughlin stated he might consider it and Casserly so informed Turkmany after Loughlin departed for Los Angeles. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">The foregoing narrative (Findings 1 through 14, inclusive) covers the evidence for the period from June 7 through the month of August 1961.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These findings reflect undisputed facts, or were made by the trial court upon conflicting evidence, and are binding upon this court in either event. Concerning some events which immediately followed in early September, the trial court next found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-8\">\u201c [15] On September 5, 1961, Turkmany phoned Loughlin to confirm the fact Loughlin would accept $11,280 net cash and Loughlin told Turkmany he would accept such an offer. [16] Turkmany then prepared for signature by Loughlin a letter dated September 6, 1961, which was sent to Loughlin on said date for signatures of Loughlin and his wife in which they agreed to accept $11,280 net cash for the property for a total sales price of $12,000, the broker to receive $720 as a commission. [17] The buyer was E. Mejia, mother-in-law of Turkmany. [18] On September 5, 1961 Turkmany ordered a preliminary title report from Western Title Co., Order No. 626121, and [19] on September 6th informed the title com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>pany escrow officer, Joseph Lauck, that he had a buyer for the property. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">According to uncontradicted evidence, the events of early September, involving Turkmany and Loughlin, were these: On September 5, Turkmany opened an escrow at Western Title Insurance Co. under No. 626121. The title company\u2019s \u201cOrder Blank,\u201d a filled-in form evidencing this transaction, was received in evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The form shows that Turkmany ordered a preliminary title report, and specified title insurance in the amount of $14,000, in connection with a sale of the 5028 Webster Street property by Loughlin to Mejia. The form referred only to a \u201csale\u201d and \u201c$14,000\u201d; it did not mention any other amount, nor any person other than Loughlin and Mejia, nor terms, nor financing.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Thereafter, on the night of September 5 and again on the night of September 6, Turkmany telephoned Loughlin in Los Angeles. In the September 6 call, he told Loughlin that he had a $12,000 offer for the property. Turkmany, according to his testimony, was acting as agent for Mejia in communicating the offer, but there is no evidence that he disclosed this fact to Loughlin in the telephone conversation. In response to an inquiry by Loughlin, Turkmany said that he\u2014Turkmany \u2014was not buying the property, but he did not say that Mejia was, nor that she was his mother-in-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">In the September 6 telephone conversation, Loughlin verbally agreed to accept $12,000 for the property: $11,280 cash net to plaintiffs, with Turkmany to receive the $720 balance as a commission. On the same night, Turkmany drafted a document dated Steptember 6, and mailed it to Loughlin for plaintiffs' signature and return. A covering letter stated in relevant part, in Turkmany\u2019s handwriting, that \u201cI will proceed to open the escrow\u201d when the signed document was returned. Plaintiffs signed the document\u2014apparently on September 7\u2014and mailed it back. The document, which was in letter form, stated in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-7\">\" September 6,1961</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7i\">\" Idora Realty Company [address]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>Attention: Mr. George Turkmany</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-5\">\u201cRE: Our real property known as 5028 Webster Street Oakland, California.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-6\">\u201cDear Sir:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-7\">\"This is to confirm our telephone conversation of last night and the telephone conversation we had this evening that we will accept the sum of $11,280.00 Net Cash To Us for our above mentioned property. . . . [Instructions follow for payment of an outstanding indebtedness to the Bank of America and for closing the transaction]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-8\">\u201c s/ Joseph W. Loughlin</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7Ve\">\u201cs/ Frances Loughlin \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">Neither Turkmany\u2019s covering letter, nor the September 6 document, identified the buyer of the property. On September 15, the title company sent a deed to plaintiffs, naming \u201cE. Mejia\u201d as the buyer. They signed and returned the deed on September 16 and returned it to the title company.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">The next successive findings by the trial court generally reflect these facts: Shortly following the telephone conversation of September 6, Turkmany obtained from one Azaro a commitment for a loan of up to $12,500 on the property, the loan to be made to Mejia. Soon thereafter, Turkmany negotiated a sale of the property from Mejia to the Messrs. Schennek for $16,500, but upon terms: $2,000 cash down, a $12,500 loan from Azaro to be secured by first deed of trust, and the balance to be carried by a note from the Schenneks to Mejia, to be secured by a second deed of trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-11\">The Mejia-Schenneks sale was placed in the same escrow (No. 626121) where the sale from Loughlin to Mejia was already pending. The entire escrow closed on September 20, with consecutive recordation of the Loughlin deed to Mejia, a deed from her to the Schenneks, and a deed of trust from the Schenneks in Azaro\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-12\">The title company disbursed $11,280 to plaintiffs, less the balance of the bank loan owed on the property. Mejia received the Schenneks \u2019 note for $2,000, plus a check for about $1,200. The note and the check were delivered to Turkmany, who deposited the check in his trustee account. According to Turk-many, this account contained other funds which Mejia had accumulated by investments made through him. Turkmany also received a $720 commission from the Loughlin sale, of which he paid $360 to Casserly. He also \u201ccharged\u201d the Mejia account with a commission for his services to her in the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>According to the uncontradicted evidence, plaintiffs were not told at any time before the escrow closed, and did not learn until thereafter, that Mejia was Turkmany\u2019s mother-in-law, nor that a successive sale by Mejia to anyone else, at any price or upon any terms, was being negotiated or transacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">The trial court further found \u201cThat the allegations of fraud in plaintiffs\u2019 complaint are not true and that defendants did not obtain or receive a secret profit nor make false and fradulent representations to plaintiffs.\u201d In this regard, plaintiffs\u2019 complaint had originally alleged that they were induced to sell their property for $11,280 net as a result of several false representations made to them by Turkmany. According to the complaint, these included false representations that termite repairs would cost $2,500 and that a prospective street widening project would take some of the property. The trial court\u2019s general finding that defendants \u201cdid not . . . make false and fraudulent representations to plaintiffs\u201d rejected plaintiffs\u2019 contentions in these specific respects and, in such respects, the general finding is supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint had also alleged, however, that they were induced to sell for $11,280 by Turkmany\u2019s further false representations \u201cthat $12,000 was the highest and best price that could be obtained for the property; . . . [and] . . . that he was not buying it himself, but had a bona fide offer for $12,000 less six per cent real estate broker\u2019s commission . . .\u201d We hold that, in these and related respects, the evidence sustains plaintiffs\u2019 position on the appeal and that, for specific reasons which will appear, the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Speaking\u2014on the appeal\u2014to the undisputed fact that Turkmany did not disclose to plaintiffs the identity of the person who was to buy the property for $12,000 ($11,280 net to plaintiffs), defendants point out that Turkmany\u2019s agreement with plaintiffs was a \u2018 \u2018 net sale contract. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">A net sale contract (or \u201cnet listing\u201d) is one in which the principal agrees to accept a specified net price for the property to be sold, and the agent\u2019s compensation for negotiating a sale is to be any amount received in excess of the specified figure. <em>(Allen </em>v. <em>Dailey </em>(1928) 92 Cal.App. 308, 310-311, 313-314 [268 P. 404]; <em>Hiss </em>v. <em>Mulholland </em>(1929) 96 Cal.App. 121, 126 [273 P. 859]; <em>Pascal </em>v. <em>Cotton </em>(1962) 205 Cal.App.2d 597, 598, 600 [23 Cal.Rptr. 357], See <em>Abell </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number><em>Watson </em>(1957) 155 Cal.App.2d 158 [317 P.2d 159].) Defendants rely upon the rule that an agent with a net sale contract has no fiduciary duty to disclose the buyer's identity to the principal, even if the agent is buying the property himself. <em>{Allen </em>v. <em>Dailey, supra, </em>at pp. 313-314; <em>Hiss </em>v. <em>Mulholland, supra; Pascal </em>v. <em>Cotton, supra, </em>at p. 600; 1 Within, Summary of Cal. Law (7th ed. 1960) Agency and Employment, \u00a7 30, p. 408.)</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\"> The trial court found (Nos. 3 and 4, quoted <em>supra) </em>that the June 7 agreement was a \u201cnet sale contract\u201d; and, as we have seen, this finding is supported by the evidence. The court made no such finding as to the \u201ccontract\u201d dated September 6. The latter (to which we hereinafter refer as the \u201cSeptember 6 contract,\u201d although plaintiffs signed it somewhat later) was not in terms a \u201ccontract\u201d between Turkmany and plaintiffs. It did not, in fact, expressly provide for Turkmany\u2019s services or for payment to him of the verbally-agreed $720 commission. However, it resembled the \u201ccontract\u201d in <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Dailey, supra </em>(92 Cal.App. 308 at p. 311), and it was a \u201cnet sale contract\u201d within the meaning- of the <em>Allen </em>rule. However, although each of the two agreements was a net sale contract, the <em>Allen </em>rule\u2014under the circumstances of this ease\u2014had no application under either of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">The June 7 contract did not define the rights and duties of the parties, because its 90-day term expired on September 5 (Civ. Code, \u00a710; Gov. Code, \u00a7 6800) and it did not control Turkmany\u2019s conduct thereafter. The <em>Allen </em>rule would not, in any event, have applied to it. The theory of the rule is that the principal cannot be injured by the agent\u2019s failure to disclose the buyer\u2019s identity because the latter fact is immaterial if the principal realizes the full net sale price he had agreed to accept. <em>{Allen </em>v. <em>Dailey, supra, </em>92 Cal.App. 308 at p. 314; 1 Within, <em>supra, </em>at p. 408.) Plaintiffs did not realize the $14,000 specified in the June 7 contract, and the rule would not apply to that agreement because the theory\u2019s factual premise did not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">The <em>Allen </em>rule rests upon the further factual premise that the principal must have determined the net sale price without influence by the agent. <em>{Pascal </em>v. <em>Cotton, supra, </em>205 Cal.App.2d 597 at pp. 600-601; 1 Miller &amp; Starr, Current Law of California Real Estate (1965) 216-217.) As to the June 7 contract in the present case, the trial court so found. (Nos. 7-8, quoted <em>supra.) </em>The evidence does not show, however, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>the $11,280 net price in the September 6 contract was determined by plaintiffs in their independent judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">In this regard, the evidence does not support the trial court\u2019s finding (No. 15) that on September 5 \u201cTurkmany telephoned Loughlin to confirm the fact Loughlin would accept $11,280 net cash ...\u201d Turkmany so testified, but there is no evidence that such was \u201cthe fact\u201d: as the trial court had previously found (Nos. 13-14), Loughlin had told Turkmany\u2019s salesman that he might consider $11,280, not that he \u201cwould accept\u201d it. According to the events of early September as shown by the evidence, Loughlin did not agree to sell for $11,280 net until Turkmany told him among other things he had a $12,000 offer for the property. A critical fact, therefore, was whether Turkmany's representations influenced Loughlin in this respect. The trial court did not make a finding negating this fact, and in the absence of such finding the <em>Allen </em>rule has no application to the September 6 contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Furthermore, the <em>Allen </em>rule operates to limit the agent\u2019s duty of disclosure to his principal when\u2014but not until\u2014the parties have entered into a net sale contract. In the present case, the September 6 contract did not materialize until after Turkmany communicated with Loughlin in early September. His duties to plaintiffs at that time were defined by his relationship with them at that time, and were not limited by the net sale contract agreed upon thereafter. The <em>Allen </em>rule, in other words, applies where there is a net sale contract, but not to the negotiations which preceded it.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Since neither of the successive net sale contracts operated to limit Turkmany\u2019s duties to plaintiffs,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we are required to assess what his duties were and whether he discharged them.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">When Turkmany called Loughlin on September 5, he was still in an express contractual relationship with plaintiffs under the earlier contract. On September 6, that contract having expired by its terms, the express relationship had terminated. The telephone call on September 6, however, was apparently a continuation of the call on September 5; there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>no evidence that the parties discussed or considered the materiality of the current calendar date; and the subject discussed involved\u2014and produced\u2014a continuing principal-agent relationship between them. It therefore appears that Turkmany\u2019s calls to Loughlin on both dates were communications from a real estate agent to his principal, and that his duties to plaintiffs on both occasions are to be defined accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">A real estate agent is a fiduciary. His obligation of diligent and faithful service is the same as that imposed on a trustee. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 2322, subd. 3; <em>Rattray </em>v. <em>Scudder </em>(1946) 28 Cal.2d 214, 222-223 [169 P.2d 371, 164 A.L.R. 1356]; <em>Rodes </em>v. <em>Shannon </em>(1963) 222 Cal.App.2d 721, 725 [35 Cal.Rptr. 339].)</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\"> The real estate agent has, among other duties, the duty (1) to refrain from making any misrepresentation to his principal (Civ. Code, \u00a72228; Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 10176, subds. (a), (c); <em>Caro </em>v. <em>Savage </em>(1962) 201 Cal.App.2d 530, 541 [20 Cal.Rptr. 286]); and (2) to make to the principal \u201cthe fullest disclosure of all material facts concerning the transaction that might affect the principal\u2019s decision\u201d <em>(Rattray </em>v. <em>Scudder, supra, </em>28 Cal.2d 214 at p. 223; <em>Menzel </em>v. <em>Salka </em>(1960) 179 Cal.App.2d 612, 622 [4 Cal.Rptr. 78]; Rest. 2d Agency, \u00a7 381).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\"> The real estate agent has the further duty (3) to disclose to the principal all offers to buy the property in addition to the offer accepted <em>(Simone </em>v. <em>McKee </em>(1956) 142 Cal.App.2d 307, 311-312 [298 P.2d 667] ; <em>Hickson </em>v. <em>Gray </em>(1949) 91 Cal.App.2d 684, 685-687 [205 P.2d 420]; Annotation, \u201cLiability of real-estate broker or agent to principal for concealing or failing to disclose offer,\u201d 7 A.L.R.3d 693) and (4) to refrain from dual representation in a sale transaction without full disclosure to both principals and their knowledge and consent. <em>(McConnell </em>v. <em>Cowan </em>(1955) 44 Cal.2d 805, 809-810 [285 P.2d 261, 482]; <em>Vice </em>v. <em>Thacker </em>(1947) 30 Cal.2d 84, 90-91 [180 P.2d 4] ; <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Thacher </em>(1946) 76 Cal.App.2d 50, 68 [172 P.2d 533].)</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">With respect to Turkmany\u2019s performance of these duties, we next address evidence which is virtually uncontradieted and which is shown or substantiated by Turkmany\u2019s own testimony, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-9\">(1) <em>Possible misrepresentations. </em>Turkmany testified that he told Loughlin on September 6 that he had a $12,000 offer for plaintiffs\u2019 property. There is no evidence that he ever received a $12,000 offer from anyone, and his use of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>figure \u201c$14,000\u201d in opening the escrow on September 5 imports that an offer, if there had been one, was for the higher sum. He also wrote Loughlin on September 6 that he would \u201cproceed to open the escrow\u201d when plaintiffs had returned their signed agreement to accept $11,280 net. To the extent that this statement implied that no escrow had been opened, the statement could have amounted to a misrepresentation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-4\">(2) <em>Disclosure of material facts. </em>If Turkmany\u2019s written reference to an escrow did not amount to an affirmative misrepresentation, his failure to mention the escrow opened on September 5 could clearly have amounted to nondisclosure of a material fact which\u2014particularly with its reference to \u201c$14,000\u201d in title insurance\u2014might have affected plaintiffs\u2019 decision to sell for $11,280 net. According to his testimony, Turkmany also knew\u2014and did not disclose to Loughlin-\u2014that the proposed buyer was Turkmany's mother-in-law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">A current treatise expresses the view that, although a real estate agent must disclose the fact that he is buying his principal\u2019s property himself, \u201cthe California courts have not, as yet, expressly set forth the extent to which this rule will apply\u201d where the buyer is among the agent\u2019s \u201crelatives, friends or employees.\u201d (1 Miller &amp; Starr, <em>stipra, </em>at p. 157. See also California Real Estate Sales Transactions (Cont. Ed. Bar 1967) 157 [discussion by the same authors].) In <em>Abell </em>v. <em>Watson, supra, </em>155 Cal.App.2d 158, however, the court upheld disciplinary action against a real estate salesman for failure to disclose to his principal that the proposed buyer was the salesman\u2019s sister and that the actual buyer, taking from escrow as the sister\u2019s nominee, was his wife. The <em>Abell </em>court stated (p. 160) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-6\">\u201cTo hold otherwise would be to approve a practice by which a real estate broker or salesman could himself purchase a client\u2019s property without Ms knowledge, by having it conveyed to the wife or other relative of the broker or salesman. This would open the door to all sorts of chicanery and double dealing, and would be contrary to the purpose and intent of the real estate law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-7\">\u201cThe rule is to be found in . . . [Adams v. <em>Herman </em>(1951) 106 Cal.App.2d 92, 99-100 (234 P.2d 695)] . . . taken from 2 American Jurisprudence, page 208, section 257:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-8\">\u201c \u2018 \u201c The general principle which denies the agent the right, without the knowledge and consent of the principal, to become the purchaser of property which he is employed to sell for the principal is aimed at an indirect or collusive sale or transfer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>as well as a direct sale or transfer to the agent. <em>It precludes the agent from selling or conveying to the agent\u2019s spouse, </em>to a corporation in which the agent has a large concealed interest, indirectly to himself in the name of a third person, and even to a clerk of the agent who is engaged in the affairs of the vendor relating to the sale of the land.\u201d \u2019 (Italics are in the reported decision.) \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">We conclude that, where the seller\u2019s real estate agent is obligated to disclose to his principal the identity of the buyer, and where the buyer is not the agent but occupies with him such blood, marital or other relationship which would suggest a reasonable possibility that the agent could be indirectly acquiring an interest in the property himself, such relationship is a \u201cmaterial fact\u201d which the agent must disclose to his principal. If, as the text writers state (1 Miller &amp; Starr, <em>supra, </em>at p. 157; California Real Estate Sales Transactions, <em>supra, </em>at p. 157), this is not the settled rule in California, it should be: and we hold that it is. (See <em>Rodes </em>v. <em>Shannon, supra, </em>222 Cal.App.2d 721, 722, 726; <em>Caro </em>v. <em>Savage, supra, </em>201 Cal.App.2d 530, 535, 536-537; <em>Estate of DeHart </em>(1961) 196 Cal.App.2d 452, 455-456 [16 Cal.Rptr. 603]; <em>Abell </em>v. <em>Watson, supra, </em>155 Cal.App.2d 158 at p. 160; <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Herman </em>(1951) 106 Cal.App.2d 92 at pp. 99-100 [234 P.2d 695] ; <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Thacher, supra, </em>76 Cal.App.2d 50, 57, 73; <em>Firestone </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien </em>(1929) 97 Cal.App. 43, 47-49 [274 P. 1006] ; 3 Am.Jur.2d, \u00a7 228, p. 601; Annotation, 11 Duty of real-estate broker to disclose that prospective purchaser is a relative,\u201d 26 A.L.R.2d 1307.)</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">(3) <em>Disclositre of offers. </em>If Turkmany had a $14,000 offer from Mejia when he opened the escrow on September 5, he failed to disclose it to plaintiffs <em>\u25a0 </em>and he did not disclose to them the $16,500 offer from the Schenneks which he negotiated but which was accepted by Mejia. Of the Sehennek offer, Turkmany testified that he did not disclose it to plaintiffs because they were disinterested in any offer which was not for an all-cash price. But the payment of only $2,000 was to be deferred under the Sehennek offer; with the financing arranged by Turkmany for his mother-in-law, the Sehennek offer would have produced $12,500 cash, and it appears to have been a better offer than the $12,000 cash offer he had disclosed to plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">(4) <em>Dual representation. </em>Turkmany expressly testified that he was acting as Mejia\u2019s agent when he communicated her alleged $12,000 offer to Loughlin on September 6, but there is no evidence that he disclosed this fact to plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>The trial court, apparently having concluded that Turk-many had no fiduciary duty to plaintiffs because the June 7 agreement was a net sale contract, did not find that he was plaintiffs\u2019 agent in and after early September. As we have seen, the evidence indicates that he was; and, if he was, the question of whether he discharged his duties as such required findings concerning his conduct as shown by the evidence detailed above.  Where the fiduciary relationship of agency has been established, and where the principal questions the agent\u2019s actions, the agent bears the burden of showing that he acted in good faith and discharged the duties imposed upon him <em>(Estate of DeHart, supra, </em>196 Cal.App.2d 452, 455); otherwise he will be held liable to the principal for all \u201cbenefits and advantages\u2019\u2019 he acquired from the agency. <em>(Crogan </em>v. <em>Metz </em>(1956) 47 Cal.2d 398, 404-405 [303 P.2d 1029].)</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">Under the evidence of Turkmany\u2019s actions in September, and in the absence of findings, supported by the evidence, that he was not acting as plaintiffs\u2019 agent at the time or that he discharged his duties as their agent, the burden cast upon him has not been met. For want of such findings, the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">However, the state of all the evidence\u2014which is ambiguous and incomplete in many respects, and much of which is at variance with the pleadings\u2014is such that this court is not able to make findings in favor of plaintiffs and against Turkmany nor, if we could, to assess damages. Consequently, we are required to remand the cause for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">The case against Mejia, Casserly and Eloise Turkmany was pleaded and tried upon the theory that each conspired with Turkmany to defraud plaintiffs. The rule here invoked is that if through fraud and conspiracy another person assists a real estate broker in violating his fiduciary obligation to his principal by making a secret profit and retaining the proceeds therefrom, such person is liable for the consequences to the extent of his participation. <em>(Hickson </em>v. <em>Gray, supra, </em>91 Cal.App.2d 684 at pp. 686-687.) Little or no proof was offered concerning the knowing complicity of any of the other three defendants. However, the evidence suggests\u2014although we do not hold\u2014that Mejia was a \u201cdummy\" for Turkmany in the transaction, and it shows that both Casserly and Eloise Turk-many received money or property in its course. The liability\u2014 if any\u2014of them can be determined upon retrial. We therefore remand for new trial against all four defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">The pretrial conference order under which this case was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>tried stated that the issues were \u201c1. Are the defendants or any of them guilty of fraud upon the plaintiffs? 2. If so, which defendants and damages if any. 3. Are plaintiffs entitled to punitive damages; if so, in what amount?\u201d For purposes of further proceedings, we hold that each and all of these issues are still to be resolved. However, if plaintiffs desire to amend factual allegations of their complaint in any respect material to the views expressed herein, they should be permitted to do so, defendants should be permitted to answer, and the cause should be retried upon the pleadings thus amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for new trial against all defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Devine, P. J., and Christian, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b645-9\">All dates and events hereinafter mentioned occurred in 1961.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b646-8\">The order blank shows two dates, September 5 and September 7. To the extent that the trial court found (Finding No. 18, quoted supra) that the transaction occurred on September 5, the finding stands because it was made upon conflicting evidence. The trial court did not find <em>(id.) </em>that Turkmany \u2018 \u2018 opened an escrow <em>\u2019 </em>\u2019 in the September 5 transaction, but the contents of the order blank\u2014which, among other things, designated an <em>\u20181 </em>escrow officer \u2019 \u2019\u2014demonstrate that he did, and there is no evidence to the contrary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b650-8\">Despite the rule of <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Dailey, supra </em>(92 Cal.App. 308 at pp. 313-314)\u2014that an agent with a net sale contract is under no fiduciary-duty to disclose the buyer\u2019s identity to his principal\u2014some authorities indicate that nondisclosure violates a fiduciary duty which will at least warrant disciplinary action by the Beal Estate Commissioner against the nondiselosing agent. (See <em>Abell </em>v. <em>Watson, supra, </em>155 Cal.App.2d 158 at p. 160; 1 Miller &amp; Starr, <em>supra, </em>at pp. 216-217 [\u201cThe \u2018net listing.\u2019 \u201d].) However, the <em>Allen </em>rule is apparently still the law of California <em>(Pascal </em>v. <em>Cotton, supra, </em>205 Cal.App.2d 597 at p. 601) ; and, since we hold that it is inapplicable to the present ease, we are not called upon to reexamine it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
