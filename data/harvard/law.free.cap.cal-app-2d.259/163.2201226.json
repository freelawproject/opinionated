On October 31, 1951, at age 38, he suffered a heart attack, which was admittedly, under Labor Code section 3212, an industrial injury. He never thereafter returned to work. He was retired December 1, 1952, for service-incurred industrial disability with a retirement allowance of 75 percent of his salary. This retirement allowance was paid until Reimers\u2019 death on October 26, 1964. Thereafter a death allowance was paid his widow.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">On July 28, 1965 Reimers\u2019 widow filed an application with the Industrial Accident Commission (now Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeals Board) claiming individually and as administratrix of his estate, permanent disability indemnity for his industrial injury of October 31, 1951.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The City of Oakland was permissibly uninsured for workmen\u2019s compensation (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3700). The industrial injury and disability were admitted but the city claimed credit against its workmen\u2019s compensation liability for the disability retirement allowances paid Reimers during his lifetime. The appeals board denied such credit and awarded a sum of $8,280 for Reimers \u2019 disability. The City of Oakland here seeks review of that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">The Charter of the City of Oakland provides for a \u201cPolice and Fire Retirement System.\u201d Section 249(2) of the charter, among other things, provides: \u201cIt is the intention of this see<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>tion that allowances granted to or on account of members of the System for injury, illness or death incurred in the performance of duty <em>shall not be cumulative with benefits under the Labor Code of California awarded as the result of the same injury, illness or death.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> (Italics added.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">The retirement provisions of the charter, including the above mentioned section 249(2) constitute part of the contract of employment between the City of Oakland and its policemen and firemen. It has been stated that such provisions \u201care an inseparable part of that contract.\u201d <em>(Holt </em>v. <em>Board of Police etc. Comrs., </em>86 Cal.App.2d 714, 716 [196 P.2d 94].)  With its retirement provisions the charter is not only the organic law of the City of Oakland but it is also the law of the state. It has the force of a legislative enactment. <em>(C. J. Kubach Co. </em>v. <em>McGuire, </em>199 Cal. 215, 217 [248 P. 676] ; <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Wolff, </em>84 Cal.App.2d 435, 440 [190 P.2d 665].)  However, if there is any conflict between the charter and the workmen\u2019s compensation provisions of the Labor Code the latter must prevail. <em>(Healy </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com, </em>41 Cal.2d 118, 122 [258 P.2d l].)</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Such a charter provision preventing an employee\u2019s \u201cdouble recovery\u201d of indemnity for an industrial disability is legally proper. It has been repeatedly held that a city may protect itself against paying twice (through the workmen\u2019s compensation provisions of the Labor Code and its own retirement system) for the same industrial disability. (See <em>City of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com (Fraide), </em>63 Cal.2d 242 [46 Cal.Rptr. 97, 404 P.2d 801]; <em>Stafford </em>v. <em>Los Angeles etc. Retirement Board, </em>42 Cal.2d 795 [270 P.2d 12]; <em>Lyons </em>v. <em>Hoover, </em>41 Cal.2d 145 [258 P.2d 4]; <em>Healy </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., supra, </em>41 Cal.2d 118.)</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\"><em>City of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. (Fraide), supra, </em>63 Cal.2d 242, concerned a Los Angeles Charter provision somewhat similar to that before us. There Fraide, a disabled policeman, sought both disability retirement allowances and a workmen\u2019s compensation disability award. The court stated (p. 253) : \u201c [W]e cannot properly sanction \u2018double recovery\u2019 for the employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\"><em>Stafford </em>v. <em>Los Angeles etc. Retirement Board, supra, </em>42 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>Cal.2d 795, concerned the provisions of Government Code sections 32080-32082 (repealed 1959). Section 32080 stated, in language almost identical to section 249(2), \u201cIt is the intention of this chapter that pensions allowed for injury incurred in line of duty shall not be cumulative with the benefits under workmen\u2019s compensation awarded for the same injury or disability.\u201d The court held it was proper that no payments be made on a disability retirement until \u201c \u2018the total amount of the retirement payments which would otherwise be paid equals the total amount received under the workmen\u2019s compensation act.\u2019 \u201d (P. 796.) It was stated: \u201c[A] contrary view would defeat the declared policy of section 32080 that disability provisions shall not be cumulative with workmen\u2019s compensation benefits awarded for the same disability.\u201d (P. 798.)</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">The City of Oakland contends that the respondent appeals board acted in excess of its powers in not crediting against its disability indemnity award, the amounts previously paid by the city\u2019s retirement system on Reimers\u2019 disability retirement allowance. It adds that at the very least such credit should have been computed in accordance with the so-called \u201cFraide\u201d formula adopted by the Supreme Court in <em>City of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. (Fraide), supra, </em>63 Cal.2d 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">We shall first discuss the duty of the appeals board to give effect to the City of Oakland Charter section 249(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">The meaning of this section is clear. A policeman or fireman may not, for the same industrial disability, receive from the city disability allowances both under the workmen\u2019s compensation provisions of the Labor Code and under the city\u2019s retirement system.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">Respondents concede that if Reimers had obtained a workmen\u2019s compensation disability award during his lifetime the city could properly have withheld retirement allowances up to the amount of such award. Indeed, since this was the anticipated manner in which section 249(2) would be given effect, the charter details the procedure for taking such a credit. However, since the charter does not spell out a procedure for offsetting previously paid disability allowances against a compensation award, respondents insist that such credit is not legally allowable. We cannot accept this argument. A retired disabled city employee, by not seeking disability compensation during his lifetime, could thus insure to his dependents after his death a derivative disability allowance which he himself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>could not have obtained\u2014clearly a result to be avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">In support of the instant contention respondents cite <em>Holt </em>v. <em>Board of Police etc. Comrs., supra, </em>86 Cal.App.2d 714, where a different factual situation was encountered. The court there said,1 \u2018 The charter provides that the pension provision is intended to be in lieu of and take the place of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. It does not provide that the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act is to be in lieu of and take the place of the pension provisions.\u201d (P. 719.) Obviously the charter language found in <em>Holt </em>was quite different from that of the City of Oakland which says that disability retirement payments and disability compensation payments \u201cshall not be cumulative.\u201d <em>Stafford </em>v. <em>Los Angeles etc. Retirement Board, supra, </em>42 Cal.2d 795, 799, in denying \u201cdouble recovery\u201d under a provision almost identical with that of section 249(2), stated that <em>Holt, supra, </em>was \u201cneither compelling nor persuasive to a contrary holding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Respondent appeals board contends that it lacks authority to allow offsets of the sort here demanded by the City of Oakland. We need not consider the question of whether or not the appeals board has <em>implied </em>power to give effect to Reimers \u2019 valid employment contract with the City of Oakland and that city\u2019s charter which has the effect of law. Labor Code section 4909 <em>expressly </em>gives to the appeals board the necessary power. That section provides that the appeals board may take into account \u201cin fixing the amount of the compensation to be paid\u201d any \u201cbenefit received by the injured\u25a0 employee during the period of his incapacity\u201d which was not due and payable under the workmen\u2019s compensation provisions of the Labor Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">We hold that the appeals board was required to give effect to section 249(2) of the City of Oakland Charter as authorized by Labor Code section 4909, and that in failing to do so the appeals board abused its discretion and acted in excess of its powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">We now direct our discussion to the effect of the <em>Hr aide </em>ruling <em>{City of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(Fraide), <em>supra, </em>63 Cal.2d 242) on the instant ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">Labor Code section 3751 relating to workmen\u2019s compensation provides: \u201cNo employer shall exact or receive from any employee any contribution, or make or take any deduction from the earnings of any employee either directly or indirectly, to cover the whole or any part of the cost of compensation under this division. Violation of this section is a misdemeanor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>In <em>Fraide </em>the policeman was required to contribute 6 percent of his salary to the retirement fund. Los Angeles also contributed to the same fund. The respective contributions were commingled \u201cwith no earmarking and no segregation.\u201d The court held (p. 249) that the city failed \u201cto show that as a matter of practice <em>or as an acco%mting procedure </em>it did not use employee contributions\u201d to pay Fraide\u2019s workmen\u2019s compensation award. (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">The court in <em>Fraide </em>held that requiring the policeman to contribute to the commingled pension fund and then using payments from such fund for the purpose of discharging compensation liability would effectively abrogate the mandate of Labor Code section 3751. The court then stated: \u201cOn the other hand the city has substantially contributed to the pension fund. Moreover, we cannot properly sanction \u2018double recovery\u2019 for the employee. Although we then apparently face a dilemma, the difficulty dissolves upon the realization that <em>to the extent </em>that the employee receives workmen\u2019s compensation benefits which consist of employee deductions he does not obtain \u2018 double recovery. \u2019 Viewed in this light the proper method becomes clear. We must regard each dollar which is paid out of the pension fund as consisting in part of tax monies and in part of employee contributions. The city, therefore, should receive a partial credit against workmen\u2019s compensation liability for the disability pension it pays each employee. The credit should bear the same ratio to workmen's compensation liability as the \u2018city\u2019s contributions\u2019 bears to the \u2018total contributions.\u2019 ...\u201d <em>(City of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. (Fraide), </em>supra, 63 Cal.2d 242, 253.)</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">The City of Oakland contends that the respective retirement fund contributions of the city and its employees are not commingled as in <em>Fraide. </em>This appears to be the ease. Under section 252(4) of the City of Oakland\u2019s charter a percentage is deducted from each member\u2019s salary. This deduction is then \u201ccredited forthwith to the individual account of the member.\u201d Upon retirement the total of these contributions is applied to <em>\u201cprovide part of the retirement allowance granted </em>.-. . on account of said member.\u201d (Italics added.) This \u201cpart\u201d has been referred to by the parties in the proceedings below as the \u201cannuity portion.\u201d The City of Oakland makes no contribution until the member retires. Thereafter the city is required to contribute each year such amount as is necessary, when added to the member\u2019s contributions, to provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>the full retirement benefit payable during that year. This part is called the \u201cpension portion.\u201d The total of the \u201cpension portion\u201d paid during Reimers\u2019 lifetime by the City of Oakland was $56,459.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">The City of Oakland, unlike the City of Los Angeles in <em>Fraide, </em>has established both as a matter of practice and as an accounting procedure that no part of the \u201cpension portion\u201d it seeks to offset against the compensation award was contributed by Reimers.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Accordingly we hold that the formula announced in <em>Fraide </em>is inapplicable to the ease before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Respondents point out section 249(3) of the City of Oakland\u2019s charter which provides: \u201cNo benefits shall be paid under this Article [covering the Police and Fire Retirement System] on the basis of an award by the Industrial Accident Commission [now the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeals Board] of the State of California. \u2019' They insist that this provision denies to the city any right to credit disability retirement allowances against compensation awards. We do not agree. The crediting of previously paid retirement allowances against a compensation award is not a benefit paid on the basis of a workmen\u2019s compensation award.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">Section 249(3) was added to the Oakland Charter in 1951 following entry of the superior court judgment of 1949<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in <em>French </em>v. <em>Rishell </em>which was affirmed on appeal in 40 Cal.2d 477 [254 P.2d 26] (1953). In that case it was held that a determination of the Industrial Accident Commission that a fireman \u2019s death occurred in the scope of his employment was res judicata in subsequent unrelated proceedings before the Oakland Retirement Board. Section 249(3) was obviously designed to eliminate the effect of that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">Respondents have invited our attention to the recently decided case of <em>Barnett </em>v. <em>Brizee, </em>258 Cal.App.2d 97 [65 Cal.Rptr. 493], where the court held the language of the City of Oakland\u2019s charter section 249(2) to be ambiguous. There the son of a deceased fireman was awarded a statutory death benefit by the appeals board. The City of Oakland sought to reduce retirement allowances due the fireman\u2019s widow by the amount of the award. Holding it could be reasonably argued that payments made to separate individuals are not \u201ccumulative\u201d the court denied to the City of Oakland the demanded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>offset. The rule of that case is not applicable here where admittedly such rights as Mrs. Reimers may have are admittedly derivative.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Finally respondents contend that the City of Oakland, which was bound to pay the compensation award, is a different entity than its police and fire retirement fund\u2014and that a claim or obligation of one is not a claim or obligation of the other. This contention is without merit. In <em>French </em>v. <em>Rishell, supra, </em>40 Cal.2d 477, 482, it was held that the Oakland Firemen\u2019s Relief and Pension Fund \u201cacts as an agent of the city, and, in this representative capacity, it is bound by the [Industrial Accident] commission\u2019s decision if the city is bound.\u201d See also <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Fontana County Fire Protection Dist., </em>15 Cal.2d 380, 391 [101 P.2d 1092], where it is stated: \u201c [ G] enerally a political subdivision and the officers, boards, commissions, agents and representatives thereof form but a single entity. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">The award is annulled and the cause remanded to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeals Board for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Molinari, P. J., and Sims, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">The petition of respondent Reimers for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied May 1,1968.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b187-11\"> Admittedly Mrs. Reimers <em>\u2019 </em>claim is derivative.

Accordingly such <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>death allowance \u2019 \u2019 cannot be reduced or otherwise affected by the award of permanent disability indemnity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b192-9\">We take judicial notice of the record <em>of </em>the superior court.
