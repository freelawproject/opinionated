All three were found guilty and each was sentenced to pay a fine of $5,000 and to imprisonment for two years. Among the errors assigned is the refusal of the court, at the close of all the evidence, to direct the jury to return verdicts of acquittal, as to the appellants, on the ground that there was no evidence upon which they could be convicted of a conspiracy in the district of Rhode Island.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-28\">After careful examination of the evidence, we are of the opinion that the District Court erred in denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-29\">The judgment of the District Court is vacated, the verdict is set aside, and the ease is remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
