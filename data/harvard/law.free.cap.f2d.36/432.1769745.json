The Board also found that no lubricating means are disclosed in the patent to Overly, no lubricant chambers called for by the claim of Hauer, and that the rotor of Gressle et al. has a series of lubricant chambers, whieh are independent of eaeh other, but not connected with ports between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-19\">The analytical statement of the claim in issue, made in the brief of appellant, asserts the presence of the following elements:</p>\n<p id=\"b460-20\">A. Solid shaft.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-21\">-B. A rotor body having:</p>\n<p id=\"b460-22\">(1) A series of longitudinal air chambers.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-23\">(2) An inlet port for each air chamber.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-24\">(3) One or more outlet ports for each air chamber.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-25\">(4) A series of piston chambers.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-26\">(5) A piston in eaeh chamber. \u2018</p>\n<p id=\"b460-27\">(6) A port between eaeh piston chamber and air chamber.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-28\">(7) A series of lubricant chambers.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-29\">(8) A series of reservoirs.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-30\">(9) Ports between the lubricant chambers and the reservoirs.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-31\">The Solicitor for the Patent Office during argument supplied the court with a reading which was prepared to show the elements identified in appellants\u2019 disclosure find the references. This reading we quote in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-32\">\u201cAfter eaeh element the first parentheses contain the reference numeral identifying the element in appellants\u2019 disclosure and the second parentheses the corresponding reference numeral of the reference patent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-33\">\u201cClaim 7. In an implement of the character described a rotor (4) (4 of Hauer), comprised of a solid shaft (21) <em>(shaft in bushing 11 of Hauer) </em>and a rotor body (4) (4 of Hauer) carried thereby, and having a series of longitudinal air chambers (27) (13 of Hauer, Fig. 5), in the body, eaeh chamber \u00a1having an inlet (28) (left end pf 13 of Hauer, Fig. 5, unnumbered) and one or more outlet ports (29) (14,14 of Hauer), and having also a series of piston chambers (30) (8 of Hauer, Fig. 2) a piston (31) (7 of Hauer) in eaeh chamber, and a port (32) (25 of Hauer) between each piston chamber and air chamber, and a series of lubricant chambers (37) and reservoirs (39) (23 of Gressle et al. are both chambers and reservoirs) with ports (38) (no corresponding element in reference but held uninventive) between them. (Italics ours.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-36\">It will be noted that we have italicized the words \u201cshaft in bushing 11 of Hauer\u201d in'the foregoing quotation. This element seems to* be a pivotal feature of the controversy, and unless it can be held to be identical, in the sense of the patent law, with the \u201csolid shaft\u201d of appellant, we do not find in any of the references any anticipation of said shaft.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>The language of the Hauer specification relative to this element is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-5\">\u201cThe rotary motor member may be mounted upon a shaft; but I preferably form said member with front and rear journals integrally therewith of less diameter than the body thereof as shown. A motor journal bearing member <em>9 </em>is seated in one part of the casing <em>3 </em>and a removable bushing <em>10 </em>is preferably provided to carry the rear journal of the rotary motor member; and a removable bushing <em>11 </em>seated in an opening in the head of the other part of said easing is provided to carry the front journal of said rotary motor member. Said front journal portion projects through said head and is screw-threaded at <em>12 </em>to attach a tube cleaner or other tool to be driven.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">No one of the Hauer claims uses the word \u201cshaft,\u201d and the member called for in them as the one upon which the rotary motor is mounted (being evidently the- member or part bearing in the bushing) is otherwise designated and described. The only place in the specifications or claims where the word \u201cshaft\u201d occurs is as quoted supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">In the specifications of appellant we find the following relative to the shaft claimed in No. 7:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-8\">\u201cReferring now to the rotor we would state that it is composed of a central shaft <em>21 </em>having at each end a ball-bearing ring <em>22 </em>mounted to rotate on the balls <em>23 </em>held in ball races <em>24 </em>secured in any convenient manner, respectively, in the handle section 1 and the driven shaft section 3 as best seen in Figures 1 and 5. This shaft <em>21 </em>may be integral with the rest of the rotor or be a separate shaft, fitted firmly in the body <em>4 </em>of the rotor and held by a key <em>21a.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">The Board of Appeals held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-10\">\u201cTo connect Gressle\u2019s rotor with a solid shaft as shown in Hauer and connect the lubricant chambers with each other by passages not disclosed in Gressle would not, in our opinion, involve invention. Or, stating it in another way, to introduce into Hauer or Overly the lubricating chambers of Gressle would not involve invention.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">In answer to this finding of the Board of Appeals, appellant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-12\">\u201cSuppose the alleged solid shaft of Hauer were introduced into the rotor body of Gressle, what would the resulting structure be? It is noted that the shaft of Gressle is hollow, and through this hollow shaft the actuating fluid is fed. Suppose that this shaft were solid, as the alleged Hauer shaft, there would be no possible means of providing the rotor with actuating fluid. All means of fluid access to the rotor would be absolutely destroyed. It se\u00e9ms that this substitution, suggested by the Board, would reduce the Gressle device to a mass of unrelated paid\u00ae, and would render the suppositious structure absolutely inoperative and worthless.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-14\">\u201cSuppose, for instance, that the shaft of Hauer were not solid, and in fact, it is not solid, and it were introduced into the rotor body of Gressle. In this case, if the rotor shaft is integral with the rotor, the result would be the Hauer device, but if the shaft and the rotor are not integral there would be produced another Gressle device without the Gressle means to control the admission of air to the rotor; there would be no flat sides on the rotor shaft. In neither case would appellant\u2019s device be produced.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-15\">A close analysis of the claim 7 shows that it calls for a rotor containing a solid shaft, the rotor body having the nine separate and distinct co-operating features as given, supra, and the claim is drawn to the structure of a rotor, which includes the features that are essential to make it operable, including means for lubrication.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-16\">The solid shaft feature of the claim does not appear in any of the references cited. Its only suggested equivalent is an element contained in the Hauer patent and referred to in the brief in behalf of the Commissioner as \u201cthe part bearing in the bushing.\u201d It does not seem to us, from our understanding of the functioning of the machine, that this element is the mechanical equivalent of the shaft of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-17\">We think it is correctly stated by appellants that the complete structure set out in the claim is not shown' by any of the patents cited, nor does it appear that the structure of one can be so modified by substituting features or elements in the structure of the other as to produce the machine claimed by appellants. It does not seem to us that the element referred to as the one \u201cbearing in the bushing\u201d of the Hauer patent could be substituted for the shaft of the claim, or vice versa, so as to produce an operative device, without further and very material modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-18\">An examination of the drawings and specifications leads us to the conclusion that appellants have produced a rotor body mounted on a solid shaft, which body has features or parts in combination for lubrication and operation not shown in the references cited and containing invention as expressed in the claims, for which patent should be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-19\">The decision of the Board of Patent Appeals is therefore reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-20\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
