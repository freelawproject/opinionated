The question involved is purely one of fact, viz. the value of the good will of the business acquired by petitioner. The Board had before it not only opinion evidence as to this, but also all the facts as to the amount invested in the busi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>ness and its earnings and expenses over a long period of time. The finding was supported by the evidence, and there is nothing to show that the Board abused its discretion or proceeded upon any erroneous view of the law. In such case, this court has no power to review the finding or to substitute its judgment for that of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
