Freedlander from the refusal of the Board of Appeals to allow four claims of his application for improvements in driving belts. The four claims are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b170-18\">\u201c1. A two member belt, comprising an inner or compression member, and a tension member, which latter constitutes also the general bulk or body of the belt outside of the inner member.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-19\">\u201c2. A two member belt, comprising an inner or compression member composed of stiflex constituted of a body of 'rubber mixed with fiber, fabricated into sheet form, and a tension member composed of rubberized cord fabric and constituting also the general bulk or body of the belt outside of the inner member.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-20\">\u201c3. A two member belt, comprising an inner or compression member and a tension member, which latter constitutes also the general bulk or body of the belt with a vulcanized rubber protecting cover overlying the periphery of the tension member.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-21\">\u201c4. A two member belt, comprising an inner or compression member composed of stiflex constituted of a body of rubber mixed with fiber, fabricated into sheet form, and a tension member composed of rubberized cord fabric and constituting also the general bulk or body of the belt outside of the inner member, with a vulcanized rubber protecting cover overlying the periphery of the tension member.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-22\">The decision of the Board of which appellant eoniplains is short, and is here set out in full:</p>\n<p id=\"b170-23\">\u201cThis is an appeal from the final rejection of all the claims in the case, four in number; claim 1 being illustrative and reading as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b170-24\">\u201c \u20181. A two member belt, comprising an. inner or compression member, and a tension member which latter constitutes also the general bulk or body of the belt outside of the inner member.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b170-25\">\u201cThe references relied upon are as follows : Gates, 1,354,738, October 5, 1920. Short, 1,538,303, May 19, 1925.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-26\">\u201cAppellant\u2019s invention consists of a belt having an inner compression member, and a tension member which \u2018constitutes the general bulk or body of the belt,\u2019 overlying which is a vulcanized rubber protecting cover.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-27\">\u201cThe claims stand rejected on both Gates and Short. Appellant contends that Gates does not disclose a two member belt and that he shows more fabric layers than cord layers. Gates shows a fabric compression member <em>19 </em>and a tension cord member <em>20, </em>each of which, he states, may consist of one or more layers. In our opinion appellant\u2019s limitation that the tension member \u2018constitutes the general bulk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>or body of the belt\u2019 distinguishes from Gates at most in an unpatentable matter of degree. The same is true of the construction shown in the Short belt.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-5\">\u201cAppellant further contends that Gates and Short do not show \u2018two member belts\u2019 but belts having three members. In Gates the compression and tension members are surrounded by a rubberized fabric <em>18. </em>The belt of appellant is not strictly speaking a two member belt for he has an outer protecting layer <em>5.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\">\u201cWe find no error in the holding of the Examiner, and his decision is accordingly affirmed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">It seems that this opinion answers the contentions of applicant except as to one, specially emphasized in this court, to the effect that in claims 2 and 4 is the provision for the \u201cinner or compression member composed of stiflex constituted of a body of rubber mixed with fiber, fabricated into sheet form,\u201d which constitutes a patentable difference between his belt and those shown in the references.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">In the Examiner\u2019s statement we find the following -with reference to the \u201cstiflex\u201d provision :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-9\">\u201cThe naming of the inner layer \u2018stiflex\u2019 and substitution of the same for the inner fabric layer of Short in which it forms a resilient backing for the cord tension fabric is not deemed an inventive change.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">The brief of the Commissioner of Patents, in this court, in answer to applicant\u2019s \u25a0argument concerning \u201cstiflex,\u201d has the following to say: '</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-11\">\u201cAs to claims 2 and 4 appellant presents the further argument, at page 13 of his brief, that \"neither of the reference patents shows an inner compression member composed of stiflex, that is, rubber having intermixed therewith fiber. It was held that this inner layer of stiflex was merely the equivalent of Short\u2019s inner layer. Furthermore, Gates\u2019 inner compression layer <em>19 </em>is formed \u2022of rubberized fabric. Fabric is made of fibers, and so fabric is fiber. Rubberized fabric is therefore fiber mixed with rubber. 'Similarly in Short\u2019s disclosure the skin coating <em>27 </em>of rubber with the fabric makes rubberized fabric, or fiber mixed with rubber. It is accordingly submitted that either reference clearly discloses an inner compression member composed of rubber having intermixed therewith fiber.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-12\">With this view of the Commissioner and the Examiner we agree. The decision of the Board of Appeals was correct, and should be and is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
