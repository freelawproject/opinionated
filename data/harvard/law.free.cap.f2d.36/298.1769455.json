On June 1,1929, Slattery filed application which ripened into patent 1,483,991 on February 19, 1924, while the Larner application was still pending. On January 19, 1925, Larner copied as claims the five counts which are in issue; same being taken from the Slattery patent and added to his original application of July 22, 1919. On March \u00cd7, 1925, Lamer filed application containing the claims as a division of the earlier application; it being a duplicate of the specifications and drawings of the parent application, and this divisional application was substituted in the interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-27\">The counts in issue are five in number, and correspond to Slattery\u2019s claims 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6. 'No. 1 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>\u201cIn combination with a conduit, a valve comprising a casing, a hollow member within the casing having a plunger, means for shifting said plunger to open and close the valve, and means independent of the means for opening and closing the valve and extending to the exterior of the valve for maintaining within said hollow member substantially the same pressure that exists on the nose of the plunger.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The other four counts cover the same structure in slightly different language, and it is not deemed necessary to quote them verbatim. Count 4 is apparently broader than the others, in that it does not contain the word \u201cindependent,\u201d and No. 5 speaks specifically of an \u201cequalizing pipe.\u201d Otherwise the meaning of all the counts seems to be identical.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The assignments of error, in substance, submit two general questions: Eirst, whether Lamer had the right to make the claims forming the counts of the interference; and, second, whether he was estopped, by any of the facts shown, or by law, from making said claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">The primary matter within the jurisdiction of this court is, of course, that of priority. The proofs of dates of conception and reduction to practice sustain the statement that the dates of Lamer are prior to those of Slattery. This Slattery concedes, and, did the dates constitute the only element to be considered, the question would be entirely answered and in Lamer\u2019s favor. But there is a second element of the first factor, as we have stated the issues, and that is the insistence that Lamer did not have \u201ca sufficient basis in the specification of his application <em>* </em>* * to support the subject-matter of the claims * * *\u201c when said claims are made in Lamer\u2019s application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">The contention upon the latter point revolves about the question of whether the pipe <em>34, </em>shown in the Slattery drawing, so differs in its functioning or in its application to the functions performed, from pipe <em>12, </em>shown in the Lamer drawing, as to preclude it being covered by the Lamer specification while being covered in the Slattery specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">The Board of Appeals in its decision describes the respective structures and their functioning as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-10\">\u201cThe invention of both parties relates to hydraulic valves of the pressure operated plunger type. Slattery moves his plunger <em>17 </em>to open or closed position by hydraulic pressure applied to the piston <em>23 </em>in a cylinder <em>22 </em>located in the chamber <em>A </em>of the valve. Slattery provides an \u2018equalizing pipe <em>34\u2019 </em>which the specification states is \u2018to maintain the same pressure on the inner side of the valve plunger as exists on the nose of the plunger.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-12\">\u201cLamer\u2019s valve has a similar plunger <em>5 </em>movable by hydraulic pressure but his means for moving it differs specifically from that of Slattery. The Lamer specification states\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-13\">\u201cThe main valve <em>5, </em>is operated by control valves <em>10 </em>and <em>11, </em>for example, in either of two ways. Ports or connections <em>8 </em>and <em>9, </em>are either connected to a drain or otherwise discharge against atmospheric pressure; or they are connected to an independent pressure system carrying a pressure higher than that in the main valve. In the first case the plunger <em>5, </em>is moved to open position by exhausting the chamber <em>6, </em>through port <em>8, </em>and is closed by exhausting chamber <em>7, </em>through port <em>9. </em>In the second case the plunger is moved to open position by admitting higher pressure to chamber <em>7, </em>through port <em>9, </em>and is closed by admitting higher pressure to chamber <em>6, </em>through port <em>8. </em>The valves <em>10 </em>and <em>11, </em>are normally closed, and they are alternately opened to move the plunger, but as soon as the plunger has completed its stroke they are closed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-14\">\u201cLamer has a pipe <em>12 </em>similar to Slattery\u2019s pipe <em>34 </em>connecting the valve chamber with the conduit beyond the closing position of the plunger. The question in controversy involves the structure and function of this by-pass pipe.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-15\">The Board then continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-16\">\u201cSlattery contends first, that the pipe <em>12 </em>of Lamer is not independent but a part of his means for opening and dosing the valve. It is true that during the movement of the plunger the size of the chamber in the valve back of the plunger changes and there is flow of water through the pipe <em>12 </em>into or out of said chamber. The same is likewise true of appellant\u2019s pipe <em>34. </em>Moreover, Lamer does not describe his pipe <em>12 as a </em>part of his means for opening and closing his valve. In our opinion the term independent as used in the counts is as applicable to Lamer\u2019s pipe <em>12 </em>as it is to Slattery\u2019s pipe <em>34.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-17\">\u201cSlattery further contends that Lamer\u2019s pipe <em>12 </em>does not have the function of \u2018maintaining within said hollow member substantially the same pressure that exists on the nose of the plunger,\u2019 as called for in the count. Lamer\u2019s specification states that his pipe <em>12 </em>is provided to prevent the pressure on the nose of the plunger from becoming lower than in the chamber <em>6 </em>when the valve is open which would result in closing the valve. The law examiner has carefully analyzed this matter. He finds that in both Lar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>n\u00e9r\u2019s and appellant\u2019s devices there will be a flow of water in the pipe when the plunger is opened or closed and a temporary disturbance of the pressure in the devices of both parties. We agree with his conclusion that the term 'maintains * * * substantially the same pressure * * * \u2019 in the claim is to' be, construed broadly and is properly applicable to Darner\u2019s device as well as that of appellant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">It seems to us that, in so holding, the tribunals in the Patent Office have failed to give recognition to a difference in the functioning of the structures, or in- the application of the pipes to the functions intended to be performed by the structures, which difference we think is entitled to recognition in Slattery\u2019s favor. This difference lies in the fact that in Slattery\u2019s structure the pipe <em>34 </em>is a \u201cmeans independent of the means for opening and closing the valve,\u201d etc., as claimed in typical count 1, supra, while in the Larner structure the pipe <em>12 </em>is connected to an operating chamber.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">The effect of this independent means in operation appears to be that of maintaining within the hollow member in which the valve is constructed substantially the same pressure as that which exists on the nose of the plunger; this being accomplished by reason of the fact that one end of the pipe <em>34 </em>in Slattery\u2019s structure is connected to the exterior of the valve, while the relatively corresponding end of pipe <em>12 </em>in Lamer\u2019s structure is connected with a chamber in the valve itself. The Slattery arrangement thus equalizes the pressure and affects the opening and closing of the valve in a manner different from the operation applied by the Lamer arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\"> We feel assured from the record in the case that, at the time of filing his parent application, appellee did not contemplate or ex-peet the performance of the same function in the same way by his pipe <em>12, </em>as Slattery expected from his pipe <em>34. </em>The Lamer specifications and claims do not specifically disclose any such purpose, while those of Slattery appear to us clearly to do so. It is true that an applicant need not, at the time of filing application, necessarily be conscious of every function which his device can perform in order to claim it, and in interference proceedings \u201cclaims should be given as broad a meaning as their terminology will reasonably permit.\u201d Sherman v. Hagemann, 51 App. D. C. 373, 279 F. 1011, 1922 C. D. 121. But this principle should not, we think, be \u2022stretched so as to apply to a ease where there is-such manifest difference in structures, speeifie\u00e1tions, .and claims as appears to exist in the instant ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">Under this view of the case, it does not appear to be necessary that we should pass upon the question of estoppel raised in the second part of Slattery\u2019s contention as we have stated it, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">For the reasons given, the decision of the Board of Patent Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
