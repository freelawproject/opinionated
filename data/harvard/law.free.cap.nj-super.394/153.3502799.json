[procedures requiring that the social security number of ... any applicant for a ... driver\u2019s license ... be recorded on the application^]\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 666(a)(13)(A). If a state fails to comply with this mandate, it \u201close[s] a substantial portion of [its] federal funding for various welfare programs[.]\u201d <em>Tenison v. State, </em>38 P.3d 535, 537 (Alaska Ct.App.2001). In conformity with this mandate, the Legislature enacted <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:17-56.60(a)(l), which provides in pertinent part that \u201c[t]he Social Security number of an applicant for any ... driver\u2019s license ... shall be recorded on the applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>tion.\u201d To implement this legislation, the Motor Vehicle Commission adopted a regulation, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">(a) An applicant for any ... driver license ... or registration shall disclose his or her social security number(s) upon the application form furnished by the Chief Administrator of the Motor Vehicle Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-7\">(c) This section shall not apply to persons who are exempt from applying for a social security number.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-8\"><em>[N.J.A.C. </em>13:21-1.3.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">In September 2005, the Commission notified appellant, whose driver\u2019s license was scheduled to expire on January 31, 2006, that \u201cyour name and/or date of birth on your motor vehicle record does not match information contained in Social Security Administration files[,]\u201d and that the Commission would not be able to renew his license unless he resolved this discrepancy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">Appellant responded to this letter by submitting a letter in November 2005, followed by an affidavit, executed on January 17, 2006, which asserted that he was not required by federal law to maintain a social security number, that he had revoked any social security registration he may have obtained before he became \u201cof legal age,\u201d and therefore, he had \u201cno valid social security account number.\u201d These submissions were accompanied by a document, entitled \u201cAffidavit of Revocation and Rescission,\u201d submitted by appellant to the Department of Treasury in 1990, by which appellant purported to revoke his registration with the Social Security Administration. Appellant claimed that as a result of his submission of this document to the Social Security Administration, he was \u201cexempt\u201d within the intent of <em>N.J.AC. </em>13:21-1.3(c) from the requirement of submission of a social security number on his application for renewal of his driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">Although the Commission did not respond directly to appellant\u2019s letter and affidavit claiming this exemption, it did not renew his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>driver\u2019s license. Appellant also went to the Commission\u2019s service center in Trenton and made telephone calls to the Commission\u2019s offices, but the representatives with whom he spoke declined to renew his driver\u2019s license on the ground that his application did not include a social security number.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Appellant then wrote letters to the Commission, a state Senator and two members of the Assembly objecting to the Commission\u2019s refusal to renew his driver\u2019s license. The Commission responded to communications from the state legislators by a letter dated March 21, 2006, a copy of which was sent to appellant, which stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-6\">Please be advised that the only exception from the MVC\u2019s requirement for driver license renewal applicants to provide their Social Security numbers is for \u201cpersons who are exempt from applying for a social security number.\u201d See <em>New Jersey Administrative Code </em>13:21-1.3(c) which is enclosed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-7\">Mr. Alpert indicated that he filed an Affidavit of Revocation and Rescission with the United States Treasury Department in 1990, and he provided a receipt for certified mail to indicate that he sent the letter by certified mail. Mr. Alpert also provided a letter from the Social Security Administration (SSA), dated August 12, 2005. That letter indicated, among other things, that the SSA does not require a person to obtain a Social Security number but that other agencies do require Social Security numbers. One such agency mentioned is the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) which requires Social Security numbers on tax returns.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-8\">The actions that Mr. Alpert has taken do not prove that he is exempt from applying for a Social Security number.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-9\">MVC needs a letter from the SSA which indicates that Mr. Alpert is no longer a participant in the Social Security system and that he no longer has a Social Security number in order to exempt him from MVC\u2019s regulatory requirement that he must submit his Social Security number before his driver license can be renewed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-10\">The letter that Mr. Alpert provided from the SSA merely indicates that the Social Security Act does not require a person to obtain a Social Security number. It does not state that Mr. Alpert does not have a Social Security number.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-11\">Several years ago, in a very similar situation, a driver claimed that he was no longer a participant in the Social Security system and he wanted to renew his driver license without submitting his Social Security number. The former Division of Motor Vehicle[s] (DMV) (now MVC) rejected his renewal application when he failed to provide proof that he no longer participated in the Social Security system and no longer had a Social Security number.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-12\">The applicant sued the DMV and DMV ultimately prevailed. The Appellate Division of the New Jersey Superior Court in an unreported decision (copy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>enclosed), <em>Earl W. Werline, III v. Jeffrey T. Pistol and C. Richard Kamin </em>(Docket No. A-4830-00T5) (unpublished, 2002), stated on page 6:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-7\">[Appellant\u2019s] unilateral execution of an affidavit is insufficient to eliminate a social security number and need not be recognized by the Division of Motor Vehicles.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">On the date of expiration of his driver\u2019s license, appellant filed an action in the Law Division seeking to compel the Commission to renew his license. The Law Division transferred the action, which challenges the decision of a state administrative agency, to this court. <em>See R. </em>1:13\u20144(a); <em>R. </em>2:2-3(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">We disapprove of the informal manner in which the Commission acted upon appellant\u2019s application for renewal of his driver\u2019s license. The Commission should have responded to appellant\u2019s November 2005 letter and/or his January 17, 2006 affidavit with a clear statement of its reasons for refusing to renew his driver\u2019s license. Appellant should not have been forced to seek the assistance of state legislators in order to obtain such a statement. However, the letter to the legislators has now provided appellant with that statement. Moreover, we are satisfied that there is no contested issue of fact material to appellant\u2019s entitlement to a driver\u2019s license that requires referral of this matter to the Office of Administrative Law for an evidentiary hearing. Therefore, we address the merits of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">Initially, we note that appellant did not present any evidence that the Social Security Administration had accepted his purported \u201cAffidavit of Revocation and Rescission\u201d of his social security registration. Appellant suggests that the Commission had some sort of an obligation to investigate the status of his social security registration. However, appellant is the one who claimed the exemption provided by <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:21-1.3 from the requirement of submission of a social security number with an application for a driver\u2019s license. Therefore, appellant had the burden to submit satisfactory evidence that he qualified for the exemption. Appellant\u2019s submission of evidence demonstrating that the Department of Treasury received his purported \u201cAffidavit of Revocation and Rescission,\u201d without submission of any evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>that the Social Security Administration had accepted that affidavit, did not satisfy this burden. <em>See Hershey v. Pa. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>669 A.2d 517, 519-20 (Pa.Commw.Ct.), <em>appeal denied, </em>544 <em>Pa. </em>664, 676 A.2d 1202 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Moreover, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:17-56.-60(a)(l), and the federal statute it was enacted to comply with, do not provide that a person may be relieved of the requirement of submission of a social security number with an application for a driver\u2019s license by simply failing to apply for or revoking a registration with the Social Security Administration. Federal law provides limited exemptions from the requirement of payment of social security taxes. For example, such an exemption is provided to a person who is \u201cconscientiously opposed to acceptance\u201d of social security benefits as a result of membership in a \u201crecognized religious sect\u201d whose teachings oppose receipt of such benefits. 26 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1402(g); see <em>Kocher v. Bickley, </em>722 A.2d 756, 760 n. 11 (Pa.Commw.Ct.1999). We believe that <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:21-1.3(c) must be read to provide an exemption from the requirement of submission of a social security number with an application for a driver\u2019s license only to persons who are exempt under 26 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1402(g) or other similar provision. Appellant has not presented any evidence that he qualifies for such a federal statutory exemption. Therefore, he would not be exempt from the requirement of submission of a social security number with the application for renewal of his driver\u2019s license even if he could show that the Social Security Administration had accepted his \u201cAffidavit of Revocation and Rescission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b183-12\"> Appellant\u2019s 2001 application for renewal of his driver\u2019s license included a social security number, which apparently did not correspond with Social Security Administration records.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
