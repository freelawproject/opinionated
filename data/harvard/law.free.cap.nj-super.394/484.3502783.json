The appeal thus raises the narrow issue of whether, as expressed by the Supreme Court in <em>Kane v. Bd. of Trs., Police and Firemen\u2019s Ret. Sys., </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>651, 663, 498 A.2d 1252 (1985), the source of petitioner\u2019s injury itself \u201cwas a great rush of force or uncontrollable power.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">Following an injury occurring on November 8, 2000, petitioner, a member of PERS, sought accidental disability retirement benefits from that system. The Board of Trustees of PERS denied petitioner\u2019s application, finding that the accident did not constitute a \u201ctraumatic event,\u201d but granted petitioner ordinary disability retirement benefits, effective November 1, 2002, finding that peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>tioner was totally and permanently disabled from the performance of her regular and assigned duties, and that her disability was a direct result of the November 8 incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Petitioner appealed, and the matter was referred to the Office of Administrative Law for an evidentiary hearing. Prior to the hearing, PERS stipulated that petitioner had met the first two of <em>Kane\u2019s </em>requirements\u2014that her injuries were not induced by the stress or strain of normal work effort, and that she met involuntarily with the object or matter that was the source of the harm. <em>Ibid. </em>However, following the hearing, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) determined in a comprehensive initial decision, as had the PERS Board, that petitioner had failed to meet <em>Kane\u2019s </em>third requirement, finding that \u201cthe incident of November 8, 2000 does not constitute a traumatic event within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:15A-43.\u201d Upon further appeal, the Board accepted the finding of the ALJ that the incident of November 8 was not a traumatic event, and it accepted the ALJ\u2019s recommendation that accidental disability retirement benefits be denied. This appeal followed, and we reverse. We confine our analysis to the one issue raised in the administrative proceeding: whether a \u201ctraumatic event\u201d occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The record of the hearing before the ALJ discloses that, at the time of the event at issue, petitioner was a school bus driver, employed by the Pennsauken Board of Education to transport special needs students, most of whom were autistic, to the private schools to which they had been assigned. On the morning of November 8, petitioner had stopped at the school that \u201cM.,\u201d a third-grade student of eight or nine years of age, attended. As was her custom, petitioner was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat, handing school bags with her right hand to each student as the student exited the bus. As M. approached the front of the bus, petitioner noticed that he was gaining momentum, while twisting from side to side in a manner that petitioner found to be \u201cpeculiar.\u201d Petitioner testified that she \u201cwasn\u2019t sure exactly what he was doing.\u201d As he reached petitioner, according to her testimony, M. \u201cbasically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>turned Ms back to me and threw himself at me ... with Ms shoulder and Ms back.\u201d Petitioner, concerned that M. would injure himself on the dashboard, steering wheel or gear shift, and concerned for her own safety, put up her hands to break M.\u2019s fall. In doing so, petitioner bent back both wrists and suffered an injury to her bracMal plexus. M. fell onto petitioner\u2019s lap, but then slid to the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">In his mitial opinion denying accidental disability retirement benefits, the ALJ stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-5\">The purported \u201cgreat rush of force\u201d in this case consists of a third grade student who flung himself backward onto petitioner\u2019s lap. Petitioner\u2019s physical description of M. in no way indicates that he was in any way oversized in comparison to other third graders. Nor is there anything in the record to indicate M. was significantly older, and therefore bigger, than the other third graders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-6\">I FIND that the force generated by the third grader\u2019s conduct does not meet the definition of a \u201cgreat rush of force\u201d or \u201cuncontrollable power,\u201d as defined in the case law. Therefore, petitioner has failed to satisfy the third prong of the <em>Kane </em>test.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Receipt of the benefits sought by petitioner requires a showing of permanent and total disability, uncontested here, taking place \u201cas a direct result of a traumatic event occurring during and as a result of the performance of [her] regular or assigned duties____\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>43:15A-43. The requirement of evidence of a \u201ctraumatic event\u201d appears, as well, in connection with statutes providing for accidental disability pension benefits under the State\u2019s other two public pension systems: the Police and Firemen\u2019s Retirement System, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-7, and the Teacher\u2019s Pension and Annuity Fund, <em>see N.J.SA </em>18A:66-39. Precedent construing the three statutes is thus relevant to the present matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">What constitutes a \u201ctraumatic event\u201d has vexed our courts since the Legislature\u2019s adoption of that statutory requirement, in lieu of a prior requirement that an \u201caccident\u201d be the precipitating cause of the disability. <em>See </em>L. 1966, c. 67, \u00a7 4; <em>see also Maynard v. Bd. of Trs. of the Teachers\u2019 Pension and Annuity Fund, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>169, 172-73, 549 A.2d 1213 (1988); <em>Cattani v. Bd. of Trs., Police and Firemen\u2019s Ret. Sys., </em>69 <em>N.J. </em>578, 583-84, 355 A.2d 625 (1976); and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number><em>Russo v. Teachers\u2019 Pension and Annuity Fund, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>142, 151, 299 A.2d 697 (1973) (discussing legislative and judicial history).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">It is clear that the Legislature, by passage of this amendment, sought to limit awards of accidental disability retirement benefits\u2014which are markedly higher than ordinary disability retirement benefits <em>(compare N.J.S.A. </em>43:15A-46 with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:15A-45)\u2014to more narrowly drawn circumstances and to a smaller cohort than had previously been the case. Unfortunately, however, the language adopted by the Legislature gives little guidance as to what constitutes a \u201ctraumatic event.\u201d Judicial interpretation has filled that void, but in a manner that has highlighted the difficulty of giving consistent meaning to a term potentially applicable to the wide range of workplace circumstances in which accidental injury meriting enhanced compensation has been considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">In its opinion in <em>Cattani, </em>the Supreme Court rejected our early conclusion, rendered in <em>Hillman v. Bd. of Trs., Public Employees\u2019 Ret. Sys., </em>109 <em>N.J.Super. </em>449, 460-61, 263 A.2d 789 (App.Div.1970), that a \u201ctraumatic\u201d event must be \u201cundesigned, unexpected and unusual,\u201d finding that formulation to be \u201ctoo broad\u201d and to \u201cfrustrate[ <em>] </em>the restriction which the Legislature intended to place on the granting of an accidental disability pension when it substituted the expression \u2018traumatic event\u2019 for the word \u2018accident.\u2019 \u201d 69 <em>N.J. </em>at 585, 355 A.2d 625. The <em>Cattani </em>Court determined that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-8\">The phrase \u2018traumatic event\u2019 would ordinarily involve a mishap or accident involving the application of some kind of external force to the body or the violent exposure of the body to some external force.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-10\"><em>[Id. </em>at 586, 355 A.2d 625.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-11\">However, the Court also recognized that \u201ca traumatic event may possibly be found in some situations which do not literally fall within the external force or violence concept but still might be regarded as having a traumatic origin.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b517-12\">Later, in <em>Kane, </em>the Supreme Court refined its definition of a traumatic event by exempting injuries sustained as the result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>of \u201cthe stress or strain of the normal work effort,\u201d and requiring that the petitioner \u201cmeet involuntarily with the object or matter that was the source of the harm,\u201d and establish that \u201cthe source of the injury itself was a great rush of force or uncontrollable power\u201d that the petitioner did not bring into motion. 100 <em>N.J. </em>at 663, 498 A.2d 1252. As examples of qualifying injuries, the Court mentioned a fireman thrown off the roof of a building by a sudden explosion or burst of flames, a fireman who is struck by a falling beam, or one who falls off the top step of a ladder.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Despite the formulation of a standard that the Supreme Court \u201chope[d]\u201d would \u201cbring clarification to the area,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>the precise nature of what constitutes a traumatic event continues to create interpretational difficulties for the Court and, consequentially, for us<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the Boards involved. <em>See, e.g., Maynard, supra, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>at 177-79, 549 A.2d 1213 (Stein, J., concurring and O\u2019Hern, J., dissenting); <em>Ciecwisz v. Bd. of </em>Trs., <em>Police and Firemen\u2019s Ret. Sys., </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>180, 182-92, 549 A.2d 1218 (1988) (O\u2019Hern, J., joined by Handler, J., dissenting, and Stein, J., separately dissenting) and <em>Mazza v. Bd. of Trs., Police and Firemen\u2019s Ret. Sys., </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>22, 25-30, 667 A.2d 1052 (1995) (Handler, J., joined by Stein, J., dissenting). As Justice O\u2019Hern complained in <em>Maynard: </em>\u201cIn focusing on Justice Clifford\u2019s examples of a \u2018great rush of force,\u2019 the majority has turned useful guides to the Legislature\u2019s intent into an artificially-created standard of ground-level disqualification.\u201d 113 <em>N.J. </em>at 178, 549 A.2d 1213.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>While we appreciate Justice O\u2019Hern\u2019s comments, we need not address them substantively in the present case of traumatic injury, in which the great rush of force required by <em>Kane, </em>consisting of the hurtling body of M., certainly existed. In reaching this conclusion, we are mindful of the deference that we must accord the decisions of administrative agencies. <em>Mazza, supra, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>at 25, 667 A.2d 1052; <em>Henry v. Rahway State Prison, </em>81 N.J. 571, 579-80, 410 A.2d 686 (1980); <em>Campbell v. Dept. of Civil Serv., </em>39 <em>N.J. </em>556, 562, 189 A.2d 712 (1963). Nonetheless, \u201c(a]n appellate tribunal is in no way bound by the agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute or its determination of a strictly legal issue.\u201d <em>Mazza, supra, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>at 29, 667 A.2d 1052 (Handler, J., dissenting) (quoting <em>Mayflower Securities v. Bureau of Securities, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>85, 93, 312 A.2d 497 (1973)).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Here, in a case in which the facts are essentially undisputed, we differ from the conclusion reached by the Board as to the applicability of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:15A-43 to petitioner\u2019s case. We perceive no legal basis for determining that the force created by the eight- to nine-year-old, approximately sixty- to seventy-pound, boy who launched himself into petitioner was inadequate to meet the <em>Kane </em>standard\u2014a conclusion that the ALJ and the Board apparently reached solely by determining that M. was no bigger than other children of his age, and without adequate consideration of the potential for injury inherent in an average child of M.\u2019s age who hurled himself at petitioner in the fashion that M. employed. Nor do we find any evidentiary basis for concluding that a statutorily-eognizable \u201ctraumatic event\u201d would not exist when an average child of M.\u2019s age engaged in conduct similar to that of M. In this regard, we note that a \u201ctraumatic event\u201d has been found to exist on the basis of the exertion of far less force. <em>See, e.g., Muller v. Bd. of Trs., Police and Firemen\u2019s Ret. Sys., </em>316 <em>N.J.Super. </em>94, 719 A.2d 699 (App.Div.1998) (bite by suspect, leading to struggle and fall, in which petitioner\u2019s previously-injured shoulder was re-injured); <em>Duignan v. Public Employees\u2019 Ret. Sys., </em>223 <em>N.J.Super. </em>208, 218, 538 A.2d 432 (App.Div.1988) (holding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>\u201c[i]n an organ as sensitive as the eye the invasion of broom bristles can be a \u2018great rush of force or uncontrollable power.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">We regard the circumstances presented by this case as fitting comfortably within both the intent and the language of <em>N.J.S.A </em>43:15A-48 .and the requirements of <em>Kane. </em>Our review of the record satisfies us that the Board\u2019s decision to the contrary lacked substantial support in the essentially-uncontested facts set forth at the hearing; and that in applying the legislative policies articulated in connection with the accidental disability retirement benefit statute to the facts that were presented, the Board reached conclusions that could not reasonably have been drawn from the record before it. <em>Mazza, supra, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>at 25, 667 A.2d 1052. While we continue to advocate a re-evaluation of <em>Kane, </em>or at least a relaxation of its standards to include situations outside the strictures of its tripartite test, as <em>Cattani </em>suggested might be necessary, in this case, we are satisfied that <em>Kane, </em>even as literally applied, provided ample grounds for the relief that petitioner seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b518-5\"> This last example appears to be inconsistent with cases denying benefits for slip and fall accidents, <em>see, e.g. Maynard, supra, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>169, 549 A.2d 1213, and has unnecessarily invited nice distinctions as to the distance of a fall required for recovery of accidental disability retirement benefits in cases that could have been resolved more consistently by a focus on the cause of the fall. See discussion in <em>Angiola v. Bd. of Trs., Public Employees' Ret.
