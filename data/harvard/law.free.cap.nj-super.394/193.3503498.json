Plaintiffs Joseph and Pamela Hughes, neighboring residential property owners, objected to the application as a nonresidential use of property zoned for low-density residential uses. After hearing extensive testimony from both sides, the Board voted five to one to approve the application, granting thirteen distinct use and bulk variances. Thereafter, plaintiffs filed a complaint in lieu of prerogative writs with the Law Division, claiming that several Board members should have been disqualified because of financial or personal involvement with the University. Plaintiffs also claimed the Board\u2019s grant of the variances was improper and a usurpation of the Borough\u2019s zoning power. Judge Lehrer affirmed the Board\u2019s decisions, and plaintiffs appealed to this court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm substantially for the reasons expressed by Judge Lehrer in his decision, <em>Hughes, et </em>al., <em>v. Monmouth Univ. and W. Long Branch Bd. of Adjustment, </em>394 <em>N.J.Super. </em>207, 925 A.2d 750 (Law Div.2006), as supplemented by the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The Municipal Land Use Law (MLUL), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-69, provides in pertinent part that \u201cno member of the board of adjustment shall be permitted to act on any matter in which he has, either directly or indirectly, any <em>personal or financial interest.\u201d Ibid, </em>(emphasis added). This conflict-of-interest provision codified the existing common law, <em>Care of Tenafly v. Borough of Tenafly, </em>307 <em>N.J.Super. </em>362, 369, 704 A.2d 1032 (App.Div.1998), and has been interpreted as precluding action by board members in four situations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-6\">(1) \u201cDirect pecuniary interests,\u201d when an official votes on a matter benefiting the official\u2019s own property or affording a direct financial gain; (2) \u201cIndirect pecuniary interests,\u201d when an official votes on a matter that financially benefits one closely tied to the official, such as an employer, or family member; (3) \u201cDirect personal interest,\u201d when an official votes on a matter that benefits a blood relative or close <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Mend in a non-financial way, but a matter of great importance, as in the case of a councilman\u2019s mother being in the nursing home subject to the zoning issue; and (4) \u201cIndirect Personal Interest,\u201d when an official votes on a matter in which an individual\u2019s judgment may be affected because of membership in some organization and a desire to help that organization further its policies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\"><em>[Wyzykowski v. Rizas, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>509, 524, 626 A.2d 406 (1993).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">In 1996, the Local Government Ethics Law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:9-22.1 to -22.5, was enacted, barring a public official, such as a member of a board of adjustment, <em>see Haggerty v. Red Bank Borough Zoning Bd. of Adjustment, </em>385 <em>N.J.Super. </em>501, 514, 897 A.2d 1094 (App.Div.2006), from acting in any matter in which he or she \u201chas a direct or indirect <em>financial or personal involvement </em>that might reasonably be expected to impair his[7her] objectivity or independence of judgment.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:9-22.5(d)(emphasis added). The Ethics Law also extends the prohibition to immediate family members or business associates. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">As we indicated in <em>Shapiro v. Mertz, </em>368 <em>N.J.Super. </em>46, 53, 845 A.2d 186 (App.Div.2004), \u201c[t]he Ethics Law expanded the definition of a conflict of interest which had been established through common law and codified by the MLUL, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-23b.\u201d Indeed, one of the leading land-use scholars believes that \u201cthe Ethics Law broadens the areas of disqualification at least by its extension of reach to the indirect involvements of family members and business associates.\u201d William M. Cox, <em>Zoning and Land Use Administration, </em>3-1.2(d) at 50 (2007). According to Cox, \u201cit is unclear whether the use of the word \u2018involvement\u2019 instead of \u2018interest\u2019 bears significance,\u201d but \u201cintangible relations such as a friendship or being an alumnus of the same school as the applicant could be held to be grounds for disqualification depending upon the circumstances.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Nevertheless, whether considering the MLUL\u2019s definition or the broader Ethics Law, we still agree with Judge Lehrer\u2019s determination that none of the involvements and interests highlighted by plaintiff, under the circumstances presented herein, constituted disqualifying conflicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">It is clear that an alumnus of a University applicant has an \u201cinvolvement\u201d with the school. But here, where the board mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>bers obtained their degrees many years ago, were not active alumni members, and did not substantially contribute to the University or otherwise evidence any special attachment to the school, no reasonable person could conclude that such involvement would have tempted them \u201cto depart from [their] sworn public duty.\u201d <em>Care of Tenafly, supra, </em>307 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 369-70, 704 A.2d 1032; <em>Barrett v. Union Twp. Comm., </em>230 <em>N.J.Super. </em>195, 201, 553 A.2d 62 (App.Div.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">We also note that none of the board members or their family members is a current student at the University. <em>Compare McVoy v. Bd. of Adjustment of Twp. of Montclair, </em>213 <em>N.J.Super. </em>109, 111-112, 516 A.2d 634 (App.Div.1986) (finding current membership in a religious congregation a conflict where the congregation was the applicant) and <em>Zell v. Borough of Roseland, </em>42 <em>N.J.Super. </em>75, 81-82, 125 A.2d 890 (App.Div.1956) (finding disqualification because of membership in a church which had applied for a zone change); <em>with Sugarman v. Twp. of Teaneck, </em>272 <em>N.J.Super. </em>162, 169, 639 A.2d 402 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>137 <em>N.J. </em>310, 645 A.2d 139 (1994) (finding prior membership in congregation too remote an interest to require disqualification from synagogue\u2019s application).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">It is true that one of the board member\u2019s children, who had attended the University in the past, received a $4,500 tuition credit from the school. However, the credit was awarded because of the student\u2019s academic record and was available to all similarly situated students. Consequently, this credit would not have interfered with the members\u2019 impartial performance of his duties. <em>Wyzykowski, supra, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>at 523, 626 A.2d 406. Similarly, the fact that a board member\u2019s child may in the future consider attending the University or that a member\u2019s company won a public bid and performed some work for the school over ten years ago, are both much too remote to constitute conflicts. <em>See Van Itallie v. Borough of Franklin Lakes, </em>28 <em>N.J. </em>258, 269, 146 A.2d 111 (1958); <em>Sugarman, supra, </em>272 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 169, 639 A.2d 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>Furthermore, the fact that board members participated in various University events, such as concerts, wine tastings, and athletic events, would similarly not be disqualifying. None of these involvements, which were open to the public generally, could \u201creasonably be expected to impair [the board member\u2019s] objectivity or independence of judgment.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>40A:9-22.5(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Plaintiffs further argue that board member Juliano was disqualified from voting and improperly participated in one of the final hearings, thereby rendering the result void in its entirety. <em>See Haggerty supra, </em>385 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 517, 897 A.2d 1094; <em>Szoke v. Zoning Bd. of Adjustment, </em>260 <em>N.J.Super. </em>341, 343-44, 616 A.2d 942 (App.Div.1992). The final hearings plaintiffs reference, however, dealt with the site plan and occurred well after the variances had been approved. Plaintiffs also complain of Juliano \u201cquestioning objector Hughes, especially as related to the tennis court aspect of the plan. In addition, she also questioned the objector\u2019s Professional Planner\u201d regarding the placement of the tennis courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">However, Juliano\u2019s relatively minimal participation was not fatal because she was not disqualified \u201cfor cause.\u201d <em>See DeMaria v. JEB Brook L.L.C., </em>372 <em>N.J.Super. </em>138, 148, 855 A.2d 628 (Law Div.2003). Instead, she disqualified herself from voting because she had missed several meetings due to her ill son. Had she read the transcripts from the missed meetings, she could have voted. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-10.2. Under these circumstances, she was not precluded from commenting on those issues for which she was properly prepared.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">Finally, plaintiffs claim that when the entire 19.277 acre proposal is considered, and not just the 4.38 acres relating to the tennis courts, the project was clearly an usurpation of the Borough\u2019s zoning authority. However, the entire proposal constituted only three percent of the R-22 zone and was hardly a substantial modification of the zone. <em>See Twp. of Dover v. Bd. of Adjustment, </em>158 <em>N.J.Super </em>401, 412-13, 386 A.2d 421 (App.Div.1978) (finding \u201cthe size of the tract relative to the size and character of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>district in which it is located\u201d one of the relevant factors in determining whether usurpation has occurred). Moreover, unlike <em>Twp. of N. Brunswick v. Zoning Bd. of Adjustment of Twp. of N. Brunswick, </em>378 <em>N.J.Super. </em>485, 494, 876 A.2d 320 (App.Div.2005), there was no indication in the record that the Borough clearly-disapproved of the proposed use within the zone. In fact, the surrounding area includes numerous other resident dorms and other University structures that are similar in style and size to the proposed plan. Consequently, the variances did not significantly alter the township\u2019s zoning plan, and Judge Lehrer correctly found that the variance approvals were not usurpations of the Borough\u2019s zoning authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b224-7\"> The Borough of West Long Branch had brought a separate action challenging only the Board's approval of the tennis courts, associated parking lot, and storm water basin. The Borough claimed that the approval of these uses on one residential block was a usurpation of its zoning authority. The trial court found to the contrary, and the Borough has not appealed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
