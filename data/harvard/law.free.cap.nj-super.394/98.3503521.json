Plaintiffs claim defendants inflated the prices of the art through fraudulent bidding practices. We conclude that because the difficulties likely to be encountered in the management of this class action cannot be overcome, <em>see R. </em>4:32\u20141(b)(3)(D), common questions of law do not predominate over individual questions. Consequently, we conclude that class certification was improvidently granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-11\">Defendants, Park West at Sea, a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Florida, and Park West Gallery, a Michigan corporation with its principal place of business in Michigan (collectively, defendants or Park West), conduct land-based art auctions and art auctions aboard cruise ships. They maintain art storage facilities in both Florida and Michigan. Plaintiffs are New Jersey residents who represent the putative class, which includes potentially thousands of residents of the United States <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> who, between 1996 and the present, attended those auctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>Since 1996, Park West has conducted auctions on ships operated by seven different cruise lines, departing from a variety of locations, including numerous states and territories, as well as international ports. Plaintiffs estimate that 90,000 individuals bid on art on Carnival Cruise Lines alone. While the parties agree that the auctions were held on board the cruise ships, the record is not specific as to where the ships were located when the auctions took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Defendants also sold art at sidewalk sales and in on-ship galleries. While they maintain records of the names and addresses of the individuals who purchased art, the records do not indicate the means by which the art was purchased, nor do they contain the names of individuals who attended auctions without making a purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">As is standard practice in the auction industry, art sold at defendants\u2019 auctions was subject to a \u201creserve,\u201d a confidential minimum price below which the art would not be sold. Park West\u2019s customer catalog states that \u201c[w]e may implement such reserve by opening or continuing the bidding, or [by] placing bids in response to other bidders, up to the amount of the reserve.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">While the auctioneers are independent contractors, Park West supplies them with a \u201cPolicy and Procedure Manual.\u201d The manual provides for eight levels of pricing for any given work. In order of highest to lowest, they are: \u201cAbove Reserve\u201d; \u201cReserve\u201d; \u201cBelow Reserve\u201d; \u201cRedline\u201d; \u201cUnder\u201d; \u201c.9 Under\u201d; \u201c.8 Under\u201d; and \u201cBelow.\u201d When conducting an auction, the auctioneer views a computer screen that lists, for each piece of art, the prices corresponding to those various pricing levels. According to the manual, an auctioneer has the discretion to set the reserve anywhere in the range from the price representing the \u201cbelow\u201d pricing level to the price representing the \u201creserve\u201d pricing level. The manual states that the \u201cbelow\u201d is the price below which the art may not be sold. Most auctioneers, guided by the range established by the pricing levels, mentally set a reserve, \u201c[o]n the fly\u201d; it is not a pre-determined amount. Accordingly, that num<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>ber is never written down or disclosed, and is subject to change at the auctioneer\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">The auctioneer may also place bids on behalf of the house (house bid). The only limit in placing house bids is the \u201creserve\u201d pricing level on the auctioneer\u2019s computer. The auctioneer may bid a sum higher than the reserve, which is referred to as \u201cbidding to reserve\u201d and serves to \u201cstimulate bidding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Plaintiffs allege that under these practices, the \u201cbelow\u201d pricing level represents the true reserve and the house bidding procedure fraudulently inflates the value of the art. They further assert that not only do auctioneers artificially inflate bids, but they place house bids in a deceptive manner. For example, the auctioneer will sometimes bid to reserve by using a \u201chouse number,\u201d a number not assigned to the placard of any bidder in the room. If an auctioneer places a house bid using a house number, and no one places a higher bid, the auctioneer will end the auction and call out the house number, so that the audience believes the art has been sold for that price. Plaintiffs allege that auctioneers do not always disclose that the house places the bid; they sometimes point to the back of the gallery to lead the audience to believe that an audience member placed the bid.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Park West\u2019s materials instruct auctioneers to use the bid-to-reserve technique to maximize sales. Nevertheless, the instructions direct auctioneers to be honest with bidders; not to pretend to acknowledge a non-existent bidder; and not to indicate that a work has been sold if it has not. At their depositions, many auctioneers testified that they infrequently use the bid-to-reserve procedure, and they never do so where a customer has already placed a bid or where a piece of art is unique.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">The trial court\u2019s order granted class certification to \u201c \u2018[a]ll individuals who attended and bid on artwork and were at any of the Park West live auctions from 1996 to present[,]\u2019 [w]ith respect to the following cause of action: \u2018Any claims premised on an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>alleged violation of the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In New Jersey, class certification is governed by <em>Rule </em>4:32-1, which is modeled after the federal class action rule, <em>Fed.R.Civ.P. </em>23. <em>Iliadis v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>88, 103, 922 A.2d 710 (2007); <em>Varacallo v. Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>332 <em>N.J.Super. </em>31, 41, 752 A.2d 807 (App.Div.2000); <em>see also Muise v.

To attain class certification, a plaintiff must establish the following four requirements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-6\">(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class, (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class, and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class, [R. 4:32-l(a); <em>see also Muise II, supra, </em>371 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 30, 851 A.2d 799 (referring to the \u201cthreshold requirements\u201d of numerosity, commonality, typicality and adequacy of representation).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">A plaintiff must not only satisfy the prerequisites of paragraph (a) of <em>Rule </em>4:32-1, but must also establish one of the three factors articulated in paragraph (b) of that rule. As is relevant to this case, <em>Rule </em>4:32-l(b) requires that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-8\">(3) the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy. The factors pertinent to the findings include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-9\">(A) the interest of members of the class in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-10\">(B) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already commenced by or against members of the class;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-11\">(C) the desirability or undesirability in concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-12\">(D) the difficulties likely to be encountered in the management of a class action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-13\">[i?. 4:32\u20141(b)(3).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-14\">The party seeking class certification bears the burden of establishing that the requirements of <em>Rule </em>4:32-1 are met. <em>Iliadis, supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>191 <em>N.J. </em>at 106, 922 A.2d 710; <em>Muise II, supra, </em>371 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 32, 851 A.2d 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">The class action is \u201c \u2018an exception to the usual rule that litigation is conducted by and on behalf of the individual named parties only,\u201d\u2019 <em>Iliadis, supra, </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>at 103, 922 A.2d 710 (quoting <em>Calif ano v.

Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>387 <em>N.J.Super. </em>405, 415, 904 A.2d 736 (App.Div.2006), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, Iliadis, supra, </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>88, 922 A.2d 710 by \u201cequaliz[ing] ... the ability of the parties to prepare and pay for the advocacy of their rights.\u201d <em>In re Cadillac V8-6-1 Class Action, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>412, 435, 461 A.2d 736 (1983); <em>see also Iliadis, supra, </em>191 <em>N.J. at </em>104-05, 922 A.2d 710 (discussing equalizing function of class action). Thus, despite the complexity of management a class action poses for a trial court, \u201coverarching prineiple[s] of equity\u201d dictate that <em>Rule </em>4:32-1 be liberally construed, especially in consumer fraud actions brought to redress common grievances, under circumstances that would make individual actions uneconomical to pursue. <em>Varacallo, supra, </em>332 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 45, 752 A.2d 807; <em>see also Iliadis, supra, </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>at 103, 922 A.2d 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Given these policy considerations, class certification should be granted absent a clear showing that it is inappropriate or improper. <em>Iliadis, supra, </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>at 103, 922 A.2d 710. A trial court deciding a motion for class certification affords the plaintiffs every favorable view of their complaint and the record. <em>Int\u2019l Union of Operating Eng\u2019rs Local </em># <em>68 Welfare Fund v.

Still, the court should undertake a \u201crigorous analysis\u201d to determine if the requirements of the rule have been met, and must understand the claims, defenses, relevant facts and applicable substantive law necessary to make a meaningful determination. <em>Iliadis, supra, </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>at 106, 922 A.2d 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Class certification decisions rest in the sound discretion of the trial court and an appellate court reviews for abuse of discretion. <em>Muise II, supra, </em>371 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 29, 31, 851 A.2d 799. The judge\u2019s legal decisions relevant to class certification, however, including his or her choice of what law governs the class, are reviewed de novo. <em>Inti Union, supra, </em>384 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 284, 894 A.2d 1136.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">Here, defendants challenge the court\u2019s class certification, arguing that common questions of law and fact do not predominate. <em>See R. </em>4:32\u20141(b)(3). The \u201cpredominance\u201d requirement is analytically distinct from, and more demanding than, the commonality requirement of <em>Rule </em>4:32-l(a)(2). <em>Iliadis, supra, </em>387 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 416-17, 904 A.2d 736. To meet the predominance requirement, it is not necessary that all issues be identical among class members; the issues common to the class must simply outweigh those that are not. <em>Saldana v. City of Camden, </em>252 <em>N.J.Super. </em>188, 197, 599 A.2d 582 (App.Div.1991); <em>Debra F. Fink, D.M.D., MS, P.C., v. Ricoh Corp., </em>365 <em>N.J.Super. </em>520, 568, 839 A.2d 942 (Law Div.2003) (it is not the number of common issues, but rather their significance, that \u201csways the pendulum\u201d). Predominance may be found where there is a common nucleus of operative fact, or where the potential class seeks to remedy a common legal grievance. <em>Delgozzo v. Kenny, </em>266 <em>N.J.Super. </em>169, 189, 628 A.2d 1080 (App.Div.1993); <em>Saldana, supra, </em>252 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 197, 599 A.2d 582.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">A consumer fraud class may be certified even where individual questions, such as the degree of damages due a particu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>lar class member or reliance by individual class members on a defendant\u2019s alleged misrepresentations, remain following resolution of the common issues. <em>Delgozzo, supra, </em>266 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 181, 628 A.2d 1080. Nor does the possibility of conflict of laws issues foreclose the certification of a multi-state class; both state and federal courts frequently certify multi-state classes in causes of action based on state law. <em>Id. </em>at 190, 628 A.2d 1080.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Plaintiffs argue that members of the class were injured by defendants\u2019 fraudulent scheme either because they paid too much for the art, or because they were unable to purchase art as a result of defendants\u2019 fraudulent practices. In their brief in support of their motion in the Law Division seeking class certification, plaintiffs characterized the scheme as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-7\">Two related fraudulent practices are engaged in by the auctioneers as a result of the training they receive directly from Park West. The first practice involves the intentional misuse of the \u201creserve\u201d and the wrongful placement of bids on behalf of the house. The second involves the use of \u201cfictitious\u201d house numbers designed to mislead auction participants into believing that there is competitive bidding on artwork offered for sale.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">Defendants respond that even if plaintiffs could establish a common scheme or general policy to defraud, they cannot prove that the same procedures were utilized in every auction; whether, and to what degree, the alleged practices were used will have to be determined separately for each transaction. Thus, they claim that common issues of fact cannot predominate.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">The record before the motion judge included the deposition testimony of auctioneers who testified that, contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 allegations, they did not use phantom bidders when placing house bids. In fact, some plaintiffs have admitted they did not personally observe auctioneers using phantom bidders. The record shows that in many auctions, the auctioneer did not place a house bid at all and that many auctioneers would not use the technique if a bid had already been placed by an audience member or if the art was unique. Put simply, the record shows that the procedure followed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>by auctioneers at each auction varied. A jury may be required to evaluate the circumstances under which each auction was conducted and make individual factual determinations as to each plaintiff. Regardless of the existence of a general fraudulent scheme, whether each particular class member has a claim may be dependent upon the conduct of the particular auction in which the class member participated.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">In light of these facts, defendants make a reasonable argument that individual factual issues predominate over common issues so as to preclude the certification of a class. Those plaintiffs who simply bid on art, but did not make a purchase were neither deprived of the full value of a product they purchased for full price, here, the artwork, nor were they induced by misrepresentation into paying more than the product was worth. Said differently, those plaintiffs appear to have sustained no out-of-pocket loss. <em>See Thiedemann v. Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>234, 240, 251-52, 872 A.2d 783 (2005). Predominance requires that \u201cthe fact of damage predominate.\u201d <em>See Muise II, supra, </em>371 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 46, 851 A.2d 799. Here, the members of the class who did not purchase art at the auctions may have suffered no loss and, as to them, the \u201cfact\u201d of damages may not predominate.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">As to those persons who did make purchases at the auctions, plaintiffs offer a letter from an expert, who proposes that damages be calculated by determining the difference between the price paid and the value of the art. Yet, because presumably, each piece of art sold by defendants did not have the same value, the expert\u2019s methodology also requires a fact-sensitive, case-by-case analysis. That methodology could also be considered problematic because notably, the essence of an auction is that a bidder does not pay the actual value of the item offered for sale, but instead pays the best price he or she can obtain, which may be more or less than the item\u2019s true value. Thus, by its very nature, the price paid for an item purchased at auction is dependent upon, to some degree, other bids offered for the item. Here, then, an accurate damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>calculation for each item of art purchased could require, in each individual case, an inquiry into the price paid, what other bids were placed for the item, and what the price would have been had defendants not engaged in fraudulent conduct, if, in fact, defendants committed fraudulent practices at that particular auction.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">It is difficult to reconcile these significant factual questions with the requirement of factual predominance that is necessary for a class action. We do not, however, need to address that issue, as we conclude that the litigation requires the application of such divergent governing substantive law, so as to defeat class certification pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:32\u20141(b)(3). <em>See Iliadis, supra, </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>at 118, 922 A.2d 710 (trial court may deny class certification when the \u201clitigation requires the application of divergent or various governing law,\u201d so long as such considerations are \u201cgrounded in concrete evidence of actual or likely management problems, not mere speculation of complications that may arise\u201d (citing, <em>inter alia, In re Warfarin Sodium Antitrust Litig., </em>391 F.3d 516, 529 (3d Cir.2004))). Here, under the circumstances, maritime law applies, which makes maritime choice of law principles applicable to the selection of the applicable substantive law. Applying those principles, we conclude that each putative class member\u2019s claim is governed by the law of his or her home state, rather than by Florida law, as the trial judge concluded, which will present insurmountable difficulties in the management of the class action.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">In multi-state class actions, variations in state law may swamp common issues and defeat predominance. <em>Fink, supra, </em>365 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 568, 839 A.2d 942. Application of one state\u2019s law to all claims is rare in a nationwide class action. <em>Int\u2019l Union, supra, </em>384 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 303-04, 894 A.2d 1136. When considering a nationwide class, a major concern in the predominance determination is which state\u2019s law should apply to each member of the class. <em>Id. </em>at 292, 894 A.2d 1136. The motion court thus has a duty to conduct a choice of law analysis before deciding whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>the predominance element is satisfied. <em>Fink, supra, </em>365 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 568, 839 A.2d 942. Although conflict of laws issues do not <em>per </em>se foreclose certification of a multistate class, a thorough analysis of state laws is particularly important where a possibility exists that common issues could be subsumed by substantive conflicts in state laws. <em>Id. </em>at 569-70, 839 A.2d 942.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Here, the trial judge rejected admiralty jurisdiction, and determined that New Jersey\u2019s choice of law analysis required the application of Florida law. Defendants argue that plaintiffs\u2019 claim is subject to admiralty jurisdiction, which ultimately requires the application of the law of the state of each individual claimant\u2019s residence. We agree with defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">New Jersey courts have concurrent admiralty jurisdiction with the federal courts and apply admiralty law where a two-pronged test is met. <em>Goldson v. Carver Boat Corp., </em>309 <em>N.J.Super. </em>384, 390, 392, 707 A.2d 193 (App.Div.1998) (the \u201csaving to suitors\u201d clause of 28 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1333(1) allows claimants to bring admiralty actions in state court); <em>see also Infl Union of Operating Eng\u2019rs, Local 68 v. Del.

Under the test, admiralty principles apply where: (1) the incident in question occurred in navigable waters; and (2) the alleged wrong bears a significant relationship to \u201ctraditional maritime activity.\u201d <em>Goldson, supra, </em>309 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 390, 707 A.2d 193 (citing <em>Executive Jet Aviation, Inc. v. City of Cleveland, </em>409 <em>U.S. </em>249, 268, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>493, 504, 34 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>454, 467 (1972)). These prongs are referred to as the \u201clocation test,\u201d and the \u201cconnection test,\u201d respectively. <em>Jerome B. Grubart, Inc. v.

While the record is not specific as to the ships\u2019 locations at the times the auctions were conducted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>it is undisputed that the auctions occurred aboard ship, while the ships were cruising or docked in United States waters, foreign territorial waters, or international waters. Regardless of whether the ships were at sea or in port at the time of the auctions, they were in navigable waters. <em>See Sisson v. Ruby, </em>497 <em>U.S. </em>358, 367, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>2892, 2898, 111 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>292, 302 (1990) (\u201cnavigable waters\u201d includes being docked at a marina on a navigable waterway). That the planning of the \u201cfraudulent scheme\u201d and the training of the auctioneers may have occurred on land does not negate the undisputed fact that the auctions themselves, which caused the harm to plaintiffs, all took place aboard ship, in \u201cnavigable waters.\u201d As the United States Supreme Court has observed, in the interest of protecting maritime commerce, \u201cthe shore is now an artificial place to draw a line.\u201d <em>Norfolk S.

So long as the incident in question bears some relation to traditional maritime activity and could, in any way, however remote, impact upon the flow of maritime commerce, admiralty jurisdiction is proper. <em>Calhoun v. Yamaha Motor Corp., </em>216 F.3d 338, 345 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 <em>U.S. </em>1037, 121 <em>S.Ct. </em>627, 148 L.Ed.2d 536 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">In applying the connection test, a court looks not only to the specific incident\u2019s impact on commerce, but to the potential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>impact of incidents of that type. <em>Id. </em>at 345 n. 11. To carry out its primary purpose, the protection of maritime commerce, admiralty jurisdiction must extend beyond actual commercial maritime activity, <em>Foremost Ins. Co. v. Richardson, </em>457 <em>U.S. </em>668, 674-75, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>2654, 2658, 73 L.Ed.2d 300, 306 (1982), even beyond the shore line. <em>Norfolk S. Ry. Co., supra, </em>543 <em>U.S. </em>at 25, 125 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 394, 160 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 295.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Ocean-going passenger vessels are engaged in maritime commerce, and where the conduct giving rise to the suit \u201coccur[s] aboard a cruise ship in navigable waters, [the] cause of action contains the traditional nexus for maritime torts.\u201d <em>Gibbs v. Carnival Cruise Lines, </em>314 F.3d 125, 129, 132 (3d Cir.2002) (where child burned the soles of his feet on a hot ship\u2019s deck, maritime jurisdiction appropriate); <em>Friedman v.

Princess Cruises, Inc., </em>306 F.3d 827, 831-32, 840-41 (9th Cir.2002) (plaintiff sued for intentional infliction of emotional distress after her husband fell overboard and ship\u2019s master told her that her husband had probably been \u201cchopped up\u201d by the propellers and his body would never be recovered); <em>Fedorczyk v. Caribbean Cruise Lines, Ltd., </em>82 <em>F.3d </em>69, 72, 73 (3d Cir.1996) (slip and fall in cruise ship bathtub had nexus to traditional maritime activity).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Maritime commerce may also be affected where the incident giving rise to the suit occurs on land. For instance, both prongs of the \u201cconnection test\u201d were met where a ship\u2019s staff member committed a sexual assault against a passenger, on land, because the treatment of a ship\u2019s passenger has a substantial relationship to commercial maritime activity, and because if passengers are subject to poor treatment, the cruise industry will necessarily suffer. <em>Doe, supra, </em>394 <em>F.</em>3d at 897-98, 900.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">Here, both prongs of the connection test are met. Auctions are commonplace, occur on many cruise ships, and are part and parcel of the cruise ship experience. The \u201ccharacter of the activity\u201d\u2014the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>services and diversions provided for cruise ship passengers while aboard ship\u2014shows a \u201csubstantial relationship\u201d to \u201ctraditional maritime activity.\u201d <em>See Id. </em>at 900. The conduct complained of here has a potentially disruptive impact on maritime commerce\u2014if cruise ship passengers know they are subject to fraudulent conduct while aboard ship, the cruise ship industry will \u201cnecessarily suffer.\u201d <em>See ibid. </em>It is thus irrelevant that defendants may have planned the fraudulent scheme or trained the auctioneers on land. <em>See Norfolk S. Ry. Co., supra, </em>543 <em>U.S. </em>at 25, 125 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 394, 160 L.Ed.2d at 295 (shore an artificial place to draw the fine). Given the primary purpose of admiralty jurisdiction, protecting maritime commerce, <em>Foremost, supra, </em>457 <em>U.S. </em>at 674-75, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2658, 73 L.Ed.2d at 306, admiralty jurisdiction is proper here.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">That said, we next turn to the question of which state\u2019s substantive law should be applied. Where an action sounds in admiralty, the choice of law inquiry is governed by the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lauritzen v. Larsen, </em>345 <em>U.S. </em>571, 73 <em>S.Ct. </em>921, 97 <em>L.Ed. </em>1254 (1953). <em>Calhoun, supra, </em>216 F.3d at 343, 345. The <em>Lauritzen </em>Court identified multiple factors for courts to consider in rendering choice of law decisions, with four of those factors relevant when, such as here, the dispute is solely domestic.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 345-46. The following four factors are relevant to solely domestic admiralty disputes: place of the wrongful act; allegiance or domicile of the injured party; place of contract; and the law of the forum. <em>Ibid. </em>In <em>Hellenic Lines Ltd. v. Rhoditis, </em>398 <em>U.S. </em>306, 309, 90 <em>S.Ct. </em>1731, 1734, 26 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>252, 256 (1970), the Court held that the <em>Lauritzen </em>factors are not exhaustive, and incorporated an eighth factor, the defendant ship owner\u2019s base of operations. According to the <em>Calhoun </em>court, this latter consideration is more relevant to international disputes. <em>See supra, </em>216 F.3d at 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>The <em>Lauritzen </em>rule is intended to balance the interests of various states, <em>Calhoun, supra, </em>216 <em>F.3d </em>at 347; it represents \u201ca move toward analyzing which state has the most significant relationship to the incident and the dominant interest in having its law applied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 346. The <em>Restatement (Second) of Conflicts of Law </em>\u00a7 145 (1971) recognizes <em>Lauritzen </em>as an example of the \u201cmost significant relationship\u201d standard for analyzing conflicts of laws. <em>Id. </em>at 346 n. 14; <em>Scott v. E. Air Lines, Inc., </em>399 F.2d 14, 28 n. 6 (3d Cir.1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>393 <em>U.S. </em>979, 89 <em>S.Ct. </em>446, 21 L.Ed.2d 439 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">New Jersey follows a similar analysis. Even though New Jersey applies the governmental interests test for determining choice of law questions, sections 6 and 145 of the <em>Restatement (Second) of Conflicts of Law </em>also guide New Jersey courts in that analysis. <em>Fu v. Fu, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>108, 119, 733 A.2d 1133 (1999). New Jersey \u201cadheres to the method of analysis\u201d set forth in the <em>Restatement </em>because the \u201cgovernmental-interest\u201d and the \u201cmost-significant-relationship\u201d tests are \u201csubstantially similar.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 144 (Pollock, J., dissenting). Consequently, New Jersey law, as informed by the <em>Restatement, </em>guides our determination of which state\u2019s law applies to the putative class members.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">The <em>Restatement </em>provides that factors relevant to a choice of law decision in the realm of tort law include: the needs of the interstate and international systems; the relevant policies of the forum; the relevant policies of other interested states and the relative interests of those states in the determination of the particular issue; and ease in the determination and application of the law to be applied. <em>Restatement (Second) of Conflicts of Law </em>\u00a7 6(2) (1971) (articulating seven factors to be considered in all choice of law decisions); <em>Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 145(1) comment b (noting that in tort law, three of the factors of section 6(2) are relatively insignificant); <em>see also Fu, supra, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>at 122, 733 A.2d 1133 (identifying the seven factors in section 6 of the Restatement). To address an issue arising out of tort law, the <em>Fu </em>Court grouped the factors of <em>Restatement </em>section 6(2) into five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>categories: (1) interests of interstate comity; (2) interests of the parties; (3) interests underlying the field of tort law; (4) interests of judicial administration; and (5) competing interests of the states. <em>Fu, supra, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>at 122, 733 A.2d 1133 (citing <em>Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 145(1) comment b (also grouping principles of section 6(2) into five categories)).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">In a consumer fraud class action, the first factor, the interests of interstate comity, \u201crequire[s] application of the law of any potential claimant\u2019s state of residence because application of any other state\u2019s law would frustrate the domiciliary state\u2019s legislative policies.\u201d <em>Fink, supra, </em>365 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 585, 839 A.2d 942 (citing <em>Fu, supra, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>at 122-23, 733 A.2d 1133). That is so because the consumer fraud statutes of the many states differ vastly in scope of recovery, burdens of proof, and standing of private plaintiffs. <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, to apply the law of one state would frustrate the public policies of the other states. <em>Id. </em>at 585-86, 839 A.2d 942.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The second category, the \u201cinterests of the parties,\u201d which focuses on expectations of the parties and predictability of result, is irrelevant in tort cases. <em>Id. </em>at 592, 839 A.2d 942; <em>see also Fu, supra, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>at 123, 733 A.2d 1133; <em>Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 145(1) comment b.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">Category three, the \u201cinterests underlying the field of tort law,\u201d requires courts to consider \u201cthe degree to which deterrence and compensation, the fundamental goals of tort law, would be furthered by application of a state\u2019s local law.\u201d <em>Fu, supra, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>at 123, 733 A.2d 1133 (citing <em>Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 145(1) comment c). If the tort rule serves a deterrent purpose, \u201cthe state where the harmful conduct took place will likely have the dominant interest with respect to that rule.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>On the other hand, \u201cwhen the tort rule is designed primarily to compensate a victim for his or her injuries, the state where the injury occurred, which is often where the victim resides, may have the greater interest in the matter.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, it is necessary to evaluate on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>a case-by-case basis the relative weight of those underlying purposes with respect to each specific rule at issue. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The fourth category, the \u201cinterests of judicial administration,\u201d requires a court to consider the relative ease of determination of the choice of law regarding a specific issue; this in turn furthers the values of uniformity and predictability. <em>Fink, supra, </em>365 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 593, 839 A.2d 942. The considerations under this category \u201care of lesser importance and must yield to a strong state interest implicated by the remaining factors.\u201d <em>Fu, supra, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>at 124, 733 A.2d 1133 (citing <em>Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 145(1) comment b (predictability and uniformity of result of lesser import in tort choice of law)).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Of the five groups of interests identified by <em>Fu, supra, </em>the most significant factor in the tort field is the fifth category, \u201cthe competing interests of the states,\u201d which requires an analysis of whether application of a state\u2019s law under the circumstances of the case will advance the policies that the law was intended to promote. <em>Id. </em>at 125, 733 <em>A.2d </em>1133. It is the qualitative nature of a state\u2019s contacts that ultimately determines whether its law should apply. <em>Fu, supra, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>at 125, 733 A.2d 1133.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">Section 145(2) of the <em>Restatement </em>specifies the contacts that are most significant to an analysis of the \u201ccompeting interests of the states.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>They are \u201c(a) the place where the injury occurred, (b) the place where the conduct causing the injury occurred, (c) the domicilie], residence, nationality, place of incorporation and place of business of the parties, and (d) the place where the relationship, if any, between the parties is centered.\u201d <em>Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 145(2); <em>Fu, supra, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>at 125, 733 A.2d 1133 (also listing these factors). These contacts are to be evaluated according to their relative importance with respect to the particular issue. <em>Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 145(2); <em>Fu, supra, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>at 125, 733 A.2d 1133.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">Under the <em>Restatement, </em>in a tort action for fraud or misrepresentation, where a defendant\u2019s misrepresentations and a plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>receipt of and reliance on them took place in the same state, that state\u2019s law will govern unless, based on the principles of section 6, another state has a more significant relationship to the occurrence and the parties. <em>Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 148(1). In that case, the law of the state with the more significant relationship will apply. <em>Ibid. </em>The place of injury is less significant in a fraud action than in a personal injury action. <em>Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 145(2) comment f.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">In the context of the choice of law framework in this case, because this action sounds in admiralty, we begin with the <em>Lauritzen </em>analysis, which, like the <em>Restatement, </em>looks to which state has the most significant relationship to the incident, and the dominant interest in having its law applied. <em>Calhoun, supra, </em>216 F.3d at 346 n. 14; <em>Scott, supra, </em>399 F.2d at 28 n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The <em>Fu </em>Court organized the relevant factors of the <em>Restatement </em>into five categories, only two of which are significant in the realm of tort law\u2014the interests of interstate comity and the competing interests of the states\u2014the first and fifth categories, respectively, <em>see supra, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>at 122, 733 A.2d 1133; in the tort choice of law analysis they \u201cassume greater importance\u201d than the other factors. <em>See Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 145(1) comment b. These two categories both favor application of the law of the plaintiffs\u2019 states of residence. In a consumer fraud class action, like here, the interests of interstate comity \u201cclearly require application of the law of any potential claimants\u2019 state of residence because application of any other state\u2019s law would frustrate the domiciliary state\u2019s legislative policies.\u201d <em>Fink, supra, </em>365 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 585, 839 A.2d 942. The competing interests of the states, the most significant consideration in tort choice of law, is analyzed by looking to the four factors articulated in section 145(2) of the <em>Restatement. Fu, supra, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>at 125, 733 A.2d 1133 (\u201cthe place where the injury occurred; the place where the conduct causing the injury occurred; the domicile, residence, nationality, place of incorporation and place of business of the parties; and the place where the relationship, if any, between the parties is centered\u201d). Those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>factors applied here counsel in favor of application of the law of each individual plaintiffs home state.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\"><em>Calhoun, supra, </em>is also instructive in this analysis. Applying <em>Lauritzen, </em>the court focused on the place of the injury; whether the place of injury was \u201cfortuitous\u201d; and upon the domicile of the injured parties. <em>See </em>216 F.3d at 346\u201447; <em>see also Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 145(2)(a), (b) (focusing on place of injury and place where conduct causing injury occurred); <em>Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 148(1) (where misrepresentations, their receipt, and reliance on them occurred in same place, law of that place should apply, absent another jurisdiction having a more significant relationship); <em>Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 145(2) comment e (where place of injury fortuitous, it does not play important role in selection of applicable law).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Thus, here, looking first to the location of the injury, we conclude that the fraudulent practices and ensuing losses occurred at auctions aboard ships on navigable waters. The ships departed from ports in various states and foreign countries. While the record is not specific as to the ships\u2019 locations at the times the auctions were conducted, the auctions occurred aboard the ships, while they were cruising or docked in United States waters, foreign territorial waters, or international waters. Defendants could have held an on-ship auction at any point during a particular cruise. That an auction may have occurred, hypothetically, while the ship was docked in Puerto Rico, as opposed to cruising in international waters or the waters of a state or foreign country, would appear to be no more than mere chance. Where the harm occurred, therefore, the site of the auction itself, was simply fortuitous.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See Calhoun, supra, </em>216 <em>F.</em>3d at 346-17. Put another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>way, here, because mere chance dictated the situs of the injuries, the injuries\u2019 connection with their place of occurrence is tenuous at best, and no particular jurisdiction has an especially strong interest in having its law applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">We turn next to the place where the relationship is centered. <em>Fu, supra, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>at 125, 733 A.2d 1133; <em>Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 145(2)(d). While some putative plaintiffs undoubtedly boarded cruise ships in Florida where Park West at Sea is headquartered, it is likely that some did not, and even those who did board in Florida did not form a relationship with defendants until attending an on-board auction. The jurisdictions where the relationships between the parties were formed are the same jurisdictions where the auctions occurred; and, as discussed, none have a significant interest in having their law applied. Thus, the locations where the injuries or the conduct causing the injuries occurred, and where the parties\u2019 relationships are centered demonstrate only tenuous connections to this lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">That takes us to a consideration of the remaining factor of <em>Restatement </em>section 145(2) mentioned in <em>Fu, </em>\u201cthe domicile, residence, nationality, place of incorporation and place of business of the parties.\u201d <em>Supra, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>at 125, 733 A.2d 1133. This factor is the most compelling under the circumstances of this case. We conclude that it is the home states of the individual plaintiffs that have \u201ca more significant relationship with the occurrence and the parties as to the particular issue involved.\u201d <em>Scott, supra, </em>399 F.2d at 28. A significant factor in this lawsuit is compensation of the victims. The plaintiffs\u2019 home states have a \u201csubstantial interest in obtaining compensation for [their] citizens in order to remedy wrongs that have been committed against\u201d them. <em>Calhoun, supra, </em>216 A.3d at 347; <em>cf. Int\u2019l Union, supra, </em>384 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 298, 894 A.2d 1136 (\u201cAll consumer fraud laws ... are designed to protect consumers to some degree.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>When the interest affected in a tort action is a personal one, domicile is of greater importance than when the interest is a business or financial one. <em>Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 145 comment e. Plaintiffs here allege a purely economic injury, but in a personal, not a business, capacity. If a plaintiff is a natural person, where the loss is pecuniary in nature, the plaintiffs place of residence is a contact of substantial significance. <em>Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 148(2) comment i. This is so because a financial loss will usually be of greatest concern to the state with which the person suffering the loss has the closest relationship. <em>Ibid. </em>The place of business or residence of the plaintiff is more important than are similar contacts on the part of the defendant. <em>Ibid. </em>Therefore, in a consumer fraud class action, a putative class member\u2019s residence is a contact greater in significance than a defendant\u2019s principle place of business. <em>Fink, supra, </em>365 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 592, 839 A.2d 942. Accordingly, applying admiralty principles as informed by the <em>Restatement </em>and New Jersey decisional law, it is the place of residence of each individual plaintiff that will dictate which state\u2019s law applies in each individual case.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Alternatively, if, exclusive of the application of admiralty principles, we apply New Jersey\u2019s choice of law principles because New Jersey is the forum state, we arrive at the same conclusion; we apply the law of the domicile of each respective class member. In deciding choice of law issues, New Jersey applies the \u201cgovernmental-interest\u201d test, which seeks to apply the law of the state with the greatest interest in governing the specific issues in the underlying litigation, <em>Fu, supra, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>at 118, 733 A.2d 1133, and which is \u201csubstantially similar to the <em>[Restatement\u2019s </em>] most-significant-relationship test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 144, 733 A.2d 1133 (Pollock, J., dissenting); <em>see also Rowe v. Hoffman-La Roche, Inc., </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>615, 621, 917 A.2d 767 (2007) (when suit filed in New Jersey, we \u201csubscribe to the ... governmental-interests analysis\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">The first prong of the test requires a determination, on an issue-by-issue basis, that an actual conflict exists between the laws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>the parties seek to apply. <em>Fu, supra, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>at 118, 733 A.2d 1133. If a conflict exists, the second prong requires the court to determine which state has the most significant relationship to the occurrence and the parties with respect to the issue to be decided. <em>Id. </em>at 119, 733 A.2d 1133; <em>see also Rowe, supra, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>at 621-22, 917 A.2d 767. The factors set forth in sections 6 and 145 of the <em>Restatement </em>guide this evaluation. <em>Fu, supra, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>at 119, 733 A.2d 1133.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Here, in analyzing the first prong of New Jersey\u2019s choice of law framework, we conclude that numerous actual conflicts exist between provisions of the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act and the consumer protection statutes of other states. <em>Fink, supra, </em>365 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 570-84, 839 A.2d 942 (conducting detailed analysis of differences between New Jersey\u2019s consumer fraud statute and those of other states); <em>see also In re Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., </em>288 F.3d 1012, 1018 (7th Cir.2002) (\u201c[s]tate consumer protection laws vary considerably\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 <em>U.S. </em>1105, 123 <em>S.Ct. </em>870, 154 L.Ed.2d 774 (2003); <em>Int\u2019l Union, supra, </em>384 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 293-94, 894 A.2d 1136 (same). The differences between the consumer fraud statutes of the various states are significant. New Jersey allows private class actions for consumer fraud while several other states do not; some states require proof of scienter, New Jersey does not; variations exist in the area of damages, especially the decision or ability of a court to award punitive or treble damages. <em>Int\u2019l Union, supra, </em>384 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 294, 894 A.2d 1136.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Consequently, because an actual conflict exists among the various state consumer protection statutes, we look to the second prong of New Jersey\u2019s conflict of laws analysis, which applies the principles articulated in the <em>Restatement; </em>this analysis is substantially the same as the choice of law analysis applied under admiralty law. <em>See Calhoun, supra, </em>216 F.3d at 346 n. 14; <em>Fu, supra, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>at 119, 733 A.2d 1133. Each is guided by the <em>Restatement </em>and requires that each punitive class member\u2019s claim be governed by the law of his or her state of residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>The question remains though, whether, under this analysis, the application of the laws of what may be all fifty states defeats predominance. While the existence of state law variations does not ipso facto defeat certification of a multi-state class, the onus is on the plaintiff to provide an extensive analysis of the state law variations so that the court can determine whether insurmountable obstacles to certification exist. <em>Fink, supra, </em>365 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 569, 594, 839 A.2d 942. That is because \u201c[i]f more than a few of the laws of the fifty states differ, the [trial] judge [may] face an impossible task [in] instructing a jury on the relevant law ... [this would provide a] reason why class certification would not be the appropriate course of action.\u201d <em>In re Am. Med. Sys., Inc., </em>75 F.3d 1069, 1085 (6th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Where the plaintiffs do not illustrate how the variations among potentially applicable state laws can be fairly and efficiently adjudicated, class certification is improper. <em>In re Ford Motor Co. Ignition Switch Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>174 <em>F.R.D. </em>332, 350 (D.N.J.1997). In <em>In re Ford, </em>the defendants detailed the variations among the states\u2019 laws on the various issues and causes of action listed for trial. <em>Id. </em>at 350-51. The court agreed with the defendants that class <em>certification </em>had not been established, concluding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-7\">Viewing these variations in the context of a case involving five state-law causes of action, the laws of fifty states, and over twenty-three million plaintiffs ... this suit cannot be practically and efficiently tried as a class action because plaintiffs have not established a predominance of common legal issues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 351.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">Here, plaintiffs did not submit a plan for the adjudication, at trial, of claims based on the laws of potentially all fifty states. Though there is only one cause of action, consumer fraud, and the plaintiffs are not so numerous as they were in <em>In re Ford, </em>class certification is not warranted for the same reasons it was not warranted in that case. The consumer fraud statutes of the fifty states vary greatly from one another, and, as noted, the differences are significant; indeed, some states do not allow private causes of action under their statutes. <em>Fink, supra, </em>365 <em>N.J.Super. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>at 570-84, 839 A.2d 942. Plaintiffs estimate that 90,000 individuals bid on art on Carnival Cruise Lines alone, and defendants note that they conducted auctions on six additional cruise lines. A class of plaintiffs comprised of these passengers would likely involve residents of all fifty states. Given the numerous differences among the various state consumer protection laws and the absence of a plan for their presentation at trial, in light of the expansiveness of the class, the manageability obstacles cannot be overcome and predominance of common issues of law has not been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">In sum, we conclude that the difficulties likely to be encountered in the management of a class action as a result of the application of the governing law of each state of residence of the putative plaintiffs precludes certification of the class, and consequently, the trial court\u2019s order certifying the class represents an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b134-12\"> While the court's order certifying the class did not confine the class solely to residents of the United States, the parties concede that this was a clerical error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b137-15\"> The parties agree that the reference in the order to the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act was an error; the court\u2019s oral and written decisions certify the class pursuant to Florida\u2019s consumer fraud statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b146-5\"> The dispute here is solely domestic because all members of the class are United States residents and defendants are both incorporated and maintain their principal places of business in the United States.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b151-8\"> As noted, plaintiffs claim the conduct causing the injury occurred on land, in the corporate offices of defendants where they formed their fraudulent scheme. We disagree. The conduct causing the injury was the auctions, which occurred aboard ship, in navigable waters. Nevertheless, to the extent that the scheme originated on land, it would still be sufficiently connected to maritime activity as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>to implicate maritime jurisdiction.
