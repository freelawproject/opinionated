Four years later, his parole officer imposed a curfew, which required Jamgochian\u2019s confinement to his residence every day from 8:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m., for an indefinite period of time. We agree with Jamgochian\u2019s contention that <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-6.11(Z) provides an inadequate procedural framework upon which to rest this limitation on his liberty interests and deprived him of a meaningful opportunity to be heard. We remand for further proceedings consistent with due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">In 1979, Jamgochian was convicted of kidnapping and various sex offenses, and sentenced to a twelve-year term of imprisonment. Neither the 1979 judgment of conviction nor any other information regarding this conviction can be found in the record except for a brief recitation of some of the alleged details, which is contained in a November 1998 confidential report prepared by the Adult Diagnostic and Treatment Center. It is not clear whether or to what extent these 1979 convictions and the underlying circumstances were considered in the proceedings relevant to the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">In 1998, defendant was convicted of committing a second-degree sexual assault on S.S. According to a pre-sentence report con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>tained in the record,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Jamgochian initially approached S.S., stating that his uncle had seen her photographs and wanted to know if she would be interested in modeling for him. After speaking with S.S. on a few occasions, Jamgochian arranged for her to travel to New Jersey from California for a test shoot. In February 1997, S.S. arrived in New Jersey and posed for Jamgochian.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Following S.S.\u2019s return to California, Jamgochian inquired about her interest in posing for the cover of a romance novel. After she indicated her willingness, Jamgochian arranged to have S.S. return to New Jersey on June 7,1997. Upon arriving at Jamgochian\u2019s studio, S.S. was presented with a contract, which referred to a \u201cmusic video,\u201d and contained phrases such as \u201cexposed in a sexual manner,\u201d \u201cexploit,\u201d and \u201cInternet,\u201d causing S.S. to balk and begin asking questions. Because Jamgochian assuaged all her concerns, and also offered to revise the contract, S.S. later indicated that she felt \u201cstupid and uncomfortable\u201d for hesitating, and signed the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Jamgochian photographed S.S. wearing a bra and panty leopard suit. He then said he was going to photograph her wearing \u201crestraints.\u201d He chained her wrists and ankles together, and then fastened her arms and legs to the bed. S.S. later reported that she was in fear and felt completely helpless. Jamgochian left the <em>room </em>but returned with a document, which indicated what he wanted S.S. to do. He also told S.S. that she had two options. The first was that he would go and contact two other men he had waiting nearby and she would have to have sex with them, which he would videotape, or she would have to do anything he wanted while he videotaped it. She acceded to the latter demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">Jamgochian then released S.S. from all restraints except the handcuffs. He retrieved a twenty-two page script, and told S.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>that they were going to \u201cact out\u201d the scenes, which he would videotape. When S.S. began to cry, Jamgochian told her that if she did not stop, he would call the two other men. She agreed to cooperate and gave in to Jamgochian\u2019s demands for her to perform various sex acts, which did not terminate until S.S. began acting as if she was hyperventilating. She was then permitted to dress and they went for a ride. When they returned to Jamgochian\u2019s studio, S.S. ran from his vehicle and into a nearby convenience store, shouting for help.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">On September 2, 1997, Jamgochian was indicted and charged with second-degree sexual assault, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2(c)(l), third-degree criminal restraint, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:13-2(b), third-degree criminal coercion, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:13\u20145(a)(1), and third-degree terroristic threats, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-3(a). On April 22,1998, he was charged in another indictment with third-degree unlawful possession of a weapon, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-5(c)(l), and second-degree being a person not permitted to possess weapons, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:39-7. On July 27, 1998, Jamgochian pled guilty to the second-degree sexual assault count in the first indictment and the second-degree being a person not permitted to possess weapons count in the second indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">On February 5, 1999, the trial judge imposed a four-year term of imprisonment on the second-degree sexual assault conviction, and directed that Jamgochian comply with all requirements of Megan\u2019s Law, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:7-2. The judge also imposed a special sentence of parole supervision for life, <em>N.J.S.A </em>20:43-6.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">Jamgochian was released from incarceration on October 4, 2001. At that time, by operation of law, he began serving the community supervision for life term. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6.4(b); <em>State v. Williams, </em>342 <em>N.J.Super. </em>83, 92, 775 A.2d 727 (App.Div.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">A sentence of community supervision for life means that the offender \u201cshall remain in the legal custody of the Commissioner of Corrections, shall be supervised by the Division of Parole of the State Parole Board, shall be subject to the provisions and condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>tions set forth in <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-123.51(b); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-123.59 through 30:4-123.63; and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-123.65], and shall be subject to conditions appropriate to protect the public and foster rehabilitation.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6.4(b). We have held that, as a general matter, the Legislature did not violate the separation of powers doctrine by delegating to the Parole Board the authority to promulgate conditions and other procedures applicable to persons placed on community supervision for life. <em>State v. Bond, </em>365 <em>N.J.Super. </em>430, 442, 839 A.2d 888 (App.Div.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Upon his release from prison, Jamgoehian executed a document containing the general conditions applicable to the community supervision for life term. This document included Jamgochian\u2019s acknowledgement that he would \u201ccomply with any curfew established by the assigned parole officer.\u201d When released, however, Jamgoehian was not subjected to a curfew of any sort. Instead, on April 15, 2005\u2014nearly four years after his release from incarceration\u2014he was advised by his parole officer that because of some contact or communication Jamgoehian had with a young woman (hereinafter \u201cJane Doe\u201d) he was to \u201ccomply with a curfew and be at [his] approved residence between the hours of 8:00 pm and 7:00 am daily.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">The parole officer\u2019s April 15, 2005 letter presented the following justification for his imposition of this curfew:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-8\">Jamgoehian contacted [Jane Doe] after obtaining her personal information from an unknown source and attempted to arrange a meeting to discuss employment. As described by Jamgoehian, this employment would be for a short time period and pay an inordinately large sum of money. Jamgoehian has a history of sexual offenses involving victimization of women he lured by offering them modeling work. The current behavior of Jamgoehian towards [Jane Doe] fits his identified offense eyele/modus operandi. This Special Condition will curtail Jamgoehian\u2019s ability to commit further acts of victimization.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>In response, Jamgochian\u2019s attorney wrote to the Chairman of the Parole Board on April 27, 2005, complaining of the imposition of the special conditions. Relying upon a certification executed by his client, the attorney claimed that the factual reasons given for the parole officer\u2019s imposition of the special conditions were erroneous, and, also, that the special conditions had been championed by a parole officer who had \u201cacted unprofessionally, and perhaps even unethically, in his investigation and pursuit\u201d of Jamgochian. He requested that the conditions be vacated and, failing that, the entry of a stay of the special conditions pending an appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">On May 5, 2005, the Chairman wrote to Jamgochian\u2019s attorney advising that, on May 4, 2005, \u201cthe Adult Panel reviewed the cited special conditions, chronological supervision reports and attendant police investigation reports from the Hanover and Rockaway Township Police Departments\u201d and that, \u201c[b]ased upon such review,\u201d the panel had affirmed the imposition of all the special conditions. The Chairman further indicated that the Adult Panel found that Jamgochian\u2019s \u201cadherence to the special conditions will reduce the likelihood of recurrence of criminal behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">The factual basis for the imposition of all three special conditions was expressed by the Chairman in the following way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATQ\">On 4/15/05, [Jane Doe] reported to the Hanover PD that Mr. Jamgochian contacted her by cell phone and in person; that he engaged her in conversations that made her feel uncomfortable; that he offered to engage her in employment for unknown services; and that based upon the nature and circumstances of Mr. Jamgoehian\u2019s current and past offenses wherein Mr. Jamgochian also engaged young females to his employ resulting in him sexually assaulting the victims, [a special condition of no contact with Jane Doe] will lessen the likelihood of his return to criminal activity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-7\">In 1980 and 1999, Mr. Jamgochian was convicted of crimes involving the luring of females for the purpose of engaging in deviant sexual conduct. The Adult Panel notes that the recent incident involving [Jane Doe] is alarmingly similar to the precursors employed by Mr. Jamgochian prior to engaging in his past criminal conduct. Accordingly, participation in sex-offender specific mental health counseling will assist Mr. Jamgochian in exploring any underlying issues as they relate to his poor judgment, lack of insight and apparent inability to desist from the repetitive behavior that he has engaged in that led to his two prior convictions, as well as, the present situation with [Jane Doe]____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>Based upon Mr. Jamgochian\u2019s recent conduct involving [Jane Doe,] compliance with the above-noted curfew will allow the Division of Parole to better monitor his whereabouts and activities and, thus, will seek to lessen the likelihood of Mr. Jamgochian\u2019s return to criminal activity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">The Chairman also instructed the Division of Parole to \u201cre-draft\u201d the special conditions utilizing the justification for those conditions quoted above. He lastly indicated that Jamgochian\u2019s allegations of his parole officer\u2019s misconduct had been forwarded to the Director of the Division of Parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">On May 23, 2005, the special condition that required Jamgochian to comply with a curfew was amended, pursuant to the Chairman\u2019s directions, by eliminating the factual basis contained in the April 15, 2005 notice, and replacing it only with the following conclusory statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-8\">Based upon your recent conduct involving [Jane Doe,] compliance with the above noted curfew will allow the Division of Parole to better monitor your whereabouts and activities and thus, will seek to lessen the likelihood of your return to criminal activity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">Gone were the prior findings that Jamgochian had contacted Jane Doe, and that he arranged to meet with her to discuss employment \u201cfor a short time period and pay an inordinately large sum of money,\u201d and gone was the Adult Panel\u2019s conclusion that this alleged conduct \u201cfits [Jamgochian\u2019s] identified offense cycle/modus operandi.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">Following this revision in the special conditions, Jamgochian\u2019s attorney requested copies of the reports and information reviewed and relied upon by the Adult Panel. The Parole Board provided copies of: the handwritten notes of Jamgochian\u2019s parole supervisor; a police report regarding the information provided by Jane Doe; and other police reports memorializing attempts to determine whether the person Jane Doe referred to as \u201cRon\u201d was Jamgochian. Also provided was a memorandum, dated April 18, 2005, written by an assistant district supervisor, which summarized: the police reports; his discussions with a police detective regarding Jane Doe; his instruction to the parole officer to advise Jamgochian that he both have no further contact with Jane Doe or her place of employment and that he thereafter comply with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>curfew; and Ms direction that the parole officer search JamgocMan\u2019s home. If the Adult Panel relied on anytMng else, it was not revealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">On November 4, 2005, JamgocMan\u2019s attorney wrote to the Chairman, claiming that the imposition of the curfew was unlawful and inappropriate. He provided a certification executed by JamgocMan, and requested that the letter be considered as JamgoeMan\u2019s appeal to the full Parole Board. In asserting that the procedures utilized in imposing the curfew were insufficient, Jamgochian argued in tMs letter that there had not been \u201cthe slightest nod to due process\u201d and that the special conditions</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-5\">were imposed without any hearing, without Mr. Jamgochian being given the right: to view the evidence against him, without giving him any discovery, and without giving him the right to confront witnesses against him. It was based upon reports and writings that were not sworn to and were full of hearsay and vague accusations. There was no competent legal evidence introduced to support those accusations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Invoking, among other things, the constitutional rights guaranteed by the federal constitution, <em>U.S. Const, </em>amend. VI and XIV, and our state constitution, <em>N.J. Const </em>art. I, \u00b6 s 1 and 10, JamgoeMan requested a hearing at wMch he would be permitted the right \u201cto cross examine any witnesses, have an attorney present, obtain discovery, receive copies of all materials submitted to the board, and subpoena witnesses in order to confront Ms accusers and mount a defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">On February 24, 2006, the CMef of the Parole Board\u2019s Appeals UMt wrote to JamgocMan\u2019s attorney to advise that the full Parole Board had considered the issues raised in his appeal. He stated that the Board \u201cnoted that the Adult Panel was not required by <em>[N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-6.11(Z) ] to conduct a hearing or provide your client with documentation prior to affirming the imposition of the special conditions for community supervision for life.\u201d According to this letter, the Parole Board also rejected Jamgochian\u2019s contention that there was an insufficient factual basis for the imposition of a curfew, indicating that the Board had considered the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>report, which incorporated Jane Doe\u2019s assertion that Jamgochian made telephone calls to her that made her \u201cfeel uncomfortable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Jamgochian filed a notice of appeal, seeking our review of this final agency decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">While this appeal was pending, the Board placed the curfew in abeyance. The Board has since moved for dismissal, claiming that the appeal is now moot. We turn first to the question of mootness.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">Jamgochian has argued that his appeal has not been rendered moot because the Board recently placed the curfew in \u201cabeyance.\u201d He argues that this recent action regarding the curfew contains no guarantee that the Board will not lift that restraint and again require Jamgochian\u2019s adherence to the curfew at some future time. He argues that the Board\u2019s power to unilaterally turn on and off the application of the curfew should not be permitted to control or preclude this court\u2019s review of the proceedings that led to the imposition of the curfew and the sufficiency of the regulations that formed the basis for the Board\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">We agree that this appeal raises issues of substantial importance that are likely to recur but evade review, <em>Coyle v. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>260, 263, 787 A.2d 881 (2002); <em>Zirger v. General Acc. Ins. Co., </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>327, 330, 676 A.2d 1065 (1996), and that we should therefore consider the merits of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b557-12\">Jamgochian argues that the principles of due process required greater protections than were permitted here. In concluding that the procedures utilized in imposing the curfew were flawed: (a) we reject Jamgochian\u2019s argument that the Parole Board has no authority to impose a curfew; (b) but we agree with Jamgochian <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>that, notwithstanding the Board\u2019s power to impose a curfew, it could not validly exercise that authority without providing greater procedural safeguards and, thus, deprived him of due process of law; (c) alternatively, we conclude that the doctrine of fundamental fairness requires more extensive procedures than permitted here; and (d) we find that the absence of any procedural framework whereby Jamgochian could seek review, in the future, of the continued need for this curfew also violated his due process and fundamental fairness rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">As we have recognized, in enacting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6.4(b), the Legislature provided that persons serving a special sentence of community supervision for life, although \u201cnot actually on parole,\u201d shall be supervised \u201cas if on parole.\u201d <em>State v. Williams, supra, </em>342 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 92, 775 A.2d 727. <em>See also Sanchez v. N.J. State Parole Bd., </em>368 <em>N.J.Super. </em>181, 187, 845 A.2d 687 (App.Div.2004), <em>app. dis., </em>187 <em>N.J. </em>487, 901 A.2d 951 (2006); <em>State v. Bond, supra, </em>365 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 443, 839 A.2d 888. In fulfilling this obligation, the Parole Board\u2019s polestar is the statute itself, which declares that a person serving a special sentence of community supervision for life shall be subject \u201cto conditions appropriate to protect the public and foster rehabilitation.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6.4(b). It requires no further proof to conclude that the compelling interests so succinctly stated in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6.4(b) fully empower the Parole Board to impose a curfew upon an individual who has engaged in conduct that threatens the public or does not foster rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">We, thus, reject the argument that the Parole Board, in fulfilling its duty to supervise such individuals, is prohibited from imposing a curfew tailored to vindicate those interests. So long as a curfew is not invoked arbitrarily, and so long as the curfew bears a reasonable relationship to the rehabilitation of the individual, the protection of society or the prevention of recidivistic behavior, <em>Pazden v. N.J. State Parole Bd., </em>374 <em>N.J.Super. </em>356, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>366-67, 864 A.2d 1136 (App.Div.2005); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-123.59(b), we will defer to the Board\u2019s exercise of sound discretion in imposing such a condition, <em>Trantino v. N.J. State Parole Bd., </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>19, 25, 711 A.2d 260 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">Jamgochian more persuasively argues that the Board was without the authority to impose a curfew of such scope and duration absent the granting of greater procedural safeguards than presently exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">Upon the imposition of a term of community supervision for life, the individual is automatically required to comply with twenty \u201cgeneral\u201d conditions, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-6.11(b), one of which requires that the offender \u201c[c]omply with any curfew established by the assigned parole officer.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-6.11(b)(17). Since no curfew was imposed at the time Jamgochian began serving his term of community supervision for life, any later imposition of a curfew required compliance with the procedures applicable to special conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\"><em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-6.11(Z) contains the procedure promulgated by the Parole Board for the imposition of special conditions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-10\">Additional special conditions may be imposed by the District Parole Supervisor, an Assistant District Parole Supervisor or the designated representative of the District Parole Supervisor when it [sic] is [of] the opinion that such conditions would reduce the likelihood of recurrence of criminal behavior. The offender and the Board shall be given written notice upon the imposition of such conditions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-11\">1. Upon notice being received by the Board, the appropriate Board panel shall review the offender\u2019s ease and determine whether to vacate, modify or affirm the additional special condition(s).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-12\">2. The Board panel shall notify the District Parole Supervisor of its determination within three working days of receipt of notice of the imposition of the additional special condition(s).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-13\">3. The District Parole Supervisor shall notify the offender in writing of the determination of the Board panel and shall cause a written record of such notice to be made in the offender\u2019s ease file.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-14\">4. A special condition shall not be deemed effective until affirmed by the appropriate Board panel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Jamgochian does not claim that the administrative proceedings failed to conform with <em>N.J.AC. </em>10A:71-6.11(Z). Instead, he claims that those procedures are inadequate and fail to conform with the principles of procedural due process guaranteed by the federal and state constitutions. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">As can be readily seen, <em>N.J.AC. </em>10A:71-6.11(Z) outlines a process that operates without the input or involvement of the affected individual. The individual is entitled to <em>notice </em>\u201cupon imposition of the condition\u201d and <em>notice </em>of the Adult Panel\u2019s determination in its review of the propriety of the condition. But the regulation does not permit the individual to participate and does not provide any other rights normally associated with the principles of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">For example, this regulation does not allow an individual serving a term of community supervision for life: to be heard, either with or without counsel, prior to the rendering of a decision by the Adult Panel; to view the evidence prior to the rendering of the Adult Panel\u2019s decision; to confront or call witnesses; or to offer relevant evidence. In addition, the regulation contains no standards or limitations regarding the type of information that the Adult Panel or the Parole Board may consider in imposing a special condition. As a result, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-6.11(Z) permits the imposition of a special condition upon the consideration of the rankest of hearsay, and by way of a process that excludes the input or participation of the individual affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">The Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution provides that no state shall \u201cdeprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d <em>U.S. Const. </em>amend. XIV, \u00a7 1. In broader language, our state constitution declares that \u201c[a]ll persons are by nature free and independent, and have certain natural and unalienable rights, among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty, of acquiring, possessing, and protecting property, and of pursuing and obtaining safety and happiness.\u201d <em>N.J. Const, </em>art. I, K1. Although this provision of our state constitution does not actually include the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>phrase \u201cdue process,\u201d it is well understood that, like the Fourteenth Amendment, it \u201cprotects against injustice and, to that extent, protects \u2018values like those encompassed by the principle[ ] of due process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Doe v. Poritz, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>1, 99, 662 A.2d 367 (1995) (quoting <em>Greenberg v. Kimmelman, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>552, 568, 494 A.2d 294 (1985)). In considering the application of these principles, we are required to determine whether a curfew infringes a liberty interest and, if so, whether the existing procedural framework fairly and adequately safeguards that liberty interest from arbitrary or unreasonable governmental restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">As to the first aspect, the Parole Board does not argue, and it cannot be seriously alleged, that a prohibition from being anywhere except within the confines of one\u2019s home, every day, for eleven consecutive hours, does not impact the liberty interests secured by the federal and state constitutional guarantees of due process of law. Instead, the troubling issue presented by this appeal is whether the existing procedures adequately safeguard such a liberty interest from arbitrary governmental infringement. In considering this contention in the present context, we are satisfied that greater procedural protection was due than currently provided by <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-6.11 <em>(l).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Due process is a flexible concept. <em>Zinermon v. Burch, </em>494 <em>U.S. </em>113, 127, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>975, 984, 108 L.Ed.2d 100, 114-15 (1990); <em>Doe v. Poritz, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 106, 662 A.2d 367. As Justice Frankfurter said, \u201c \u2018Due process\u2019 is, perhaps, the least frozen concept of our law\u2014the least confined to history and the most absorptive of powerful social standards of a progressive society.\u201d <em>Griffin v. Illinois, </em>351 <em>U.S. </em>12, 20-21, 76 <em>S.Ct. </em>585, 591, 100 <em>L.Ed. </em>891, 900 (1956) (concurring opinion). At its most basic level, the concept of due process requires that an individual be given notice and the opportunity to be heard when the government seeks to limit or curtail a protectable interest. <em>Goss v. Lopez, </em>419 <em>U.S. </em>565, 579, 95 <em>S.Ct. </em>729, 738, 42 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>725, 737 (1975); <em>Doe v. Poritz, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 106, 662 A.2d 367. This constitutional guarantee is understood as providing the individual with \u201can opportunity to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(citing <em>Kahn v. United States, </em>753 F.2d 1208, 1218 (3rd Cir.1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">How elaborate procedures must be in order to comply with the principles of due process depends upon the following factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9R\">[P]irst, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government\u2019s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-5\"><em>[Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 <em>U.S. </em>319, 335, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>893, 903, 47 L.Ed.2d 18, 33 (1976).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">In weighing these three factors, we are abundantly satisfied that the procedures delineated in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-6.11(Z) are, in this context, wanting.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">(D</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">The first factor of the <em>Mathews </em>calculus requires consideration of the private interests affected by government action. The interest in being free from physical detention by the government is \u201cthe most elemental of liberty interests.\u201d <em>Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, </em>542 <em>U.S. </em>507, 529, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>2633, 2646, 159 L.Ed.2d 578, 599 (2004). A curfew that requires an individual to remain in his residence, every day, for an eleven hour period, represents a significant burden on an individual\u2019s liberty interests, which is only enhanced by the fact that a violation of that condition without good cause constitutes a fourth-degree offense and poses a risk of re-incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">In considering the second <em>Mathews </em>factor, we observe that the manner of the Board\u2019s review presented a great potential for an erroneous deprivation of Jamgochian\u2019s liberty interests. That is, the record before the Adult Panel, and the full Parole Board, consisted entirely of written materials, most if not all of which constituted hearsay. The makers of these statements were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>called as witnesses. Indeed, Jane Doe, who was the only person with personal knowledge of what it was that Jamgoehian may have said or done that might have warranted the imposition of a curfew, was not called as a witness; only an unsworn, unauthenticated statement purportedly written by Jane Doe, which was appended to a police report, was considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Jane Doe\u2019s unsworn statement represented the \u201cbest\u201d evidence placed before either the Adult Panel or the full Board as to any conduct that might have warranted the imposition of a curlew. Yet, Jamgoehian was not given access to that document, or any others, prior to the decision of the Adult Panel. He was not given the opportunity to rebut that \u201cevidence.\u201d He was not allowed to argue to the Adult Panel that statements other than those made by individuals with personal knowledge should have been considered. He was not given the opportunity to urge that witnesses be called and that the Adult Panel or Parole Board should consider information of greater substance than the hearsay statements provided. And he was not given the right to confront and cross-examine any of the persons whose information was considered by the Adult Panel and the Parole Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">It is also important to emphasize that there is a greater opportunity for an erroneous determination when the only information provided to the decision maker consists of written statements, which were not subject to cross-examination, and when the individual whose liberty interest is at stake has had no opportunity to know of the contents of the statements or to provide his own testimony or other evidence in response. To paraphrase Justice White\u2019s comments regarding the extent of process due to students suspended from school without a hearing, \u201calthough proceeding in utmost good faith,\u201d officials charged with making such decisions \u201cfrequently act on the reports and advice of others.\u201d <em>Goss v. Lopez, supra, </em>419 <em>U.S. </em>at 580, 95 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 738, 42 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 738. Despite good faith efforts, as Justice White recognized, \u201cthe controlling facts and the nature of the conduct under challenge are often disputed\u201d; as a result, \u201c[t]he risk of error\u201d when proofs are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>limited to a cold record of mostly hearsay statements \u201cis not at all trivial, and it should be guarded against if that may be done without prohibitive cost or interference\u201d with the governmental interest in question. <em>Ibid. </em>The disposition of a matter such as that presented here is troubled by the same possibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">The likelihood of erroneous outcomes is also increased by the one-sided nature of the proceedings. Jamgoehian and his attorney were precluded from the \u201chearing\u201d that took place before the Adult Panel. Simple common sense suggests that the chances of a mistaken determination are greatly increased when only one side to a controversy is invited to participate.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">The deprivation of cross-examination represents yet another basis for questioning the accuracy of the outcomes produced by the procedures currently employed by the Parole Board in such matters. The importance of cross-examination, \u201cone of the greatest engines that the skilled man has ever invented\u201d for ascertaining the truth of a matter, 6 <em>Wigmore on Evidence </em>\u00a7 1838 (Chadbourn Rev.1976), has not been understated. Yet the right to the cross-examination of Jane Doe was completely denied here and, with that deprivation, the Adult Panel and the Parole Board failed to take advantage of a valuable tool for deciphering the truth of the matter.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>In addition, while we have no basis for believing it so here\u2014 chiefly because the accuracy of the information considered by the Adult Panel and the full Board was never tested in an adversarial setting\u2014it is not so far-fetched to believe that an utterly false accusation could be presented and still produce the results obtained here. Procedures that so thoroughly exclude an adverse party\u2019s participation invite the possibility that the good faith of the Adult Panel and the Board could be thwarted by faceless individuals with a grudge or vendetta against an individual. <em>See, e.g., Peters v. Hobby, </em>349 <em>U.S. </em>331, 350-51, 75 <em>S.Ct. </em>790, 800, 99 <em>L.Ed. </em>1129, 1143-14 (1955) (Douglas, J., concurring). As we have already observed, Jamgochian alleged that such forces were at work here, but the Board merely passed those allegations along to the Director of the Division of Parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">It is not for the interests of Jamgochian alone that the second <em>Mathews </em>factor compels the granting of greater procedural rights than were afforded here. It is equally important to society that governmental bodies not proceed in such matters on \u201cerroneous information or because of an erroneous evaluation\u201d of the information at hand. <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 <em>U.S. </em>471, 484, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>2593, 2601, 33 L.Ed.2d 484, 496 (1972). <em>See also Carey v. Piphus, </em>435 <em>US. </em>247, 266, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>1042, 1054, 55 L.Ed.2d 252, 266-67 (1978) (noting \u201cthe importance to organized society that procedural due process is observed\u201d). In considering the procedural rights required when the government seeks to revoke an individual\u2019s parole, Chief Justice Burger, in speaking for the Court in <em>Morrissey, </em>observed that society has an interest \u201cin treating the parolee with basic fairness: fair treatment in parole revocations will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>enhance the chance of rehabilitation by avoiding reactions to arbitrariness.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">We likewise believe that these societal interests are endangered in this similar setting. Jamgochian\u2019s past conduct, and alleged more recent conduct\u2014fairly viewed with repulsion and legitimate alarm for the safety of the public\u2014does not justify a deprivation of the requirements of due process. <em>Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, supra, </em>542 <em>U.S. </em>at 531, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2647, <em>159 L.Ed.2d </em>at 600; <em>O\u2019Connor v. Donaldson, </em>422 <em>U.S. </em>563, 575, 95 <em>S.Ct. </em>2486, 2494, 45 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>396, 407 (1975). When an adversarial proceeding, which would better test the accuracy of the charges leveled against the individual, is precluded by governmental regulation, not only is there an increased potential for inaccurate conclusions, but a sense of unfairness inevitably adheres to whatever result is achieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">We thus conclude that the application of the first two <em>Mathews </em>factors\u2014in light of the significant liberty deprivation imposed by the Parole Board\u2014mandates more extensive procedural rights than presently permitted by <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-6.11(Z). However, we are in no position to determine what additional procedures should be adopted because the record on appeal contains insufficient information for a thorough evaluation and assessment of the third <em>Mathews </em>factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">The third <em>Mathews </em>factor requires that we consider \u201cthe Government\u2019s interest.\u201d <em>Mathews, supra, </em>424 <em>U.S. </em>at 335, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 903, 47 L.Ed.2d at 33. Of course, the State does not have an interest in resolving such matters without at least \u201csome informal procedural guarantees.\u201d <em>Morrissey, supra, </em>408 <em>U.S. </em>at 483, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2601, 33 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 495. Nor is there a valid State interest in insulating, from closer scrutiny, the Parole Board\u2019s discretion to restrict an individual\u2019s liberty that would justify its preclusion of adversarial hearings. The State, however, does have an interest in \u201cthe function involved\u201d\u2014here, the supervision of individuals serving community supervision for life terms\u2014as well as \u201cthe fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>substitute procedural requirement would entail.\u201d <em>Mathews, supra, </em>424 <em>U.S. </em>at 335, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 903, 47 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 33. Consideration of the procedural safeguards required, thus, must include not only a weighing of the Board\u2019s obligation to supervise against the individual\u2019s liberty interests, but also an accounting of the costs in money and time that would be increased by the adoption of additional procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">In this regard, we are mindful of the need for the expeditious resolution of such matters. It may very well be that the record formed on remand will support the Board\u2019s view that Jamgochian\u2019s communications with Jane Doe suggest that he was, as alleged, cultivating a new victim. If true, a delay in the imposition of a curfew would be troubling.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">But there is no reason to believe that the interests served by the rapid imposition of a curfew and the providing of greater procedural rights cannot be harmonized. We do not see why a curfew might not be temporarily imposed in appropriate circumstances prior to the conducting of a hearing that would guarantee all the process due. Although the principles of due process normally require an opportunity to be heard prior to a liberty deprivation, <em>see, e.g., Zinermon, supra, </em>494 <em>U.S. </em>at 127, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 984, <em>108 L.Ed.2d </em>at 115; <em>Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, </em>470 <em>U.S. </em>532, 542, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>1487, 1493, 84 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>494, 503-04 (1985), it is, in the final analysis, not just the individual\u2019s liberty interests, but also the public\u2019s right to be secure from potentially dangerous offenders that must be safeguarded. As a result, when quick action is necessary and a pre-deprivation process is impractical, a post-deprivation hearing may satisfy the requirements of due process. <em>See, e.g., Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., </em>455 <em>U.S. </em>422, 436, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>1148, 1158, 71 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>265, 278 (1982). The constitutional principles girding our judgment can accommodate both the societal interest and the individual\u2019s right to a meaningful opportunity to be heard, by permitting a pendente lite curfew ultimately subject to a rapid final agency determination that would encompass all appropriate procedural safeguards.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>Although we are convinced that Jamgoehian was deprived of procedural due process at the agency level,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we will not presently attempt to define the scope of a constitutional procedural framework in this setting.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">In response to our inquiries, the Board has provided raw data regarding the number of hearing officers and Board members available to conduct the hearings presently required by law in other matters within the Board\u2019s jurisdiction, as well as statistics concerning the number of hearings in other matters that are conducted on a monthly basis. In addition, we are told that there are presently 3,334 individuals on community supervision for life, and that 233 of these individuals are currently subject to curfews. These figures are helpful in our gaining a perspective, as a general matter, of the potential increase in the Board\u2019s caseload that evidentiary hearings in such matters might impose. But these statistics do not convince us that providing a greater panoply of rights, as urged by Jamgoehian, would open the floodgates nor are we presently convinced that there is merit to the Board\u2019s eonclusory contention that \u201cthe current caseload for both hearing officers and Board members cannot be increased without detriment.\u201d In any event, we conclude that appropriate deference to the Board requires that we decline to mandate any specific guidelines for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>adjudication of such matters in the future.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We leave this question for the Board\u2019s consideration in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Our dissenting colleague would allow the Board to adjust the extent of due process rights in this context through an ad hoc case-by-case methodology, and has concluded that, in these circumstances, this standard would not entitle Jamgochian to any additional process than he already received because the record, in our colleague\u2019s view:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-8\">does not disclose any statements by [Jamgochian] that ... could be characterized as a denial of the allegations made by Jane Doe. In the absence of such a denial, I am unwilling to conclude that these proceedings, and the regulations under which they were held, were deficient.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-9\"><em>[Post, </em>394 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 555, 928 A.2d 24.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">In relying upon <em>Bolyard v. Berman, </em>274 <em>N.J.Super. </em>565, 644 A.2d 1122 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>272, 649 A.2d 1291 (1994), our colleague would link the process due in this setting to whether the individual has made \u201ca timely and colorable\u201d denial of the factual basis for the curfew. <em>Post </em>at 556, 928 A.2d 24.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>further assume that compliance with this test would be governed by the Board\u2019s unilateral view of the sufficiency and timeliness of the individual\u2019s denial. We reject this proposed standard because, if adopted, it would substitute an unpredictable and potentially arbitrary methodology for the approach mandated by <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, supra, </em>424 <em>U.S. </em>at 335, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 903, 47 L.Ed.2d at 33, which we outlined earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">We would also observe that the existing regulations do not provide a mechanism by which this proposed \u201ctimely and color-able\u201d test could be triggered or analyzed. The existing regulations do not provide an individual with the opportunity or right to respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">In addition, we reject our colleague\u2019s view that Jamgochian\u2019s uninvited response to the imposition of the curfew fails to meet the standard urged in the dissenting opinion. As we have already observed, Jamgochian\u2019s counsel wrote to the Chairman of the Board after the curfew was imposed, and provided a copy of Jamgoehian\u2019s certification. In comparing this submission with the \u201ctimely and colorable\u201d test proposed, our colleague has concluded that Jamgochian did not deny Jane Doe\u2019s allegations. We disagree. As revealed by that part of Jamgoehian\u2019s certification also quoted in the dissenting opinion, Jamgochian vociferously disputed the allegations upon which the curfew was based:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-6\">16. [The parole officer] then told me he had received orders from Trenton and that I had to sign these two papers. One said that I could not go near [Jane Doe] and thereafter he verbally added the Diner [where she worked] and the second was that I had a curfew.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-7\">17. I told him that <em>this was all bullshit. </em>That even if I made a call, what would that have to do with a curfew? I also told him that I would stay away from the Diner and I did not care about that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-8\">[Emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">Although the expletive used by Jamgochian to describe the factual basis for the imposition of a curfew lacked charm, we think it must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>be viewed as a rather emphatic denial of the Board\u2019s contentions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> And, although our colleague does not suggest that Jamgochian\u2019s papers were untimely, we would observe for the sake of completeness that Jamgochian\u2019s papers were forwarded to the Board twelve days after notification of the imposition of the curfew. Accordingly, even under the approach suggested by our colleague, we would conclude that Jamgochian both timely and colorably denied the allegations and that\u2014even if we were to apply the approach suggested in the dissenting opinion\u2014Jamgochian would be entitled to an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">We also find inconsistent our colleague\u2019s broad interpretation of Jane Doe\u2019s statement, in which Jane Doe only concluded that the alleged conversation with Jamgochian made her feel \u201cuncomfortable,\u201d as well as her assumption that Jane Doe\u2019s statement is true, with our colleague\u2019s narrow interpretation of Jamgochian\u2019s rather forceful denial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This reasonable debate over the meaning of these statements, we respectfully suggest, further illuminates the danger in basing such a significant deprivation of an individual\u2019s liberty interests upon legitimate differences of opinion as to the meaning of written statements that have not been tested through a process that requires the speaker to take the oath and undergo cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Our colleague also states that compelling Jane Doe to appear and testify poses \u201ca significant \u2018danger that the hearing body would be less attuned to the parolee\u2019s rehabilitation needs because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>it would be distracted by the adversarial nature of the proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Post </em>at 557, 928 A.2d 25 (quoting <em>Bolyard, supra, </em>274 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 573-74, 644 A.2d 1122). We doubt whether an agency which conducts as many hearings as does the Board,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and whose decisions we ordinarily apply a standard of review that defers to its determinations unless arbitrary or capricious<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> because of its expertise in such matters, would be distracted by the presence of an attorney. We are confident that the Board\u2019s hearing officers would not confuse the resolution of a disputed fact question with the obligation to impose, if warranted, appropriate conditions to aid in the individual\u2019s rehabilitation. Indeed, we doubt the effectiveness of imposing further limitations on an individual\u2019s liberty interests for rehabilitation purposes when those conditions emanate from a faulty, erroneous or unfair resolution of factual disputes. Permitting the individual to appear at a hearing with a member of the Bar lessens the likelihood of erroneous determinations and thereby enhances the effectiveness of any conditions imposed for the individual\u2019s rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">For all these reasons, we respectfully reject our colleague\u2019s suggestion that only a \u201ctimely and colorable\u201d denial triggers an individual\u2019s right to a hearing in this setting. We view this test as insufficient, unpredictable, and subject to the whim of the administrative body. Moreover, we observe that this test is more than the Board presently allows. The Board\u2019s failure to adopt or apply even this limited test for determining the need for a hearing in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>this case belies our colleague\u2019s conclusion that Jamgochian \u201creceived the process to which he was due.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 557, 928 A.2d 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Our decision is further compelled by considerations of fundamental fairness, which, in this State, reach further than the requirements of due process. <em>See, e.g., Doe v. Poritz, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 108, 662 A.2d 367. This doctrine</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-8\">serves to protect citizens generally against unjust and arbitrary governmental action, and specifically against governmental <em>procedures </em>that tend to operate arbitrarily. [It] serves, depending on the context, as an augmentation of existing constitutional protections or as an independent source of protection against state action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-9\"><em>[Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>State v. Ramseur, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>123, 377, 524 A.2d 188 (1987) (Handler, J., dissenting)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">In <em>Doe v. Poritz, supra, </em>the Court held that convicted sex offenders have privacy interests in the information regarding their whereabouts and that, prior to being subjected to Megan\u2019s Law registration and notification requirements, those individuals were to be afforded the right to counsel, the right to a hearing and the right to judicial review as to their classification. 142 <em>N.J. </em>at 30-31, 106, 662 A.2d 367. The Court based that holding not only on the requirements of due process but also on concepts of fundamental fairness. This holding further buttresses our conclusion that when the government seeks to infringe such a significant liberty interest, greater procedural rights than heretofore allowed by the Parole Board are due.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-11\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b573-12\">Lastly, we cannot overlook the fact that the curfew imposed was for an indefinite period of time. <em>N.J.AC. </em>10A:71-6.11 incorporates no mechanism by which an individual such as Jamgochian may seek the later modification or termination of a curfew. Just as Jamgochian will be subject to community supervision for the remainder of his life, so too\u2014but for our judgment today\u2014 Jamgochian may be required, solely at the discretion of the Board, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>to abide by a curfew either from time to time, or permanently, for the remainder of his life.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">In a later submission invited by our inquiry, the Board asserted, without reference to any written regulation, that \u201c[p]ursuant to Division policy and procedure, when a curfew is imposed by a supervisor as a condition of [community supervision for life], it must be reviewed and assessed by a supervisor every six months to determine its efficacy and continued need.\u201d The Board has not indicated whether or to what extent an offender may participate in these periodic reviews, or what steps an offender may take if the Board fails to undertake such a review in any given case. We find such loose promises as to future review to be inconsistent with the requirements of due process and fundamental fairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">An individual\u2019s liberty interests should not be held hostage to the whim or beneficence of the government. \u201c[P]rocess which is a mere gesture is not due process.\u201d <em>Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>339 <em>U.S. </em>306, 315, 70 <em>S.Ct. </em>652, 657, 94 <em>L.Ed. </em>865, 874 (1950). We are not convinced that absent today\u2019s judgment there is anything other than the unilateral action of the Board standing between Jamgochian and banishment to his home for eleven hours per day, every day, for the rest of his life. The constitutional principles we have already discussed require greater safeguards than are represented by the Board\u2019s bald assertion that it will consider the matter again sometime in the future. <em>See also Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, supra, </em>542 <em>U.S. </em>507, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>2633, 159 <em>L.Ed,2d </em>578.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">We thus conclude that the absence of a written procedure by which modification or termination of such an intrusive special condition may be sought by Jamgochian or others similarly situated violates the principles of due process and fundamental fairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">In providing guidance for the Board\u2019s reconsideration of the process which is due Jamgochian, we commend for its consider<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>ation the procedures adopted in parole revocation matters. Although we acknowledge that the liberty interest at stake in this matter is not precisely the same, an individual serving a community supervision for life term is nevertheless to be \u201csupervised as if on parole.\u201d <em>State v. Williams, supra, </em>342 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 92, 775 A.2d 727. And, when an individual who has been released from incarceration is subjected to a curfew\u2014the breach of which constitutes a fourth-degree offense and possibility of incarceration\u2014the liberty interests at stake must be understood as being far more similar to parole revocation, as in <em>Morrissey, </em>or revocation of an individual\u2019s participation in a \u201cpre-parole\u201d program, as in <em>Young v. Harper, </em>520 <em>U.S. </em>143, 152-53, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>1148, 1154, 137 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>270, 280 (1997), than other less drastic limitations on liberty, <em>see, e.g., Meachum v. Fano, </em>427 <em>U.S. </em>215, 228, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>2532, 2540, 49 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>451, 461 (1976) (intrastate prison transfer); <em>Shabazz v. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>385 <em>N.J.Super. </em>117, 127, 896 A.2d 473 (App.Div. 2006) (continued placement in a halfway house); <em>O\u2019Neal v. N.J. State Parole Bd., </em>149 <em>N.J.Super. </em>174, 184, 373 A.2d 657 (App.Div. 1977) (rescission of a parole date).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">As explained by Chief Justice Burger in <em>Morrissey, </em>the individual who has been released on parole, like the individual who is released from incarceration and placed on community supervision for life,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-7\">can be gainfully employed and is free to be with family and friends and to form the other enduring attachments of normal life. Though the State properly subjects him to many restrictions not applicable to other citizens, his condition is very different from that of confinement in a prison. He may have been on parole for a number of years and may be living a relatively normal life at the time he is faced with revocation. The parolee has relied on at least an implicit promise that parole will be revoked only if he fails to live up to the parole conditions____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-9\">We see, therefore, that the liberty of a parolee, although indeterminate, includes many of the core values of unqualified liberty and its termination inflicts a \u201cgrievous loss\u201d on the parolee and often on others. It is hardly useful any longer to try to deal with this problem in terms of whether the parolee\u2019s liberty is a \u201cright\u201d or a \u201cprivilege.\u201d By whatever name, the liberty is valuable and must be seen as within the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment. Its termination calls for some orderly process, however informal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-10\"><em>[Morrissey, supra, </em>408 <em>U.S. </em>at 482, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2600-01, 33 L.Ed.2d at 495 (footnotes omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>These same circumstances are largely present here. Although, unlike <em>Morrissey, </em>the proceedings in question do not result in the direct or immediate re-incarceration of Jamgochian, nevertheless the curfew places a significant limitation on his liberty interests and a breach of the curfew would undoubtedly lead to incarceration. As a result, <em>Morrissey\u2019s </em>holding represents an influential paradigm for determining the procedural rights that should be afforded to Jamgochian and those similarly situated.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">In considering the procedural rights that were constitutionally mandated in parole revocation matters in <em>Morrissey, </em>the Court held that upon threat of parole revocation, the federal due process clause required that a parolee be given at least \u201can informal hearing structured to assure that the finding of a parole violation will be based on verified facts and that the exercise of discretion will be informed by an accurate knowledge of the parolee\u2019s behavior.\u201d 408 <em>U.S. </em>at 484, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2602, 33 L.Ed.2d at 496. The <em>Morrissey </em>Court declined to \u201cwrite a code of procedure,\u201d but it held that the \u201cminimum requirements of due process\u201d in that circumstance include \u201c(a) written notice of the claimed violations of parole; (b) disclosure to the parolee of evidence against him; (e) opportunity to be heard in person and to present witnesses and documentary evidence; (d) the right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses (unless the hearing officer specifically finds good cause for not allowing confrontation); (e) a \u2018neutral and detached\u2019 hearing body such as a traditional parole board, members of which need not be judicial officers or lawyers; and (f) a written statement by the factfinders as to the evidence relied on and reasons for revoking parole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 488-89, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2604, 33 L.Ed.2d at 498-99. The Court declined to reach the question of whether the parolee is entitled to the assistance of retained counsel or the appointment of counsel if indigent. <em>Id. </em>at 489, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2604, 33 L.Ed.2d at 499.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Regulations applicable to parole revocation proceedings in this State require all the rights described in <em>Morrissey. </em>And although <em>Morrissey </em>did not compel it, <em>ibid., </em>an individual facing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>parole revocation in this State also has the right to counsel. <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-7.7(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">We also suggest that the Board consider the trend, since <em>Morrissey, </em>to provide greater procedural rights in similar circumstances than were required by <em>Morrissey. See, e.g., Dougherty v. N.J. State Parole Bd., 325 N.J.Super. </em>549, 740 A.2d 150 (App.Div. 1999) (holding that the Parole Board was obligated to conduct a parole revocation hearing despite the parolee\u2019s refusal to participate and that it was not sufficient for the Board to simply postpone the hearing indefinitely until its scheduling was requested by the parolee), <em>certif. denied, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>77, 747 A.2d 285 (2000); <em>White v. N.J. State Parole Bd., </em>136 <em>N.J.Super. </em>360, 368, 346 A.2d 415 (App.Div.1975) (holding that a criminal indictment alone was not a sufficient basis for parole revocation but only established reasonable cause for a parole revocation hearing); <em>Johnson v. N.J. State Parole Bd., </em>131 <em>N.J.Super. </em>513, 521, 330 A.2d 616 (App.Div. 1974) (due process requires prompt probable cause and parole revocation hearings), <em>certif. denied, </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>94, 335 A.2d 47 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">It is also of interest that the Supreme Court of the United States has held that the federal constitution guarantees a prison inmate facing disciplinary action greater procedural rights than afforded to Jamgochian here. <em>Wolff, supra, </em>418 <em>U.S. </em>at 563-70, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2978-82, 41 L.Ed.2d at 955-59. Our courts have since determined that inmates are entitled to even greater procedural rights than compelled by <em>Wolff. See McDonald, supra, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>at 194-95, 652 A.2d 700; <em>Avant, supra, </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>at 523, 341 A.2d 629; <em>Decker, supra, </em>331 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 356-59, 751 A.2d 1094.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">The Board should also recognize that couching the nature of the proceedings that lead to the imposition of a curfew, such as occurred here, as \u201ccivil\u201d instead of \u201ccriminal\u201d does not provide any great insight into whether a person in Jamgochian\u2019s position has a right to counsel in the proceedings required by due process and fundamental fairness. <em>Lassiter v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>452 <em>U.S. </em>18, 25, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>2153, 2158-59, 68 L.Ed.2d 640, 648 (1981); <em>Pasqua v. Council, </em>186 <em>N.J. </em>127, 142, 892 A.2d 663 (2006). For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>example, courts have held that the federal and state due process guarantees require that the right of counsel attaches: when the Megan\u2019s Law tier classification of a convicted sex offender is considered at a hearing, <em>Doe v. Poritz, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 30-31, 662 A.2d 367; when a delinquent child support obligor faces enforcement proceedings pursuant to <em>R. </em>1:10-3, <em>Pasqua v. Council, supra, </em>186 <em>N.J. </em>at 141-46, 892 A.2d 663; when a person is charged with disorderly persons or other petty offenses in municipal court that may result in \u201cactual imprisonment <em>or ... </em>other serious consequences such as <em>the substantial loss of driving </em>privileges,\u201d <em>Rodriguez v. Rosenblatt, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>281, 295, 277 A.2d 216 (1971) (emphasis added); when a parent is a party to civil proceedings that may lead to the temporary or permanent loss of parental rights, <em>Crist v. N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Fam. Servs., </em>135 <em>N.J.Super. </em>573, 575, 343 A.2d 815 (App.Div.1975); and when the involuntary civil commitment of a person is sought, <em>In re S.L., </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>128,136-37, 462 A.2d 1252 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">This trend toward the enhancement of procedural rights in these settings should also be weighed in the Board\u2019s consideration of the procedures that now must be applied in the present and other similar circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">The Board\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal as moot is denied, its decision imposing a curfew on Jamgochian is vacated and the matter remanded for further proceedings. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b551-9\"> The record does not include the transcript of the plea proceedings or anything other than this pre-sentence report, which would reveal the conduct that formed the basis for Jamgochian's conviction. We assume, for present purposes, the accuracy of the factual recitation contained in the pre-sentence report.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b553-9\"> Other conditions were also then imposed, including a prohibition on Jamgochian having any contact \u201cwhat so ever [sic], physical, verbal, written or through a third party\u201d with Jane Doe. Jamgoehian does not seek our review of the imposition of any of these special conditions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b564-6\"> In this vein, we find it incongruous that an inmate, charged with violating a prison regulation, possesses a right to confront and cross-examine witnesses absent only a reasoned determination by an impartial tribunal that cross-examination is not necessary for an adequate presentation of the evidence, or in the interest of prison security, <em>see Avant v. Clifford, </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>496, 532, 341 A.2d 629 (1975), whereas the same rights were denied Jamgoehian here. We also recently emphasized the importance of preserving an inmate right\u2019s to confrontation and cross-examination when a matter turns on the credibility of the inmate and a corrections officer. In <em>Decker v. Dep't of Corr., </em>331 <em>N.J.Super. </em>353, 359, 751 A.2d 1094 (App.Div.2000), we held that \"where the inmate is charged with a disciplinary infraction by virtue of conduct directed to or at a corrections officer and the matter turns on the credibility of the officer or the inmate, the inmate, upon request, is entitled to confrontation and cross-examination of the officer, at least in the absence of issues that justify an exception as a matter of prison security.\u201d By comparison, Jamgoehian accused his parole officer of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>misconduct, which affected, in his view, the decision to impose a curfew; the Board, however, as indicated earlier, did not consider or pursue this allegation and gave Jamgochian no opportunity to provide evidence in support of his claim. If this matter had arisen in a prison setting, Jamgochian would have been entitled to greater procedural rights than afforded here. <em>See McDonald v. Pinchak, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>188, 194-95, 652 <em>A.2d </em>700 (1995); <em>Avant, supra, </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>at 523, 341 <em>A.2d 629; see also Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 <em>U.S. </em>539, 556, 94 <em>S.Ct. 2963, </em>2974, 41 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>935, 951 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b568-5\"> We recognize that Jamgoehian did submit factual and legal written arguments to the Parole Board both before and after the Adult Panel\u2019s decision. This fact does not alter our view that Jamgoehian was deprived of due process in this matter. Indeed, there is nothing in the Board Chairman's letter of May 5, 2005, which explained the reasons for the Adult Panel\u2019s decision, thus belying any contention that anything Jamgoehian had asserted in his attorney\u2019s submission had actually been considered by the Adult Panel. Indeed, as we have mentioned, Jamgochian\u2019s factual and legal contentions regarding the alleged misconduct of the parole officer were merely passed along to the Division of Parole. The full Parole Board also did not consider any of Jamgochian's other factual contentions and further rejected his due process arguments by mere reference to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-6.11 (l). We decline to hold that by submitting unsolicited materials to the Parole Board, of which the Board was dismissive, Jamgochian\u2019s due process rights were adhered to.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b569-11\"> We are also perplexed by the absence of any argument regarding whether the Legislature has already fixed the procedural rights due. That is, <em>NJ.S.A. </em>2C:43-6.4(b) states that persons serving a special sentence of community supervision for life, among other things, \"shall be subject to the provisions and conditions set forth in ... sections 15 through 19 and 21 of <em>P.L. </em>1979, <em>c. </em>441.\u201d These incorporated provisions include <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-123.62 and -123.63 (i.e., sections 18 and 19 of <em>P.L. </em>1979, <em>c. </em>441), which outline the rights due to a parolee, including those rights recognized by <em>Morrissey </em>and the additional right to counsel. It is conceivable that by expressly incorporating <em>NJ.S.A. </em>30:4-123.62 and -123.63 as provisions applicable to community supervision for life terms, the Legislature intended that the procedural rights contained in <em>NJ.S.A. </em>30:4-123.62 and -123-63 would be applicable to the imposition of a special condition. Because this issue has not been briefed, however, we offer no view on the impact <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-123.62 and -123.63 may have on the issues on appeal. The parties are free to raise this issue, in this first instance, on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b569-12\"> We are not persuaded that \"the timely and colorable\u201d test we adopted in <em>Bolyard, supra, 274 N.J.Super, </em>at 574, 644 A.2d <em>1122, </em>for determining when an indigent parolee charged with a parole violation is entitled to <em>the appointment of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number><em>counsel </em>should be transplanted and utilized here to create a case-by-case approach for determining when someone in Jamgochian's position is entitled <em>to a hearing.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b571-8\"> We would also question whether it is fair to determine whether Jamgochian fully disputed Jane Doe\u2019s allegations when there is nothing in the record to suggest that at the time of Jamgochian\u2019s submission he had been provided with a copy of Jane Doe's statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b571-9\"> Our colleague is also dismissive of Jamgochian\u2019s allegations that his parole officer had a vendetta against him, stating that these allegations do not suggest that the parole officer was pursuing Jamgochian as Inspector Javert pursued Jean Valjean in <em>Les Miserables. Post </em>at 556, 928 A.2d 24. In questioning the motives of the parole officer\u2014and thereby questioning the credibility of his accusations\u2014we do not think that Jamgochian should be put to the test of demonstrating that the parole officer fit the Javert mold of overzealousness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b572-5\"> The Attorney General has advised that the Board conducts probable cause, final revocation and rescission hearings at the rate of forty per week.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b572-6\"> <em>See Trantino v.

The record before us does not contain the transcript of the proceedings at which appellant was sentenced, and we are thus unable to account for the calculus which was used to balance the aggravating and mitigating factors to determine an appropriate sentence. We do know from the record before us that these convictions were not appellant\u2019s first contact with the criminal justice system. Appellant had at the time at least three prior convictions, two of which were for sexually-related offenses for which he received sentences of twelve years of incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">By the time of his 1998 convictions, the Legislature had passed <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6.4, directing that any individual convicted of certain specified enumerated offenses, including <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2c(l), in addition to a period of incarceration, receive a special sentence of community supervision for life.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The statute provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-7\">The special sentence of community supervision required by this section shall commence upon completion of the sentence imposed pursuant to other applicable provisions of the Code of Criminal Justice.

Shortly thereafter, he filed a petition for post-conviction relief in which he alleged that he was not correctly informed at the time he entered his guilty plea that community supervision for life entailed restrictions upon his ability to travel outside the State. <em>State v.

We reversed for an evidentiary hearing on appellant\u2019s claim that he was misinformed about what community supervision for life entailed. <em>Id. </em>at 227, 832 A.2d 360.

Jane Doe had worked as a waitress at a diner. She told the police that \u201cRon,\u201d a frequent customer, had been calling her persistently and had told her that he would pay her $300 a week for two hours work. \u201cRon\u201d told her not to tell her employer. Jane Doe\u2019s mother learned that \u201cRon\u201d had been calling her daughter and discussed the matter with Jane\u2019s employer, who told her that \u201cRon\u201d had been in jail \u201cfor trouble with young girls.\u201d Because these conversations made Jane Doe uncomfortable, she contacted the police. The police conducted an investigation which led them to identify appellant as \u201cRon,\u201d and appellant\u2019s parole officer was notified.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">Appellant\u2019s parole officer, and his supervisor, were immediately concerned. They perceived a similarity between appellant\u2019s alleged conduct with Jane Doe and the circumstances involved in his 1998 conviction for sexual assault, which they knew from appellant\u2019s file rested upon his having lured a woman with the opportunity to pose for photographs for a book jacket and then repeatedly assaulting her. Appellant\u2019s parole officer and his supervisor consulted with a deputy parole supervisor, and appellant was then served with an order directing him to have no contact with Jane <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>Doe and imposing a curfew from 8:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In connection with the service of that order, a search of appellant\u2019s residence was conducted, which led to the discovery of a pornographic tape of appellant and a willing adult participant.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Two weeks later, appellant\u2019s attorney wrote to the New Jersey State Parole Board, protesting the imposition of these special conditions. In that letter, the attorney alleged that these conditions were the result of animus on the part of appellant\u2019s parole officer. Accompanying that letter was a certification from appellant detailing his complaints against his parole officer, which revolve around his expressed concern that the superintendent of the apartment building in which he was living had been in contact with the parole officer. Paragraphs 16 and 17 of the certification stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-7\">16. P.O. Venditti then told me he had received orders from Trenton and that I had to sign these two papers. One said that I could not go near [Jane Doe] (and thereafter he verbally added the Diner) and the second was that I had a curfew.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-8\">17. I told him that this was all bullshit. That even if I made a call, what would that have to do with a curfew? I also told him that I would stay away from the Diner and I did not care about that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">On May 5, 2005, the Adult Panel, in response to appellant\u2019s appeal, adopted the recommendations of the District Parole Officer, including the curfew, the no-contact order, and that appellant engage in counseling designed for sex offenders.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>My colleagues conclude that the procedure followed in this matter was deficient, in part, because \u201cthe record before the Adult Panel and the full Parole Board, consisted entirely of written materials, most if not all of which constituted hearsay.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>394 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 534, 928 A.2d 1 (App.Div.2007). That, however, is one of the hallmarks of proceedings before the Parole Board, which \u201care dependent upon information obtained from various files, documents, records, and other materials and sources.\u201d <em>Gerardo v. N.J. State Parole Bd., </em>221 <em>N.J.Super. </em>442, 452, 534 A.2d 1037 (App.Div.1987). Indeed, so dependent are Parole Board proceedings upon such material that we have specifically held that the residuum rule, otherwise applicable to administrative proceedings, does not apply to Parole Board decisions. <em>Id. </em>at 453, 534 A.2d 1037. We reached this conclusion, noting the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-5\">legislative awareness and acceptance of the fact that, of necessity, evidence at parole hearings is frequently hearsay by nature. This is so because the Board\u2019s parole decisions are often highly predictive and subjective.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 452, 534 A.2d 1037.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">My colleagues also conclude that the Parole Board proceedings in this matter were defective because appellant was not afforded the opportunity for confrontation and cross-examination. In my judgment, the right of confrontation and cross-examination should not be viewed as a necessary and integral part of all proceedings in which the Parole Board is considering the imposition of conditions as part of community supervision for life. I note initially that the parole proceedings are not part of a criminal prosecution and that the full panoply of rights associated with the process due a defendant charged with a criminal offense do not come to bear in parole proceedings. <em>Gagnon v. Scarpelli, </em>411 <em>U.S. </em>778, 788-89, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>1756, 1763, 36 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>656, 665 (1973) (noting \u201cthere are critical differences between criminal trials and probation or parole revocation hearings, and both society and the probationer or parolee have stakes in preserving these differences\u201d); <em>Gerardo v. N.J. State Parole Board supra, </em>221 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 448, 534 A.2d 1037. This is so because the essential focus of parole proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>is rehabilitative, not punitive. <em>Gagnon v. Scarpelli, supra, </em>411 <em>U.S. </em>at 785, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1761, 36 L.Ed.2d at 663.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">My colleagues draw an analogy to prison disciplinary proceedings, in which, in appropriate instances, an inmate may confront and cross-examine a corrections officer who has filed charges against the inmate. <em>Ante </em>at 536, n. 3, 928 A.2d 12. <em>Decker v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>331 <em>N.J.Super. </em>353, 751 A.2d 1094 (App.Div. 2000). In my judgment, <em>Decker </em>is distinguishable from the present matter and supplies no basis to conclude that appellant\u2019s due process rights were trampled. In that case, inmate Decker was charged with tampering with or blocking a locking device in violation of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:4-4.1(a)*.154 and the hearing officer concluded that Decker\u2019s \u201cintentional act jeopardized the security of the facility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 355, 751 A.2d 1094. Decker testified at the disciplinary hearing that he was pushed into the gate by the press of inmates leaving the mess hall, and he submitted statements of two other inmates corroborating his version of what occurred. We concluded that since the case \u201cturn[ed] on whether the complaining officer [was] correct or incorrect in charging an inmate with conduct that was intentional____the inmate [was] entitled to challenge the officer\u2019s perceptions by developing why the officer thought the incident was purposeful as opposed to accidental.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 359, 751 A.2d 1094.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">Here, however, my review of the record and the various submissions by appellant and his attorney to the parole authorities does not disclose any statements by appellant that in my judgment could fairly be characterized as a denial of the allegations made by Jane Doe. My colleagues treat appellant\u2019s use of an expletive as a denial. In my judgment, the context requires the conclusion that appellant was referring to the curfew, not the charges. I do not consider it unfair to expect appellant to set forth an explicit denial of the charges as opposed to what is, at best, an ambiguous emotional reaction. In the absence of such a denial, I am unwilling to conclude that these proceedings, and the regulations under which they were held, were deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>In connection with this aspect of their decision, my colleagues write that appellant \u201caccused his parole officer of misconduct which affected, in his view, the decision to impose a curfew.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 536-37, n. 3, 928 A.2d 12. In my judgment, a balanced reading of appellant\u2019s certification of April 25, 2005, would not support a conclusion that his parole officer had a vendetta against appellant or perceived his role to be that of Inspector Javert pursuing Jean Valjean. Appellant\u2019s landlord may have expressed complaints against him, but nothing within that certification would support an inference that the landlord\u2019s bias infected appellant\u2019s parole officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">I would utilize the ease-by-case approach this court earlier adopted when deciding whether indigent parolees were entitled to the assignment of counsel when charged with violations of parole. <em>Bolyard v. Berman, </em>274 <em>N.J.Super. </em>565, 577, 644 A.2d 1122 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>272, 649 A.2d 1291 (1994). There, we relied upon the principles set forth by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Gagnon v. Scarpelli, supra, </em>which conditioned the right to counsel in such cases upon the probationer or parolee presenting</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-5\">a timely and colorable claim (i) that he has not committed the alleged violation of the conditions ...; or (ii) that, even if the violation is a matter of public record or is uncontested, there are substantial reasons which justified or mitigated the violation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-6\"><em>[Bolyard, supra, </em>274 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 574, 644 A.2d 1122 (quoting <em>Gagnon, supra, </em>411 <em>U.S. </em>at 790, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1764, 36 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 666-67).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">In my judgment, appellant has yet to make a \u201ctimely and colorable claim\u201d in either respect. Because in my view claims of entitlement to a hearing are susceptible to such a case-by-case approval, I would not direct promulgation of new regulations to supersede <em>N.J. AC. </em>10A:71-6.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">Further, I am troubled by the lack of definition to my colleagues\u2019 assertion that appellant was entitled to confront and cross-examine witnesses in connection with the decision to impose a curfew upon him. My colleagues do not address who it is that appellant may have the right to cross-examine. Is it the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>officers who took Jane Doe\u2019s complaint? Is it the parole personnel who were alerted by the police? Or is it Jane Doe herself? Compelling her to appear for cross-examination poses, in my mind, a significant \u201cdanger that the hearing body would be less attuned to the parolee\u2019s rehabilitation needs because it would be distracted by the adversarial nature of the proceedings.\u201d <em>Bolyard, supra, 274 N.J.Super. </em>at 573-74, 644 A.2d 1122.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Further, my colleagues, in setting forth the proposition that \u201ca trend toward the enhancement of procedural rights,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 550, 928 A.2d 21 should guide the Board in its determination of how to structure such hearing point to <em>Rodriguez v. Rosenblatt, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>281, 277 A.2d 216 (1971). The Supreme Court, however, in <em>Beckworth v. N.J. State Parole Bd., </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>348, 365-66, 301 A.2d 727 (1973), specifically declined to consider <em>Rodriguez </em>as bearing upon the appropriate conduct of parole hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">In my judgment, appellant received the process to which he was due, and I would thus affirm the action of the Parole board.</p>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b579-9\"> The statute has since been amended to provide for \"parole supervision for life.\u201d L. 2003, <em>c. </em>267, \u00a7 1, effective January 14, 2004.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b581-10\"> Special conditions such as imposition of this curfew are not effective until \"affirmed by the appropriate Board panel.\u201d <em>NJ.A.C. </em>10A:71-6.11(1)(4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b581-11\"> My colleagues appear to attach some significance to the fact that the justification stated in the May 23, 2005 Special Condition for the curfew differs from the language used in the April 15, 2005 Special Condition originally drafted by the parole officer. There is, however, no difference in the language used in the May 5, 2005 and May 23, 2005 documents. The specific references to appellant\u2019s conduct with regard to Jane Doe which my colleagues say was dropped from the May 23 Special Condition remain in the Special Condition imposing the no-contact order. I consider it self-evident that those factual allegations are the underpinning for the curfew order, and thus I disagree with my colleagues\u2019 description of the May 23, 2005, Special Condition imposing the curfew as \"conclusoiy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
