After some years of operation, the relationship between plaintiff and defendant soured, and plaintiff sought to buyout defendant\u2019s 50% interest in the company. After the parties could not agree on a buyout amount, litigation ensued, ending in this appeal by defendant and cross-appeal by plaintiff. Although on appeal the parties challenge the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>court\u2019s valuation of defendant\u2019s interest and its calculation of appropriate adjustments and credits, the primary issue raised involves an alleged appearance of impropriety created by the trial court\u2019s actions towards the end of the litigation. Indeed, defendant claims that this entire multi-day trial and over two years of litigation must be reversed and remanded for a new trial because, shortly before entry of the final judgment, the trial judge and plaintiffs counsel began negotiations for the judge\u2019s post-retirement association with counsel\u2019s firm, which occurred less than one month after the final judgment was entered. Because the judge had already issued a series of written opinions finally deciding the case, and signing the judgment simply memorialized those decisions, we disagree that the judge\u2019s action created an appearance of impropriety, however poorly timed it may have been. Thus we decline to order a new trial. We reject all other objections to the final judgment, except that we conclude the valuation date was incorrectly established and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">We begin by summarizing the relevant facts and procedural history, which are complex due to the nature of the dispute. DeNike and Cupo formed Classic Mortgage on December 14, 1996. The operating agreement gave each member a 50% interest and provided that net profits and losses would be allocated among the members \u201cpro rata in proportion to their respective Membership Interests.\u201d The agreement also provided that when a member left the company, his capital account would be transferred to the remaining member.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">At the inception of the company, plaintiff and defendant agreed to keep only 70% of their individual commissions and to leave the remaining 30% in the company\u2019s operating account for overhead expenses. The salespeople were paid commissions ranging from 30% to 55%. The net money generated by their sales went into the \u201ccorporate pot,\u201d which the members split equally at the end of the year. Thus, DeNike and Cupo received compensation through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>revenues generated by the company\u2019s sales force as well as their own commissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">From the company\u2019s inception, DeNike managed the business and defendant managed the sales force including the employees\u2019 payroll. Initially they produced about the same amount of business, with plaintiff perhaps producing \u201cmarginally more.\u201d By 2000, however, because of the company\u2019s growth plaintiff was spending much more time managing the business and his sales commissions were also exceeding defendant\u2019s. This meant, in effect, that plaintiff was contributing more money towards the business expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">For example, in 2002, plaintiffs and defendant\u2019s 30% allocations were $1,288,650 and $829,566 respectively. Also at this time, plaintiff had been overdrawing and defendant underdrawing funds from their capital accounts. In any event, because of the extra time plaintiff was spending managing the business, defendant acquiesced in plaintiffs request for a $15,000 management fee that plaintiff began to receive monthly from July 2002 forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">By August 2002, the relationship between plaintiff and defendant had become strained, as defendant\u2019s participation in the business declined amid rumors about his alleged drinking. Plaintiff and defendant decided to go their separate ways in September 2002, but could not agree on a buyout figure and consequently the parties continued their association.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">In December 2002, plaintiff and defendant mediated their dispute with a retired Supreme Court justice. For purposes of the mediation, defendant agreed to December 31, 2002, as the date defendant\u2019s interest in the business was to be valued. During the mediation, which ended unsuccessfully in June 2003, defendant remained at Classic Mortgage and was paid for his sales at the previously agreed 70% commission rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">Shortly after the mediation failed, plaintiff DeNike, individually and as a member of Classic Mortgage, filed a complaint and order-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>to-show-cause on July 2, 2003, seeking to terminate Cupo\u2019s membership in the company and acquire his interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">On July 10, 2003, before the return date of the order-to-show-cause, defendant filed a cross-motion seeking the appointment of a special fiscal agent to oversee Classic Mortgage. On July 18, 2003, the trial court denied the cross-motion because it found no evidence of any irregularity in the management and operation of the company, and issued an order deeming Cupo dissociated from the company, subject to compensation for his membership. The judge granted limited restraints on Cupo\u2019s presence at Classic Mortgage and directed the company to make a $250,000 partial payment to him, without prejudice to a final determination of the value of his interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Cupo then answered the complaint, denying the key allegations, and filed a counterclaim for the fair value of his interest, an accounting, and the repayment of the \u201cmanagement fees\u201d that had been paid to DeNike.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">On March 10, 2004, plaintiff moved to establish the valuation date for Cupo\u2019s interest as December 31,2002, the date the parties had adopted in connection with the unsuccessful mediation. Defendant opposed the motion claiming that the appropriate date was July 18, 2003, the date the court had deemed him dissociated from the company. On April 16, 2004, the court determined that the valuation date should be December 31, 2002, which was seven months before defendant had been dissociated from the company, and simultaneously determined that Cupo was entitled to certain commissions from January 1, through July 18, 2003. An order to that effect was issued on June 15, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">The trial court conducted a bench trial on this dispute during various dates from February 8 to March 10, 2005. The court heard testimony about business operations and the parties\u2019 relationship. Besides receiving testimony from DeNike, Cupo and several employees, the court also heard testimony from David Weiss, the company accountant, and two valuation experts, Karen Eisenberg and Leonard Friedman. This testimony presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>various valuation approaches and differing valuations of defendant\u2019s interest in the company. As one early possibility, used as a starting point for the parties\u2019 discussions, Weiss had valued defendant\u2019s share of the business at $586,084. A second opinion was presented by Eisenberg, who testified as plaintiffs expert. She valued the business based upon its fair market value and fair value as a going concern. Using a capitalization of earnings approach, she determined that the value of the business was $944,000, and that defendant\u2019s share was therefore $472,000. After applying discounts for marketability and minority interest she reached a net value of $284,616.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Friedman testified as Cupo\u2019s valuation expert and presented a third option. He calculated the company\u2019s value using a capitalization of earnings method. Even though DeNike and Cupo were commission salespersons, Friedman assigned them salaries for purposes of his valuation. As of December 31, 2002, Friedman estimated the value of the company at $2,740,000 with $1,370,000 as defendant\u2019s interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">On April 7, 2005, the court issued its \u201cinitial decision.\u201d In that decision, the judge found that the parties had consented to place 30% of their commissions in the business to pay overhead and continued this arrangement even after the business succeeded to the point where the employees\u2019 production covered the overhead. As the parties\u2019 production began to differ, the judge noted that their capital accounts became imbalanced. Because the parties ultimately intended to pass through to each of them whatever they brought into the business, the court determined that their accounts must be recalculated accordingly. The court further found that the parties agreed to pay plaintiff $15,000 a month for \u201cmanagement\u201d from July 2002 onward.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">In this initial decision, the judge also reaffirmed his prior decision that defendant had ceased his involvement with the business by the end of 2002. The court found that the parties agreed at that time that defendant would leave, that plaintiff would acquire defendant\u2019s interest and that even though defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>remained on the premises, by that time he was only a salesman. The court further noted that the parties had used the December 2002 date as the basis for their mediation and generally acted as if that was the date when defendant terminated his involvement in the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">In the initial decision, the court also concluded that both of the experts\u2019 opinions were flawed and unreliable. After explaining why the court had rejected the valuations supplied by the experts, he found that the valuation of this business was difficult to determine under the conventional methods used to value small businesses. That is so, because \u201c[t]he departure of one producer-member does not make the company attractive to an outside investor. The person benefited is the surviving member.\u201d Thus, whatever value the business may have to a willing outside purchaser is probably less than the value of the business to the surviving member, who obtains complete control of the entity through the purchase. Accordingly, on May 13, 2005, the trial judge appointed its own expert, William Morrison, to value Classic Mortgage and calculate the parties\u2019 capital accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">The trial continued on December 20, 2005, at which time the court heard testimony solely from Morrison. Morrison based his opinions upon three different assumptions regarding overhead: (1) no overhead is assessed against the members\u2019 commissions, (2) actual direct expenses are allocated against the commissions, or (3) 30% overhead is assessed against the commissions. Morrison determined that plaintiffs and defendant\u2019s reconstituted capital accounts as of December 31, 2002, were $62,299 and $263,674, respectively, and that plaintiff owed defendant $100,688 for the equalizing distribution. He also determined defendant\u2019s 2003 commissions. First he found that between January 1, and July 18, defendant generated $351,925 in sales commissions of which he was owed 70% or $246,348, and received $388,559.03. Then he found defendant generated approximately $148,641 in sales commissions for transactions which closed after July 18, of which he was owed 70% or $104,048.70, and received $78,310.16. Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>Morrison determined that defendant owed Classic Mortgage approximately $116,472.57. Morrison used that amount as a direct offset to any amount owed defendant, with consideration of the $250,000 already paid defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Following cross-examination by the parties, the court asked Morrison to place a particular value on the business. After taking a brief break and making some modifications to his initial calculations, Morrison selected scenario three without discounts, explaining that the purpose of the valuation was to determine the worth of the business to plaintiff, not to an open market. He valued the gross business at $1,518,113, half of which was rounded off to $759,056. He then adjusted the amount defendant was due by subtracting $116,473 for the overpayment of commissions and $250,000 for the advance payment, and by adding a credit of $100,688 to equalize the capital accounts. Inclusive of credits and adjustments, the resulting figure was $493,271.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">At the conclusion of Morrison\u2019s testimony, the court denied defendant\u2019s motion to reconsider the valuation date and reserved decision on defendant\u2019s motions for prejudgment interest from December 21, 2002 and for $98,800 in taxes plus interest. It also reserved decision on plaintiffs request to pay the judgment over five years based upon the operating agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">In a December 28, 2005 supplemental decision, the court accepted Morrison\u2019s calculations and opinions. The court adopted Morrison\u2019s commission/draw calculation of $116,472.57 (meaning defendant was overpaid to that extent, requiring a credit back to Classic Mortgage), reiterated the need to give credit for the $250,000 advance, and agreed that defendant\u2019s interest should not be modified by a marketability or minority discount. The court concluded that the value of defendant\u2019s interest was $750,000, after rounding off Morrison\u2019s figure. The court then adjusted defendant\u2019s account by a credit of $53,155, a debit for the overpayment of $116,473, and the payment of $250,000. The court therefore ruled that plaintiff would purchase defendant\u2019s interest for $436,682.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>The court denied defendant\u2019s application for prejudgment interest based on plaintiffs good-faith, substantial payment of $250,000. The court also denied defendant\u2019s counsel fee application because it found no showing that plaintiffs actions were arbitrary or vexatious, or not in good faith. Finally, the court refused to alter its earlier decision that the parties had by their actions acquiesced in the use of the December 2002 valuation date, and that defendant thereafter became \u201cnot [] an equity member, but rather [] a sales person.\u201d As a sales person, defendant was not entitled to his member\u2019s share in the profits from December 31, 2002 to his date of dissociation on July 18, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">After reconsideration, the court in a second supplemental decision found that it erred by using the credit of $53,155, instead of the $100,688 actually used by Morrison to equalize the capital accounts. The court further concluded that a five-year note was an appropriate means of paying the judgment and that the obligor should be Classic Mortgage, not plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">On January 11, 2006, the judge ordered Classic Mortgage to compensate defendant pending applications relating to the specific amount and time payments of the award. On January 17, 2006, defendant challenged the court expert\u2019s valuation and adjustments and, on January 20, 2006, plaintiff sought payment of the award in installments.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">In a January 20, 2006 second supplemental decision, the court adjusted its prior calculations and concluded that immediate payment contravened the parties\u2019 intent for Classic Mortgage to continue as a viable enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">During this period, plaintiffs attorney in the matter, Thomas J. Herten, was aware of the trial judge\u2019s mandatory retirement date of February 24, 2006. Herten certified that he received a copy of the court\u2019s written final decision on January 23, 2006. The next day, before the final judgment memorializing that decision had been executed, Herten approached the judge about his post-retirement plans and discussions began regarding the possibility of the judge joining his firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>On January 30, 2006, Herten received defendant\u2019s proposed form of final judgment and promissory note and submitted to the court an alternative form of judgment and promissory note. On February 1, 2006, the court entered final judgment of $493,271 against Classic Mortgage and ordered the award paid in installments. The court denied Cupo\u2019s motion seeking to have the judgment entered jointly against plaintiff and Classic Mortgage and indicated that \u201cClassic Mortgage, LLC shall execute and deliver <em>a </em>promissory note, to [defendant].\u201d (emphasis added). Significantly, the court did not select plaintiffs form promissory note over defendant\u2019s proposed note. It also denied defendant\u2019s motion seeking to have the court award him the additional amount of $98,800 on account of taxes, plus interest, which he allegedly paid. On February 1, 2006, after he had received a copy of the final judgment, Herten had another telephone conversation with the judge about his firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">On February 3, 2006, Herten visited the judge in his chambers where they discussed the relationship, in principle, with the financial aspects to be determined later. The judge indicated that he was having a retirement dinner that evening and asked if he could announce his intention to join the Herten firm. Herten agreed that would be appropriate, and that evening the judge announced that he had accepted a position as \u201ccounsel\u201d to the Herten firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Ten days after the judge\u2019s announcement, defendant\u2019s counsel advised the Bergen County Assignment Judge that Cupo intended to move to vacate the final judgment and seek disqualification of the trial judge. The Assignment Judge changed the venue \u201cin the interest of justice\u201d and Judge Passero, of Passaic County, agreed to hear the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">On February 27, 2006, the original trial judge joined the Herten firm. The arrangement entitled the judge to income he generated from mediations and arbitrations, and provided that he would be responsible for some yet undefined overhead based upon those fees. Shortly thereafter, defendant moved to vacate the final judgment and all prior orders. He raised questions about the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>judge\u2019s failure to disclose his post-retirement negotiations and alleged that the judge\u2019s relationship with plaintiffs counsel\u2019s firm could have influenced the outcome of the ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Before addressing defendant\u2019s motion, Judge Passero gave both parties an opportunity to file, on short notice, motions for reconsideration of any issue that could properly have been raised before the trial judge. Judge Passero specifically gave defendant the opportunity to seek reconsideration of certain components of the judgment. He also indicated that he would facilitate defendant\u2019s right to cross-examine Herten, and that both parties could question the trial judge at a subsequent hearing regarding the circumstances leading to the trial judge\u2019s association with the firm. Neither party accepted Judge Passero\u2019s offer for reconsideration or further development of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Judge Passero then denied defendant\u2019s motion. He noted the lengthy complex litigation, which took two-and-a-half years to complete. He emphasized that the judge\u2019s disclosure of his post-retirement plans was \u201cnot surreptitious, this was not behind the scenes, and this was very open and clear.\u201d He also recognized the trial judge\u2019s excellent reputation for integrity and professionalism. Judge Passero emphasized that the trial judge already had made his substantive decision and that \u201cthe only thing that remained to be done was the ministerial act of formalizing in a written order that which was decided upon by [the trial judge] on January 20, 2006, and by decision prior thereto.\u201d He did recognize, however, that it would have been a better exercise of judicial discretion if the judge and Herten had immediately disclosed their initial conversations about the possibility of future employment, and also acknowledged that \u201cmaybe in retrospect and hindsight being 20/20 [the trial judge] should have done it differently.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">In the order denying the motion to vacate judgment, Judge Passero again reiterated that he would entertain motions for reconsideration in the event that either party appealed the final judgment and the case was remanded for further proceedings, or in the event that an appeal was not filed. Likewise, in the event <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>of further proceedings, he ordered that defendant would have the right to cross-examine Herten and the trial judge at a hearing before Judge Passero concerning the facts leading up to the judge\u2019s association with the Herten firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">We address first defendant\u2019s allegation of serious error caused by the judge\u2019s untimely association with the Herten law firm. It goes without saying that judges must personally observe high standards of conduct to preserve public confidence in the integrity and independence of the judiciary. <em>In re Mathesius, </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>496, 500, 910 A.2d 594 (2006); <em>see Code of Judicial Conduct, </em>Canon 1 (2007). A judge must avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety by acting at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary. <em>Code of Judicial Conduct, </em>Canon 2(a)(2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">\u201cThe judge of any court shall be disqualified on the court\u2019s own motion and shall not sit in any matter ... (f) when there is any other reason which might preclude a fair and unbiased hearing and judgment, or which might reasonably lead counsel or the parties to believe so.\u201d <em>R. </em>1:12\u20141(f). A judge must disqualify himself or herself in any proceeding in which the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned. <em>Code of Judicial Conduct, </em>Canon 3(c)(1)(a) (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">Defendant argues that the trial judge\u2019s ill-timed negotiation and announcement of his post-retirement plans created an appearance of impropriety and has undercut his \u201cconfidence in the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>See Rivers v. Cox-Rivers, </em>346 <em>N.J.Super. </em>418, 421, 788 A.2d 320 (App.Div.2002). However, our analysis reveals that there was no actual appearance of impropriety. No person could reasonably believe that the judge had been biased, less than impartial, or unfair in conducting this trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">In arguing for a new trial, defendant relies on the <em>Committee on Codes of Conduct </em>Advisory Opinion 84 (entitled Judge\u2019s Pursuit of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>Post-Judicial Employment), which suggests that \u201cjudgefs] should not explore [post-judicial] employment opportunities with a law firm which has appeared before the judge until the passage of a reasonable interval, so that the judge\u2019s impartiality in the handling of the case cannot be reasonably questioned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">However, the Committee on Codes of Conduct issues advisory opinions upon delegation from the Judicial Conference of the United States. <em>In re School Asbestos Litig., </em>977 <em>F.2d </em>764, 783 n. 24 (3d. Cir.1992). Therefore, Advisory Opinion 84 pertains to federal judges and is not binding on State judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Defendant also argues that application of <em>Pepsico, Inc. v. McMillen, </em>764 F.2d 458 (7th Cir.1985), would require a new trial. <em>Pepsico </em>recognized that the appearance of equal justice requires a judge not to explore employment prospects with lawyers representing clients in cases before him or her. <em>Id. </em>at 460. However, that ease\u2019s holding applied only to those unusual situations \u201cwhen, at the very time a case is about to go to trial before a judge, he is in negotiation\u2014albeit preliminary, tentative, indirect, unintentional and ultimately unsuccessful\u2014with a lawyer or law firm or party in the case over his future employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 461.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Unlike <em>Pepsico, </em>in this case, the trial judge did not begin negotiations with the Herten firm until after he held a five-day bench trial and a one-day post-trial examination of the court-appointed expert, and issued three written decisions which addressed all of the substantive decisions in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">Defendant argues that the trial judge rejected pre-judgment interest and permitted the company to issue a promissory note after the judge began negotiations with the Herten firm. However, there is nothing in the record to suggest that after issuing his second supplemental decision, the judge revisited any of the issues on which he had already ruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">On the final judgment itself, the judge carefully refused to endorse either form of promissory note and wrote that \u201c[t]he interest rate was set at the judgment rate rather than at the rate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>in the operating agreement to recognize the effect of the \u2018advance\u2019 payment of $250,000 toward the obligation and the fact that the matter was litigated.\u201d Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, the handwritten note was not an \u201cadditional substantive determination!;]\u201d but simply an explanation of how the court had earlier set the interest rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Consequently, the only action the judge took after negotiations began with the Herten firm was the ministerial act of adopting the form order drafted by plaintiffs attorney with only a few minor editorial changes. <em>Fazilat v. Feldstein, </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>74, 81-82, 848 A.2d 761 (2004) (describing the insignificance of a failure to execute an order where a clear intent to do so has been shown). There is nothing in the record that causes us to doubt Herten\u2019s statement that he did not discuss any potential relationship with the judge while the case was being decided. Furthermore, Judge Passero offered defendant the opportunity to develop the record on this point, including an examination of the trial judge, but defendant demurred. Therefore, because defendant chose not to present any testimony on this point, we conclude defendant accepted Herten\u2019s account of the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">Although we agree with Judge Passero that the judge should have handled this situation differently, there are, at this time in this State, no regulatory restrictions on post-retirement employment by judges. There is currently no waiting period after retirement before employment may be accepted by a judge and no limitations on the timing of a judge\u2019s negotiations or the acceptance of post-retirement employment with any law firm. If there is to be any such regulatory restriction, it must come from the Supreme Court. In that regard, we note that the Court has recently formed an Ad Hoc Committee to review the Code of Judicial Conduct in light of the revised Model Code of Judicial Conduct adopted by the American Bar Association in February 2007. We assume that issues involving retired judges, such as the one presented here, will be considered by this new Committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>In this appeal, we hold only that because the judge negotiated post-retirement-employment after he had rendered all substantive decisions there was no appearance of impropriety. This is so even though negotiations were begun before execution of a final judgment, as the judgment merely captured what had been earlier decided by the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">We recognize that defendant could have made the same appearance of impropriety argument even had the judge waited for some reasonable period after conclusion of this matter before negotiating with the firm. And while it is nevertheless our considered opinion that the judge should not have begun negotiations with the Herten firm before completely concluding this matter, and minimally should have revealed to defendant the contact that was made by plaintiffs attorney as soon as it occurred, in the absence of an appearance of impropriety or any indication of partiality, bias, or unfairness, we decline to direct a new trial. Moreover, defendant had a fair opportunity to seek reconsideration of any issue he believed the trial judge decided in error, but he declined that opportunity. Accordingly, we affirm Judge Passero\u2019s decision denying defendant\u2019s motion to vacate.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">In the balance of the appeal, Cupo challenges the trial court\u2019s determination of the valuation date, the fair value of his interest, the recalculation of the parties\u2019 capital accounts, the denial of a credit for taxes paid on the difference between Cupo\u2019s actual and adjusted capital accounts, the denial of prejudgment interest, the failure to enter judgment individually against DeNike, the allowance of the judgment to be paid over time, the determination that the parties agreed to \u201ctrue up\u201d their 30% contributions to the business, and the finding that defendant did not understand the concept of retroactive management fees. In DeNike\u2019s cross appeal, he claims the court erred by adopting a valuation that was inconsistent with the court\u2019s opinion. Except for the date of valuation, we deny all other arguments on the appeal and cross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>appeal substantially for the reasons stated by the trial court and Judge Passero. We address first the valuation date, and then briefly address the other issues raised by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Defendant contends the valuation date should be July 18, 2003, the date on which the court deemed him dissociated, rather than December 31, 2002, which was the court-ordered date of valuation. Plaintiff, in opposition, argues that by the end of 2002, defendant was working sporadically, behaving peculiarly, no longer participating in management meetings, and making minimal contributions to the business. Thus, according to plaintiff, it does not matter if the court relied on <em>N.J.S.A. </em>14A:12-7(8)(a), the statute cited as controlling in the pretrial order, or <em>N.J.S.A. </em>42:2B-39(a), the limited liability corporation provision, which defendant argues on appeal is the controlling provision. According to plaintiff, both Titles 14A and 42 gave the court discretion to adopt the earlier date as the one on which defendant \u201cresigned and deemed himself to be dissociated\u201d from membership. We disagree with this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">A trial court\u2019s valuation date is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Torres v. Schripps, Inc., </em>342 <em>N.J.Super. </em>419, 437, 776 A.2d 915 (App.Div.2001); <em>Musto v. Vidas, </em>333 <em>N.J.Super. </em>52, 64, 754 A.2d 586 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>165 <em>N.J. </em>607, 762 A.2d 221 (2000). However, we accord no deference to the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions. <em>Manalapan Realty, L.P. v. Manalapan Twp., </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">The trial court explained that it set the valuation date at the end of 2002 because \u201cthe date that can be selected by the Court is that which appears to be the equitable date which can be a date as of the filing of the complaint or can be some other date.\u201d By that time, according to the court, the parties had \u201cdecided to proceed to break up, to disengage themselves, which was manifested first by the discussions and the mediation.\u201d The court further found that by the end of 2002, defendant had agreed to leave, plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>had agreed to acquire his interest, and defendant stayed on only as a salesman. Furthermore, the court noted that the parties had premised their mediation on the December 31, 2002 date.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Pursuant to the oppressed shareholder statute, upon the motion of the corporation or shareholder, the court may order the sale of a shareholder\u2019s stock holdings valued at \u201ctheir fair value as of the date of the commencement of the action or such earlier or later date deemed equitable by the court.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>14A:12-7(8)(a). Classic Mortgage, however, is a limited liability company governed by the New Jersey Limited Liability Company Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>42:2B-1 to -70 (LLCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">The Legislature enacted the LLCA to enable members of such companies \u201cto take advantage of both the limited liability afforded to shareholders and directors of corporations and the pass through tax advantages available to partnerships.\u201d <em>Kuhn v. Tumminelli, </em>366 <em>N.J.Super. </em>431, 439, 841 A.2d 496 (App.Div.) (quoting <em>Senate Commerce Committee Statement, </em>S. Doc. No. 890, at 1 (June 14, 1993)), <em>certif. denied, </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>354, 851 A.2d 648 (2004). The LLCA gives members of such companies great discretion to establish structure and procedures, with the statute controlling in the absence of a contrary operating agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 440, 841 A.2d 496; <em>Union County Improvement Auth. v. Artaki, LLC, </em>392 <em>N.J.Super. </em>141, 152, 920 A.2d 125, (App.Div. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">The operating agreement for Classic Mortgage specified that no member had the right to voluntarily withdraw or resign. Instead, the company could dissolve followed by a winding up of its affairs. The operating agreement stated that dissolution could occur by unanimous written consent of the members, the sale or other disposition of all the company\u2019s assets, the expiration of the company\u2019s term, or \u201c[t]he death, expulsion, bankruptcy, dissolution or incapacity of a Member or the occurrence of any event which terminates the membership of a Member____\u201d Significantly, however, the operating agreement did not specify that dissociation was an event of dissolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number><em>N.J.S.A. </em>42:2B-24 sets forth the events under which a member is dissociated from a limited liability company. Dissociation occurs on a member\u2019s resignation, bankruptcy, death, dissolution or expulsion, or on the happening of an agreed-upon event. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>42:2B-24a and b(l)(4). A member\u2019s expulsion occurs pursuant to the operating agreement, by unanimous vote of the other members, or by judicial determination on application by the company or another member. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>42:2B-24b. Among other things, the statute provides that a court may expel a member who \u201cengaged in conduct relating to the limited liability company business which makes it not reasonably practicable to carry on the business with the member as a member of the limited liability company.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>42:2B-24b(3)(c). Here, the court deemed defendant dissociated, subject to compensation for his interest in the LLC, shortly after plaintiff filed a complaint making numerous allegations against defendant and seeking to terminate his membership.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">The LLCA, however, does not specify how a valuation date is determined for purposes of purchasing a dissociated member\u2019s interest. Instead, the statutory provision entitled \u201cRights of dissociated member\u201d simply provides that \u201cthe dissociated member has, <em>subject to section 39 ofP.L.1993, c. 210 (C.12:23-39), </em>only the rights of an assignee of a member\u2019s limited liability interest.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>42:2B-24.1 (emphasis added). <em>N.J.S.A. </em>42:2B-39, which addresses a member\u2019s right to receive distribution upon resignation, states that a member is entitled to the fair value of his or her limited liability company interest as of the date of resignation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Our goal in construing any statute is to discern and implement the legislative intent. <em>State v. Reiner, </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>307, 311, 850 A.2d 1252 (2004). It is a fundamental tenet of statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>construction that \u201c \u2018every effort should be made to harmonize the law relating to the same subject matter. Statutes in pari materia are to be construed together when helpful in resolving doubts or uncertainties and the ascertainment of legislative intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Return of Weapons to J.W.D., </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>108, 115, 693 A.2d 92 (1997) (quoting <em>State v. Green, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>547, 554-55, 303 A.2d 312 (1973)).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Here, both <em>N.J.S.A. </em>42:2B-24 (end of membership by dissociation) and <em>N.J.S.A </em>42:2B-39 (distribution upon end of membership by resignation) deal with the change in relationships among members of a limited liability company. Either way, a member ceases to be associated with the company\u2019s business. <em>See </em>Carter G. Bishop, <em>Treatment of Members Upon Their Death and Withdrawal from a Limited Liability Company: The Case for a Uniform Paradigm, </em>25 <em>Stetson L.Rev. </em>255, 265 (1995). Moreover, either event triggers the obligation of the company to purchase the resigned or dissociated member\u2019s interest. Thus, these two statutory provisions deal with similar subject matter, seek to achieve the same purpose, and should be construed together.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Although <em>N.J.S.A </em>42:2B-24 is silent as to the valuation date for purposes of purchasing a dissociated member\u2019s interest, <em>N.J.S.A </em>42:2B-39 fixes the time as the date of resignation. It, therefore, is reasonable to conclude that the Legislature intends for a dissociated member\u2019s interest to be similarly valued as of the date of dissociation. This interpretation is consistent with the fact that the LLCA explicitly provides that a dissociated member has certain rights subject to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>42:2B-39, thereby linking the two statutory provisions. <em>N.J.S.A </em>42:2B-24.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Under this interpretation, the LLCA does not give the court any discretion to determine the valuation date, and in that regard differs from the oppressed shareholder statute, which was evidently relied upon by the trial court. That particular statute allows the court to set the valuation date, \u201cas of the date of the commencement of the action or such earlier or later date deemed equitable by the court.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>14A:12-7(8)(a). As noted above, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>the trial judge determined the valuation date as December 31, 2002, based on his understanding that the \u201cstatute\u201d allowed him to select some equitable date other than the date of filing of the complaint. This was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">In our opinion, the LLCA requires the same valuation date for dissociations as for resignations. Therefore, because the judge deemed Cupo dissociated as of July 18, 2003, he became entitled, as of that date, to a distribution of \u201cthe fair value of his limited liability company interest.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>42:2B-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">In addition, we reject plaintiffs argument that the trial court correctly relied upon the mediation agreement to establish December 2002 as the valuation date. The mediation letter specifically stated that defendant agreed to a valuation date of December 31, 2002, and acknowledged plaintiffs request that the date be used without prejudice. According to defendant\u2019s testimony, plaintiff wanted to reserve the right to argue for the earlier date of September 30, 2002, in the event mediation proved unsuccessful. Thus, the parties did not agree to utilize this valuation date beyond any failed mediation.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">We will not accept a valuation date agreed to in the mediation for the sole purpose of mediation without a clear agreement by the parties that the date would remain viable should mediation fail. A contrary rule has the potential of deterring a party\u2019s willingness to mediate. This, we decline to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">Defendant Cupo also argues that the court erred in determining his fair share. Specifically, Cupo asserts that the court applied incorrect legal principles, imposed conditions on its expert which impaired Morrison\u2019s ability to render an opinion, improperly relied upon Morrison\u2019s \u201coff-the-cuff\u2019 valuation, and relied upon Morrison\u2019s flawed valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">In a bench trial, the acceptance or rejection of an expert\u2019s opinion as to valuation of a corporation, and the expert\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>methodology, are matters peculiarly within the province of the trial court. The judge\u2019s findings are thus entitled to great deference and will be reversed only if the trial judge abused his discretion. <em>Balsamides v. Protameen Chems., Inc., </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>352, 368, 734 A.2d 721 (1999). However, the question of what standards of value are permissible to consider is one of law and, thus, is subject to de novo review. <em>Casey v. Brennan, </em>344 <em>N.J.Super. </em>83, 113, 780 A.2d 553 (App.Div.2001), <em>aff'd, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>177, 801 A.2d 245 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The LLCA utilizes the phrase \u201cfair value of his limited liability company interest\u201d to designate what a resigning member is entitled to receive. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>42:2B-39(a). Fair value is not synonymous with fair market value. <em>Lawson Mardon Wheaton, Inc. v. Smith, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>383, 397, 734 A.2d 738 (1999). There is no inflexible test to determine fair value. <em>Steneken v. Steneken, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>290, 297, 873 A.2d 501 (2005). We generally consider \u201c \u2018... proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 297, 873 A.2d 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Morrison recognized that the interest being sold was not listed on any stock market and, thus, was not readily marketable. He also recognized that a sale of Cupo\u2019s interest to a third-party would not give the purchaser a controlling stake in the company. The situation was unique and the traditional \u201cfair market value,\u201d which assumes a willing buyer and willing seller, did not apply. That was so because defendant\u2019s interest had little value to outsiders, but significant intrinsic value to plaintiff, who wanted to continue the business. <em>See Brown v. Brown, </em>348 <em>N.J.Super. </em>466, 487-88, 792 A.2d 463 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>193, 803 A.2d 1164 (2002). We have no doubt that Morrison applied the proper valuation method.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">There is no dispute that Morrison would have done things differently if he had conducted his own investigation and not been restricted by the trial court. However, there is no indication that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>the opinion rendered by Morrison based on the court\u2019s restrictions was contrary to accepted valuation principles. For example, Morrison\u2019s valuation of the interest without applying marketability and minority discounts was consistent with the general rule that marketability and minority discounts are not applied in valuation proceedings where there will be no actual transfer of shares and a sale of the entire business appears unlikely. <em>See Brown, supra, </em>348 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 489, 792 A.2d 463. In any event, the judge\u2019s findings based upon Morrison\u2019s testimony were not \u201cso wholly unsupportable as to result in a denial of justice.\u201d <em>Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v. Investors Ins. Co., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 483-84, 323 A.2d 495 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Although defendant complains about Morrison\u2019s \u201coff-the-cuff\u201d valuation, the expert explained what he had done and did not appear to have been forced into making an arbitrary decision. As he explained, the gross valuation of the business was $1,518,113 and defendant\u2019s share was $759,056, which was his \u201cbest call on effectuating [the court\u2019s] decision based upon everything [he had] seen ... [and] it appears fair and reasonable.\u201d Furthermore, Morrison\u2019s observations and conclusions were fully explored on cross-examination. We cannot find that the trial court abused its discretion by pressing Morrison to value defendant\u2019s share from the witness stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Finally, we reject defendant\u2019s argument that Morrison\u2019s valuation was flawed. Specifically, defendant argues that Morrison arbitrarily reduced the excess assets by 25% and that the court, in turn, arbitrarily rounded Morrison\u2019s estimate of defendant\u2019s 50% interest to $750,000. Morrison, however, explained that he reduced the excess assets because he found the parties\u2019 experts\u2019 recommendations to be \u201ctoo aggressive,\u201d an explanation which the court found credible and had discretion to accept. The court also had discretion to round-off the final figure, given that valuation is not an exact science. <em>See Steneken, supra, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>at 297, 873 A.2d 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>c.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Defendant also contends the court erred by finding that the parties\u2019 capital accounts had to be \u201cequalized\u201d based upon an alleged agreement to \u201ctrue up\u201d their 30% contributions to the business. Defendant argues the parties never agreed to \u201cgo back\u201d and \u201ctrue up\u201d their contributions, but simply intended to stop making them when the business generated enough income to cover expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">However, the trial court concluded from the testimony that the parties\u2019 intent was ultimately to pass through to each of them whatever was brought into the business. The court explained that the 30% was only \u201cdeferred\u201d to the account until such time as the company was financially successful, meaning when the revenue generated by its salespeople (less their salaries or commissions) would pay the overhead. At that time, the full amount of their commission would pass directly to the members.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">Although there were no earlier discussion on what would happen if there was an imbalance in the members\u2019 capital accounts, in September 2002, Weiss suggested that they could reconcile (or \u201ceven-up\u201d) the accounts by allowing plaintiff to take out his 30% by way of \u201cretroactive management fees.\u201d Cupo claims never to have agreed to any retroactive management fee and to have been shocked by the calculation. Based upon this testimony, however, the court ordered the accounts recalculated or evened out, which was, in our view, only equitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">In any event, we must give deference to the trial court\u2019s ability to judge the credibility of the witnesses and assess the feel of the case. <em>Monogram, Credit Card Bank of Ga. v. Tennesen, </em>390 <em>N.J.Super. </em>123, 130-31, 914 A.2d 847 (App.Div.2007). Here, the trial court reviewed the conflicting testimony on the treatment of the 30% contributions, and reached its decision on the basis of findings of fact that are supported by credible evidence in the record. <em>Ibid. </em>Consequently, the findings are binding on us.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>D.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Defendant also argues that the trial court erred by failing to credit him for $98,530 in taxes paid on income which he did not receive from Classic Mortgage. Specifically, defendant claims he paid taxes on the difference between his reported capital account of $510,407 and the reconstituted capital account of $263,674. The tax was on money defendant never received because that year plaintiff withdrew $700,000 more than he was allocated.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">Unfortunately, the trial court did not explain its reasons for denying the motion to award defendant an additional amount for taxes allegedly paid. Although Morrison testified that a credit might be appropriate, he valued defendant\u2019s interest as of December 31, 2002. As we have explained, defendant\u2019s interest must be valued as of July 18, 2003. Assuming the validity of defendant\u2019s contention that he paid taxes on amounts that plaintiff overdrew in 2002, the record also shows plaintiff similarly paid taxes on money which defendant overdrew in 2003, which Morrison calculated as $116,472.47. Thus, the trial court correctly rejected this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">Defendant also seeks prejudgment interest on appeal. The purpose of prejudgment interest is compensatory to indemnify claimants for the loss of what they could have earned on the amounts ultimately awarded if they had received them when due. <em>Rova Farms Resort, Inc., supra, </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>at 506, 323 A.2d 495; <em>Busik v. Levine, </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>351, 358, 307 A.2d 571, <em>appeal dismissed, </em>414 <em>U.S. </em>1106, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>831, 38 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>733 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">In our view, the court acted well within its discretion when it implicitly found that there was no manifest injustice in denying prejudgment interest on the money owed defendant after deduction of the advance payment. The $250,000 payment to defendant ultimately represented over half of the total amount of $493,271 awarded to him, whether the payment was voluntary or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>required by the court\u2019s order. <em>See Sulcov v. 2100 Linwood Owners, Inc., </em>303 <em>N.J.Super. </em>13, 39, 696 A.2d 31 (App.Div.1997), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>194, 743 A.2d 847 (1999). Consequently, we reject this claim also.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">F.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Defendant further contends that the court erred by failing to enter final judgment against plaintiff, and in allowing the judgment to be paid over time. The court explained that the parties\u2019 agreement \u201cmanifested\u201d an intent to allow the company to \u201ccontinue as a viable enterprise. The provision for a 5-year note permits just that.\u201d The court also believed that the obligation was \u201cthat of the company, not of the remaining member, notwithstanding that he now becomes the only member of the LLC.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Plaintiff filed the complaint individually and on behalf of Classic Mortgage. The operating agreement provided at Section 20.1.4 that a distribution was to be made when a member\u2019s membership was terminated. Section 20.1.4.3 specifically provided for a payment \u201c[a]t the company\u2019s option, ... in a lump sum or by promissory note payable in equal quarterly installments over a period of five (5) years.\u201d The trial court\u2019s order thus enforces this agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">We may not rewrite a contract or grant a better deal than that for which the party expressly bargained. <em>Solondz v. Kommehl, </em>317 <em>N.J.Super. </em>16, 21, 721 A.2d 16 (App.Div.1998) (citing <em>Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. Riefolo Constr. Co., </em>161 <em>N.J.Super. </em>99, 114, 390 A.2d 1210 (App.Div.1978), <em>aff'd, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>514, 410 A.2d 658 (1980)). <em>\u201cWe </em>must enforce the contract which the parties themselves have made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 22, 410 A.2d 658 (citing <em>Kampf v. Franklin Life Ins. Co., </em>33 <em>N.J. </em>36, 43, 161 A.2d 717 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">G.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">Finally, defendant argues that several of the court\u2019s findings were not supported by substantial credible evidence in the record. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>Defendant claims there was insufficient support for the court\u2019s finding of a \u201ctrue up\u201d agreement for the 30% contribution and that defendant did not initially understand the concept of retroactive management fees. Our review of the record reveals sufficient support for the court\u2019s finding concerning the \u201ctrue up\u201d agreement. Although the court did not explain why it made the latter finding, defendant fails to show how such a statement was clearly capable of producing an unjust result and thus, does not warrant a remand. <em>R. </em>2:10-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">H.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">On plaintiffs cross-appeal, he contends that Morrison did not render an opinion that was consistent with the proceedings. He essentially argues that the court erred when it adopted Morrison\u2019s scenario three without discounts. Instead, plaintiff argues that scenario two without discounts, but with the reduction for excess assets and the modified capitalization rate, was most consistent with the court\u2019s decision. Plaintiff requests that we exercise our original jurisdiction to perform \u201csimple mathematical equations\u201d to find that the total due defendant is $196,215. We decline plaintiffs request.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">Morrison explained why scenario three was most appropriate and was cross-examined by the court and both counsel. The court\u2019s acceptance of this scenario was not an abuse of its discretion and thus there is no need to make any recalculations. Furthermore, an exercise of original jurisdiction is inappropriate in cases dependent upon credibility assessments. <em>See State ex rel. </em>336 <em>N.J.Super. </em>614, 628, 765 A.2d 1084 (App.Div.2001), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>475, 795 A.2d 851 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">Accordingly, for the reasons explained above, we affirm Judge Passero\u2019s order denying the motion to vacate and reject all other arguments by both parties, except for the valuation date and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>minor mistake in the judgment. Accordingly, we reverse and remand in part: (1) for a calculation by the court\u2019s expert of the amount owed defendant for his membership interest in Classic Mortgage from January 1 through July 18, 2003, using Morrison\u2019s valuation methodology; and (2) for a recalculation of the final judgment based upon the figure of $750,000, instead of the non-rounded figure of $759,056, which was used in the final judgment. As Judge Passero correctly noted, the final judgment under review mistakenly included the non-rounded off figure.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b407-8\"> Section 701(a)(1) of the Uniform Limited Liability Company Act (1996) provides that a member is entitled to the fair value of his or her interest as of the date of the member\u2019s dissociation. However, New Jersey chose not to incorporate that language into its version of the law. Our research has failed to locate any legislative history explaining the omission.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
