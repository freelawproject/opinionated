We conclude that only a person who has been assigned responsibility for a child\u2019s care or custody by a court or public agency may be found to be \u201clegally charged\u201d with the child\u2019s care or custody. Therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>defendant\u2019s <em>de facto </em>parental relationship with the victim was insufficient to support his conviction for the first degree offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Defendant was indicted on three counts of aggravated sexual assault, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2a; sexual assault, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2b; first degree endangering the welfare of a child by the production of child pornography, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4b(3); second degree endangering the welfare of a child by the production of child pornography, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4b(4); second degree endangering the welfare of a child, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a; and possession of child pornography, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4b(5)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">Defendant entered into a plea bargain under which he agreed to plead guilty to one count of aggravated sexual assault and first degree endangering the welfare of a child by the production of pornography and the State agreed to dismiss the other charges. The plea bargain also provided that the State could seek consecutive sentences for the two first degree offenses for which defendant agreed to plead guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">The trial court sentenced defendant in accordance with the plea bargain to a fifteen-year term of imprisonment, with seven and a half years of parole ineligibility, for aggravated sexual assault, and a consecutive ten-year term for first degree endangering the welfare of a child by the production of child pornography. The court also found that defendant was a repetitive and compulsive sex offender and directed that his sentence be completed at the Adult Diagnostic and Treatment Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">We initially heard defendant\u2019s appeal on an excess sentence calendar. See <em>R. </em>2:9-11. However, after hearing oral argument, we determined that defendant\u2019s argument that his relationship to the victim did not provide a factual basis for his plea to first degree endangering the welfare of a child by the production of pornography was sufficiently substantial to require briefing. Therefore, we transferred the appeal to a regular calendar.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>The offense of endangering the welfare of a child by the production of pornography is proscribed by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4b(3), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-5\">A person commits a crime of the second degree if he causes or permits a child to engage in a prohibited sexual act or in the simulation of such an act if the person knows, has reason to know or intends that the prohibited act may be photographed, filmed, reproduced, or reconstructed in any manner, including on the Internet, or may be part of an exhibition or performance. <em>If the person is a parent, guardian or other person legally charged with the care or custody of the child, the person shall be guilty of a crime of the first degree.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-6\">(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">It is undisputed that defendant was not the victim\u2019s \u201cparent\u201d or \u201cguardian.\u201d The only question is whether he provided a factual basis for finding that he was \u201clegally charged with [her] care or custody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">There is no case law interpreting the term, \u201cperson legally charged with the care or custody of [a] child,\u201d as used in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4b(3), which elevates the form of endangering the welfare of a child proscribed by this subsection from a second to a first degree offense, and this term is not used in any other New Jersey statute. However, <em>State v. Galloway, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>631, 657-62, 628 A.2d 735 (1993) sets forth the principles that guide our interpretation of this term.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\"><em>Galloway </em>involved the interpretation of N.J.S.A 2C:24-4a, which, at the time of Galloway\u2019s offense, elevated the form of endangering the welfare of a child proscribed by that subsection from a fourth to a third degree offense if the perpetrator had \u201ca legal duty for the care of [the] child or ... [had] assumed responsibility for the care of [the] childf.]\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Galloway was a boyfriend of the victim\u2019s mother, who did not live with her but visited on a weekly basis, and was caring for the child at the time of the offense. <em>Id. </em>at 662, 628 A.2d 735. He obviously did not have \u201ca legal duty for the care of the child[.]\u201d The only question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>was whether the evidence could support a jury finding that he had \u201cassumed responsibility for the care of the childf.J\u201d The Court held that to support a conviction for the elevated third degree offense, the State had to show that the defendant \u201chad assumed a caretaking function over the child on a continuing, regular or recurrent basis[,]\u201d and that the State had not made this showing. <em>Ibid, </em>In giving <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a this restrictive interpretation, the Court relied on the principles that penal statutes should be \u201cstrictly\u201d construed and that courts should \u201cconstrue ambiguous language [in penal statutes] against the State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 658-59, 628 A.2d 735; <em>see also State v. V.R., </em>387 <em>N.J.Super. </em>342, 347, 903 A.2d 1116 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>103, 912 A.2d 1263 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">We conclude that these same principles preclude interpreting <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:24-4b(3) to allow a conviction of a live-in boyfriend such as defendant, who does not have any legally assigned duty for the care of the victim, for the first degree offense. It is illuminating to compare the language of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a, which the Court interpreted in <em>Galloway, </em>with <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:24-4b(3). Under <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:24-4a, a defendant could be convicted of the elevated third degree offense if he either had a \u201clegal duty\u201d to care for the child or had \u201cassumed responsibility\u201d for the child\u2019s care. However, under <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:24-4b(3), a defendant may be found guilty of the elevated first degree offense only if he is \u201clegally charged\u201d with the victim\u2019s care or custody. Thus, while either a <em>de jure </em>or <em>de facto </em>parental relationship with the victim will support a conviction for the elevated offense under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a, only a <em>de jure </em>parental relationship with the victim will support a conviction for the elevated offense under <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:24-4b(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">Our law recognizes that some persons who do not occupy the status of a parent or guardian may nevertheless be \u201clegally charged\u201d with a child\u2019s care or custody. For example, the Department of Children and Families is authorized to place a child under its care, custody or guardianship with a \u201cresource family parent\u201d for \u201ccare\u201d of that child. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-26a; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-26.4. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>We conclude that the term, \u201cperson legally charged with the care or custody of a child,\u201d as used in <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:24~4b(3), must be strictly construed to apply only to a person who has been assigned responsibility for a child\u2019s care or custody by a court or public agency under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-26a and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-26.4 or other similar provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">There is no evidence defendant was ever legally charged with the care or custody of his girlfriend\u2019s daughter. Indeed, in pleading guilty, defendant only indicated that he resided in the same household as the victim and the presentence report simply describes him as the live-in boyfriend of the victim\u2019s mother. Consequently, his conviction for the first degree offense proscribed by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4b(3) cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">The only error in the plea and sentence was the parties\u2019 mutual misunderstanding that defendant was guilty of a first degree rather than a second degree violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4b(3). Therefore, the parties\u2019 expectations in entering into the plea bargain may be honored by giving the State the option of accepting defendant\u2019s plea to the second degree offense and remanding to the trial court for resentencing. If the State rejects this option, defendant\u2019s plea and sentence must be vacated and the case remanded for renegotiation of the plea or trial. Accordingly, the case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b602-10\"> This subsection was subsequently amended to make the more serious offense one of the second degree and the lesser offense one of the third degree. <em>L. </em>1992, c. 6, \u00a7 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
