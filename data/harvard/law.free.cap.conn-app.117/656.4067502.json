The resolution of the appeal concerns the interaction between the exclusive remedy of our Workers\u2019 Compensation Act; see General Statutes \u00a7 31-284 (a);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>exception to that exclusivity set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336 (f).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">The following facts are not in dispute. On April 16, 2001, Ludemann was employed as a police officer by the town of Enfield (town) and was directing traffic within the scope of his duties when he was struck and injured by a motorist. Ludemann received workers\u2019 compensation benefits for his injuries and exhausted the coverage of the motorist\u2019s liability insurance. On the date he was injured, Ludemann was an insured under an uninsured-underinsured automobile insurance policy issued to the town by the defendant. The policy provided for arbitration in the event of a dispute between the defendant and an insured for underinsured motorist benefits. The arbitrators were to determine whether Ludemann was barred from receiving underin-sured motorist benefits because, at the time he was injured, he was not <em>occupying </em>his police cruiser for the purposes of \u00a7 38a-336 (f). On November 13, 2007, in a two to one decision, the arbitration panel rendered an award in favor of the defendant. The plaintiffs filed an application in the trial court, asking the court to vacate the award. The court denied the application to vacate, and the plaintiffs appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the court erred by (1) concluding that Ludemann was barred under \u00a7 31-284 (a) from recovering as an insured by virtue of \u00a7 38a-336 (f), (2) failing to find an explicit, well defined and dominant public policy in favor of providing under-insured motorist coverage to an insured regardless of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>whether he was occupying a vehicle, (3) failing to provide underinsured motorist coverage to Ludemann by virtue of his status as a third party beneficiary, (4) finding that Ludemann did not occupy the motor vehicle under \u00a7 38a-336 (f) and (5) concluding that Ennis was not entitled to underinsured motorist coverage for her alleged loss of consortium.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">After examining the record on appeal and carefully considering the briefs and arguments of the parties, we conclude that the judgment of the trial court should be affirmed. <em>See American Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>DelGreco, </em>205 Conn. 178, 191, 530 A.2d 171 (1987) (de novo judicial review of compulsory arbitration award). The court\u2019s thoughtful memorandum of decision is comprehensive and consistent with our applicable statutes and decisional law. See <em>Gomes </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Ins. Co., </em>87 Conn. App. 416, 866 A.2d 704, cert. denied, 273 Conn. 925, 871 A.2d 1031 (2005). We therefore adopt the court\u2019s well reasoned decision. See <em>Ludemann </em>v. <em>Specialty National Ins. Co., </em>51 Conn. Sup. 326, 982 A.2d 659 (2008). No useful purpose would be served by repeating the discussion contained therein. See <em>Sansone </em>v. <em>Nationwide Mutual Fire Ins. Co., </em>62 Conn. App. 526, 528, 771 A.2d 243 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b680-13\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-284 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cAn employer who complies with the requirements of subsection (b) of this section shall not be hable for any action for damages on account of personal injury sustained by an employee arising out of and in the course of his employment ....
