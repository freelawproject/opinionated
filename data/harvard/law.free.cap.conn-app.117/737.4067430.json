He claims that the court improperly dismissed his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. We affirm the judgment of the habeas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>The following facts and procedural history are relevant. The petitioner was convicted after a jury trial of robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4) and sentenced to twelve years incarceration.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The petitioner\u2019s conviction was affirmed on direct appeal. <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>33 Conn. App. 915, 635 A.2d 885 (1993), cert. denied, 228 Conn. 924, 638 A.2d 38 (1994). Thereafter, the petitioner filed this amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus alleging prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel. The petitioner had been represented by attorney John Stawicki at trial and on appeal. He claimed that Stawicki was generally unprepared for trial and made several errors.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He also claimed that Stawicki\u2019s appellate performance was ineffective because Stawicki had failed to raise on appeal the issue of prosecutorial misconduct. The habeas court denied his petition. The court determined that procedural default prevented review of his prosecutorial misconduct claim and found no evidence of prejudice with respect to either of his ineffective assistance of counsel claims. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">The petitioner claims that the court improperly determined that his counsel was effective. More specifically, he asserts that the judgment of the court should be reversed because its determination that his attorney was prepared adequately rested on a misapprehension of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">On the basis of the testimony presented during the habeas hearing, the court found that Stawicki represented the petitioner on all four robbery charges. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>fact, Stawicki provided representation to the petitioner with respect to only the fourth robbery charge, namely, the charge at issue in the present case. He had no connection with the other three trials. The petitioner argues that the court\u2019s misunderstanding of his attorney\u2019s involvement in his three previous robbery prosecutions undermines its conclusion that his attorney performed reasonably. In essence, the petitioner contends that the court\u2019s mistaken belief that Stawicki had represented him on three prior occasions caused it to credit Stawicki with a broader understanding of the petitioner\u2019s case than he actually had and led the court to determine that Stawicki\u2019s trial performance was sufficient. He urges this court to reevaluate the adequacy of his counsel\u2019s performance.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">\u201cA claim of ineffective assistance of counsel consists of two components: a performance prong and a prejudice prong. To satisfy the performance prong . . . the petitioner must demonstrate that his attorney\u2019s representation was not reasonably competent or within the range of competence displayed by lawyers with ordinary training and skill in the criminal law. ... To satisfy the prejudice prong, a claimant must demonstrate that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. . . . The claim will succeed only if both prongs are satisfied.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Mozell </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>291 Conn. 62, 77, 967 A.2d 41 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>(2009). Moreover, when a petitioner is claiming ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, he must establish \u201cthat there is a reasonable probability that but for appellate counsel\u2019s error, the petitioner would have prevailed in his direct appeal.\u201d <em>Charles </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>112 Conn. App. 349, 351, 962 A.2d 868, cert. denied, 290 Conn. 922, 966 A.2d 235 (2009), citing <em>Small </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>286 Conn. 707, 721-24, 946 A.2d 1203, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Small </em>v. <em>Lantz, </em>555 U.S. 975, 129 S. Ct. 481, 172 L. Ed. 2d 336 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">Although the petitioner acknowledges that the court rendered its decision based solely on a finding of no prejudice, he does not challenge that portion of the court\u2019s holding. Because he does not provide any indication that his attorney\u2019s allegedly deficient performance altered the outcome of his criminal trial or his direct appeal, the petitioner\u2019s claim fails under the second prong of <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984) (requiring habeas petitioner to establish both deficient performance by trial counsel and that deficient performance prejudiced defense).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the habeas court and do not address the adequacy of Stawicki\u2019s performance or the court\u2019s findings thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b761-15\"> The habeas court granted certification to appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b762-6\"> At the time of his trial, the petitioner already was serving consecutive sentences totaling sixty-six years on three other robbery charges that involved some of the same witnesses, including the state\u2019s key witness, Dani Carlson.
