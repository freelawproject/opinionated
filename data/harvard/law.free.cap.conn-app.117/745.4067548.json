Korolyshun<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeals from the order of the trial court denying his motion for attorney\u2019s fees. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">On March 19,2003, the defendant was appointed conservator of the estate of Jean Bartolucci, who was a patient at the plaintiff health care facility, Gardner Heights Health Care Center, Inc. Travelers Casualty &amp; Surety Company of America (Travelers) issued a bond to the Probate Court to guarantee the defendant\u2019s performance as a conservator. Subsequently, the plaintiff brought this action against the defendant and Travelers, claiming that the defendant breached his fiduciary duties while acting as Bartolucci\u2019s conservator by, among other things, failing to obtain medicaid benefits for Bartolucci. The plaintiff also alleged that Travelers was liable as surety under the bond. The court rendered judgment in favor of the defendant and Travelers.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">Thereafter, the defendant filed a motion for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 42-150bb, which provides in relevant part that \u201c[wjhenever any contract ... to which a consumer is a party, provides for the attorney\u2019s fee of the commercial party to be paid by the consumer, an attorney\u2019s fee shall be awarded as a matter of law to the consumer who successfully . . . defends an action . . . <em>based upon the contract </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The underlying action here, however, was not such a contract action but was a claim of breach of fiduciary duty, which is a tort claim. See <em>Ahem </em>v. <em>Kappalumakkel, </em>97 Conn. App. 189, 192 n.3, 903 A.2d 266 (2006). Accordingly, because \u00a7 42-150bb is not applicable to the action at hand, the court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b770-10\"> Travelers Casualty &amp; Surety Company of America (Travelers) was also a defendant in this case. Because Travelers is not a party to this appeal, we refer to Korolyshun as the defendant in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
