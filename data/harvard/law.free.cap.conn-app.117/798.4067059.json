The defendant makes several claims on appeal. First, he claims that the court improperly removed from the jury the determination of whether he met the statutory definition of a drug-dependent person. Next, the defendant claims that the court improperly admitted evidence of his prior misconduct. The defendant also claims that the court improperly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>failed to instruct the jury on the doctrine of nonexclusive possession with regard to the pistol or revolver. Next, the defendant claims that there is insufficient evidence to support his conviction of possession of a weapon in a motor vehicle. Last, the defendant claims that the court imposed an improper sentence for his conviction of criminal possession of a pistol or revolver. We affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On the morning of November 28, 2005, Sergeant William Lowe, Detective Mark Lepore and Officer Terrance Blake of the Norwalk police department were assigned to locate and to arrest the defendant pursuant to a warrant for a violation of probation. The three police officers, traveling together in an unmarked police cruiser and dressed in plain clothes, headed to the area surrounding the Colonial Village public housing project\u2014the area they were assigned to search. They were aware that the defendant likely was driving a black Hyundai for which they had the license plate number. The officers drove to a parking area behind a strip mall located at 280 Connecticut Avenue, across the street from Colonial Village. As the officers approached this area, Blake, who was driving, saw a black Hyundai parked perpendicular to a wall. The license plate number matched the one that the officers were given, and Blake parked so that the Hyundai was blocked by the cruiser. Parked next to the Hyundai was a white Nissan Sentra, in which Frank Bruno was seated. The defendant was walking from his vehicle to the Nissan as the officers approached; he was between the two vehicles as the officers exited the cruiser.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">Upon exiting the cruiser, the officers identified themselves, drew their revolvers, ordered the defendant to stop and put his hands up and informed him that he was under arrest. The defendant did not comply and moved toward the wall adjacent to where his car was parked. Lepore walked to one side of the Hyundai while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>Blake walked between the Nissan and the Hyundai in an effort to cut off any means of escape for the defendant. Lowe, who noticed that Bruno was attempting to swallow something that Lowe believed to be packaged cocaine, approached the Nissan and, through the driver\u2019s side window, attempted to stop Bruno from swallowing the contraband by grasping him by the jaw. As Lowe confronted Bruno, Lepore and Blake attempted to place the defendant under arrest and to handcuff him. The defendant became verbally abusive and resisted their efforts to handcuff him by kicking and elbowing the officers, tensing his arms, thrashing his body and limbs about and wrestling with the officers. During this struggle, Lepore, in an effort to gain control of the defendant, punched him multiple times on the back and upper arms. This had no discernible effect because the defendant continued to resist the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">At one point during the struggle with the defendant, Blake released his grip on him and retrieved a Taser gun from Lepore\u2019s utility belt. Blake warned the defendant twice that if he did not stop resisting, he would be immobilized with the Taser gun. When the defendant did not comply, Blake shot him with the Taser gun in the back after which the defendant fell to the ground and was handcuffed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Soon after the defendant was subdued, Blake searched him and retrieved from his left front pants pocket a plastic bag containing twelve bags of a white powdery substance. Subsequent chemical testing conducted by Lepore and then by Rafal Miel-guj, a department of public safety chemist, confirmed that the substance was cocaine. Mielguj determined that the cocaine seized from the defendant weighed approximately seventeen grams and was divided into the twelve bags in amounts varying from about one third of a gram to more than five grams.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>During the struggle with the defendant, Lepore radioed for backup assistance. Greg Scully, a Norwalk police officer, responded to Lepore\u2019s call. Upon arriving at the scene, Scully saw a man later identified as Sean Sullivan, the defendant\u2019s cousin, who was carrying a small gray plastic bag, run from the area. Previously, Sullivan had been seated in the Hyundai during the officers\u2019 interactions with the defendant and Bruno. As the defendant was being handcuffed, Sullivan exited the Hyundai and ran away. Scully pursued Sullivan in his vehicle. At no time prior did Lowe, Lepore or Blake observe Sullivan in the Hyundai. Soon after he started pursuing Sullivan, Scully exited his vehicle and continued to pursue him on foot. Scully then tackled and subdued Sullivan. Scully found a loaded nine millimeter Tech-9 handgun along with an instruction manual for the weapon inside the gray plastic bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">The jury subsequently found the defendant guilty of criminal possession of a pistol or revolver, possession of a weapon in a motor vehicle, possession of narcotics with intent to sell by a person who is not drug-dependent and possession of narcotics with intent to sell within 1500 feet of a public housing project. The court imposed a total effective sentence of fifteen years incarceration. This appeal followed. Further facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">The defendant first claims that the court improperly removed from the jury the determination of whether he met the statutory definition of a drug-dependent person.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As a result, the defendant contends, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>denied the defendant his constitutional rights to present a defense and to have issues of fact decided by a jury. The defendant asserts, therefore, that his conviction of both possession of narcotics with intent to sell by a person who is not drug-dependent and possession of narcotics with intent to sell within 1500 feet of a public housing project should be reversed and remanded for a new trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">The state concedes that the court improperly removed from the jury the determination of whether the defendant met the statutory definition of a drug-dependent person. The state, however, argues that the remedy sought by the defendant is inappropriate. The state contends that this court should reverse the defendant\u2019s conviction of possession of narcotics with intent to sell by a person who is not drug-dependent only and remand the case with direction to modify that conviction to reflect the lesser included offense of sale of narcotics in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-277 (a). We disagree with both parties and reverse only the conviction of possession of narcotics with intent to sell by a person who is not drug-dependent and remand the case for a new trial on that charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">Our Supreme Court has stated that a \u201ctrial court should instruct the jury concerning the issue of drug dependency and [a] defendant\u2019s burden of proof if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>determines that there is any foundation in the evidence, no matter how weak or incredible . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>221 Conn. 595, 613, 605 A.2d 1366 (1992). Here, the defendant presented evidence of drug dependency. First, the defendant testified that he smoked marijuana on a daily basis and used phencyclidine, otherwise known as PCP, on a weekly basis. The defendant also presented as a full exhibit a discharge summary from his stay at Norwalk Hospital subsequent to his arrest. That summary stated that the defendant had a \u201c[hjistory of daily marijuana use and weekly PCP use.\u201d It also stated that a urinalysis showed a positive result for the presence of marijuana and PCP. The defendant\u2019s grandmother also testified that she had been aware of his marijuana use and had once seen him under the influence of drugs. The defendant also called as a witness Edward Conway, a probation officer personally familiar with the defendant and his probation file. Conway testified that the defendant had submitted to a urinalysis as a part of his conditions of probation. He testified that it was positive for drug use. Conway also testified that as a result of that positive test, the office of adult probation referred the defendant for substance abuse treatment at Connecticut Renaissance. Last, Conway testified that one of the reasons that the violation of probation warrant was issued was that the defendant tested positive for drug use and was non-compliant with substance abuse treatment. Furthermore, Bruno and Jourden Huertas, the defendant\u2019s brother, also testified that the defendant regularly used marijuana and PCP.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">During the testimony of James Gadzik, a trauma surgeon who treated the defendant while he was an inpatient at Norwalk Hospital, the defendant attempted to admit into evidence a psychological assessment performed by Sheila Devlin-Craane, a nurse practitioner of psychiatry. That assessment was ordered as a result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>of the defendant\u2019s having tested positive for drug use after his admission to Norwalk Hospital and was part of his hospital records. Devlin-Craane\u2019s assessment indicated that the defendant was dependent on PCP and abused marijuana. The court, however, sustained the state\u2019s objection to its admission and, outside the presence of the jury, stated: \u201cUnder our law currently, as I understand it, for the purpose of proving that the defendant is drug-dependent . . . you must present evidence from a mental health professional trained in the application of the diagnostic criteria using [the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM-IV)] with respect to the satisfaction of the criteria for drug dependency.\u201d The court observed that the assessment likely was based on the defendant\u2019s representations regarding his drug use rather than the criteria set out in the DSM-IV and stated that \u201cwhether that makes him . . . dependent or not requires an expert.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">The court, furthermore, in its charge to the jury, stated: \u201cThe defendant has the burden of proving drug dependency by a preponderance of the evidence. Proof by a preponderance of the evidence means considering all the evidence fairly and impartially, enough evidence to produce in your minds a reasonable belief that what is sought to be proven is more likely true than not. . . . I had indicated earlier to the defendant that he had not even presented any evidence under this special defense. And I would have ordinarily ruled that there was no issue on that question, and you may presume that the state does not have to prove he was [not] drug-dependent; you can rely on the assumption. But, because he did introduce some evidence, I am now indicating that whatever evidence [he] did introduce does not meet that standard. <em>The state does not have to prove as a matter of fact that the defendant was drug-dependent; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number><em>the state may rely on the presumption that he wasn\u2019t drug-dependent. \u201d</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis added.) We conclude that the court did improperly remove from the jury the determination of whether the defendant met the statutory definition of a drug-dependent person.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">Although we conclude that the court improperly removed from the jury the determination of whether the defendant met the statutory definition of a drug-dependent person, we must now determine the appropriate remedy. The state argues that it is entitled to a modification of the judgment to reflect a conviction of the lesser included offense of sale of narcotics.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanseverino, </em>291 Conn. 574, 590-98, 969 A.2d 710 (2009) (en banc),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a case in which the issue of whether, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>and if so, under what circumstances, an appellate court of this state may order the modification of a judgment to reflect a conviction of a lesser included offense, is instructive to our resolution of the state\u2019s claim. In <em>Sanseverino, </em>the defendant, after a jury trial, had been convicted of, inter alia, kidnapping in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2) (A). The state, in its motion for reconsideration, argued, among other things, that it was entitled either to retry the defendant for kidnapping or a judgment of conviction of unlawful restraint in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-96, as a lesser offense included within kidnapping in the first degree. <em>State </em>v. <em>Sansever-ino, </em>supra, 579. Our Supreme Court agreed with the state that it was entitled either to retry the defendant or to a modification of the judgment. Id. In doing so, however, the court stated that it \u201cdisagreefd] with the state that the broad issue presented by the state\u2019s . . . claim [of] whether, and if so, when, an appellate court may order the modification of a judgment in the manner requested in the present case, is settled in this state.\u201d Id., 593.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">Our Supreme Court explained that \u201c[i]ndeed, this court never has addressed [that] issue directly. Moreover, there is a distinct split of authority on [that] question among both state and federal courts. Some courts have held that it is appropriate for an appellate court to order the modification of a judgment to reflect a conviction of a lesser included offense, even in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>absence of a jury instruction on that lesser offense, when it is not unfair to the defendant to do so. . . . Other courts have barred such a modification unless the jury has been instructed on the lesser included offense.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 593-94. The court concluded that under the \u201cunique circumstances\u201d in <em>Sanseverino, </em>the state was entitled to the modification of the judgment that it sought. Id., 595. The court reached that conclusion for four express reasons, \u201ceach of which [was] integral to [its] decision.\u201d Id. First, there was no reason for the court to believe that the state opted against seeking a jury instruction on the lesser included offense for strategic purposes.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Second, the defendant had benefited from the intervening change in the law that resulted from the court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Salamon, </em>287 Conn. 509, 949 A.2d 1092 (2008). Third, the defendant did not file an objection to the state\u2019s request for modification. Finally, the court concluded that it was not unfair to the defendant to impose a conviction of the lesser included offense. <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanseverino, </em>supra, 291 Conn. 595. The court emphasized that \u201cit intimate[d] no view as to whether the state would be entitled to such a modification <em>in the absence of any one of the factors that are present in [that] case.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., 596 n.18. It further referenced \u201cthe fact that [it] limitfed] [its] holding to the particular facts and procedural history of [that] case, and that [it] decline [d] to decide the broader issue presented, namely, under what particular circumstances is it appropriate for an appellate court to require the conviction of a lesser included offense upon reversal of a conviction of the greater offense.\u201d Id., 597 n.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>In the defendant\u2019s appeal, each of the factors detailed in <em>Sanseverino </em>are not present. First, we consider the factor that there ought to be no reason for this court to believe that the state opted against seeking a jury instruction on the lesser included offense for strategic purposes. See id., 595. We conclude, much as our Supreme Court concluded in <em>Sanseverino, </em>that there was <em>no </em>purpose for the state to seek an instruction on the lesser included offense, and, therefore, a fortiori, there could not have been a <em>strategic </em>purpose. This is so for several reasons. The state was aware that the court considered, wrongly, that an expert witness was required to establish the defendant\u2019s drug dependence. The state participated in the argument involving the defendant\u2019s attempt to admit into evidence Devlin-Craane\u2019s assessment. Therefore, the state knew of the court\u2019s ruling concerning the issue of the defendant\u2019s evidence of drug dependency before the court charged the jury and, therefore, had no reason to seek an instruction on the lesser included offense. Supporting this conclusion is the fact that in its charge to the jury, the court stated that it \u201chad indicated earlier to the defendant that he had not even presented any evidence under this special defense.\u201d This indicates that the state also was aware, prior to the court\u2019s instructing the jury, that the defendant had not met his burden of producing evidence, in the court\u2019s opinion, of his drug dependence, sufficient to require that the court give such an instruction to the jury and that the court would allow the state to rely on the presumption that the defendant was not drug-dependent. Although we conclude that the state had no reason to seek an instruction on the lesser included offense, and, consequently, the state\u2019s failure to do so was not possibly the product of a strategic decision, we conclude that under the circumstances present here, that factor cannot weigh in favor of the state. This is so, in large part, because that circumstance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>clearly was predicated on the court\u2019s error and not on an unforeseeable, intervening change in the law, as was the case in <em>Sanseverino.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">We also conclude that the remaining factors detailed in <em>Sanseverino </em>do not favor the state\u2019s position. There was no intervening change in the law that inured to the benefit of the defendant; the defendant objects to the modification of his conviction; and we cannot conclude, on the basis of the record before us, that it would be fair to modify the judgment to reflect the lesser included offense. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanseverino, </em>supra, 291 Conn. 595.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The unusual circumstances of this case lead us <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>to conclude that it is inappropriate for this court to order a modification of the judgment to reflect a conviction of the lesser included offense of sale of narcotics. Accordingly, we reverse the conviction of possession of narcotics with intent to sell by a person who is not drug-dependent and remand the case for a new trial on that charge.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly admitted evidence of his prior misconduct. Specifically, the defendant contends that the court abused its discretion in admitting testimony concerning various shootings that occurred prior to his arrest because the incidents were not material to the issue of whether he had knowledge of the gun having been in his car. The defendant further argues that the prejudicial nature of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>the evidence outweighed its probative value. The state contends that the evidence at issue in this claim was not objected to on the same grounds asserted on appeal, and, therefore, the claim is not reviewable by this court. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">The defendant claims that the court abused its discretion in admitting testimony concerning various shootings that occurred prior to his arrest.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Our standard of review of a claim that a court improperly admitted evidence is well established. \u201cThe trial court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of evidence is entitled to great deference. . . . [T]he trial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility ... of evidence . . . [and its] ruling on evidentiary matters will be overturned only upon a showing of a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. . . . We will make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling, and only upset it for a manifest abuse of discretion. . . . Moreover, evidentiary rulings will be overturned on appeal only where there was an abuse of discretion and a showing by the defendant of substantial prejudice or injustice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>272 Conn. 106, 180, 864 A.2d 666 (2004), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 848, 126 S. Ct. 102, 163 L. Ed. 2d 116 (2005). \u201cOur review [however] of evidentiary rulings made by the trial court is limited to the specific legal ground raised in the objection. Practice Book [\u00a7\u00a7 60-5 and 5-5]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Rothenberg, </em>195 Conn. 253, 262, 487 A.2d 545 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Braman, </em>191 Conn. 670, 684-85, 469 A.2d 760 (1983). The reason for this rule is clear: it is to alert the trial court to an error while there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>time to correct it; <em>State </em>v. <em>Rothenberg, </em>supra, 263; <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>193 Conn. 70, 88, 475 A.2d 1087 (1984); and to give the opposing party an opportunity to argue against the objection at trial. To permit a party to raise a different ground on appeal than was raised during trial would amount to \u2018trial by ambuscade,\u2019 unfair both to the trial court and to the opposing party. <em>State </em>v. <em>Brice, </em>186 Conn. 449, 457, 442 A.2d 906 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>DeGennaro, </em>147 Conn. 296, 304, 160 A.2d 480, cert. denied, 364 U.S. 873, 81 S. Ct. 116, 5 L. Ed. 2d 95 (1960).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Baptiste, </em>114 Conn. App. 750, 769, 970 A.2d 816 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">During his cross-examination of Sullivan, the prosecutor read into the record portions of Sullivan\u2019s written statement made to police after his arrest. Those portions read into the record concerned a November 27, 2005 shooting at the Carlton Court public housing project. See footnote 10 of this opinion. The defendant argues on appeal that he objected to the prosecutor\u2019s reading into the record Sullivan\u2019s statement and Huer-tas\u2019 testimony concerning two shooting incidents on the ground that they were evidence of prior misconduct that was inadmissible to prove the defendant\u2019s bad character or criminal tendencies and that their limited probative value was far outweighed by their prejudicial effects. Our review of the trial transcripts clearly establishes that the legal grounds raised by the defendant in both his objections to the prosecutor\u2019s reading into the record Sullivan\u2019s written statement and Huertas\u2019 testimony were not that the evidence concerned inadmissible prior misconduct. As for Sullivan\u2019s statement, the defendant objected because the prosecutor was reading into the record a statement that was not admitted as evidence at that point. Concerning Huertas\u2019 testimony, the defendant objected when the prosecutor asked Huertas if two named individuals were with him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>during a November 27, 2005 shooting on Westport Avenue in Norwalk. See footnote 10 of this opinion. The defendant expressly stated that the bases for the objection were relevance and that the question was beyond the scope of direct examination, and the state withdrew that question. Because our review of the court\u2019s rulings on those objections is limited to the specific legal grounds raised in the objection; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Baptiste, </em>supra, 114 Conn. App. 769; and inasmuch as the defendant did not object on the grounds that the proffered evidence was inadmissible prior misconduct, we will not review these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly failed to instruct the jury on the doctrine of nonexclusive possession with regard to the pistol or revolver. As a result of this failure, he argues, it is reasonably possible that the jury was misled and thereby impermis-sibly inferred that he constructively possessed the pistol or revolver solely because he was present in the automobile. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">The defendant failed either to request a charge on nonexclusive possession or to object to the instruction as given.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> That circumstance renders his claim unpreserved. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>115 Conn. App. 556, 562, 973 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>A.2d 138, cert. denied, 293 Conn. 912, 978 A.2d 1110 (2009); Practice Book \u00a7 42-16. He therefore seeks to prevail pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). The record is adequate for review, and the claim is of constitutional magnitude, alleging the violation of a fundamental right. \u201c[I]tis . . . constitutionally axiomatic that the jury be instructed on the essential elements of a crime charged. . . . Consequently, the failure to instruct a jury on an element of a crime deprives a defendant of the right to have the jury told what crimes he is actually being tried for and what the essential elements of those crimes are.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>111 Conn. App. 337, 350, 958 A.2d 1271 (2008), cert. denied, 290 Conn. 903, 962 A.2d 794 (2009). The defendant, however, has not demonstrated that a constitutional violation clearly exists and that he was clearly deprived of a fair trial. We therefore conclude that his claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">Our standard of review with regard to claims of instructional error is well established. \u201c[I]ndividual jury instructions should not be judged in artificial isolation, but must be viewed in the context of the overall charge. . . . The pertinent test is whether the charge, read in its entirety, fairly presents the case to the jury in such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>a way that injustice is not done to either party under the established rules of law. . . . Thus, [t]he whole charge must be considered from the standpoint of its effect on the [jurors] in guiding them to the proper verdict . . . and not critically dissected in a microscopic search for possible error. . . . Where . . . the challenged jury instructions involve a constitutional right, the applicable standard of review is whether there is a reasonable possibility that the jury was misled in reaching its verdict.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>supra, 115 Conn. App. 562-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">The defendant does not argue that the court improperly instructed the jury with regard to the elements of the crime of criminal possession of a pistol or revolver. Instead, he contends that, under the facts and circumstances of this case, the court, sua sponte, should have instructed the jury on the doctrine of nonexclusive possession.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We conclude, following a thorough review of the entire jury charge, in light of the evidence presented at trial, that the court properly instructed the jury on the elements of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">The jury reasonably could not have been misled by the court\u2019s charge in the manner asserted by the defendant. The court clearly instructed the jury that to find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>that the defendant had constructive possession of the pistol or revolver it would have to determine that he had knowledge of the nature of the weapon, of its presence within the vehicle and was in a position to exercise dominion and control over the weapon. Importantly, the court instructed the jury not only that the defendant had to have such knowledge, but also that he must have acted intentionally. In another portion of the jury instruction, the court explained fully the definition of intent. \u201c[Focusing] on [a] defendant\u2019s knowledge and control and intentional action with regard to [a] firearm [in a jury instruction] properly direct[s] the jury and preclude [s] it from considering that the mere presence of the defendant was enough to satisfy the elements of the crime.\u201d Id., 564. As a result, the given instruction, though not explicitly addressing nonexclusive possession, nonetheless covered the most important protective elements of a charge on the doctrine: the defendant\u2019s knowledge and intent to possess the weapon. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>258 Conn. 1, 12, 778 A.2d 186 (2001) (to establish possession of firearm for conviction under \u00a7 53a-217 by constructive possession, state required to prove beyond reasonable doubt defendant exercised intentional dominion and control over firearm and had knowledge of its character).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">Last, this is not a case in which the court declined a requested instruction; the defendant made no request of the court to charge the jury on the doctrine of nonexclusive possession. A defendant\u2019s right to due process is implicated by a court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on the essential elements of the crime charged. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cote, </em>286 Conn. 603, 626, 945 A.2d 412 (2008). \u201cA trial court [however] has no independent obligation to instruct, sua sponte, on general principles of law relevant to all issues raised in evidence .... Rather, it is the responsibility of the parties to help the court in fashioning an appropriate charge.\u201d (Citation omitted; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Arena, 235 </em>Conn. 67, 75, 663 A.2d 972 (1995); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Crawley, </em>93 Conn.

We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>In <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>9 Conn. App. 330, 338, 518 A.2d 956 (1986), we noted that the lack of a proper permit is an essential element for a violation of \u00a7 29-38 that the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt. At trial, the defendant stipulated that he had no permit for the weapon. The state, however, pursuant to \u00a7 29-38 must also prove that <em>no one </em>else in the vehicle had a proper permit to carry the weapon. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Mebane, </em>17 Conn. App. 243, 246, 551 A.2d 1268, cert. denied, 210 Conn. 811, 556 A.2d 609, cert. denied, 492 U.S. 919, 109 S. Ct. 3245, 106 L. Ed. 2d 591 (1989). The defendant asserts on appeal that the only evidence that Sullivan, the co-occupant of the vehicle, did not have a proper permit for the weapon was Sullivan\u2019s testimony that he had pleaded guilty to carrying a pistol or revolver without a permit in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 29-35. The defendant argues that, because of hearsay concerns, \u201c[t]he fact that one or more persons jointly charged with the commission of a crime pleaded guilty is not admissible on the trial of another person so charged, to establish that the crime was committed.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Pikul, </em>150 Conn. 195, 198, 187 A.2d 442 (1962). We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">The facts present in this appeal are distinguishable from those in <em>Pikul, </em>and, therefore, its holding is inapplicable here. Sullivan testified at the defendant\u2019s trial that he had pleaded guilty to carrying a pistol or revolver without a permit while the defendant was convicted of possession of a weapon in a motor vehicle. Simply put, this is not the situation where one or more persons were charged with the commission of a crime. Sullivan and the defendant were charged with the commission of two distinct crimes that merely had the overlapping element of proof that no one charged, or present in the vehicle, had a proper permit for the weapon.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Sullivan\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820A\">*820A</page-number>testimony only related to his admission that he had pleaded guilty to a separate charge and was not hearsay evidence concerning the defendant\u2019s guilt. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>280 Conn. 686, 704 n.13, 911 A.2d 1055 (2006) (\u201ca plea of guilty is, in effect, merely a confession of guilt which, <em>having been made by one of those charged with the crime, </em>can be no more than hearsay as to <em>another who is so </em>charged\u201d [emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted]); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Gargano, </em>99 Conn. 103, 108, 121 A. 657 (1923) (\u201c[t]he confession involved in a plea of guilty in court by one [jointly charged with the accused of] a crime, is as much hearsay as if the confession were made out of court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\">The defendant also asserts that the evidence was admitted for impeachment purposes only and therefore could not properly have been used by the jury for the substantive purpose of proving that Sullivan did not have apermit for the weapon. The defendant mischaracterizes the nature of the testimony. Sullivan was a defense witness. Although a party may impeach his own witness in the same manner as an opposing party\u2019s witness; <em>State </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>105 Conn. App. 596, 613, 939 A.2d 1195, cert. denied, 286 Conn. 913, 944 A.2d 983 (2008); our review of the transcripts clearly establishes that the puipose of Sullivan\u2019s testimony regarding his guilty plea was to establish that the defendant did not possess nor was aware of the presence of the weapon in the vehicle. In short, it was offered to substantively establish that Sullivan was the owner of the gun. Because a guilty plea is \u201ca confession which admits that the accused did various acts\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>State </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>221 Conn. App. 635, 641, 605 A.2d 1381 (1992); and the testimony was offered as proof that Sullivan engaged in those acts and not to impeach him, it was properly before the jury as proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820B\">*820B</page-number>that he had no proper permit for the weapon. Therefore, this claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">Last, the defendant claims that the court imposed an improper sentence for his conviction for criminal possession of a pistol or revolver. Specifically, he contends that the court mistakenly imposed a sentence of five years incarceration, two of which were mandatory, for his conviction of criminal possession of a pistol or revolver pursuant to \u00a7 53a-217c (a) (1), which has no minimum mandatory sentence.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The state concedes, and we agree, that the court erred in its sentencing of the defendant for his conviction of criminal possession of a pistol or revolver. Because it is axiomatic that this court is vested with the authority to remand a case for resentencing; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Hanson, </em>210 Conn. 519, 556 A.2d 1007 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>19 Conn. App. 48, 562 A.2d 35, cert. denied, 213 Conn. 804, 567 A.2d 834 (1989); the appropriate remedy for this claim is a remand to the trial court with direction to resentence the defendant. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Dennis, </em>30 Conn. App. 416, 426, 621 A.2d 292, cert. denied, 226 Conn. 901, 625 A.2d 1376 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">The judgment is reversed as to the conviction of possession of narcotics with intent to sell by a person who is not drug-dependent and the case is remanded for a new trial on that charge only; the judgment is reversed as to the sentence imposed on the conviction of criminal possession of a pistol or revolver and the case is remanded with direction to resentence the defendant on that charge only.

We also held that the state was barred from retrying the defendant on the kidnapping charge because we concluded, on the basis of our review of the record, that no reasonable jury could have found that the restraint used by the defendant in the commission of the kidnapping was not incidental to and necessary for the commission of the sexual assault.

In <em>Ray, </em>the defendant appealed from the judgments of conviction, rendered after a trial to the court, of sale of narcotics by a person who is not drug-dependent in violation of \u00a7 21a-278 (b), claiming, inter alia, that the court improperly found that he had not met his burden of proving his drug dependency. Id., 605-606. In <em>Ray, </em>the trial court concluded that the defendant had not presented sufficient evidence of drug dependency to present the issue to the fact finder. Id., 607. As a result, our Supreme Court concluded, \u201cthe trial court, applied an improper evidentiary standard in determining whether the defendant was drug-dependent, as defined in \u00a7 21a-240 (18).\u201d Id., 633.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">The court noted that \u201c[ajlthough this conclusion ordinarily would require a remand to <em>the </em>trial court so that the court may apply the correct standard, we conclude that, on the basis of the evidence presented, no reasonable fact finder could conclude that the defendant was not drug-dependent .... Accordingly, we conclude that, as a matter of law, the defendant met his burden of proving that he was a drug-dependent person under \u00a7 21a-278 (b).\u201d Id., 633-34. The court reversed the convictions under \u00a7 21a-278 and remanded the case to the trial court with direction to modify those convictions to reflect the lesser included offense of sale of narcotics in violation of \u00a7 21a-277 (a) and for resentencing. Id., 634. It is clear that the court made its decision to reverse the defendant\u2019s convictions with direction to modify the judgments to reflect the lesser included offense \u201c [b] ecause [it] concluded that the trial court improperly found that the defendant was not drug-dependent\u201d; id.; and that he had met that burden as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">In the present case, we cannot conclude, on the basis of the evidence, that the defendant met his burden of proving that he was a drug-dependent person under \u00a7 21a-278 (b) as a matter of law. This conclusion, however, is pre.dicated on the exclusion from evidence of the clinical assessment prepared by Devlin-Craane, in which she diagnosed him as dependent on PCP, the defendant\u2019s most compelling evidence of his alleged drug depen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>dency. As a result, we determine that the result reached in <em>Ray </em>should not be replicated here. This conclusion is supported by the fact that the defendant in <em>Ray </em>also met at least one of the factors announced by our Supreme Court in <em>Sanseverino </em>that is not present here. The defendant in <em>Ray </em>specifically sought modification of his convictions to reflect the lesser included offense\u2014a circumstance absent in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b836-13\"> The defendant also argues that his conviction of possession of narcotics with intent to sell within 1500 feet of a public housing project should also be reversed as a result of the court improperly removing from the jury the determination of whether he was drug-dependent. This claim has no merit. General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278a (b) is bereft of any reference to drug dependency as a mitigating factor of the crime it prohibits. Moreover, the defendant\u2019s claim that his conviction under \u00a7 21a-278a (b) requires a predicate conviction under, in this case, \u00a7 21a-278 is also without merit. This is so because \u201c[i]n <em>State </em>v. <em>Player, </em>58 Conn.
