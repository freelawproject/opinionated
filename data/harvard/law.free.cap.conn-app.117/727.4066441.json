J.</author>\n<p id=\"a0s-dedup-0\">Traditionally, our law has required that a person be in custody in order to make a habeas challenge to his criminal sentence. In <em>Garlotte </em>v. <em>Fordice, </em>515 U.S. 39, 41, 115 S. Ct. 1948, 132 L. Ed. 2d 36 (1995), the United States Supreme Court upheld a habeas petitioner\u2019s right to challenge a conviction on the first expired sentence in a series of consecutive sentences because the expired sentence persisted to postpone the petitioner\u2019s eligibility for parole. In the case before us, the petitioner, Kaniyn Parker, appeals following the habeas court\u2019s denial of his petition for certification to appeal from the court\u2019s judgment dismissing his petition for a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that the court did not have jurisdiction over the petition. He seeks to extend <em>Garlotte </em>to permit his attack on a sentence from which he was released from custody on April 7, 2001, because it has been used to enhance the sentence for a Florida conviction in the United States District Court for which he received a sentence of 262 months incarceration. We decline to extend <em>Garlotte </em>that far and dismiss the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-10\">We first observe that the habeas court denied certification to appeal because the certification request was untimely. We note that the court\u2019s decision dismissing the petitioner\u2019s habeas petition was rendered on August <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>8, 2008, and that the clerk gave notice of it to the petitioner on the same day. However, the petitioner did not file with the clerk his petition for certification to appeal until September 18, 2008. Our statutes and rules of practice require that any petition for certification to appeal must be filed with the judge who decided the case within ten days of issuance of the decision sought to be reviewed. General Statutes \u00a7 52-470 (b); Practice Book \u00a7 80-1. No extension of that time period was sought, nor was any extension granted by the habeas judge. The request therefore was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">We nonetheless address the merit of the petitioner\u2019s argument, which was briefed by both the petitioner and the respondent, the commissioner of correction, namely, whether the habeas court properly dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction. Our standard of review is plenary when examining whether jurisdiction exists. <em>Lebron </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>274 Conn. 507, 512, 876 A.2d 1178 (2005). In conducting that plenary review, we assume that the facts pleaded in the petitioner\u2019s complaint are true and construe the allegations most favorably to the petitioner. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">We first point out that the petitioner concedes that his federal sentence is not consecutive to the state sentence he now seeks to challenge. His state sentence had expired approximately three years before his Florida federal sentence was imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-466 (a) (1) and (2) and 52-466 (b) make it clear that habeas relief is limited to persons \u201cillegally confined\u201d or \u201cdeprived of . . . liberty . . . .\u201d We agree with the petitioner that our case law has been consistent that a habeas petitioner does not remain in custody merely because that conviction was used to enhance a subsequent sentence. <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>274 Conn. 557, 562-63, 877 A.2d 758 (2005); <em>Lebron </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>supra, 274 Conn. 530. We reject the petitioner\u2019s suggestion that, because <em>Garlotte </em>held that a defendant satisfied the \u201cin custody\u201d requirement for an expired sentence if the petitioner still were serving a consecutive sentence, the holding should be extended to nonconsecutive enhanced sentences that the petitioner is serving for the commission of a later unrelated crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">The <em>Garlotte </em>court was interpreting the federal habeas statute; see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (a) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (c) (1) through (5); not our state habeas statute. The rationale for the <em>Garlotte </em>ruling was that consecutive sentences were a \u201ccontinuous stream\u201d and that, therefore, a petitioner remains \u201cin custody\u201d until all of his sentences are served. <em>Garlotte </em>v. <em>Fordice, </em>supra, 515 U.S. 41. That rationale is inapplicable to a habeas petition addressing a nonconsecutive sentence that had been completely served when an enhanced federal sentence was imposed three years after the petitioner\u2019s first sentence expired. In short, there is nothing continuous about a second sentence that does not immediately follow a first.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">In fact, <em>Garlotte </em>distinguished the consecutive sentence scenario from the sentence enhancements of the kind that the petitioner argues habeas jurisdiction should include. The Supreme Court reaffirmed the rationale of its prior holding in <em>Maleng </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>490 U.S. 488, 109 S. Ct. 1923, 104 L. Ed. 2d 540 (1989) (per curiam). The <em>Garlotte </em>court said: \u201cThe question presented in <em>Maleng </em>was whether a habeas petitioner remains \u2018in custody\u2019 under a conviction after the sentence imposed for it has fully expired, merely because of the possibility that the prior conviction will be used to enhance the sentences imposed for any subsequent crimes of which he is convicted. <em>[Maleng </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>supra, 492]. We held that the potential use of a conviction to enhance a sentence for subsequent offenses did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>suffice to render a person \u2018in custody\u2019 within the meaning of the habeas statute. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\"><em>\u201cMaleng </em>recognized that we had very liberally construed the \u2018in custody\u2019 requirement for purposes of federal habeas, but stressed that the Court had never extended it to the situation where a habeas petitioner suffers no present restraint from a conviction. . . . Almost all States have habitual offender statutes, and many States provide . . . for specific enhancement of subsequent sentences on the basis of prior convictions . . . hence, the construction of \u2018in custody\u2019 urged by the habeas petitioner in <em>Maleng </em>would have left nearly all convictions perpetually open to collateral attack. The <em>Maleng </em>petitioner\u2019s interpretation, we therefore commented, would read the \u2018in custody\u2019 requirement out of the statute.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Garlotte </em>v. <em>Fordice, </em>supra, 515 U.S. 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">We decline to read the \u201cin custody\u201d requirement out of our statute when the sentence challenged is not consecutive to a later imposed sentence simply because the commission of the first challenged offense has been used to enhance a sentence imposed for commission of a later crime. Such a course would sap the finality of many criminal judgments and is inconsistent with our precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">We review a habeas court\u2019s denial of a petition for certification to appeal from the judgment of the court for an abuse of discretion. <em>Crespo </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>292 Conn. 804, 811, 975 A.2d 42 (2009). We conclude that the habeas court did not abuse its discretion by denying certification to appeal. The petition for certification to appeal from the habeas court\u2019s judgment was untimely. The jurisdictional issues the petitioner raises are not debatable among jurists of reason, nor has the petitioner shown that a court could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>resolve the issues in a different manner, and the questions are inadequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
