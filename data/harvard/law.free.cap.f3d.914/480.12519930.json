The district court dismissed his claim, concluding that \u00a7 4(a)(2) of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act did not authorize job applicants like Kleber to bring a disparate impact claim against a prospective employer. A divided panel of this court reversed. We granted\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   review and, affirming the district court, now hold that the plain language of \u00a7 4(a)(2) makes clear that Congress, while protecting employees from disparate impact age discrimination, did not extend that same protection to outside job applicants. While our conclusion is grounded in \u00a7 4(a)(2)'s plain language, it is reinforced by the ADEA's broader structure and history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In March 2014, Kleber, an attorney, applied for a senior in-house position in CareFusion's law department. The job description required applicants to have \"3 to 7 years (no more than 7 years) of relevant\n   legal experience.\" Kleber was 58 at the time he applied and had more than seven years of pertinent experience. CareFusion passed over Kleber and instead hired a 29-year-old applicant who met but did not exceed the prescribed experience requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Kleber responded by bringing this action and pursuing claims for both disparate treatment and disparate impact under \u00a7 4(a)(1) and \u00a7 4(a)(2) of the ADEA. Relying on our prior decision in\n   <em>\n    EEOC v. Francis W. Parker School\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7411710\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/41/1073/\">\n    41 F.3d 1073\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 1994), the district court granted CareFusion's motion to dismiss Kleber's disparate impact claim, reasoning that the text of \u00a7 4(a)(2) did not extend to outside job applicants. Kleber then voluntarily dismissed his separate claim for disparate treatment liability under \u00a7 4(a)(1). This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We begin with the plain language of \u00a7 4(a)(2). \"If the statutory language is plain, we must enforce it according to its terms.\"\n   <em>\n    King v.

The prohibited conduct entails an employer acting in any way to limit, segregate, or classify its employees based on age. The language of \u00a7 4(a)(2) then goes on to make clear that its proscriptions apply only if an employer's actions have a particular impact-\"depriv[ing] or tend[ing] to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect[ing] his status as an employee.\" This language plainly demonstrates that the requisite impact must befall an individual with \"status as an employee.\" Put most simply, the reach of \u00a7 4(a)(2) does not extend to applicants for employment, as common dictionary definitions confirm that an applicant has no \"status as an employee.\" See Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 60, 408 (11th ed. 2003) (defining \"applicant\" as \"one who applies,\" including, for example, \"a job [applicant],\" while defining \"employee\" as \"one employed by another usu[ally] for wages or salary and in a position below the executive level\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Subjecting the language of \u00a7 4(a)(2) to even closer scrutiny reinforces our conclusion. Congress did not prohibit just conduct that \"would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities.\" It went further. Section 4(a)(2) employs a catchall formulation-\"or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee\"-to extend the proscribed conduct. Congress's word choice is significant and has a unifying effect: the use of \"or otherwise\" serves to stitch the prohibitions and scope of \u00a7 4(a)(2) into a whole, first by making clear that the proscribed acts cover all conduct \"otherwise affect[ing] his status as an employee,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   and, second, by limiting the reach of the statutory protection to an individual with \"status as an employee.\" See\n   <em>\n    Villarreal v.

Reynolds Tobacco Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12177029\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/839/958/#p964\">\n    839 F.3d 958\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 964 (11th Cir. 2016) (\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   ) (interpreting \u00a7 4(a)(2) the same way and explaining that the \"or otherwise\" language \"operates as a catchall: the specific items that precede it are\n   <em>\n    meant\n   </em>\n   to be subsumed by what comes after the 'or otherwise' \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Kleber begs to differ, arguing that \u00a7 4(a)(2)'s coverage extends beyond employees to applicants for employment. He gets there by focusing on the language in the middle of \u00a7 4(a)(2)-\"deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities\"-and contends that the use of the expansive term \"any individual\" shows that Congress wished to cover outside job applicants. If the only question were whether a job applicant counts as \"any individual,\" Kleber would be right. But time and again the Supreme Court has instructed that statutory interpretation requires reading a text as a whole, and here that requires that we refrain from isolating two words when the language surrounding those two words supplies essential meaning and resolves the question before us.

The clear takeaway is that a covered individual must be an employee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Our conclusion becomes ironclad the moment we look beyond \u00a7 4(a)(2) and ask whether other provisions of the ADEA distinguish between employees and applicants.

We do not have to look far to see that the answer is yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Right next door to \u00a7 4(a)(2) is \u00a7 4(a)(1), the ADEA's disparate treatment provision. In \u00a7 4(a)(1), Congress made it unlawful for an employer \"\n   <em>\n    to fail or refuse to hire\n   </em>\n   or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's age.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20623\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) (emphasis added). All agree that \u00a7 4(a)(1), by its terms, covers both employees and applicants. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Kralman v. Ill. Dep't of Veterans' Affairs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10504451\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/23/150/#p152\">\n    23 F.3d 150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 152-53 (7th Cir. 1994) (treating an applicant's right to bring a claim under \u00a7 4(a)(1) as unquestioned). Compelling this consensus is \u00a7 4(a)(1)'s use of the words \"to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge,\" which make clear that \"any individual\" includes someone seeking to be hired.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20623\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Yet a side-by-side comparison of \u00a7 4(a)(1) with \u00a7 4(a)(2) shows that the language in the former plainly covering applicants is conspicuously absent from the latter. Section 4(a)(2) says nothing about an employer's decision \"to fail or refuse to hire ... any individual\" and instead speaks only in terms of an employer's actions that \"adversely affect his status as an employee.\" We cannot conclude this difference means nothing: \"when 'Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another'-let alone in the very next provision-the Court presumes that Congress intended a difference in meaning.\"\n   <em>\n    Loughrin v.

A short distance away from \u00a7 4(a)(2) is \u00a7 4(c)(2), which disallows labor organizations from engaging in particular conduct. Section 4(c)(2), in pertinent part, makes it unlawful for a labor organization\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   to limit, segregate, or classify its membership ... in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities ... or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee\n   <em>\n    or as an applicant for employment\n   </em>\n   , because of such individual's age.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20623\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The parallel with \u00a7 4(a)(2) is striking: both provisions define the prohibited conduct in terms of action that \"would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities,\" only then to include the \"or otherwise adversely affect\" catchall language. But there is a big difference between the two provisions: \u00a7 4(c)(2)'s protection extends to any individual with \"status as an employee or\n   <em>\n    as an applicant for employment\n   </em>\n   ,\" whereas Congress limited \u00a7 4(a)(2)'s reach only to someone with \"status as an employee.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Consider yet another example. In \u00a7 4(d), Congress addressed employer retaliation by making it \"unlawful for an employer to discriminate against any of his\n   <em>\n    employees or applicants for employment\"\n   </em>\n   because such an individual has opposed certain unlawful practices of age discrimination.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20623\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) (emphasis added). Here, too, the distinction between \"employees\" and \"applicants\" jumps off the page.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Each of these provisions distinguishes between employees and applicants. It is implausible that Congress intended no such distinction in \u00a7 4(a)(2), however, and instead used the term employees to cover both employees and applicants. To conclude otherwise runs afoul of the Supreme Court's admonition to take statutes as we find them by giving effect to differences in meaning evidenced by differences in language.

We decline the invitation. Nowhere in\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   did the Court state that its holding extended to job applicants. And that makes perfect sense because nothing about the case, brought as it was by employees of Duke Power and not outside applicants, required the Court to answer that question. The language that Kleber insists on reading in isolation must be read in context, and the totality of the\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   opinion makes clear that the Court answered whether Duke Power's African-American employees could bring a claim for disparate impact liability based on practices that kept them from pursuing different, higher-paying jobs within the company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   What happened a year after\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   cements our conclusion. In 1972, Congress amended \u00a7 703(a)(2) of Title VII-the provision at issue in\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   -by adding language to expressly include \"applicants for employment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Pub.

This amendment occurred in the immediate wake of\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   and, in this way, reflected Congress's swift and clear desire to extend Title VII's disparate impact protection to job applicants. There was no need for Congress to amend \u00a7 703(a)(2) if the provision had always covered job applicants and especially if the Supreme Court had just said so in\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   . To conclude otherwise renders the 1972 amendment a meaningless act of the 92nd Congress, and we are reluctant to conclude that substantive changes to statutes reflect idle acts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Supreme Court endorsed this precise course of analysis-giving effect to \"Congress's decision to amend Title VII's relevant provisions but not make similar changes to the ADEA\"-in\n   <em>\n    Gross v.

Our job is to apply the enacted text, the only thing to which the House, the Senate, and the President all subscribed, not to plumb legislators' hopes and goals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Section 623(a) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   It shall be unlawful for an employer-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   (1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's age;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   (2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such individual's age; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   (3) to reduce the wage rate of any employee in order to comply with this chapter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The word \"individual\" in paragraph (1) includes applicants for employment; everyone agrees on this much. \"Individual\" reappears in paragraph (2), and normally\n   one word used in adjacent paragraphs means a single thing. See Antonin Scalia &amp; Bryan A. Garner,\n   <em>\n    Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts\n   </em>\n   (2011) (Canon 25: Presumption of Consistent Usage). Maybe the trailing phrase in paragraph (2)-\"otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee\"-implies that the word \"individual\" in paragraph (2) means only employees. That's what the majority believes. But maybe, as Part I.C of Judge Hamilton's dissent suggests, this phrase establishes an independent set of rights for employees, without implying that applicants for employment are not \"individuals.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The statutory context does not point ineluctably to one understanding. The majority does not explain why the statute would use \"individual\" in dramatically different ways within the space of a few words. But the principal dissent does not explain how we can read \"individual\" in paragraph (2) to include \"applicant\" without causing paragraphs (1) and (2) to converge. If that happens, then paragraph (2) applies disparate-impact analysis to all employment actions. That leaves little or nothing for paragraph (1) to do, for paragraph (2), no less than paragraph (1), prohibits disparate treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

That conclusion is enough by itself to expose problems in Part III of Judge Hamilton's dissent, which in the name of legislative purpose would extend disparate-impact analysis across the board. Yet this does not help us to know what \"individual\" in paragraph (2)\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   mean.

The pre-1972 version of that statute is identical to the existing text in \u00a7 623(a) ; Congress copied this part of the ADEA from that part of Title VII. It may be that the Court in\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   was careless to treat outside applicants for employment as \"individuals\" in paragraph (2), but that is what the Justices did. Part II of Judge Hamilton's opinion shows how this came to happen and also shows that many of the Supreme Court's later decisions read\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   to hold that paragraph (2) in the pre-1972 version of Title VII applies disparate-impact theory to outside applicants for employment.

While other ADEA provisions protect job applicants more clearly, the Supreme Court guides us away from the majority's word-matching and toward a more sensible and less arbitrary reading.

The majority tries to avoid this reasoning by narrowing\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   and attributing significance to the 1972 amendment of the Title VII disparate-impact provision.

Under paragraph (a)(1), an employer may not intentionally discriminate against an older individual by firing or failing to hire or promote her because she is older-i.e., engage in disparate treatment of older individuals. Paragraph (a)(2) prohibits an employer from creating an internal employee classification or limitation that has the effect of depriving \"any individual of employment opportunities\" or adversely affecting his or her status as an employee because of age-i.e., creating an internal classification system with a disparate impact against older individuals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   If an employer classifies a position as one that must be filled by someone with certain minimum or maximum experience requirements, it is classifying its employees within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2). If that classification \"would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities\" because of the person's age, paragraph (a)(2) can reach that classification. The broad phrase \"any individual\" reaches job applicants, so the focus turns to the employer's action and its effects-i.e., whether the employer has classified jobs in a way that tends to limit\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   individual's employment opportunities based on age.

Note that the key \"with\" in that phrase-repeated several times in the majority opinion-comes only from the majority, not from the statute itself. It's not correct. The antecedent of \"his\" is \"any individual,\" and \"otherwise adversely affect\" is even broader than \"deprive or tend to deprive\n   any individual of employment opportunities.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The crux of the majority's argument is that if \"any individual\" is not already employed by the employer in question, the individual does not yet have \"status as an employee\" and so is not protected from policies or practices that have disparate impacts because of age. The majority thus concludes that a \"person's status as an employee\" cannot be affected unless the person is\n   <em>\n    already\n   </em>\n   an employee. If that's true, then paragraph (a)(2) subtly limits its protections from disparate impacts to people who already possess \"status as an employee\" with the defendant-employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The majority's analysis nullifies the two uses of the broad word \"individual,\" which certainly reaches job applicants. What Congress meant to say, the majority argues, is that it's unlawful for an employer \"to limit, segregate, or classify his employees in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any\n   <em>\n    current employee\n   </em>\n   [not \"any individual\"] of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such\n   <em>\n    employee's\n   </em>\n   [not \"individual's\"] age.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   How does one read a bar against depriving \"any individual\" of \"employment opportunities\" to exclude all cases where a person is looking for a job? And if Congress meant to limit the provision's coverage only to current employees, why didn't it just use the word \"employee\"? It had used that word twice in this provision already. Courts are generally loath to read statutory terms out of a textual provision and to insert limitations that are not evident in the text. See\n   <em>\n    Mount Lemmon Fire District v.

At the textual level, there are three distinct and fundamental problems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   First, as Judge Easterbrook points out, the majority's theory gives the phrase \"any individual\" very different meanings in adjoining paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of \u00a7 623. Ante at 488-89. See also, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Mohasco Corp. v.

A list culminating in an \"or otherwise\" term can instead direct the reader to consider the last phrase as a catch-all alternative, \"in addition to\" what came before, to capture prohibited actions that might otherwise escape the statute's reach. For example, an employer can violate the ADEA by adversely affecting the status of its employees (e.g., by giving bigger raises to junior employees, as alleged in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5877522\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/228/\">\n    544 U.S. at 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5877522\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/228/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) without depriving an individual of employment opportunities such as better jobs and promotions.

Refusing to hire an individual has the most dramatic possible adverse effect on that individual's \"status as an employee.\" Reading \"status as an employee\" broadly, to include whether the individual is an employee or not, is consistent with the actual words Congress used in repeatedly referring to \"individuals,\" and with ordinary usage. Courts often speak of \"denying status\" of one sort or another.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   And the word\n   \"status\" is not necessarily limited to status as of any particular moment.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201\">\n    1 U.S.C. \u00a7 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Dictionary Act providing that \"unless the context indicates otherwise ... words used in the present tense include the future as well as the present\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In short, the effect of the phrase \"otherwise adversely affects his status as an employee\" on job applicants is at worst ambiguous for applicants like Kleber. The majority loads onto that phrase more weight than it can bear.

Congress told us it set out to address \"the incidence of unemployment, especially long-term unemployment\" among older workers.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3). In the statute, Congress said it was \"especially\" concerned about the difficulty older workers faced in trying to \"regain employment when displaced from jobs\"-in other words, when older workers were\n   <em>\n    applying for jobs\n   </em>\n   . See \u00a7 621(a)(1). Unemployment ends when a person who is not currently employed applies successfully for a job. As the ADEA itself provides, \"it is ... the purpose of this chapter to promote employment of older persons based on their ability rather than age.\" \u00a7 621(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The majority, however, focuses on comparing \u00a7 623(a)(2) to several neighboring provisions in the ADEA that distinguish clearly between current employees and job applicants. The majority, to support its improbable result, reads too much into the differences in wording.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The unlawful employment practices section of the ADEA begins with three subsections prohibiting age discrimination in employment by three different kinds of actors-private and public employers, employment agencies, and labor organizations.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20623\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) - (c) ; see also \u00a7 630(b) (defining \"employer\"). Subsections (a), (b), and (c) are all worded slightly differently. In the following subsection (d), the ADEA prohibits retaliation by any of these private-sector actors. In another section, the ADEA provides for a different and even broader policy prohibiting age discrimination in federal hiring and employment. \u00a7 633a(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The majority compares three of those ADEA provisions: the labor union provision in \u00a7 623(c)(2), the retaliation provision in \u00a7 623(d), and the federal government provision in \u00a7 633a(a). All three of these provisions use the phrase \"applicant for employment.\" The majority invokes the common presumption that a difference in statutory wording signals a difference in Congressional intent and meaning. That\n   presumption, however, is only a tool, not an inflexible rule. We need some basis beyond simple word-matching to believe that these particular differences in language were intended to distinguish the ADEA's disparate-impact provision from these other provisions to produce such an improbable result as excluding older job applicants from disparate-impact protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Instructive here is the Supreme Court's approach to interpreting the term \"employee\" in Title VII's anti-retaliation provision.\n   <em>\n    Robinson v.

The issue in\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   was whether this language prohibits retaliation against former employees. As in this case, the Court had to interpret a provision that was not as clear as other related provisions. The fact that \"Congress also could have used the phrase 'current employees,' \" or \"expressly included the phrase 'former employees' does not aid our inquiry.\" 519 U.S. at 341,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595510\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/337/\">\n    117 S.Ct. 843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Yet the majority concludes that Congress chose to allow private\n   <em>\n    employers\n   </em>\n   to use practices with disparate impacts on older job applicants. This is a truly odd reading, especially in light of the statute's stated purpose and the rest of \u00a7 623, where Congress grouped employers, employment agencies, and labor organizations together with respect to retaliation, job advertisements, and the use of bona fide occupational\n   qualifications and reasonable factors other than age.

One cannot reasonably read hiring and job applicants out of the opinion. After\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   , no competent lawyer would have counseled employers that they were prohibited from basing only intra-company transfers and promotions on \"neutral\" but non-job-related tests, but remained free to use the same tests when hiring new employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Griggs' Aftermath and Title VII's 1972 Amendment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Later Judicial Treatment of Griggs\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Unlike the majority here, courts, employers, and scholars took\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   at its word that its holding was broad and not limited to intra-company transfers and promotions.

Rep. 92-899 at 21-22, reprinted in 118 Cong.

Another House report described\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   as a case \"where the Court held that the use of employment tests as determinants of\n   <em>\n    an applicant's\n   </em>\n   job qualification ... was in violation of Title VII if such tests work a discriminatory effect in\n   <em>\n    hiring\n   </em>\n   patterns\" without a \"showing of an overriding business necessity.\" H.R. Rep. 92-238 at 8, reprinted at 1972 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2144 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Amid the major policy changes in the 1972 Act, the addition of \"applicants for employment\" to the disparate-impact provision was a minor change, mentioned only briefly as incorporating existing law. The conference committee report to the Senate said that this addition was \"merely declaratory of present laws.\" 118 Cong. Rec. at 7169. Congress noted its intention to \"make it clear that discrimination against applicants for employment ... is an unlawful employment practice\" under both\n   clauses of Title VII's \u00a7 2000e-2(a). 118 Cong. Rec. at 7169. This conference committee report to the Senate was the final report on \u00a7 8(a) of H.R. 1746, which added \"or applicants for employment\" to the provision, see\n   <extracted-citation index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=86%20Stat.%20103\">\n    86 Stat. 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 109 (approved March 24, 1972), essentially repeating an earlier Senate report that said this clarifying amendment \"would merely be declaratory of present law.\" S. Rep. 92-415 at 43 (Oct. 28, 1971). Beyond these brief mentions, the addition of \"applicants for employment\" appeared not worthy of explanation at all.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Consider these sparse comments in context. The recognition of disparate-impact liability in\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   had been controversial and hard-fought between civil rights advocates and employers. If Congress thought in 1972 that it was changing the law to\n   <em>\n    extend\n   </em>\n   disparate-impact protection to reach job applicants, that change surely would have been significant enough to mention in the detailed committee reports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   And beyond Congress's silence about such a supposedly major change in the legislation, it beggars belief to think that employer groups would have let such an amendment pass without mention.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   If, as the majority claims here,\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   had actually left open whether job applicants were covered by Title VII's disparate impact provision, the Chamber and other employer groups would not have been silent. But they had already fought that battle, and they knew they had lost.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   The majority is right that courts often assume that statutory amendments are intended to change the law. Ante at 486, citing, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Quality Stores, Inc\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706987\" index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/572/141/#p148\">\n    572 U.S. 141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 148,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3825641,12706987\" index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1395/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 1395\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706987\" index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/572/141/#p148\">\n    188 L.Ed.2d 413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). But the majority overlooks the long-recognized reality that many statutory amendments are intended only to clarify existing law, not to change it. E.g., Singer, 1A Sutherland Statutes and Statutory Construction \u00a7 22:34 (7th ed. 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   The distinction is relevant most often in disputes over whether to give an amendment retroactive effect. Substantive amendments that change the law are rarely given retroactive effect, while \"clarifying\" amendments are routinely given such effect. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel. Garbe v. Kmart Corp\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323524\" index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/632/#p642\">\n    824 F.3d 632\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 642 (7th Cir. 2016) (collecting cases). In this case, the distinction has a dramatic effect on what the 1972 amendment tells us about the scope of\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   and the proper interpretation of the original Title VII language, which is identical to the ADEA language we interpret here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   How to tell when an amendment is substantive and when only clarifying? We explained in\n   <em>\n    Garbe\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n   In deciding whether an amendment is clarifying rather than substantive, we\n   consider \"[1] whether the enacting body declared that it was clarifying a prior enactment; [2] whether a conflict or ambiguity existed prior to the amendment; and [3] whether the amendment is consistent with a reasonable interpretation of the prior enactment and its legislative history.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323524\" index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/632/#p642\">\n    824 F.3d at 642\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting\n   <em>\n    Middleton v.

As shown above: (1) The enacting body announced that the new language only declared current law and was consistent with\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   . (2) Before the 1972 amendment, disparate-impact coverage for outside job applicants had been established in\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   ; that coverage was certainly no worse than ambiguous. (3) The 1972 amendment was \"consistent with a reasonable interpretation of the prior enactment and its legislative history.\" That's exactly how the Supreme Court had read the language a year earlier in\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   and how the decision was described in the 1972 amendment's legislative history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   In short, the facts refute the majority's unsupported claim that the 1972 amendment showed Congress's \"swift and clear desire to extend Title VII's disparate impact protection to job applicants.\" Ante at 486. Without evidence that Congress was \"extending\" Title VII, there is no foundation here for the majority's further inference that Congress in 1972 was silently endorsing a narrower interpretation of identical language in the ADEA. The ADEA was never mentioned in the larger 1972 Act itself or in the conference report describing it. The 1972 Act amended only provisions of the 1964 Act and provides no support for the majority's narrower interpretation of the ADEA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Griggs and Smith v.

Those considerations weigh heavily against the majority here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   A simple hypothetical shows how improbable and arbitrary the majority's reading is. Suppose the majority is correct that \u00a7 623(a)(2) applies only to current employees. Imagine two applicants for the defendant's senior counsel position here. Both are in their fifties, and both have significantly more than seven years of relevant legal experience. One is Kleber, who does not currently have a job with the defendant. The other already works for the defendant but wants a transfer or promotion to the senior counsel position. Both are turned down because they have more than the maximum seven years of experience. According to the majority, the inside applicant can sue for a disparate-impact violation, but the outside one cannot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   That result is baffling, especially under a statute with the stated purpose \"to prohibit arbitrary age discrimination in employment.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"242\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). And the majority's view depends entirely on the assumption that the statutory phrase \"otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee\" cannot possibly be applied to an individual who is, because of the challenged employment practice, completely\n   <em>\n    denied any status\n   </em>\n   as an employee. I cannot imagine that when the ADEA was enacted, \"a reasonable person conversant with applicable social conventions would have understood\" the ADEA as drawing the line the majority adopts here. See John F. Manning,\n   <em>\n    What Divides Textualists from Purposivists?\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"243\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=106%20Colum.%20L.%20Rev.%2070\">\n    106 Colum.

Suppose the applicant is currently employed by a sister subsidiary of the employer. Does she have the right \"status as an employee\" so that she can assert a disparate impact claim? Should the answer depend on some sort of corporate veil-piercing theory? Or suppose the applicant was recently laid off by the employer and challenges its failure to recall her. Or suppose the applicant currently has a position through a temporary employment agency, working side-by-side with employees. I see no arguable reason to exclude any of these applicants from the disparate-impact protection of paragraph (a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Neither the majority nor the defendant or its amici have offered a reason why Congress might have chosen to allow the inside applicant but not the outside applicant to assert a disparate-impact claim. I can't either. Faced with the arbitrary consequences of drawing this line half a century after Congress drafted the legislation, the majority shrugs and says tautologically that it's \"the province of Congress to choose where to draw legislative lines and to mark those lines with language.\" Ante at 488.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Of course, Congress can and often does draw arbitrary lines when it wants to do so. When it does, courts enforce those lines, absent constitutional problems. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Stephens v. Heckler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"343838\" index=\"245\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/766/284/#p286\">\n    766 F.2d 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 286 (7th Cir. 1985) (Congress can dictate outcomes even though \"there is no shortage of arbitrariness in disability cases\");\n   <em>\n    First Chicago NBD Corp. v.

But when the statutory language is at worst ambiguous, see above at 490-96, courts should not embrace such arbitrary results so at odds with the stated statutory purpose. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Graham County\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12447670,3581774\" index=\"247\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/280/\">\n    559 U.S. at 283, 299-301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581774,12447670\" index=\"248\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/1396/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (False Claims Act) ;\n   <em>\n    Gustafson v.

Statutory purpose here is not a matter of judicial inference but of statutory declaration in the text enacted by both Houses of Congress and signed by the President. Congress enacted the ADEA to address unfair employment practices that make it harder for older people to\n   <em>\n    find\n   </em>\n   jobs.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"254\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). That purpose was reflected in a variety of statutory provisions, as noted above. In addition to the statute's specific reliance on its stated purpose, we know from the 1965 Department of Labor report that was the catalyst for the ADEA-known as the Wirtz Report-that Congress had job applicants very much in mind. Report of the Secretary of Labor,\n   <em>\n    The Older American Worker: Age Discrimination in Employment\n   </em>\n   (June 1965), reprinted in U.S. Equal Employment Discrimination in Employment Act (1981), Doc. No. 5 (the Wirtz Report).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Under the majority's reading of \u00a7 623(a)(2), the ADEA's protection of the \"employment opportunities\" of \"any individual\" prohibits employment practices with disparate impacts in firing older workers and in promoting, paying, and managing them,\n   <em>\n    but not in hiring them!\n   </em>\n   Congress was concerned about all of these forms of discrimination. Wirtz Report at 21-22; see also\n   <em>\n    Employment of Older Workers\n   </em>\n   , 111 Cong. Rec. 15518, 15518-19 (1965) (describing Wirtz Report as urging \"a clear, unequivocal national policy against hiring that discriminates against older workers\" and referring to \"job openings,\" and \"applicants over 45\");\n   <em>\n    EEOC v. Wyoming\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6191472\" index=\"255\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/226/#p231\">\n    460 U.S. 226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 231,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6191472\" index=\"256\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/226/#p231\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1054\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6191472\" index=\"257\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/226/#p231\">\n    75 L.Ed.2d 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983) (observing that Wirtz Report concluded \"arbitrary age discrimination was profoundly harmful ... [because] it deprived the national economy of the productive labor of millions ... [and] substantially increased costs in unemployment insurance and federal Social Security benefits\" for older workers who could not land a job).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   A central goal-arguably the most central goal-of the statute was to prevent age discrimination\n   <em>\n    in hiring.\n   </em>\n   Congress and the Wirtz Report explained that the problem stemmed not just from explicit bias against older workers (i.e., disparate treatment), but also from \"[a]ny formal employment standard\" neutral on its face yet with adverse effects on otherwise qualified older applicants. Wirtz Report at 3; see also\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5877522\" index=\"258\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/228/\">\n    544 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   235 n.5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5877522\" index=\"259\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/228/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Those neutral standards and other thoughtless or even well-intentioned employment practices can be addressed only with a disparate-impact theory under \u00a7 623(a)(2). The report made clear that the older people who suffered the disparate impact from such practices were those trying to get hired in the first place. The report explained that despite the beneficial effects of such policies, \"ironically, they sometimes have tended to push still further down the age at which employers begin asking\n   <em>\n    whether or not a prospective employee is too old to be taken on\n   </em>\n   .\" Wirtz Report at 2 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   Against this evidence of contemporary understandings, the majority offers no plausible policy reasons, but only its wooden and narrow textual interpretation, which is anything but inevitable. Wearing blinders that prevent sensible interpretation of ambiguous statutory language, the majority adopts the improbable view that the Act outlawed employment practices with disparate impacts on older workers, but excluded from that protection everyone not already working for the employer in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   Given the statutory language in \u00a7 623(a)(2), the interpretation of that language in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   and identical language in\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   , the practical consequences of the interpretive choice, and the absence of any policy rationale for barring outside job applicants from raising disparate-impact claims, we should reject the improbable and arbitrary distinction adopted by the majority. We should hold that outside job applicants like Kleber may bring disparate-impact claims of age discrimination.

The Chamber of Commerce amicus brief feints toward ascribing intent to Congress, arguing that foreclosing applicants from recourse was \"[o]ne of the careful lines drawn by Congress\" because the ADEA \"strikes a careful balance between prohibiting irrational barriers to employment of older workers and preserving employers' ability to adopt sound hiring policies.\" Dkt. 19 at 3, 1 (Sept. 6, 2018). There is no evidence of such a deliberate choice in \u00a7 623(a)(2). Under the Chamber's theory, that \"balance\" is shifted entirely in employers' favor. An employer can set wildly irrational hiring criteria-such as requiring Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat proficiency for an entry-level position at a fast-food joint, which would likely have a large disparate impact on older workers. As long as that position is not open to internal applicants, that would be a highly effective yet immune \"barrier to employment of older workers.\" That's not a \"careful line.\" It's nonsense.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
