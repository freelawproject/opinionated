SMITH, Circuit Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Narinder Pal Singh, a citizen of India and a member of the political party Shiromani Akali Dal Amritsar (Mann Party), petitions our court to review the Board of Immigration Appeals' (BIA) decision denying his claims for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). After suffering multiple physical attacks at the hands of the Punjabi police and Congress Party members due to his participation in Mann Party events, Singh fled India. He initially entered the United States in January 2013. The Immigration Judge (IJ) denied all of Singh's claims. The BIA also denied Singh all relief sought, and then denied his motion to reconsider.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We hold that the BIA erred in failing to conduct a reasoned analysis with respect to Singh's situation to determine whether, in light of the specific persons or entities that caused his past persecution, and the nature and extent of that persecution, there are one or more general or specific areas within his country of origin where he has no well-founded fear of persecution, and where it is reasonable for him to relocate pursuant to the factors set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201208.13\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3). Because the BIA did not conduct a sufficiently individualized analysis of Singh's ability to relocate within India outside of the state of Punjab, we grant the petition for review and remand the withholding of removal and asylum claims to the BIA. However, we deny review of Singh's claims for humanitarian asylum and CAT protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Narinder Pal Singh is a native and citizen of India. He entered the United States on or about January 27, 2013 through the Nogales, Arizona port of entry, without possessing a valid entry document. An asylum officer later determined that Singh demonstrated a credible fear of persecution or torture. Singh applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under CAT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At a hearing before the IJ, Singh testified that he is a Sikh and a member of the Mann Party. The Mann Party advocates for Sikh rights and an independent Khalistan state. Singh attended and assisted at Mann Party rallies, and distributed leaflets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Singh experienced several threats and suffered physical harm due to his membership in the Mann Party. He received telephonic threats in May and June of 2008, and again in October 2012. In June 2008, the police arrested Singh while he was distributing Mann Party leaflets, and beat him for six days with a leather strap. In August 2010, the police arrested Singh and detained him for ten days after protesting India's Independence Day. During Singh's detention, the police beat him with their fists and sticks, demanding that he stop supporting Khalistan and the Mann Party. Finally, in January 2012, the police arrested Singh and took him to the police station, where they beat him. In addition, Congress Party members beat Singh in April 2012, when he was returning from a Mann Party blood drive, and again in September 2012, while he was returning from a Mann Party event. After almost all of these beatings, Singh required hospital treatment, including multiple-day hospitalizations. Singh eventually fled India in November 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After Singh left India, the police continued going to his house in Punjab to ask where he was. In February 2014, police and Congress Party members went to his house in Punjab and attacked his father, breaking his father's arm in the process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Singh testified that it was not possible for him to live outside Punjab in India because, as a Mann Party member, the police would look for him and might kill him. He also noted that the police never charged him with any crimes after his several arrests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The IJ denied all the relief sought by Singh. The IJ accorded Singh's testimony and declaration \"full evidentiary weight,\" yet found the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) rebutted the presumption of his well-founded fear of future persecution. Specifically, the IJ considered the submitted country-conditions evidence and found that Singh could safely and reasonably relocate outside Punjab within India. The IJ noted that low-level Mann Party members not wanted by the Indian central authorities were unlikely to be targeted outside of Punjab, and that there was no evidence the Congress Party members who harmed Singh could find him outside Punjab. The IJ also found relocation reasonable given Singh's \"good health and job skills\" and the fact that Sikhs no longer face violence or legal obstacles when moving within India.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Further, the IJ found that the threats and physical harm inflicted upon Singh did not rise to the requisite level to warrant humanitarian asylum, and that he had not shown it was more likely than not he would be tortured if he returned to India, as required for protection under CAT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Singh appealed the IJ's decision, which the BIA affirmed. The BIA found that the evidence supported the IJ's determination that DHS carried its burden to show Singh could safely and reasonably relocate outside Punjab within India. The BIA also agreed with the IJ's determination that Singh was not entitled to humanitarian asylum, and his conclusion that Singh did not qualify for CAT relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In his motion to reconsider filed with the BIA, Singh argued that the evidence did not establish by a preponderance that he could engage in his political activities outside Punjab more safely than inside the state, and asserted that the IJ failed to identify a specific area of the country to which he could relocate as required by BIA precedent. Singh also argued that the BIA's determination that he could reasonably relocate was based on unsubstantiated assertions regarding his employment prospects. Finally, Singh contended that CAT relief was warranted based on his past torture and the current country conditions. The BIA denied the motion to reconsider, finding no legal or factual errors in its analysis and stating it need not identify a specific area of India suitable for relocation. Singh's appeals from both the denial of the motion to reconsider and the BIA's decision are now consolidated before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We have jurisdiction over Singh's petition pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).

We grant the petition for review as to Singh's withholding of removal and asylum claims because while the BIA afforded Singh the presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution, it failed to conduct a sufficiently individualized analysis of his ability to relocate within India. However, we find that substantial evidence supports the BIA's conclusions regarding Singh's humanitarian asylum and CAT claims, and we deny review of those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Safe Relocation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Singh first contends that the BIA erred in failing to identify a specific area within India to which Singh could safely relocate, as required by\n   <em>\n    Matter of M-Z-M-R-\n   </em>\n   . There, the BIA stated that where an applicant meets the refugee definition based on past persecution, \"DHS must demonstrate that there is a\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   area of the country where the risk of persecution to the respondent falls below the well-founded fear level.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%2028\">\n    26 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 33-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). The BIA ultimately remanded the case to the IJ for further fact-finding on whether the risk of persecution to the applicant in the city of Hatton, \"or another proposed area,\" met the requisite standard.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%2028\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%2028\">\n    at 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, similarly, Singh argues that the BIA was too vague when it defined his safe relocation area as \"outside Punjab.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We acknowledge the ambiguity within\n   <em>\n    Matter of M-Z-M-R-\n   </em>\n   , and the lack of controlling precedent on the level of specificity required of the government in identifying a proposed relocation area. In\n   <em>\n    Matter of M-Z-M-R-\n   </em>\n   , the BIA speaks of a \"specific area\" for relocation, yet cites a case in support of this proposition that upheld the BIA's decision in which the safe area was defined as \"outside\" the applicant's \"very small home village.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%2028\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%2028\">\n    at 33-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Tendean v. Gonzales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2921613\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/503/8/#p11\">\n    503 F.3d 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 11 (1st Cir. 2007) ). Previously, we have observed in a non-precedential decision that \"it is sufficient to define an area of relocation generally.\"\n   <em>\n    Singh v. Sessions\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=743%20F.%20App%27x%20729\">\n    743 F. App'x 729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 731 (9th Cir. 2018) (denying review where the BIA found the applicant could relocate outside Punjab, to another part of India). In numerous immigration cases however, DHS proposed specific cities or regions within the applicant's country of origin.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Kaiser v. Ashcroft\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9142311\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/390/653/#p659\">\n    390 F.3d 653\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 659-60 (9th Cir. 2004) (analyzing whether petitioners could relocate safely to two cities, a geographical region, or elsewhere in Pakistan).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The immigration regulations require that the government prove relocation is possible only to \"another part\" of the applicant's home country or country of last habitual residence.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201208.13\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(i)(B), (b)(2)(ii). Based upon its plain language, the regulation does not require the government to propose a city, state, or other type of locality as the area of relocation. Accordingly, we hold that DHS may properly propose a specific\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   a more general area as the place of safe relocation. The BIA must then conduct its safe relocation analysis with respect to that proposed area, however specifically or generally defined. This holding affords DHS flexibility in determining a safe relocation area, but maintains the appropriate burden on the government to demonstrate that the proposed area is safe for the applicant. Commensurate with DHS's burden, a more generally defined area will likely require a more comprehensive showing of proof that the entirety of the area is safe for relocation, as compared to, for example, a specific city.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Consequently, we reject Singh's argument that a greater level of specificity than \"outside Punjab\" was required as his proposed area of relocation. Although general, \"outside Punjab\" can comply with the requirement that DHS propose \"another part\" of India for Singh's relocation, so long as DHS meets its other obligations in the relocation analysis, such as considering the factors set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201208.13\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Reasonable Relocation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Singh also argues that the BIA erred in failing to analyze whether he would be substantially safer in a new location if he were to continue expressing his support for the Khalistan secession movement, and erred by unlawfully assuming that he could silence his political activity to avoid harm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree, and grant the petition for review on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The BIA considered whether a Mann Party member would face harm from the Punjabi police outside of Punjab. The BIA also noted the existence of tenant registration systems in certain parts of India, and that there is little information-sharing across Indian states outside of criminal defendant information. The Law Library of Congress 2012 report (Law Library Report)-upon which the BIA relied-stated that the police may pursue \"high-profile\n   militants\" outside of Punjab, yet acknowledged that the Punjabi police may wrongly place individuals involved in ordinary political activities on chronic offender lists. As the BIA decision notes, the Law Library Report also asserted that it is unlikely that an individual Mann Party member who \"simply holds pro-Khalistani views\" would be targeted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Although the BIA discussed the Law Library Report and its conclusion that the police will likely pursue only \"high-profile militants\" outside of Punjab, it erred by failing to address the potential harm Congress Party members, or other local authorities, might inflict upon Singh in a new state. Instead, the BIA's analysis focused on whether the Punjabi police would follow Singh outside of Punjab, based on his past political activity, ultimately concluding that he was not sufficiently high-profile for them to do so. This analysis does not account for the persecution he may face outside Punjab from local authorities, or other actors, based on his future political activities. \"[W]here the applicant has established a well-founded fear of future persecution at the hands of the government, a rebuttable presumption arises that the threat exists nationwide.\"\n   <em>\n    Melkonian v.

The BIA failed to apply that nationwide presumption to Singh's asylum claim, even though it correctly afforded him the presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution. Similarly, the BIA also failed to specifically address Singh's stated intent to continue proselytizing for his party wherever he went. Thus, the BIA's analysis regarding whether Singh could reasonably relocate was inadequate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Knezevic v.

Singh did not previously raise the brevity of the IJ's or BIA's analysis, either in his appeal brief or in his motion to reconsider. Thus, the argument is unexhausted, and we lack jurisdiction to consider it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rojas-Garcia\n   </em>\n   , 339 F.3d at 819.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The BIA described the physical harm Singh suffered at the hands of the police and Congress Party members, and noted his multiple hospitalizations.

While undoubtedly troubling, Singh's past persecution does not rise to the level of severity in some other cases in which we have denied petitions for review where the BIA has declined to extend humanitarian asylum.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Hanna v.

Singh points to the BIA's \"flawed\" relocation analysis, but the BIA's insufficient analysis of that issue does not establish that Singh carried his burden for his CAT claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ahmed v.

The ability to relocate is but one factor in the CAT analysis. To prevail on his CAT claim, Singh would need to prove that he \"more likely than not\" would be tortured if he returned home; the BIA did not need to\n   <em>\n    dis\n   </em>\n   prove this contention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Singh argues that his political activity would result in his being tortured, noting that it has led to his torture in the past, and that there is widespread torture of activists by the Indian police.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude, however, that there is substantial evidence supporting the denial of CAT protection. While Singh highlights general evidence that police across India are engaged in human rights violations, the evidence specific to Mann Party members is sparse. Notwithstanding Singh's personal experiences, the evidence in the record suggests Mann Party members are targeted primarily when they are high-profile militants. Despite Singh's documentary evidence regarding human rights concerns in India, we are not compelled to conclude that Singh more likely than not would be the subject of torture should he return to India. That Singh suffered persecution in the past does not necessarily mean he will be tortured in the future.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ahmed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2949647\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/504/1183/#p1199\">\n    504 F.3d at 1201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding substantial evidence supported denial of CAT relief where petitioner had been beaten four times by the police but otherwise did not demonstrate he would be tortured upon return to Bangladesh, because it was not clear that past persecution rose to the level of torture).

However, the IJ addressed this issue, and Singh raised it in his motion for reconsideration before the BIA. Although the BIA did not explicitly consider this argument in its denial of reconsideration, we find it is nonetheless exhausted.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Garcia v.

The BIA did not separate its analysis regarding Singh's asylum claim from whether Singh warranted withholding of removal.

The BIA's decision records the Singh family's past persecution at the outset, and notes that the \"several threats and physical abuse\" Singh suffered did not rise to the requisite level of harm.
