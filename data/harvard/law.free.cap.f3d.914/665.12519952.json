The defendant, Alvaro Alvaran-Velez, claims that he could have gotten a sentence reduction under the version of the policy statement in effect at the time of his crime. Using a newer version, he argues, violated the\n   <em>\n    Ex Post Facto\n   </em>\n   Clause by eliminating a real chance for a shorter sentence upon guideline range reduction that he believes existed when he committed the offense. Because, correctly read, the earlier version did not even apply to him, we affirm the district court's denial of Alvaran's motion for a sentence reduction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Alvaran violated\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20959\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 959\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 960, and 963 by conspiring between 2005 and 2007 to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine, knowing or intending that the cocaine would be imported into the United States. He was convicted after a jury trial in 2010. At the time of Alvaran's sentencing in 2013, the applicable Sentencing\n   Guideline range was 324 to 405 months imprisonment. The court nevertheless sentenced him to 180 months, significantly below the applicable range. In doing so, the court weighed the seriousness of the offense, Alvaran's lack of a criminal record, his poor health, letters from his family attesting to his good character, the fact that he was raised in a poor family, and that he was far less culpable than another defendant who had been sentenced to 300 months-all factors appropriate to consider under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The year following Alvaran's sentencing, the Sentencing Commission adopted Guideline Amendment 782, which lowered the base offense levels for certain drug crimes by two levels, and Amendment 788, which applied the new levels retroactively. United States Sentencing Commission,\n   <em>\n    Guidelines Manual\n   </em>\n   , App. C, amends. 782, 788 (Supp. 2014). Had Alvaran been sentenced under the amended guidelines, the applicable sentencing range would have been 262 to 327 months-substantially lower than the 324-to-405-month range at Alvaran's initial sentencing, but still well above his actual 180-month sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Alvaran requested a sentence reduction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203582\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2), which allows a district court to reduce the sentence of a defendant whose guideline range is subsequently lowered \"if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\" But the district court held that a newer version of one of those policy statements, USSG \u00a7 1B1.10, foreclosed reducing his sentence. As revised by a 2011 amendment, Amendment 759, that policy statement set the bottom of the new guideline range as a floor for sentence reductions by providing that \"the court shall not reduce the defendant's term of imprisonment ... to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range.\" USSG \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A) (2016). Because Alvaran's sentence was already below the minimum of the amended guideline range, the district court held that USSG \u00a7 1B1.10 prevented any further reduction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Alvaran contended that applying the policy statement's sentence reduction floor to deny him a reduction violated the\n   <em>\n    Ex Post Facto\n   </em>\n   Clause, U.S. CONST. art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 3, because a 2006 version of the policy statement-in force when he committed his crime-would have allowed the district court to reduce his sentence in response to the amended guidelines range. That 2006 policy statement advised a court reducing a sentence pursuant to guideline amendments to \"consider the term of imprisonment that it would have imposed had the amendment(s) to the guidelines listed in subsection (c) been in effect at the time the defendant was sentenced.\" USSG \u00a7 1B1.10(b) (2006). Subsection (c) listed twenty-four amendments that lowered guideline ranges; it did not include the amendment that lowered Alvaran's sentencing range, Amendment 782, which would not be passed for another eight years. Alvaran pointed to an application note to the 2006 version that states that, \"[w]hen the original sentence represented a downward departure, a comparable reduction below the amended guideline range may be appropriate.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203582\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.3). That application note, he claimed, shows that, but for the 2011 amendment of USSG \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A) prohibiting below-guideline sentence reductions, he would have been eligible for a reduction below the lowered guideline range comparable to the original reduction the court granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the hearing on Alvaran's motion for a sentence reduction, the district court said that it would lower his sentence \"very substantially\" if it could, but that the then-current Guidelines Manual forbade a reduction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Alvaran argued that applying the new policy statement with the guideline reduction violated the\n   <em>\n    Ex Post Facto\n   </em>\n   Clause because it eliminated his opportunity to invoke the court's discretion to lower his sentence. The district court disagreed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We review de novo whether applying the 2016 version of USSG \u00a7 1B1.10 to Alvaran violates the\n   <em>\n    Ex Post Facto\n   </em>\n   Clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Appellant's Br. 3. As Alvaran sees it, the 2011 amendment changed that to his detriment. By generally prohibiting sentence reductions for anyone whose original sentence fell below the bottom of the amended guidelines range, Alvaran claims, the 2011 amendment effected \"the complete removal of any opportunity to invoke the court's discretion to reduce a sentence\" for someone in his position.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13.

The text Alvaran wants applied to him-that \"the court should consider the term of imprisonment that it would have imposed had\n   <em>\n    the amendment(s) to the guidelines listed in subsection (c)\n   </em>\n   been in effect at the time the defendant was sentenced\"-is explicitly limited to the listed amendments, each of which had already been adopted and made retroactive in 2006. USSG \u00a7 1B1.10(b) (2006) (emphasis added). Alvaran reads into the 2006 guideline policy a broad, forward-looking promise of proportionate sentencing reduction that the textually cabined policy does not support. Unlike the laws at issue in\n   <em>\n    Weaver\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Lynce\n   </em>\n   , the 2006 version of section 1B1.10 did not confer on defendants a general opportunity to benefit; rather, it extended an opportunity that, by its terms, applied only to the amendments it enumerated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Because the 2006 version of section 1B1.10 did not apply to Alvaran in the first place, we conclude that applying its amended 2016 counterpart does not make his punishment more onerous than it otherwise would have been.

Here, the Commission exercised its discretion in drafting Amendment 782, which lowered Alvaran's guideline range, so as to render it retroactive only as to defendants who had received a sentence exceeding the newly lowered minimum. The amendment simply did not retroactively lower the range for defendants like Alvaran, who had already received a below-minimum sentence. The Commission took nothing away from Alvaran when it created a benefit targeted to offenders whose original sentences exceeded the bottom of the newly lowered guideline range.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We accordingly affirm the district court's decision to deny the motion for a sentence reduction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    So ordered\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
