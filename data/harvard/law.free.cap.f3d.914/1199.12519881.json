Because Booth was a minor, his mother, acting as his representative, sued the United States pursuant to the Federal Tort Claims Act (\"FTCA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202671\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . The district court found that the claims were time-barred because Booth's representative submitted them too late. Booth appeals, arguing that minority should operate to toll the statute of limitations on his claims. Because we conclude that prior decisions holding that there is no minority tolling for the FTCA's statute of limitations remain binding, and conclude that minority tolling is a separate statutory matter from equitable tolling, we affirm the district court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The younger Booth was weeks from his tenth birthday when he lost his father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Booth's mother, Marlene June, filed an Administrative Form 95 with the Federal Highway Administration (\"FHWA\"), and on May 5, 2011, filed suit against the United States in federal court in Arizona, on behalf of Booth and other statutory beneficiaries (the late Anthony Booth's mother, daughters, and other son), alleging that a highway barrier that failed during the highway accident was not tested and approved in accord with FHWA rules.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Booth was fifteen years old when June filed the administrative claim and sixteen years old at the time she filed the lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The FTCA requires administrative exhaustion and sets time limits for both exhaustion and the filing of a lawsuit. \"An action shall not be instituted upon a claim against the United States for money damages for injury or loss of property or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government ... unless the claimant shall have first presented the claim to the appropriate Federal agency and his claim shall have been finally denied by the agency in writing and sent by certified or registered mail.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202675\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"A tort claim against the United States shall be forever barred unless it is presented in writing to the appropriate Federal agency within two years after such claim accrues....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

The district court agreed, finding that the claim had accrued more than two years before June presented it to the federal agency and holding that, under Ninth Circuit precedent, the FTCA's statute of limitations is not subject to equitable tolling or tolling for minority of the injured party.

The Government then sought certiorari for both that decision and\n   <em>\n    Wong\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Supreme Court took both cases, addressing and affirming them both and ruling that the FTCA's statute of limitations (both the two-year time limit after accrual for presenting claims to the administrative agency and the six-month time limit for suit after denial of a claim by an agency) is not jurisdictional, but instead is subject to equitable tolling.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Supreme Court remanded June's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   June's case resumed in district court. Booth, having reached the age of majority by this time, substituted in as named plaintiff. The Government then moved for summary judgment, arguing that Booth's claim was barred by the FTCA's statute of limitations because June, as Booth's representative, did not file a claim with the administrative agency until more than five years after Booth's father's car accident and there were no circumstances that called for equitable tolling. Booth cross-moved for summary judgment, arguing that the statute of limitations should be tolled because the nature of the Government's involvement in the car accident had been concealed, and because Booth had been a minor at the time of the accident, at the time June filed an administrative claim, and at the time June filed suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The district court granted the Government's motion for summary judgment. The district court held, as it had determined before the appeal, that Booth's claim accrued on the day of his father's accident, February 19, 2005, and that Booth had submitted his claim to the FHWA more than two years later, through his mother June, on December 16, 2010. The district court concluded that Booth could not equitably toll the statute of limitations on concealment grounds and also that Booth had waived any argument that his age tolled the statute of limitations, as he had failed to raise the issue in the prior appeal. Booth moved for reconsideration. The district court denied the motion, and Booth timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On appeal, Booth asserts that his status as a minor during most of these proceedings tolls the FTCA's statute of limitations-specifically that portion of the\n   statute of limitations that requires a plaintiff to file a claim with the responsible agency within two years of the accrual of the claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). No longer considered jurisdictional, the FTCA's statute of limitations can now be tolled,\n   <em>\n    Wong\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3709533\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/732/1030/\">\n    732 F.3d at 1047\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , including for equitable considerations,\n   <em>\n    Wong/June\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12588801\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1625/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 1633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The time limits in the FTCA are just time limits, nothing more. Even though they govern litigation against the Government, a court can toll them on equitable grounds.\"). Booth argues that minority tolling-the rule applicable in many circumstances that statutes of limitations are tolled during the minority of the would-be plaintiff-should be applicable under the FTCA. He also maintains being a minor is sufficient for equitable tolling of the FTCA's statute of limitations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Rule Against Minority Tolling of the FTCA's Statute of Limitations Should Continue to Apply\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Minority tolling statutes provide that if a cause of action accrues when a plaintiff is a child, the statute of limitations on that cause of action is suspended until the plaintiff attains the age of majority. The policy reason underlying such statutes, as enunciated by one state appellate court in this Circuit, is \"[b]ecause a minor does not have the understanding or experience of an adult, and because a minor may not bring an action except through a guardian ... special safeguards are required to protect the minor's right of action.\"\n   <em>\n    W.
