After the district court\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   denied his motion to dismiss the indictment, Adams conditionally pleaded guilty. On appeal, Adams argues that the district court erred by denying his motion, because \u00a7 922(g)(1) as applied to him is unconstitutional under the Second Amendment. Adams, however, failed even to address one element of his as-applied challenge in the district court, and he therefore forfeited his claim. There was no plain error in denying the motion to dismiss, so we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Adams's instant conviction arose from a traffic stop in Kansas City, Missouri, in July 2014. Police officers pulled him over for failure to stop at a stop sign. After Adams told police that he was driving to meet his probation officer, the officers asked to search the vehicle. Adams consented to the search, and police discovered a handgun on the floor board under the driver's seat. Adams denied that the handgun belonged to him, but lab analysis\n   found his DNA on the trigger and magazine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A grand jury charged him with unlawful possession of a firearm as a previously convicted felon, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1). Adams had sustained a prior felony conviction in Missouri for carrying a concealed weapon. Adams moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional as applied to him. Adams argued that\n   <em>\n    District of Columbia v. Heller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/\">\n    554 U.S. 570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/\">\n    171 L.Ed.2d 637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008), did not categorically exclude \"non-violent felons\" from Second Amendment protection. And he asserted that a conviction for carrying a concealed weapon is a non-violent felony. He then urged that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional as applied to him, because a permanent ban on firearms possession by a \"non-violent felon\" is not narrowly tailored to the government's interest in public safety, so the prohibition did not satisfy strict scrutiny. The district court denied the motion on the ground that \u00a7 922(g)(1) serves an important governmental objective and satisfies intermediate scrutiny as applied to Adams.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Adams then pleaded guilty, and the district court sentenced him to 21 months' imprisonment with three years of supervised release. As part of the plea agreement, Adams reserved the right to appeal the district court's denial of his motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Second Amendment provides: \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\" U.S. Const. amend.

But we have yet to address squarely whether \u00a7 922(g)(1) is susceptible to as-applied challenges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

At a minimum, to succeed on an as-applied challenge, Adams must establish (1) that the Second Amendment protects his particular conduct, and (2) that his prior felony conviction is insufficient to justify the challenged regulation of Second Amendment rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Adams forfeited his claim by failing even to address the first point in the district court. Because Adams transported the handgun out of sight under his driver's\n   seat, Adams must show that the Second Amendment protects a right to carry a weapon concealed in a vehicle. Yet Adams never advanced this contention, and the district court could have denied his motion based on this deficiency alone. Adams simply assumed the existence of a constitutional right to carry a concealed weapon in a vehicle and argued only that his particular felony conviction could not justify a lifetime ban on possession. For the first time on appeal, Adams contends that the Second Amendment protects a right to carry a concealed firearm outside the home. To obtain relief on a forfeited claim, however, Adams must show that the district court made an obvious error that affected substantial rights and seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or reputation of the judicial proceedings.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Therefore, his as-applied challenge to \u00a7 922(g)(1) fails under the plain error standard. We disagree with the view of the concurring opinion that an as-applied challenger need not even show that he was engaged in constitutionally-protected conduct. Of course, the felon-in-possession statute does not require\n   <em>\n    the government\n   </em>\n   to prove the manner in which the defendant possessed a firearm. But a party who raises an as-applied constitutional challenge to a statute must show that the statute as applied in the particular circumstances of his case infringed on conduct that was constitutionally protected.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Broadrick v.

I write separately because I disagree with how the court analyzes Adams's Second Amendment challenge. When presented with similar arguments, our sister circuits have used a sensible, two-pronged approach to consider whether application of \u00a7 922(g)(1) to a particular individual comports with the Constitution's protection of the right to keep and bear arms. Instead of following that sound approach, the court focuses on a factual circumstance not before the district court and not addressed\n   by the parties: that Adams's firearm was \"concealed.\" This fact, even if it were supported by the record, would not be relevant to Adams's conviction because \u00a7 922(g)(1) applies regardless of the manner in which the firearm is possessed. It likewise should have no bearing on his ability to argue that his conviction under that section is unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Section 922(g)(1) makes it unlawful for any person who has been convicted of \"a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   to \"possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition.\" This offense has only three elements: \"(1) a prior felony conviction; (2) knowing possession of a firearm; and (3) an interstate nexus.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9499800\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/266/804/#p813\">\n    266 F.3d 804\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 813 (8th Cir. 2001). Adams asserts that the first element sweeps too broadly because it applies the ban to individuals like himself who were convicted of nonviolent offenses, in violation of the Second Amendment. Adams first raised this argument in a pretrial motion to dismiss his indictment. After the district court rejected his challenge, Adams entered into a conditional guilty plea that preserved his right to renew his constitutional claim on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The court today concludes that Adams \"forfeited\" his Second Amendment challenge from the start because he never addressed where the firearm was located at the time he was pulled over. The court anchors its reasoning in a two-part test for an as-applied constitutional challenge like Adams's. A challenger must prove: \"(1) that the Second Amendment protects his particular conduct, and (2) that his prior felony conviction is insufficient to justify the challenged regulation of Second Amendment rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   at 605. The court then explains that Adams forfeited his claim because he failed to address how one aspect of his \"particular conduct\"-the location of the firearm-was constitutionally protected.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But the court cites no authority for the proposition that the \"particular conduct\" relevant to Adams's as-applied challenge included the firearm's location. There is thus no reason why Adams would have known he needed to address this fact. Likewise, the government has never argued that Adams's firearm was concealed or that his failure to address its location in his motion forfeited his right to challenge the constitutionality of his conviction, thus limiting our review under the plain-error doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Supreme Court has cautioned that the \"as-applied\" label does not control what a party must plead or prove.\n   <em>\n    Citizens United v.

Here, Adams's \"particular injury\" is his \u00a7 922(g)(1) conviction, and we should limit our analysis to the facts that trigger that criminal sanction,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the facts that the government needed to prove in order to apply the statute to this case. There is no precedent requiring Adams to prove that every aspect of his conduct was constitutionally protected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The government was not required to prove that Adams possessed a firearm in a concealed manner because Congress did not make that an element of the felon-in-possession offense. And \u00a7 922 contains no other general prohibition on carrying concealed firearms. Thus, if Adams is correct and \u00a7 922(g)(1) cannot apply to him, then his possession of the firearm-concealed or open-was not prohibited by federal law. By focusing on the assertion that Adams carried a concealed firearm, the court addresses a hypothetical as-applied challenge to a hypothetical concealed-carry statute.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Raines\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6162322\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/362/17/#p21\">\n    362 U.S. at 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6162322\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/362/17/#p21\">\n    80 S.Ct. 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that courts should \"never ... anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it\"). There may not be, as the court explains, a protected right under the Second Amendment to carry a concealed firearm. But this analysis merely suggests that Congress\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   pass a concealed-carry statute without running afoul of the Second Amendment. It has nothing to do with whether Adams can be prosecuted under \u00a7 922(g)(1) for being a felon-in-possession, unless we \"inva[de] ... the legislative domain\" by adding a concealment requirement to the statute.\n   <em>\n    Ayotte v.

At that point, the only information before the district court was the indictment and the facts that Adams conceded in his motion. Neither the indictment nor the motion mentioned the location of the firearm or whether the firearm was \"concealed.\" The only evidence in the record on this issue comes from the plea agreement and the presentence report-both of which did not exist until after Adams's constitutional challenge was briefed, argued, and decided. The indictment's silence on the issue confirms that the location of the firearm was not one of the \"essential facts constituting the offense charged,\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(c)(1), making it immaterial to whether Adams could be convicted under \u00a7 922(g)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In short, the court's inquiry into other facts surrounding Adams's offense is an unnecessary diversion from the question that he asks us to decide. It also lacks the benefit of briefing from the parties-before the district court and on appeal-which only further counsels in favor of limiting our analysis to the facts necessary to prove the statutory elements as written in \u00a7 922(g)(1).
