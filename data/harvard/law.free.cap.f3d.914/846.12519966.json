One of the requirements is a qualifying state court custody order. Today, we address the narrow question of whether the temporary,\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   emergency order presented by Felipe Perez Perez qualifies as a predicate state court custody order for the SIJ application. The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (the \"Agency\"), the Administrative Appeals Office (\"AAO\") and the district court concluded it did not. For the reasons set out below, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Before examining the facts of this case, we briefly summarize the SIJ statute. Under 101(a)(27)(J) (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(27)(J) ) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, an SIJ is \"an immigrant who is present in the United States\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   (i) who has been declared dependent on a juvenile court located in the United States or whom such a court has legally committed to, or placed under the custody of, an agency or department of a State, or an individual or entity appointed by a State or juvenile court located in the United States, and whose reunification with 1 or both of the immigrant's parents is not viable due to abuse, neglect, abandonment, or a similar basis found under State law;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (ii) for whom it has been determined in administrative or judicial proceedings that it would not be in the alien's best interest to be returned to the alien's or\n   parent's previous country of nationality or country of last habitual residence; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (iii) in whose case the Secretary of Homeland Security consents to the grant of special immigrant juvenile status[.]\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(27)(J). To become an SIJ, an immigrant child must apply for that status with the Agency. He or she bears the burden of proving the SIJ requirements.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1361. If an applicant obtains SIJ status, he or she is potentially eligible for lawful permanent resident status. If an SIJ is granted lawful permanent resident status, he or she may eventually apply for United States citizenship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   This case involves Perez's application for SIJ status. Perez was born on July 6, 1997 in Guatemala. At age 16, he unlawfully entered the United States around January 14, 2014. Upon entry, the U.S. government apprehended Perez and placed him into custody. The government initiated removal proceedings against Perez. Shortly thereafter, the government transferred him to North Carolina, where his brother lived, and released him to his brother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A year later, around January 20, 2015, Perez's brother filed a complaint in state court seeking custody of Perez by alleging that Perez, then 17, was abandoned, neglected and abused by his parents in Guatemala. Perez's brother later filed a Motion for Temporary Emergency Custody. A North Carolina juvenile court issued an order on June 29, 2015, granting\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   \"emergency temporary custody\" of Perez to his brother and scheduling a hearing to determine custody for July 22, 2015, just a few weeks later, for which notice to Perez's parents was required. In the order, the juvenile court found that pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 50A-204(a) and 50A-311, it had temporary emergency jurisdiction to protect the child based on the information it had been presented at that time. The court further found that \"[r]eunification with the biological parents is not viable due to abuse, neglect, abandonment, or a similar basis found under state law,\" and,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that it was in Perez's \"best interest for temporary and permanent custody to be awarded to the Plaintiff.\" J.A. 129.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   After granting Perez's brother temporary emergency custody and control of the minor child, the juvenile court expressly acknowledged that the \"terms of this Order shall remain in effect until the Court date noted below,\" i.e., July 22, 2015. J.A. 129.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Perez turned 18 on July 6, 2015, just a few days after the emergency order and about two weeks before the scheduled July 22, 2015 hearing. This divested the juvenile court of jurisdiction over Perez. Therefore, the July 22, 2015 hearing never took place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On his 18th birthday, Perez filed a petition for SIJ status. Perez used the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   emergency temporary order as the predicate\n   order for his SIJ application to claim, as required by Section 1101(a)(27)(J)(i) and (ii), that a court had (i) placed Perez under the custody of his brother and determined that reunifying Perez with his parents was not viable due to abuse, neglect, abandonment, or a similar basis under state law; and (ii) determined that it would not be in Perez's best interest to be returned to his previous country of nationality. On or around July 31, 2015, the Agency issued its Notice of Intent to Deny the SIJ petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On August 28, 2015, the North Carolina juvenile court issued another\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order, this one for judgment\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   . That order made the following findings of fact: (1) an action for\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   temporary emergency child custody was instituted by Perez's brother; (2) an order granting\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   temporary emergency child custody was granted on June 29, 2015; and (3) \"[b]ecause the child turned 18 years old four days after the signing of the Order, the Order granting temporary custody to Plaintiff was as permanent as possible under North Carolina [l]aw.\" J.A. 88.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On September 23, 2015, the Agency denied Perez's application for SIJ status. The Agency determined that the juvenile court order submitted in support of the petition was \"expressly temporary in nature and therefore does not make the finding that reunification with one or both parents is permanently not viable.\" J.A. 73. After Perez appealed, the AAO reviewed the Agency's decision de novo and dismissed the appeal in a decision dated May 9, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On October 28, 2016, Perez filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina against the Director of the Agency, seeking declaratory relief and review of the AAO's decision under the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"). Perez subsequently filed a motion to set aside final agency action. Perez claimed the Agency and the AAO imposed an\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   requirement that the predicate custody order required by the SIJ application process be permanent. Alternatively, Perez argued the Agency and AAO acted arbitrarily or capriciously in differentiating between temporary emergency custody orders and permanent custody orders. The Agency moved for judgment on the record affirming the denial of the SIJ application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The district court rejected Perez's claims. In concluding that the temporary emergency custody order did not suffice to establish the requisite findings for SIJ status, the district court found that the Agency and AAO did not act arbitrarily and capriciously. Instead, the district court held they simply gave the temporary emergency custody order the same effect it would have been given in North Carolina. The district court thus denied Perez's motion to set aside final agency action and granted the Agency's motion for judgment on the record in an order signed March 6, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Perez filed a timely appeal, and this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We review both the district court's grant of judgment on the administrative record and denial of Perez's motion to set aside the Agency's action de novo.\n   <em>\n    Am.

Perez argues that neither the text, structure or history of the SIJ statute requires a qualifying custody order to be permanent. Perez argues the statute does not include temporal language pertaining to the required order, and argues that the Agency, in requiring an order to be permanent, has gone beyond its delegated authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   This Court's review under the\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   standard is \"necessarily narrow.\"\n   <em>\n    Ancient Coin Collectors Guild v.

Neither situation is present here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   First, Perez mischaracterizes the decisions of the Agency and the AAO in arguing that they impose a permanency requirement. The decisions merely evaluate whether the particular order presented by Perez qualified under the SIJ statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   To be sure, the Agency and AAO refer to the temporal aspects of the order as part of their decisions. However, neither imposed a categorical permanency requirement to the predicate state court order required by the statute. Likewise, when read in totality, neither decision implied that permanency is essential. In fact, in the analysis portion of its order, the AAO does not use the word permanent other than in its reference to the language of the\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   order itself and Perez's own assertions on brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Further, the references to the temporal aspects of the order are only part of the Agency and AAO's decisions. The decisions focus more on the terms of the order that reflect its\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   and emergency nature. To review those terms, the juvenile court invoked temporary emergency jurisdiction based on N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 50A-204(a) and \u00a7 50A-311.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under North Carolina law, particularly as applied in this context, \"[w]hen a court invokes emergency jurisdiction, any orders entered shall be temporary protective orders only.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Brode\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9082050\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/151/690/#p693\">\n    151 N.C.

Ct. App. 2002) (referencing proceedings in abuse, dependency, and/or neglect cases, and addressing the nature of North Carolina court's ability to exercise jurisdiction under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act). The June 29, 2015 order granted Perez's brother \"emergency temporary custody and control of the minor child,\" ordered notice of the hearing be provided to Perez's parents and specified that the terms of the order remained in effect for less than 30 days. J.A. 129-130. The order was plainly an emergency order based on the limited and\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   information provided to the court. The order was intended to maintain the status quo until the issues could be addressed in a more substantive manner.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, the Agency evaluated the\n   order presented by Perez, and found its\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   , emergency nature did not meet the SIJ requirements under the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Aside from its emergency nature and terms which were only intended to remain in effect for about three weeks, the order was issued without notice to Perez's parents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The emergency order was based on information provided only by Perez's brother without an opportunity for those allegations to be challenged or contested. In other words, Perez's parents were not given notice so that they, if they elected to do so, could contest the allegations in the complaint and oppose an outcome that altered their parental rights. Although we do not doubt the appropriateness of such an order under North Carolina law in the event of an emergency, the Agency and the AAO had the right to consider whether the nature and terms of such an order met the SIJ qualifications under the Act.

Here, the Agency, a bureau of the Department of Homeland Security, and AAO made a determination as to whether Perez had presented a qualifying predicate order. Making such a determination was within the bounds of their authority. The Agency did not act in an\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   way when it determined that the juvenile court order at issue here was not qualifying.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Last, and with all due respect to our good colleague in dissent, neither the decisions below nor this opinion represent an assault on principles of federalism. We join our colleague in support of those principles. Here Perez sought a federal benefit in applying for SIJ status. The federal agency charged with determining whether Perez qualified for that benefit had every right to review the pertinent state court order to see if it qualified. That is all that happened here. Respect for federalism does not require that either the Agency, the AAO or this Court ignore the language of the order-or the way in which the order was obtained-in evaluating whether Perez qualified for SIJ status.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Perez's second point of error is that the Agency's decision should be set aside as arbitrary and capricious because, even if a permanency requirement is authorized, Perez's custody order was permanent enough to satisfy the Agency's manual and was appropriate under North Carolina law. Here again, we disagree with Perez's characterization of the Agency's decision as imposing a \"permanent\" custody requirement. As fully discussed above, the Agency was simply applying the statute to find that Perez had not presented a qualifying predicate order. The district court properly deferred to the Agency's reasoning, which articulated the Agency's determination about the order's compliance with the SIJ requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Supreme Court has indicated that the \"scope of review under the 'arbitrary and capricious' standard is narrow, and a court is not to substitute its judgment for that of the agency. Nevertheless, the agency must examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a 'rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.' \"\n   <em>\n    Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Moreover, the Agency explained its reasons for doing so. Therefore, the decision was not arbitrary or capricious, or otherwise contrary to law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Further, the district court did not substitute its views for that of the Agency. We decline to do so as well. The district court here found that the juvenile court's\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   emergency custody order failed to qualify as the necessary juvenile court predicate order. In so doing, the district court recognized the deference afforded to agency decisions, rejected the notion that the Agency added an unauthorized requirement of permanency to the SIJ application process and noted the Agency's decision that proper state-level determinations for SIJ status were not made as defined by North Carolina law. As long as the Agency \"provide[s] an explanation of its decision that includes a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made,\" its decision should be sustained.\n   <em>\n    Ohio Valley Envtl.

Just as the district court found, we have no trouble tracing the Agency's decisional logic here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Perez also argues the June 29, 2015 order qualified under the SIJ statute and satisfied the requirements of the Agency's manual because the North Carolina court intended for the order to remain in effect until Perez reached the age of majority. Perez claims this is significant because the Agency's manual states \"USCIS generally requires that the court order be valid at the time of filing and must determine that the court intends that the child will not reunify with at least one parent until the child reaches the age of majority.\" J.A. 192. Perez argues the evidence of the North Carolina court's intent is the fact that the court scheduled a second hearing for July 22, 2015 -a date which fell after Perez turned 18-with the factual knowledge of when he would turn 18. Based on this, Perez argues the Agency's decision was arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   This position, while creative, finds no support in the text of the order. The court did not state that the finding related to reunification was intended to last to the age of majority. It simply set a date a mere three weeks in the future where the court could address the issues with appropriate procedural requirements in place. Rather than indicating intent that might make the order qualify under the SIJ statute or the Agency manual, the language in the order instead indicates the North Carolina court recognized the emergency,\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order was simply to preserve the status quo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Further, if the North Carolina court intended for its order to be anything more than an emergency custody order, there would have been no need for that court to issue a second\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order, which concluded that \"due to the child's age at the time the order was entered, the order was as permanent as possible under North Carolina law.\" J.A. 89. We, therefore, reject Perez's argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Finally, Perez argues that this Court should reverse the district court's decision that the Full Faith and Credit Act does\n   not apply to the Agency's decision. Perez maintains that the Agency failed to give full faith and credit to the state court temporary custody order and\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   order. For this argument, Perez cites to our own precedent of\n   <em>\n    Ojo v. Lynch\n   </em>\n   for the proposition the federal government has historically deferred to state-law policy decisions with respect to domestic relations. This proposition is not in dispute. But\n   <em>\n    Ojo\n   </em>\n   referenced the Full Faith and Credit Act simply as an example of the federal policy of deference to state-law policy decisions.\n   <em>\n    Ojo v. Lynch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4088332\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/813/533/#p540\">\n    813 F.3d 533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 540 (4th Cir. 2016). In recognizing the state law nature of domestic relations matters,\n   <em>\n    Ojo\n   </em>\n   did not hold that the Full Faith and Credit Act applies to agencies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Turning now to the Full Faith and Credit Act, the Act provides a federal court should, as a general rule, accord prior state adjudications the full force, respect, and effect that they would have under the law of the state in which the judgment was rendered.\n   <em>\n    Robart Wood &amp; Wire Prod.

Perez's arguments read more into the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   emergency order than its terms provide. Accordingly, we find no error in the district court's ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The district court properly held that the Agency did not impose an\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   requirement for permanent custody orders within the SIJ application process.

Their fatal error primarily relates to the failure to adhere to North Carolina state law concerning child custody orders, particularly as to the custody of Felipe. As explained further below, I would reverse the immigration rulings and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The USCIS has erroneously decided that an applicant for SIJ status must produce a \"permanent\" custody order. The Agency predicates this requirement on a faulty reading of the INA, which governs SIJ eligibility. Felipe challenges that interpretation, which led the Agency to wrongfully deny his SIJ application. My friends in the panel majority, however, have not resolved this straightforward question of statutory construction and have thereby committed two errors. First, the majority mistakenly applies a deferential standard of review to the Agency's flawed interpretation. Second, by avoiding that interpretive issue, the majority tacitly accepts the Agency's requirement that a custody order supporting an SIJ application must be \"permanent.\" That requirement, however, finds no support in the INA. Absent a clear directive from Congress, long-standing principles of federalism compel our deference to state law in the sensitive area of domestic relations, which encompasses such custody determinations. Because the North Carolina district court issued a valid custody order regarding Perez, both the Agency and this Court are obliged to respect it. The Agency erred in denying Perez's SIJ application, and I therefore dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   To start, it is necessary to clarify the standard of review that governs Felipe's appeal. The majority opinion correctly explains that a challenge to an agency decision-specifically, the denial of Felipe's SIJ application by the USCIS-is subject to review under the APA. That is, we should only set aside that denial if it is \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A).

The Agency and the AAO did not merely \"evaluate whether the particular [custody] order presented by Perez\" satisfied the SIJ provision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   at 853. That is, the proper focus of our review is not whether the Agency correctly assessed the particular facts of Felipe's SIJ application. Rather, the Agency's denial of his SIJ application makes clear that the Agency has adopted a specific interpretation of the SIJ statutory provision, and that it denied his application for SIJ status on the basis of that interpretation. More specifically, the Agency reads the statutory requirement that an SIJ applicant\n   be \"under the custody of\" an agency or individual in the United States to require a\n   <em>\n    permanent\n   </em>\n   custody order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 27.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   And the Agency and AAO denied Felipe's application because the North Carolina custody order he submitted with his application apparently lacked such permanence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 22-23, 26-27. The question presented, therefore, is one of statutory interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   This crucial point bears further explanation, since it marks where I diverge from my colleagues. The panel majority opines that the Agency and AAO did not impose \"a categorical permanency requirement\" on a child's custody order required for SIJ eligibility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   at 853. It is this mistaken view of the immigration rulings that leads the majority to erroneously apply the deferential arbitrary and capricious standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 852, 852-53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The decisions of the Agency and AAO as to Felipe Perez belie that conclusion. In their rulings, the immigration authorities fault the temporary nature of Felipe's custody order and explicitly deny his application on that basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 27 (As the Agency emphasized in this case, \"the [North Carolina] court order submitted is expressly temporary in nature and does not make a finding that reunification with one or both parents is permanently not viable.\");\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 22 (The AAO further explained: \"Accordingly, the [North Carolina]\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   emergency order was not a qualifying juvenile court order ... because there was no finality to the proceedings.\"). Notably, the Government's brief on appeal seeks to sustain the Agency's denial of Felipe's application on that specific ground.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Br. of Appellee 20, 24. Although \"the AAO does not use the word permanent\" in its rejection of Perez's custody order, that point is irrelevant when the Agency has repeatedly faulted the custody order as \"temporary\" and lacking \"finality\"-that is, for not being permanent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   at 853; J.A. 22-23, 26-27.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In sum, the Agency rulings make clear-beyond peradventure-that the Agency interprets the SIJ provision to require a permanent custody order. Moreover, the Agency has openly adopted that interpretation in their policy manual, as discussed below.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 186-87. Accordingly, our review today turns only on whether the Agency's interpretation of the term \"custody,\" as used in the SIJ provision, is correct as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Recognizing that Felipe's appeal challenges the Agency's interpretation of a federal statute, the question becomes whether we owe any deference to that interpretation. Notably, the record offers no evidence that the Agency arrived at its understanding of the SIJ provision through formal rule-making or some other process that would endow its view with the force of law. As a result, the significant deference afforded to decisions that result from such processes under the\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   doctrine does not apply here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

As discussed above, nothing in federal law disqualifies such awards of temporary custody-duly rendered by the appropriate state court-from satisfying the SIJ provision.

Congress has in no way demonstrated its intention to limit the force of such decisions in the immigration context.

Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11206689\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/131/851/\">\n    131 N.C.App. 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=509%20S.E.2d%20452\">\n    509 S.E.2d 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 454-55 (N.C. Ct. App. 1998) (explaining that temporary custody order has set expiration whereas permanent custody order is intended to last indefinitely). Put succinctly, the meaning of custody under North Carolina law does not exclude temporary orders from the definition of that term.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Peters v. Pennington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3821987\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/210/1/\">\n    210 N.C.App. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=707%20S.E.2d%20724\">\n    707 S.E.2d 724\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 736 (2011) (defining custody as \"the right and responsibility to make decisions with important and long-term implications for a child's best interest and welfare\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 50A-102(3) (defining a \"child-custody determination\" as a court order \"providing for the legal custody, physical custody or visitation with respect to a child\" and explaining that \"[t]he term includes a permanent, temporary, initial, and modification order\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   As to the custody order secured for Felipe from the Mecklenburg County district court, it is true, as the majority observes, that the order was entered under the district court's temporary emergency powers pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 50A-204.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 127. That provision's grant of jurisdiction, however, is not an empty one-it confers on the state court the power to make a child-custody determination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 50A-204(b) - (d). And the North Carolina court made such a determination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 129 (order granting \"emergency temporary custody and control\" of Felipe to his brother). Again, there is absolutely nothing in North Carolina law that suggests that such a temporary award of custody does not, in fact, confer custody. In these circumstances, the Agency's unwarranted rejection of Perez's custody order for lacking \"permanence\" is particularly troubling. The Agency's flawed reading of the SIJ provision yields the untenable result that a federal agency has decided that an entire category of state court custody orders-any order issued in North Carolina pursuant to that state's emergency custody statute-has no effect for purposes of the SIJ provision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   North Carolina distinguishes between temporary and permanent custody orders for other purposes. For example, the temporal scope of a custody order has implications\n   for a court's ability to modify that order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Woodring v. Woodring\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4220967\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/227/638/\">\n    227 N.C.App. 638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=745%20S.E.2d%2013\">\n    745 S.E.2d 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 17-18 (2013). Moreover, as the majority argues, emergency temporary orders-like the one issued as to Felipe-cannot terminate the parental rights of the child's parents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re N.T.U.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12169328\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/234/722/#p725\">\n    234 N.C.App. 722\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=760%20S.E.2d%2049\">\n    760 S.E.2d 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 52-53 (2014). But that rule does not preclude an award of custody to some other person while the parents' rights are finally adjudicated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kanellos v. Kanellos,\n   </em>\n   ---- N.C.App, ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12647014\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/795/225/#p229\">\n    795 S.E.2d 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 229 (N.C. Ct. App. 2016) (explaining that a temporary custody order establishes \"a party's right to custody of a child pending the resolution of a claim for permanent custody\"). Thus, it is clear that, although there may be limits to the consequences of a temporary custody order, nothing in North Carolina law demonstrates that such an order does not, in fact, confer custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Because I would reverse and remand, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    Citations herein to \"J.A. __\" refer to the contents of the Joint Appendix filed by the parties in this appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    The Agency explained its rejection of Felipe's SIJ application by referring to his custody order as \"expressly temporary\" three separate times.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    J.A. 26-27.
