GRAVES, Jr., Circuit Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Oscar Virgilio Perdomo (Perdomo) pleaded guilty to illegal reentry following deportation. On appeal, Perdomo argued that the district court erred by entering a judgment reflecting that he was convicted under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2) rather than \u00a7 1326(b)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Perdomo maintained he did not have a qualifying conviction for an aggravated felony because his prior conviction in Arkansas for residential burglary did not qualify as the enumerated offense of burglary under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(43)(G), nor did it qualify under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F) 's definition of aggravated felony, which incorporated the \"crime of violence\" definition from\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2016\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Perdomo argued that Arkansas residential burglary did not have as an element the \"use of force\" required under \u00a7 16(a), and that \u00a7 16(b) was unconstitutional on its face. Because at the time we first considered Perdomo's argument\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Dimaya\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/\">\n    138 S.Ct. 1204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/\">\n    200 L.Ed.2d 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018), holding that \u00a7 16(b) was unconstitutionally vague and abrogating\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez-Longoria\n   </em>\n   . The Supreme Court then granted Perdomo's petition, vacated this court's judgment, and remanded the case for further consideration in light of\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On remand, the parties' filed a joint 28j letter, agreeing that in light of\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   , Perdomo's prior conviction for residential burglary in Arkansas is not a qualifying aggravated felony under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F) as it does not have the requisite element of force under \u00a7 16(a) and \u00a7 16(b) is no longer constitutional in this context. The parties alerted us that the remaining issue in this matter-whether Arkansas' residential burglary offense qualifies as a generic \"burglary offense\" under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G) -was being squarely addressed in a separate case before the Supreme Court,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The parties agreed that if the issue were resolved \"against\" Perdomo, the district court's judgment should be affirmed; however, if the issue were resolved in Perdomo's favor, the case should be remanded to the district court for reformation of the judgment. They requested we hold this case in abeyance pending the resolution of\n   <em>\n    Sims\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We complied, and the Supreme Court subsequently issued its opinion in\n   <em>\n    United States v.
