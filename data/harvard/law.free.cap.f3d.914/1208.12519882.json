Crombie. In March 2010, Crombie co-founded Paron Capital Management, LLC (\"Paron\"), an investment firm. Paron used a computer model developed by Crombie to invest in certain futures\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   on behalf of clients. The\n   Commission alleged that Crombie misled potential investors by misrepresenting in marketing materials the past performance of Paron's computer model and misstating the amount of assets already under Paron's management, in violation of 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6b(a)(1) and 6\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   (1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Commission also alleged that Crombie made false statements to the National Futures Association (\"NFA\") during a March 2011 investigation by that industry group into Paron. The Commission claimed that by making these misstatements to the NFA, Crombie violated\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2013\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4), which makes it unlawful \"willfully\" to make false statements or provide false documents to certain regulatory organizations, including the NFA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Commission filed suit in the Northern District of California in September 2011. After discovery, the district court granted summary judgment to the Commission. The court determined that Crombie violated \u00a7 13(a)(4) on four separate occasions, and that Crombie also violated \u00a7\u00a7 6b(a)(1)(A)-(B) and 6\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   (1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Because the Commission did not request any relief in its summary judgment motion, the district court ordered the Commission to file a motion for requested relief and a proposed judgment. The Commission filed that motion and a proposed order and judgment two weeks later, in August 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In November 2013, the district court granted the Commission's motion in an order that almost entirely adopted the language of the Commission's proposed order, without explaining why the particular relief was chosen. The order requires Crombie to pay a $750,000 civil penalty to the Commission and $746,460.28 in restitution, plus pre- and post-judgment interest, to Paron clients. The order also permanently enjoins Crombie from violating various provisions of the Act, as well as from engaging in a broad range of conduct related to the trading of investments regulated by the Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Among other provisions,\n   the order permanently enjoins Crombie from \"directly or indirectly ... [e]ntering into any transactions involving commodity futures, options on commodity futures, commodity options ..., security futures products, swaps, ... and/or foreign currency ... for his own personal account or for any account in which he has a direct or indirect interest,\" or \"[h]aving any commodity futures, options on commodity futures, commodity options, security futures products, swaps, and/or [foreign currency] contracts traded on his behalf.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Crombie now appeals the district court's grant of summary judgment to the Commission. We review this challenge de novo.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Rocky Mountain Farmers Union v.

Crombie does not contest that he made false statements to the NFA during its investigation of Paron. He argues only that the district court misinterpreted the meaning of \"willfully\" for the purposes of the \u00a7 13(a)(4) claims, and that under the correct standard, there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether he acted willfully when he made three separate false statements to the NFA during its investigation of Paron.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    1\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"The word 'willfully' is sometimes said to be 'a word of many meanings.' \"\n   <em>\n    Bryan v.

When adjudicating the \u00a7 13(a)(4) claims on summary judgment, the district court applied the civil meaning of \"willfully,\" not the generally applicable criminal meaning. The Commission maintains that the district court was correct, because the Commission is pursuing violations of \u00a7 13(a)(4) via a civil suit. We cannot agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The term \"willfully\" appears in \u00a7 13(a)(4), a criminal provision of the Act,\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   in \u00a7 13a-1(a), the provision of the Act permitting civil enforcement. Nor does \u00a7 13a-1(a) prescribe a separate mens rea that applies in civil-enforcement proceedings. It just states that the Commission may bring an action to enforce compliance with \"any provision\" of the Act. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 13a-1(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Given this context, the meaning of \"willfully\" as used in \u00a7 13(a)(4) cannot sensibly vary depending on whether it is relied upon directly, in a criminal fraud case, or by incorporation into \u00a7 13a-1(a), in a civil case. And because it appears in a criminal statute, \"willfully\" means \"intentionally undertaking an act that one knows to be wrongful; 'willfully' in this context does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   require that the actor know specifically that the conduct was unlawful.\"\n   <em>\n    Tarallo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9214817\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/380/1174/#p1188\">\n    380 F.3d at 1188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The statements provided by Crombie stated that the JDC-managed accounts were worth over $13.8 million in February 2008, and over $24 million in December 2008. In fact, the accounts had a steady balance of only $40 from late 2007 onward; had no trades in 2008; and closed in February 2008. At his deposition, Crombie testified that he was aware of the day-to-day performance of the accounts he had managed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   These facts unequivocally establish that when Crombie provided the NFA the inaccurate account statements, he acted willfully. Crombie either knew the statements he provided to the NFA misrepresented the value of the JDC-managed accounts, or he provided those statements to the NFA \"with a reckless disregard for whether they were false.\"\n   <em>\n    Tarallo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9214817\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/380/1174/#p1188\">\n    380 F.3d at 1188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   During the NFA's investigation, Crombie also misrepresented the nature of a $200,000 payment Crombie made to Paul Porteous in May 2009. Crombie told the NFA that he had paid Porteous $200,000 in exchange for Porteous's share in JDC. In fact, as Crombie later admitted during this litigation, Crombie owed Porteous $1.15 million, and the $200,000 payment was made in partial repayment of that debt. Again, these facts make clear that Crombie either \"made statements [to the NFA] that he knew at the time were false, or else made them with a reckless disregard for whether they were false.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9214817\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/380/1174/#p1188\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Finally, Crombie told the NFA during its investigation that Steven Lamar had paid JDC $300,000 in exchange for certain financial advice JDC provided to Lamar's hedge fund. In his statement, Crombie told the NFA that the $300,000 payment was made in two separate transfers, one of which was a $50,000 transfer made on May 4, 2009. Later in the investigation, however, Crombie told the NFA that the $50,000 payment made on May 4, 2009, was an investment in JDC. Eventually, during litigation, he admitted that the $50,000 payment was in fact a loan made to JDC by Lamar's hedge fund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Crombie argues that, because he used the terms \"loan\" and \"investment\" interchangeably, he was not acting willfully when he made these false representations. But Crombie did not initially describe the $50,000 payment as either an investment or a loan; he first described the payment as a fee for services rendered. This description was undoubtedly false, and Crombie had to know the description was false. There is thus no genuine issue as to whether Crombie acted willfully when he misrepresented the nature of the $50,000 payment to the NFA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The district court was also correct to grant summary judgment to the Commission on its claims that Crombie misled investors in violation of 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6b(a)(1)(A)-(B) and 6\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   (1), two provisions of the Act that prohibit certain fraudulent conduct in connection with the trading of commodities and futures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The basic facts underlying these claims are as follows: Paron's marketing materials stated that Paron managed $35 million, including one account with $20 million. But Paron in fact managed only $15 million. The largest managed account contained only $6 million. The marketing materials also misrepresented certain performance figures for the JDC-managed accounts. For example, Paron represented in the marketing materials that JDC-managed accounts generated returns of 38.6 percent in 2008; but as discussed above, those accounts in fact had a steady balance of $40 starting in late 2007; had no trades in 2008; and closed in February 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Crombie does not dispute these facts. He argues only that there is a genuine dispute of material fact regarding whether Crombie possessed the mental state necessary to violate \u00a7 6b(a)(1)(A)-(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Section 6b(a)(1)(A)-(B) makes it unlawful for any person \"to cheat or defraud,\" or \"willfully to make or cause to be made to [another] person any false report or statement\" in connection with certain commodity-related transactions. A showing of scienter is necessary to establish a violation \u00a7 6b(a)(1)(A)-(B) ; in other words, the defendant \"must have known that he was cheating\" or \"known the report was false,\" as the case may be.\n   <em>\n    CFTC v.

Crombie was thus aware that the accounts JDC managed consistently had $40 in assets while open in 2008, and closed completely in February of that year. Even though Crombie received third-party reports that purported to verify the 38.6 percent performance figure, he could not have legitimately believed that the accounts JDC managed had generated 38.6 percent returns, given what he knew about those accounts.

Based on these facts, rescission of the contracts entered into as a result of fraud was an appropriate equitable remedy.

But the Commission submitted a declaration explaining how the restitutionary amount adopted by the district court was arrived upon. As noted, Crombie only challenges the legal propriety of the Commission's victim-based theory of restitution, not the calculation of the restitution amount if the approach taken is permissible. As we have concluded that the method of determining restitution used by the district court was legally permissible, to require a further explanation by the district court would be an empty formality.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Traxler v.

Much of the Permanent Injunction restrains Crombie from violating various provisions of the Act. Other provisions forbid him from engaging in trading in covered financial products and registering to do so. As to all such provisions-\u00a7\u00a7 4 and 5(a), (d), (e), (f), and (g) of the Permanent Injunction-the connection between the violations found and the prohibitions are sufficiently self-evident that we can-and do-conclude that the district court's inclusion of those future restraints on Crombie was not an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   As to two other sections of the Permanent Injunction, however, the path from the violations found to the prohibitions ordered is not as clear. Sections 5(b), and (c)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   of the Permanent Injunction forbid Crombie from engaging in covered transactions \"for his own personal account or for any account in which he has a direct or indirect interest,\" or from having any such trades made on his behalf. As we cannot readily discern how these prohibitions are connected to preventing future violations similar to those that Crombie has committed, we cannot conduct meaningful abuse of discretion review without further explanation.
