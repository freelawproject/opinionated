Saybolt LP, a petroleum products company, used the FWW method to calculate overtime\n   compensation for some of its oil and gas inspectors who worked radically varying hours each week. These inspectors also received incentive payments for working less desirable hours during the workweek. A group of these inspectors (\"the plaintiffs\"), sued Saybolt, alleging that the incentive payments precluded use of the FWW method and placed their employer in violation of the FLSA. The plaintiffs claimed that Saybolt's violation was willful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The district court held that Saybolt's payment scheme violated the FLSA, but the violation was not willful. The district court adopted the plaintiffs' model for calculating damages after concluding that Saybolt was judicially estopped from challenging this model. The district court also awarded liquidated damages. We affirm the district court's conclusions as to liability and willfulness, reverse the district court's ruling on estoppel and its calculation of damages, vacate the district court's order on liquidated damages, and remand for reconsideration of the liquidated damages award and for reconsideration of its calculation of damages in accordance with this opinion and entry of an appropriate judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Saybolt's Payment Scheme and the FWW Method\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The FLSA requires that nonexempt employees receive an overtime premium of not less than one and one-half times their \"regular rate of pay\" for each hour worked over 40 hours in a given workweek.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Until February 2012, Saybolt used two different methods to pay overtime. Saybolt paid one group of inspectors (\"the non-FWW inspectors\") using the FLSA's standard time and one-half method. These inspectors earned one and one-half times their \"regular rate\" for every hour worked over 40. The \"regular rate\" for salaried employees is simply the salary divided by the number of hours the salary is intended to compensate.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20778.113\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 778.113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). A non-FWW inspector earning $600 for an intended 40-hour workweek would thus have a \"regular rate\" of $15.00 per hour (the $600 base salary divided by 40 hours). The non-FWW inspector's \"overtime rate\" would be one and one-half times the \"regular rate\"-here, $22.50 per hour (one and one-half times the $15.00 \"regular rate\"). Thus, in a workweek in which the non-FWW inspector worked 60 hours (instead of the intended 40 hours), the non-FWW inspector would receive the $600 base salary plus a $450 overtime premium (20 overtime hours times the $22.50 \"overtime rate\") for a total weekly compensation of $1050.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A second group of Saybolt inspectors (\"the FWW inspectors\") received overtime compensation under the FWW method. Federal regulations state that this method is appropriate when an employee works hours that fluctuate from week to week and the employee agrees that a fixed weekly salary will constitute straight-time pay (i.e., non-overtime pay) for all the hours worked in a week, however many or few.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20778.113\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 778.114(a). Accordingly, FWW inspectors received the same weekly base salary, regardless whether they worked 60 hours or only 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Calculation of overtime premiums under the FWW method is different from the standard FLSA method in several respects. First, the \"regular rate\" under the FWW method is determined by dividing the weekly base salary by the total number of hours an employee actually works during the week. This is an application of the principle that the \"regular rate\" equals the weekly salary divided by \"the number of hours which the salary is intended to compensate.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 778.113(a). In the FWW context, \"the salary is intended to\n   compensate\" all hours an employee actually works. Because the hours actually worked each week fluctuate, the \"regular rate\" under the FWW method will fluctuate from week to week as well.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20778.113\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 778.114(a). As the hours worked increase, the \"regular rate\" will decrease. Therefore, assuming a $600 weekly base salary and 40 hours actually worked during the week, the FWW method would yield a \"regular rate\" of $15.00 per hour (the $600 base salary divided by 40 hours). But a 60-hour workweek would yield a \"regular rate\" of $10.00 per hour (the $600 base salary divided by 60 hours).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Another key difference under the FWW method is that the \"overtime rate\" is one-half, instead of one and one-half, times the \"regular rate.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20778.113\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The reason for this is, again, that the fixed weekly salary is meant to compensate all hours worked, including overtime hours. Before receiving an overtime premium, an employee has already agreed to be compensated according to the \"regular rate\" for every overtime hour worked.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20778.113\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The employee need receive only an additional one-half times the \"regular rate\" to satisfy the FLSA's one and one-half times requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20778.113\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In a 60-hour workweek, then, an employee would receive an \"overtime rate\" of $5.00 per hour (one half times the $10 \"regular rate\"). The total overtime premium would be $100 (20 overtime hours times the $5.00 \"overtime rate\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Under Saybolt's payment scheme, FWW inspectors were purportedly paid overtime under the FWW method. But the company also paid incentive payments for working on a scheduled day off (\"day-off pay\"), working at sea (\"offshore pay\"), and working on a scheduled holiday (\"holiday pay\"). Non-FWW inspectors were ineligible for these incentives. When calculating the \"regular rate,\" Saybolt added weekly incentive payments to the weekly base salary. Therefore, if a FWW inspector had a weekly base salary of $600, earned $150 in incentive payments, and worked a 60-hour workweek, the \"regular rate\" for that week would be $12.50 per hour ($600 base salary plus incentive payments of $150 for a total of $750 divided by the 60 hours worked). The \"overtime rate\" would be $6.25 per hour (one half times the $12.50 \"regular rate\"), resulting in an overtime premium of $125 (20 overtime hours times the $6.25 \"overtime rate\"). The FWW inspector's total compensation for the 60-hour week would be $875 ($600 base salary plus $150 incentive pay plus $125 overtime premium).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Saybolt's Legal Advice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Saybolt communicated with outside counsel to assess whether the FWW method allowed for additional incentive payments. In May 2009, Saybolt contacted attorney Robert Ivey. Ivey counseled Saybolt that combining incentive payments with the FWW method was a \"potential issue.\" Ivey explained that several district courts and the First Circuit had concluded that paying hours-based premiums in addition to a weekly salary precluded the use of the FWW method. But Ivey also explained that the Fifth Circuit had not addressed the question and that the Department\n   of Labor (\"DOL\") had issued proposed regulations in 2008 that would allow the payment of incentives under the FWW method.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Saybolt contacted Joseph Maddaloni, another outside attorney, in January 2010. Saybolt forwarded Ivey's recommendation to Maddaloni and said that it was \"seeking a final opinion and recommendation in order to bring closure to this pay practice.\" Maddaloni said he disagreed with the court decisions rejecting the use of incentive payments under the FWW method. But Maddaloni conceded that the judges involved were well respected and that a New Jersey district court would likely find their reasoning persuasive. Maddaloni concluded that \"while I have always taken the position that Saybolt's use and application of the FWW was defensible, I am concerned that under the present state of the law and the facts that may no longer hold true.\" Maddaloni later testified that he had considered the law on this issue to be unsettled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Proceedings in the District Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In January 2010, Joseph Dacar, on behalf of Saybolt inspectors paid under the FWW method, filed a collective action complaint in the Eastern District of North Carolina. A year later, the case was transferred to the Southern District of Texas, and the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, alleging that (1) Saybolt did not comply with the requirements for using the FWW method and (2) Saybolt willfully violated the FLSA. The complaint also substituted Lyle Deroche and Felton Ravia as named plaintiffs in place of Dacar. The district court conditionally certified a collective action in June 2011, and a total of 112 employees and former employees opted into the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In January 2013, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Saybolt moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of willfulness; the plaintiffs moved for summary judgment on willfulness, liability, damage calculation, and liquidated damages. In August 2014, the district court granted Saybolt's motion and held that Saybolt's violation, if any, was not willful. The plaintiffs moved for reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In December 2015, the district court denied the plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration but granted, in part, their motion for summary judgment. The district court held that Saybolt had violated the FWW method because the plaintiffs were not paid a \"fixed salary,\" that liquidated damages were appropriate, and that damages should not be offset by the incentive payments the plaintiffs already received.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In December 2016, the district court held a hearing on damages. The district court asked the parties to brief any remaining issues related to the damages calculation. Saybolt's brief contended that the \"regular rate\" for calculating overtime damages should be based on the plaintiffs' hours actually worked-not on a 40-hour workweek-and that overtime hours should be multiplied by one half-not one and one-half-times that \"regular rate.\" The district court held that Saybolt was judicially estopped from contesting the appropriate damages model and ordered damages of $3,020,813.21 plus an equal amount in liquidated damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The plaintiffs timely appealed the district court's partial grant of summary judgment on Saybolt's willfulness. Saybolt cross-appealed the district court's summary judgment on liability and damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A district court's grant or denial of summary judgment is reviewed de novo, applying the same standards as the district\n   court.\n   <em>\n    Castellanos-Contreras v.

But the \"holiday pay\" in\n   <em>\n    Aiken\n   </em>\n   was a \"fringe benefit\" paid whether or not an employee actually worked the \"holiday hours.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"973390\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/977/390/#p397\">\n    977 F.Supp. at 397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, though the\n   <em>\n    Aiken\n   </em>\n   employees' total compensation included the \"holiday pay,\" their salaries did not increase or decrease because of the hours they worked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Second, Saybolt contends that the First Circuit's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Lalli v. General Nutrition Centers, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , undermines\n   <em>\n    O'Brien\n   </em>\n   by holding that the payment of\n   additional commissions is compatible with the FWW method.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4143729\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/814/1/#p4\">\n    814 F.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 4-10 (1st Cir. 2016). In\n   <em>\n    Lalli\n   </em>\n   , however, the First Circuit reaffirmed\n   <em>\n    O'Brien\n   </em>\n   , and held that the \"time-based bonuses\" addressed in\n   <em>\n    O'Brien\n   </em>\n   are distinct from \"performance-based bonuses\" like commissions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4143729\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/814/1/#p4\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4143729\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/814/1/#p4\">\n    at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Time-based bonuses, unlike performance-based commissions, run afoul of the FWW regulations because they make weekly pay dependent on the type of hours worked. Saybolt's incentives are \"time-based bonuses\" because they depend on the kind and number of hours worked-i.e. day-off hours, off-shore hours, or holiday hours. Under\n   <em>\n    Lalli\n   </em>\n   , as under\n   <em>\n    O'Brien\n   </em>\n   , Saybolt's payment scheme is incompatible with the FWW requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In sum, we hold that Saybolt failed to comply with the FWW method, and, therefore, its use of that method to calculate the FWW inspectors' overtime premiums was erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Willfulness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   If a plaintiff can demonstrate that a defendant's violation of the FLSA was willful, then the limitations period is extended from two to three years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20255\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

The district court held that there was no evidence that Saybolt violated the FLSA intentionally or recklessly. Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, we agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Evidence that a defendant was merely negligent regarding FLSA requirements is insufficient to show willfulness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Steele v. Leasing Enters.,Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324558\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/826/237/#p248\">\n    826 F.3d 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 248 (5th Cir. 2016). Here, it is not even clear that Saybolt's conduct was negligent: (1) Saybolt twice sought the advice of legal counsel to ensure compliance with the FLSA; (2) Saybolt knew from these communications that the relevant legal issue was unsettled and had not been addressed in the Fifth Circuit; and (3) Saybolt knew that the DOL had issued proposed regulations that would vindicate its application of the FWW method. Ultimately, of course, Saybolt's view of the law, though not irrational, was rejected. After the plaintiffs filed this lawsuit in January 2011, more district courts held that incentive payments were incompatible with the FWW regulations.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Brumley v. Camin Cargo Control, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 08-1798 (JLL),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%201644066\">\n    2010 WL 1644066\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.N.J. April 22, 2010). Then, in 2011, the DOL's final rule affirmed this position and a district court in this circuit held accordingly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brantley,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3955983\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/821/879/#p888\">\n    821 F.Supp.2d at 889-90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At this point, Saybolt transitioned away from paying inspectors under the challenged method. Even subject to hindsight bias, these facts do not suggest an intentional or reckless violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The plaintiffs contend that the legal opinions of Ivey and Maddaloni cast doubt on the continuing viability of Saybolt's payment procedure. But both attorneys also communicated that the legal landscape was unsettled even if courts within the First Circuit would likely rule against Saybolt's payment method. The plaintiffs also cite the existence of a 2009 lawsuit in New York regarding the legality of Saybolt's pay practices.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lauer v. Saybolt LP\n   </em>\n   , No. 09-CV-3442,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%201992008\">\n    2010 WL 1992008\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D.N.Y. May 17, 2010). This lawsuit settled without a final ruling on the merits to resolve the legality of the payment scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In sum, the plaintiffs offer no evidence from which a court could infer that Saybolt willfully violated the FLSA. This conclusion does not mean that an absence of controlling authority or reliance on advice of counsel or the existence of proposed regulations necessarily preclude a willfulness determination. But in this case, all three countervailing considerations are present, and the plaintiffs have not created an issue of disputed fact regarding Saybolt's willfulness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Judicial Estoppel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The district court held that Saybolt was judicially estopped from challenging the methodology used to calculate overtime damages. The doctrine of judicial estoppel is appropriate when (1) a party has asserted a position that is plainly inconsistent with a previously asserted position, (2) the earlier position was accepted by the court, and (3) the party did not act inadvertently.\n   <em>\n    Reed v. City of Arlington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4183150,5874983\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/650/571/\">\n    650 F.3d 571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 574 (5th Cir. 2011) (en banc). Under this standard, the district court was mistaken about the nature of Saybolt's arguments and erred in applying judicial estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Before the district court entered summary judgment, Saybolt suggested that damages, if any, should be based on what the plaintiffs would have earned under a non-FWW payment scheme. Saybolt's own non-FWW inspectors would serve as comparators. Because non-FWW inspectors were not eligible for incentive payments, Saybolt argued that any incentives the plaintiffs earned should offset the damages or, at least, should not be included in the \"regular rate\" used to calculate damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   At summary judgment, the district court rejected the non-FWW comparator model by holding that incentive payments must be included in the \"regular rate\" calculation and could not offset damages. The court did not otherwise determine how damages would be calculated. Almost a year later, the district court held its hearing on damages and asked for final briefing on the issue. Saybolt's brief argued that the FWW method should be used to calculate damages. That is, the \"regular rate\" should be calculated by dividing total compensation (base salary plus incentives) by all the hours actually worked by the plaintiffs and that the \"overtime rate\" for calculating damages should be one-half times the \"regular rate.\" The district court held that Saybolt was judicially estopped from making these arguments because Saybolt had previously argued that the \"regular rate\" for damage calculation could be based on a 40-hour workweek and that the plaintiffs could receive an \"overtime rate\" of one and one-half times that \"regular rate.\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Saybolt's initial position-that damages should be calculated using non-FWW inspectors as comparators-was not plainly inconsistent with its subsequent argument that damages should be calculated under the FWW method.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hall v. GE Plastic Pac. PTE Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9136184\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/327/391/#p398\">\n    327 F.3d 391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 398 (5th Cir. 2003) (party estopped from arguing defective product manufactured by company A because it initially argued that company B manufactured the product);\n   <em>\n    Love\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3871440,5732196\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/677/258/\">\n    677 F.3d at 262-63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (debtor estopped from pursuing damages claim because he had told bankruptcy court he possessed no potential claims). In arguing for the comparator model, Saybolt never conceded that the FWW plaintiffs were paid based on a 40-hour workweek or were owed overtime at one and one-half times the \"regular rate.\" There was thus no inconsistency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Nor did the district court accept Saybolt's initial position as is required for judicial estoppel. Indeed, the court rejected the comparator model by requiring that incentive payments be included in the\n   \"regular rate\" calculation. This is why Saybolt fell back on the alternative argument that, since incentive payments must be included, the FWW method should be used to calculate the plaintiffs' damages. Accordingly, the district court erred in holding that Saybolt was judicially estopped from challenging the plaintiffs' damages model.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   An employer who violates the FLSA's overtime requirements is \"liable to the employee or employees affected in the amount of ... their unpaid overtime compensation.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20216\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court adopted the plaintiffs' damages model, under which the \"regular rate\" for calculating overtime is based on a 40-hour workweek and the \"overtime rate\" equals one and one-half times the \"regular rate.\" The plaintiffs' model leaves them with significantly more overtime compensation than they originally earned under Saybolt's application of the FWW method. This is because their model employs a hypothetical 40-hour divisor, which augments the \"regular rate.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Because judicial estoppel does not prevent Saybolt from challenging the plaintiffs' model, we may consider the alternative models that Saybolt has proposed. To begin with, we note that this is a difficult case in which to estimate the plaintiffs' \"unpaid overtime compensation.\" It is not a misclassification case in which the plaintiffs were never paid overtime at all.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hills v. Entergy Operations, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275568\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/866/610/#p613\">\n    866 F.3d 610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 613 (5th Cir. 2017). The plaintiffs have already received an overtime premium under the FWW method. Nor is this a case in which incentive payments were erroneously omitted from the \"regular rate\" calculation, thereby diminishing overtime premiums.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    O'Brien\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9051363\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/350/279/#p288\">\n    350 F.3d at 295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Saybolt added the incentive payments to the base salary, thereby increasing the \"regular rate,\" the \"overtime rate,\" and the resulting overtime premiums.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Saybolt proposes that the Court assess damages by looking to its non-FWW comparator inspectors. However, Saybolt has not thoroughly argued this method of damages on appeal or explained how the non-FWW comparators provide a sufficient empirical basis to make the damages model feasible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Saybolt's fallback damages methodology contains two separable elements: (1) the \"regular rate\" should be calculated using a denominator of all hours actually worked and not a hypothetical 40-hour denominator and (2) the plaintiffs should receive only one-half times this \"regular rate\" instead\n   of the one and one-half times awarded by the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   DOL regulations and relevant case law establish that the \"regular rate\" should be calculated based on the number of hours the plaintiffs' salary was intended to compensate. There is no 40-hour \"default\" for calculating the \"regular rate,\" as the plaintiffs suggest. To the contrary, DOL regulations state that the \"regular rate\" is \"determined by dividing [an employee's] total remuneration for employment ... in any workweek\n   <em>\n    by the total number of hours actually worked by him in that workweek for which such compensation was paid\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20778.109\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 778.109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Likewise, the regulation pertaining to salaried employees specifies that the \"regular rate\" should be computed by \"dividing the salary by the number of hours which the salary is intended to compensate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 778.113. These regulations reflect the Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Overnight Motor Transportation Company v. Missel\n   </em>\n   that \"[w]age divided by hours equals regular rate,\" and the \"regular rate\" formula is no different when a salary is intended to compensate hours that fluctuate from week to week.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"368141\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/316/572/\">\n    316 U.S. 572\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 580 n.16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"368141\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/316/572/\">\n    62 S.Ct. 1216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1221 n.16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"368141\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/316/572/\">\n    86 L.Ed. 1682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1942).

Under these circumstances, it does not matter that the FWW regulations are inapplicable. For instance, in\n   <em>\n    Singer\n   </em>\n   , the firefighter plaintiffs worked 120 hours in one 14-day pay period and 96 hours in the next.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2160858\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/324/813/#p823\">\n    324 F.3d at 824\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The difference between the majority's approach and the dissent's approach is that the majority enforces the requirement set forth in \u00a7 778.114(a) that the employer must pay the employee a \"fixed salary.\" This requirement of a \"fixed salary\" has existed since \u00a7 778.114(a) was adopted in 1968. The final rule issued by the DOL in 2011 did not change the regulation. Instead, the rule concluded that a proposed regulation allowing inclusion of bona fide bonus payments and/or premium payments in the calculation of the regular rate was \"incompatible with the fluctuating workweek method of computing overtime under section 778.114.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=76%20Fed.%20Reg.%2018832\">\n    76 Fed.

Simply put, because the preconditions for application of the FWW method were not satisfied, Saybolt is not entitled to use that method.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Because Saybolt failed to pay its workers a \"fixed salary,\" we must also conclude that one and one-half is the applicable multiplier for calculating the proper amount of overtime pay owed. Accordingly, the district court did not err in using the one and one-half multiplier. Because we determine here that the appropriate denominator for calculating the regular rate includes all hours intended to be compensated, applying the one and one-half multiplier is not a windfall to the plaintiffs. It is merely the ordinary calculation of overtime mandated by the FLSA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    V.

The majority's proposed formula effects an illegal windfall for the plaintiffs, contrary to the Supreme Court and this court. I would remand for the district court to calculate damages using the FWW weekly wage actually paid by Saybolt, adding one-half times the hourly rate for each hour a plaintiff worked in excess of 40 hours. The majority's formulation, which affords a one-and-a-half hourly multiplier for overtime, overcompensates the plaintiffs. The majority fail to recognize the plaintiffs have already been paid, under the FWW method, a higher rate for weeks in which they worked less than 40 hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The majority premises this result on DOL's April 2011 final rule and on this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Singer\n   </em>\n   . Neither rationale holds water. Using the 2011 rule to impose damages on Saybolt before the final rule was promulgated is unfair. Worse, it confuses liability and damages. It is one thing to conclude that the case law did not support Saybolt's methodology before the 2011 rule came into force; it is another to retroactively apply the rule for the purpose of calculating damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Under the circumstances of this case, the majority's invocation of time-and-a-half for overtime contravenes the principle that the purpose of actual damages under the FLSA is to compensate employees for unpaid overtime-it is not to punish employers. Even a finding of willfulness does not impose exemplary damages on employers but merely lengthens the limitations period from two years to three.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20255\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

The one-half multiplier is more closely tied to Saybolt's attempt to invoke the FWW method. The FWW method's logic is that, where the employees agreed to receive a fixed salary for all hours worked in a pay period, and the actual hours worked varied below and above 40/week, then they have already received straight-time pay for their overtime and should receive only an additional one-half the \"regular rate\" for each overtime hour.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20778.114\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 778.114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The majority here do not take issue with the fact that these employees understood they were being compensated under the FWW regime for\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   hours they worked.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hanson v.

Apr. 16, 2015). The record also shows that these employees, in receiving FWW-based compensation, were paid more than their straight-time counterparts because Saybolt added monetary incentives for less attractive duty situations. Finally, as explained at the outset, the majority's formula overcompensates the plaintiffs beyond their actual damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The majority erroneously rely on two cases in an attempt to support their damage formula. As regards the FWW method, however, the footnote in\n   <em>\n    Singer v.

The employer there did not attempt to justify its wages based on an FWW calculation; the dispute was between a 120-hour and 96-hour workweek for certain kinds of first responders. The firefighters seemed to be contending that the court's overtime damages calculation was erroneously based on the FWW method, but they were simply wrong. All\n   <em>\n    Singer\n   </em>\n   says in this connection is that \"the usual method\" of calculating overtime,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , time-and-a-half, is appropriate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2160858\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/324/813/#p823\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court does not say this method is mandatory in every case. Nor do FLSA regulations mandate this damage measure because to do so would contravene the Supreme Court's holding that overtime damages are compensatory, not punitive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   It is also significant that in\n   <em>\n    Singer,\n   </em>\n   the court approves offsetting the time-and-a-half time owed for the firemen's \"long\" weeks by the amounts they were overcompensated\n   for every third \"short\" week.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Part VII of\n   <em>\n    Singer,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=324%20F.3d%20826\">\n    324 F.3d 826\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -28.

Regarding waiver, Saybolt pressed the arguments made on appeal multiple times before the entry of final judgment; they were thus properly presented to the court.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Keenan v. Tejeda\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9433249\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/290/252/#p262\">\n     290 F.3d 252\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 262 (5th Cir. 2002). For its part, the invited error doctrine \"prevents a party from complaining of errors that it induced the district court to make.\"\n    <em>\n     Feld Motor Sports, Inc. v.

As explained in the judicial estoppel analysis, the district court was not misled into adopting Saybolt's position.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    The 40-hour divisor-as opposed to using hours actually worked-augments the \"regular rate\" because an employee is only owed overtime when she actually works\n    <em>\n     more\n    </em>\n    than 40 hours. Thus, when calculating overtime compensation, using the hypothetical 40-hour divisor will always result in a larger \"regular rate.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    Because this damages model has not been adequately briefed, we leave for another day whether such a model, or any other damages model, may be appropriate in cases in which an employer fails to satisfy the requirements allowing use of the FWW method.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    Though the First Circuit remanded the case to the district court to calculate the actual overtime owed, the reasoning in the opinion did not give the district court discretion to apply the one-half multiplier because, as the court found, \u00a7 788.114 did not apply.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 287-90.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    As set forth above, a plaintiff is entitled to overtime pay for any week in which he worked in excess of 40 hours. To determine the amount of overtime compensation due, the district court should first determine a plaintiff's regular hourly rate of pay by dividing the total amount of remuneration paid in a workweek (\n    <em>\n     including incentive payments\n    </em>\n    ) by the total number of hours intended to be compensated (which, in this case, is the total number of hours actually worked) in that workweek.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20778.207\">\n     29 C.F.R. \u00a7 778.207\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b). The district should then compute the overtime rate by multiplying the regular rate times 1.5. The overtime rate should then be multiplied by the number of overtime hours worked in the workweek to arrive at the total amount of overtime compensation due for that week. Finally, that total amount should be reduced by the amount of overtime pay the plaintiff has already received from Saybolt for that workweek.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">\n     29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (h) (Describing which sums may be creditable toward overtime compensation). The remainder is the amount of overtime compensation due to the plaintiff.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    Consequently, there is significant logical appeal to Saybolt's initial proposal that the court should assess damages by looking to its non-FWW comparator inspectors. Saybolt acknowledges that this would be a novel method of calculating damages, but here the method seems to fit: the plaintiffs say they should not have been paid under the FWW method, and the non-FWW comparators' wages could demonstrate how the plaintiffs would have been paid absent the mistake. Saybolt, however, has not thoroughly argued this method of damages on appeal or explained how the non-FWW comparators provide a sufficient empirical basis to make the damages model feasible.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
