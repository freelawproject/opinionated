App. at 386, 391, 459, 486. They arrested Roman, who was present in the apartment, after they found drugs in a common area that was shared by multiple tenants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 399, 479. Though he was imprisoned for over six months and indicted for various drug offenses, the New Jersey Superior Court found the search to be unlawful and the charges were dropped.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Roman now brings claims against the City of Newark (which includes its Police Department) and various police officers under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (which gives a federal remedy against state officials who, acting under color of state law, deprive \"any citizen of the United States ... of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the [U.S.] Constitution and laws\") and New Jersey tort law. He alleges the City had a pattern or practice of constitutional violations and failed to train, supervise, and discipline its officers. He also pleads an unlawful search claim against the officers and contends they are liable for false imprisonment and malicious prosecution. The District Court dismissed all of the claims because they were inadequately pled.

He has adequately alleged that its Police Department had a custom of warrantless searches and false arrests. He also sufficiently pled that the Department failed to train, supervise, and discipline its officers, specifically with respect to \"the requirements of [the] Fourth Amendment and related law.\" App. at 160. Because Roman has stated plausible claims against the City, we vacate and remand the District Court's holding on municipal liability.

The District Court sided with them, dismissing the complaint in its entirety. It first addressed Roman's claim against the City and concluded the complaint \"fail[ed] to plead ... a custom or policy\" of unlawful searches and a failure to train or supervise officers.\n   <em>\n    Roman v.

Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 68, 73-74. Before discussing the merits of his claims, Roman directs our attention to the types of documents we may consider on a motion to dismiss. He contends we may review three sources that were provided to the District Court: an article published in the Newark\n   <em>\n    Star Ledger\n   </em>\n   (the \"\n   <em>\n    Star Ledger\n   </em>\n   article\"), a press release issued by the U.S. Attorney's Office (the \"press release\"), and a consent decree between the United States and the City of Newark (the \"consent decree\").

Roman also asks us to look at one other document: the Department of Justice's Report on the investigation of the Newark Police Department (the \"DOJ Report\"). Although he acknowledges the DOJ Report was never provided to the District Court, he now claims it is integral to the pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Though the Defendants dispute that we may consider the DOJ Report, they add that we also cannot consider the consent decree because \"no relevant provisions of [it] ... were ever cited ... to the District Court\" and it is inadmissible settlement material.

Finally, it provides disciplinary measures for police officers who engage in \"unlawful ... searches\" and \"false arrests.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 192. At the pleadings stage, a fair inference is that the consent decree was necessary because of Department-wide failures, not because one officer was last trained in 1995.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   This is enough to prove municipal liability because the City \"[knew] to a moral certainty\" that its officers would need to conduct searches.\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032186\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/378/#p388\">\n    489 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   390 n.10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032186\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/378/#p388\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, it misperceives the decree as concerning only police interactions with \"pedestrians or the occupants of vehicles,\" not home searches. Dissenting Op. at 809 (\"The consent decree says nothing about arrests and searches without consent that occur at residences ...\"). In fact, one concern of the decree was false arrests,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   App. at 158, which can occur both at home and on the street. And the decree does concern home searches: it sets parameters officers must follow before searching \"a home based upon consent.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Although Reyes by no means consented to the search here, she willingly opened her apartment door only because the police had used her friend Isaksem as a Trojan horse to gain entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Second, the dissent believes that the consent decree cannot help Roman's case because Roman was Hispanic.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dissenting Op. at 810 (\"[T]he decree addressed police practices that disparately impacted the black community. But that racial disparity did not apply to Roman, who was Hispanic.\"). To the contrary, the consent decree includes an entire section entitled \"Bias-Free Policing,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   App. at 165-67, that never restricts itself to bias against the black community. Instead, it provides that police officers must \"operate without bias based on\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   demographic category,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 166 (emphasis added), and specifically forbids officers from discriminating based on \"proxies for demographic category\" such as \"language ability,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 167. Plainly, the consent decree was meant to protect\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   Newark residents, including Hispanic residents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Further, we find it difficult to square the dissent's reasoning with the record evidence discussing the City's troubling practices around the time of Roman's search and arrest.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 134 (stating only one complaint out of 261 filed was sustained by department investigators);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 158 (prohibiting officers from relying on materially false information to justify a warrantless search);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 160 (requiring police officers to be trained on \"the requirements of [the] Fourth Amendment and related law\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 161 (mandating supervisory review of \"searches that appear to be without legal justification\" and \"arrests that are unsupported by probable cause\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Unable to distinguish the consent decree outright, the dissent offers two narrow readings of the decree. First, it maintains that the decree can speak only to the Police Department's obligations going forward rather than shed any light whatsoever on the \"status quo\" within the Department before federal intervention.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dissenting Op. at 811 (stating that the decree does not provide \"any detail as to the status quo it addressed\"). The dissent concedes that the DOJ probably did not enter into the consent decree because it was impressed with Newark's policing practices and wanted to encourage the City to keep up the good work.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At this stage, we must draw not only such obvious inferences, but also all reasonable ones, in favor of Roman. Thus we agree with the dissent on the \"clear\" difference between \"agreeing to train more\" (the consent decree on its face) and \"agreeing that prior training was constitutionally inadequate\" (the way in which the decree supports Roman's claims).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   We simply believe that a reasonable inference bridges the gap in this case. Indeed, no\n   inference is needed because Roman made the link explicit in the amended complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 89 (stating that the Police Department's \"deliberate indifference to citizens' rights is what led to the imposition of a [f]ederal [m]onitor program ....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Second, the dissent believes that the consent decree's training requirements, from which we can reasonably infer inadequate training before the decree, simply amount to \"\n   <em>\n    additional\n   </em>\n   training\" in, for instance, the requirements of the Fourth Amendment. Dissenting Op. at 811-12. To the contrary, the consent decree was meant to take the Newark Police Department back to basics: Do not lie on a warrant application or to justify a warrantless search, App. at 158; investigate police activities that appear to have lacked legal justification,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 161; and at all times follow the requirements of the Fourth Amendment,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 160.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The theme of the dissent appears to be that we are refashioning the amended complaint. It claims we are vacating the District Court's decision based on facts and arguments that were not presented to it. But as discussed above, we are engaged in\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of the adequacy of the amended complaint in light of documents that were before the District Court and that informed its allegations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   pp. 795-96. Additionally, and to repeat, the specific events leading up to Roman's search and arrest are not relevant to the merits of his municipal liability claim. Thus we are not vacating the Court's decision for excluding these facts from its analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Rather, our focus is directed to Newark's practice at the time of Roman's search and arrest. The Court had notice of them, as it acknowledged that Roman alleged \"a 'pattern or practice of constitutional violations in areas including stop[ ] and arrest practices, use of force, and theft by officers.' \"\n   <em>\n    Roman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20436251\">\n    2017 WL 436251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (quoting Compl. \u00b6 59). Nonetheless it dismissed the complaint and amended complaint because it viewed the City as attempting to change its practices. Even if the record can be read that way-and we doubt that\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   -the District Court's rationale has the wrong focus. The question is not whether some evidence can be viewed as supporting the City. It is whether, viewing the pleadings and properly associated documents in the light most favorable to Roman, there are claims plausible enough to withstand a motion to dismiss. We think there is one-the municipal liability claim. And the Court did not have to look beyond the amended complaint and supporting documents to glean these facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In sum, Roman's municipal liability claim survives dismissal based on the record that was before the District Court. Because the Court reached the opposite conclusion, we part with its holding. Thus we vacate and remand this portion of its decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The two-year mark is measured from the day the claim accrues (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the day on which the public entity or employee allegedly harmed the plaintiff). In our case, because Roman's claims accrued in May 2014, he had until May 2016 to file a notice of claim.

If we look to the complaint, it suggests both false imprisonment and malicious prosecution are state-law tort claims. It never identifies them as \u00a7 1983 or federal claims. Rather, it presents them generically, following a series of other state-law tort claims.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , App. at 44 (\"intentional infliction of emotional distress\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 46 (\"negligent infliction of emotional distress\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 47 (\"assault and battery\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 49 (\"unlawful imprisonment\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 51 (\"malicious prosecution\"). This indicates to us that Roman pled both claims as state-law claims, not federal claims. While the unlawful (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , false) imprisonment claim does note that the Defendants \"restrict[ed] [Roman's] constitutionally guaranteed rights of liberty and freedom of movement,\" it is silent as to whether it refers to the United States or New Jersey Constitution. Compl. \u00b6 114. This is too facile to imply the former when but a few identifying words would do. The default is New Jersey law, which defines false imprisonment as \"an[y] unlawful restraint that interferes with a victim's liberty\" and requires \"[n]o further wrongful purpose\" for a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   showing.\n   <em>\n    State v.

They insist these concessions \"are sufficient to establish that [Roman's] arrest and prosecution arise out of his possession of incriminating evidence[.]\" Defendants' Br. at 65.

He cites various examples\n   of inadequate police training, poor police discipline, and unheeded citizen complaints. He tells us certain police officers did not receive training for over 20 years, and their training did not cover the basic requirements of the Fourth Amendment. In his pleadings, he states the Newark Police Department did not discipline officers who engaged in police misconduct, Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 84-86, including unlawful searches and false arrests, App. at 134. He also notes the public filed formal complaints about improper searches and false arrests that were disregarded almost wholesale.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6467132,7650398\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/81/355/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   These alleged practices were ongoing when Roman's search and arrest occurred, and the City had notice of them at that time.

Our panel is united in understanding that we can properly consider the consent decree because it was provided to the District Court and was referenced and relied upon in Roman's amended complaint. Those two sources - the consent decree and the amended complaint - are sufficient to overcome the motion to dismiss the claims against the City of Newark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The consent decree supports the allegations in the amended complaint in a number of respects. For example, it expressly prohibits Newark Police officers \"from relying on information known to be materially false or incorrect to justify a warrantless search or to seek a search warrant[.]\" (App. at 158). A fair inference from that prohibition is that it was needed precisely because the police were often relying on false information to justify warrantless searches. That inference bolsters Roman's allegation that \"[n]o drugs were found in [his] possession\" and yet the police \"arrested [him] and falsely charged him with possession of a controlled dangerous substance[.]\" (App. at 263 \u00b6\u00b6 28-29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In another instance, the consent decree suggests that there has been a lack of training and supervision in the Newark Police Department. To remedy that deficiency, the consent decree requires the Department to \"provide all officers with at least 16 hours of training on stops, searches, arrests, ... [and] training ... in ... Fourth Amendment issues\" as well as mandating \"desk lieutenant[s] or unit commander[s] [to] review each arrest report by officers under their command[.]\" (App. at 159-61). The inference that there was inadequate training supports Roman's allegation that the Department's officers, \"through their actions, inactions, course of conduct, poor or non-existent training and deficient supervision[,] caused ... [the] illegal deprivation of [his] liberty[.]\" (App. at 265 \u00b6 48).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   As a final example, the consent decree says that the Department must \"conduct integrity audits and compliance reviews to identify and investigate all officers who have engaged in misconduct including unlawful ... searches[ ] and seizures[.]\" (App. at 192). The need for such audits and reviews lends plausibility to Roman's allegation that the \"City had a custom and\n   practice of inadequately investigating ... citizens' complaints regarding illegal search and seizure[.]\" (App. at 272 \u00b6 84).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Thus, looking only at the amended complaint together with the consent decree, and giving Roman the benefit of all favorable inferences, as we must at this stage, there is a sufficient basis to say that Roman has stated plausible claims for municipal liability under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Dismissal of those claims was therefore an error.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n  <author id=\"p-76\">\n   HARDIMAN, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The District Court dismissed Roman's case after giving him two opportunities to state a claim upon which relief may be granted and after reconsidering its order of dismissal. Based on the record presented to it, the District Court's decision was correct and should be affirmed as to all but one of Roman's claims (the municipal liability claim for failure to train, supervise, or discipline).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The Majority vacates part of the District Court's judgment by reciting facts found nowhere in Roman's amended complaint and by adding facts of its own creation that were neither pleaded nor argued to the District Court with sufficient specificity. The Majority's deviation from standard civil practice and procedure compels this partial dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   This dissent results principally from a disagreement with my colleagues about which facts were properly before the District Court. First, the Majority proffers a narrative that Roman never gave the District Court and which has no relevance to the claims it revives. This Court need not (and should not) recite these \"facts\" and \"background\" as true. Second, Roman did not sufficiently plead a municipal liability claim based on Newark's alleged pattern or practice of Fourth Amendment violations. If the facts as pleaded (or subject to judicial notice) were as the Majority recites them, I would agree that Roman stated a claim for relief. But since the actual facts before the District Court were quite different from those enunciated by the Majority, the District Court did not err by dismissing this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Despite these disagreements with my colleagues, I agree with them that Roman's amended complaint sufficiently stated a municipal liability claim for failure to train, supervise, or discipline. Yet I cannot agree with their reasoning\n   <em>\n    in toto\n   </em>\n   because we should not extrapolate-and the District Court did not err by declining to extrapolate-from extraneous documents (like the consent decree Roman never provided nor cited to the District Court) to reach that conclusion. This single claim should be resuscitated, but only based on the face of the amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The Majority purports to recount the facts of this case \"as set out in the amended complaint and the transcript of the [state court] suppression hearing.\" Maj. Op. 793 n.1. Yet precious few of those facts were actually pleaded, primarily because the state court transcript was not proffered to the District Court by Roman. Moreover, the Majority's narrative of Roman's alleged mistreatment has effectively no bearing on the municipal liability claims it revives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The lion's share of the troubling facts recited by the Majority were taken from sources other than Roman's amended complaint. Those sources-including the state-court proceedings and subsequent briefs-paint a picture the District Court never observed while considering the motion to\n   dismiss. In truth, the amended complaint says nothing about how the investigation began, or the surveillance of Roman's apartment, or the initial interaction between police and Melissa Isaksem, or the officers' use of Isaksem as a decoy to gain entry into the apartment, or the fact that drugs were seized from a common area, or the expletives and threats that specific officers yelled at both Roman and his father, or Officer Mendes's use of physical force. Unlike those graphic and specific facts the Majority extracts, the amended complaint is replete with conclusory and generalized assertions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   App. 261-63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Here are some examples of the Majority's approach: Instead of averring that Officer Mendes flipped Roman on his stomach and put a knee in Roman's neck, Maj. Op. 794-95, the amended complaint merely states that \"[t]he Defendant Officers and Defendant John Does 1-20 (fictitious names) illegally assaulted the Plaintiff, throwing him against a wall and handcuffing him,\" App. 262. And rather than recounting a detailed plan to initiate an illegal search that included using an unwitting friend as a decoy, Maj. Op. 794-95, the amended complaint states only that \" 'Defendant Officers' ... and Defendant John Does 1-20 (fictitious names), after having the opportunity to observe that the Plaintiff was a person of Latino descent, initiated an illegal search and seizure of the Plaintiff's residence,\" App. 261.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Now on appeal, for the first time Roman cites facts establishing how the police gained entry into the apartment, the threatening words they spoke, and the actions of Officer Mendes. Roman Br. 10-12. We should not endorse this unpleaded narrative, nor suggest the District Court erred by failing to manufacture it in the first place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The Majority concludes that Roman's amended complaint (supplemented by the consent decree, a news article, and a press release) contains enough facts to make plausible his claims that his injuries were proximately caused by Newark's: (1) pattern or practice of constitutional violations in the area of arrest practices; and (2) failure to adequately train, supervise, or discipline its officers. Maj. Op. 799-800. The first conclusion is unwarranted. And while the second conclusion is correct, the Majority still errs in its reliance on a document Roman never cited and inferential leaps that Roman's pleadings themselves do not admit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   On its face, the amended complaint contains very few facts related to Roman's arrest or Newark's alleged pattern or practice of rights violations, and what it does contain amount only to conclusory statements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

When we excise from the Majority's narrative all facts that were neither pleaded nor presented to the District Court and the complaints' legal conclusions, it becomes clear that the District Court did not err by twice deeming Roman's complaint deficient regarding a pattern or practice of rights violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   This Court should not fault the trial judge for failing to take cognizance of facts or arguments never presented to her, especially here, where Roman chose not to include in his amended pleading facts that could have been gleaned from Defendants'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   first motion to dismiss and the consent decree attached to it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Snyder v.

Although the District Court could take notice of the consent decree's existence, it's quite another matter to hold it accountable for not accepting as true everything its contents could possibly imply-especially when Roman neither pleaded nor relied upon the decree's contents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   What is crucial is whether Roman's complaint was \"based\" on the consent decree.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec.

Only to the extent the Majority refashions Roman's pattern-or-practice claim such that it is\n   <em>\n    now\n   </em>\n   based on implausible inferences from the consent decree is it \"based on\" the consent decree. For Roman did not explicitly reference, quote, or rely on the document in his amended complaint-even after the City provided it.

The consent decree says nothing about arrests or searches without consent that occur at residences, which is what Roman complains of in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Another problem that distinguishes Roman's complaint from the problems that led to the consent decree is the fact that the decree addressed police practices that disparately impacted the black community.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   App. 93-98 (detailing same).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   But that racial disparity did not apply to Roman, who was Hispanic.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   App. 261 \u00b6 16. While the consent decree may have been \"meant to protect\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   Newark residents,\" Maj. Op. 801, the point remains that the pattern or practice giving rise to it was not one that plausibly caused Roman's injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Finally, the consent decree addressed erroneous narcotics arrest reports where \"individuals often were purportedly seated in cars holding clear plastic baggies in front of them or on their laps and officers could 'immediately' see the contraband, even though the report indicated that the subject's back was to an officer, or that the officer had not yet approached the car.\" App. 92 (detailing the pattern or practice investigated by the DOJ that led to the consent decree's adoption). Wholly unrelated to those erroneous reports, Roman alleges that officers exhaustively searched the apartment without a warrant, and he is silent as to where and when the officers found the drugs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   App. 30-31, 262-63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   In sum, Roman's arrest was too dissimilar from the pattern or practice addressed by the consent decree to plausibly allege proximate causation for his injuries. While clear that the DOJ did not enter into the consent decree \"because it was impressed with Newark's policing practices,\" Maj. Op. 801, it was not the District Court's duty to imagine all possible inferences from the document. It was Roman's duty to plead them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Judon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055412\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/773/495/#p505\">\n    773 F.3d at 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For the Majority to conclude otherwise, it must derive that pattern or practice from sources not before the District Court and define it at the highest level of generality: Fourth Amendment violations writ large. In other words, my colleagues conclude that because Newark police allegedly engaged in a pattern or practice of Fourth Amendment violations of type\n   <em>\n    x\n   </em>\n   , it follows that they plausibly committed this violation of type\n   <em>\n    y\n   </em>\n   -all based on a document they cannot claim the District Court\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   have considered. The District Court did not err in failing to perform the Majority's inferential leaps to reach that conclusion based on a document it need not have considered in the first place. It properly dismissed this claim rather than indulge such speculation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 679-80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   With or without these sources, the amended complaint's bare legal conclusions need not be accepted as true.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So Roman failed to state a pattern-or-practice claim on which relief could be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Roman's failure-to-train, failure-to-supervise, and failure-to-discipline claim was sufficiently pleaded. But the Majority's method for arriving at this conclusion suffers from similar deficiencies to its pattern-or-practice reasoning. The Majority's reliance on the consent decree is again misplaced for the reasons discussed above.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   And even if such reliance were\n   appropriate, the consent decree does not make Roman's claim plausible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Roman's arrest was not plausibly caused by the failures to train, supervise, or discipline Newark officers the Majority cites in the consent decree because no such failures appear in the document. The Majority claims \"the consent decree indicates Newark police officers were not trained on 'the requirements of [the] Fourth Amendment and related law.' \" Maj. Op. 799. And \"per the decree\" the City's \"training did not cover the basics of the Fourth Amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    at 800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It does no such thing. Rather, it indicates that Newark agreed to implement\n   <em>\n    additional\n   </em>\n   training on \"the requirements of [the] Fourth Amendment and related law\" without any detail as to the status quo it addressed. App. 160. While it's safe to say that the DOJ did not endorse that status quo, the difference between agreeing to train more and agreeing that prior training was constitutionally inadequate regarding the Fourth Amendment writ large should be clear. And, as discussed above, the consent decree arose from a host of policing practices unlike those Roman alleged (except at the highest level of generality). Newark could not plausibly have agreed to the extraordinary liability that would come from admitting that its police training violated the Fourth Amendment in every instance, or in every instance possibly connected to Roman's arrest. Indeed, the decree says no such thing about\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The consent decree is even thinner as it relates to supervisory and disciplinary issues. From the City's agreement to adhere to certain review processes and disciplinary measures regarding unlawful searches and false arrests, the Majority perceives a \"deliberate indifference to Roman's Fourth Amendment rights.\" Maj. Op. 800 (internal quotations and citation omitted). That does not follow. The decree does not describe or admit any processes or measures already in place or any existing pattern of unlawful searches or false arrests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Instead, Roman's amended complaint directly alleged training, supervision, and discipline problems with adequate specificity to survive a motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , App. 270-72 \u00b6\u00b6 68, 70, 71, 78, 80, 82;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

The Majority's improper reliance on the consent decree and inferential leaps from that and other sources outside the amended complaint are, in my view, erroneous and unnecessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   As we have noted many times before, we are a court of review, not a court of first view.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In Re: J &amp; S Props., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269840,12263945\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/138/\">\n    872 F.3d 138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 148 (3d Cir. 2017). Our review is based on the record as presented by counsel in our adversary system. We should not fault the District Court for failing to manufacture facts and craft arguments that Roman neglected to plead. By conjuring its own facts repackaged as if pleaded in the amended complaint, the Majority imposes a new duty upon district judges within the Third Circuit. It does so without citing precedent for the proposition\n   that a district court\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   consider facts and arguments never pleaded or argued by the plaintiff. I cannot subscribe to this new rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   This appeal implicates a fundamental legal principle: the plaintiff is the master of his complaint. Because of that time-honored principle, Roman's failure to state a policy-or-practice claim upon which relief may be granted requires the harsh sanction of dismissal. After his initial complaint was found inadequate, Roman failed to file an amended complaint that cured the deficiencies identified by the District Court. Even assuming Roman might have had a legitimate claim, it would have been improper for the District Court to try to make Roman's case for him. And it's especially inappropriate for us to overrule the decision of a district judge because of a failure to apprehend facts and arguments never presented to her. I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    His appellate briefs' references to the document are not determinative, no matter how many times they cite the decree.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    This timing further complicates the Majority's reliance on the consent decree. The decree's announcement months after Roman's arrest requires yet another \"infer[ence] that the problems that led to it were occurring during the time of his allegations and for some time before that.\" Maj. Op. 799. It also requires an inference that all of the City's \"corrective measures postdated the arrest.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269840,12263945\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/138/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at 802 n.8.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    The document's undisputed authenticity as a government document says nothing about the reasonableness of the inferences the Majority abstracts from the consent decree. Nor does it speak to the contents' relevance to Roman's case. Such authenticity merely provides one reason for judicially noticing the decree's existence and eliminates one potential reason for\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    relying on it. It does not follow that it is \"especially important\" for district courts to rely on and extrapolate from such documents. Maj. Op. 797-98.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    The consent decree itself admits no specific pattern or practice of rights violations. Although it followed a DOJ report that \"revealed a pattern or practice of constitutional violations in areas including stop and arrest practices, use of force, and theft by officers,\" that report was never provided to the District Court. App. 137;\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Maj. Op. 797. Instead, the consent decree only outlines measures Newark agreed to take-not any pattern or practice of rights violations, let alone one that plausibly caused Roman's injuries. In fact, that report actually demonstrates that even the pattern or practice that led to the consent decree could\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    plausibly have caused Roman's injuries.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    In his motion for reconsideration, Roman claimed his municipal liability argument was based on \"the City's widespread and systemic misuse of police powers to treat members of a protected racial class different from those of white citizens.\" ECF 43-3 at 8. Unlike the pattern or practice of Fourth Amendment violations the Majority now remands, he argued \"racial profiling, racial discrimination, or other widespread discrimination of minorities\" gave rise to his municipal liability cause of action.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269840,12263945\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/138/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    The Majority's reliance on the news article and press release hyperlinked in Roman's complaints is likewise inappropriate. The news article's identification of one officer-who may or may not have been involved in Roman's arrest-who told a reporter he \"\n    <em>\n     think\n    </em>\n    [\n    <em>\n     s\n    </em>\n    ]\" he did not receive training for 20 years is not enough to subject the City to liability for failure to adequately train its entire police force. App. 134 (emphasis added). This demonstrates no custom; nor does it plausibly demonstrate the police academy training all officers receive was constitutionally inadequate without more follow-up. Nor does the article address supervision or discipline. Similarly, the press release addresses none of the three.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
