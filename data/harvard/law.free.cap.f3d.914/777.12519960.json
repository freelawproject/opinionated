A072 375 217, A070 868 759 (B.I.A. Nov. 14, 2016),\n  <em>\n   aff'g\n  </em>\n  No. A072 375 217, A070 868 759 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Oct. 3, 2014). We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case. Under these circumstances, we have reviewed both the IJ's and the BIA's opinions \"for the sake of completeness.\"\n  <em>\n   Wangchuck v. Dep't of Homeland Sec.\n  </em>\n  ,\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3114092\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/448/524/#p528\">\n   448 F.3d 524\n  </extracted-citation>\n  , 528 (2d Cir. 2006).\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-10\">\n  Our jurisdiction is limited to colorable constitutional claims and questions of law because the lead applicant is removable under\n  <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n   8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n  </extracted-citation>\n  (a)(2)(A)(i)(I) for having been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude.\n  <em>\n   See\n  </em>\n  <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n   8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n  </extracted-citation>\n  (a)(2)(C), (D) ;\n  <em>\n   see also\n  </em>\n  <em>\n   Barco-Sandoval v.

Jiang does not raise any such arguments. We note that her challenge to the agency's denial of asylum and withholding of removal based on the birth of her children in the United States, allegedly in violation of China's family planning policy, which is the only claim she does not abandon, is foreclosed by\n  <em>\n   Jian Hui Shao v.
