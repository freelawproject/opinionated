(\"Merck\") manufactured and distributed Vioxx as a medication to relieve pain and inflammation between 1999 and 2004. Plaintiff Jo Levitt began taking Vioxx during the summer of 1999. She suffered cardiovascular injuries in March and May of 2000 while taking the medication. Her doctor continued to prescribe her Vioxx until 2002, around the time Merck changed its label to disclose a risk of cardiovascular injuries associated with the use of Vioxx. Merck removed Vioxx from the market in 2004.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Levitt filed a personal injury lawsuit against Merck on September 29, 2006. Merck filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that Levitt's claims were barred by Missouri's five-year statute of limitations. The district court granted Merck's motion and determined as a matter of law that, because \"Plaintiff's claims accrued prior to September 2001,\" her September 29, 2006 suit was time-barred.

News reports on this study explained that a clinical trial of Vioxx had \"detected statistically 'significant' cardiovascular problems,\" (Newark Star-Ledger, April 2000), that \"patients on Vioxx were more likely to suffer heart attacks and other cardiovascular complications than those on naproxen,\" (USA Today, Feb. 2001), that \"patients taking Vioxx have a higher risk of heart attack,\" (CBS The Early Show, May 2001), and that takers of Vioxx\"had significantly more heart attacks\" than users of the alternative. (Washington Post, March 2001).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 639, 898-99, 901, 904.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In August 2001, a review of literature published in the\n   <em>\n    Journal of the American Medical Association\n   </em>\n   reiterated that the clinical study showed a \"significantly increased risk of cardiovascular event\" with use of Vioxx rather than the alternative, and opined that \"the available data raise a cautionary flag about the risk of cardiovascular events\" with Vioxx. The authors found \"a potential increase in cardiovascular event rates\" for Vioxx and \"urge[d] caution in prescribing\" the drug to certain patients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As early as July 2001, other plaintiffs sued Merck alleging that Vioxx caused serious cardiovascular events. One complaint\n   from July 23, 2001, alleged that Vioxx had \"been linked to several severe and life threatening medical disorders,\" including heart attack and stroke. J.A. 931,\n   <em>\n    Reid v. Merck &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. BC254630 (Cal. Sup. Ct. July 23, 2001). Levitt herself alleged that Merck's 2001 Annual Report disclosed that a number of federal and state lawsuits had been filed against Merck with respect to Vioxx, alleging gastrointestinal bleeding and cardiovascular events. R. Doc. 1, at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Despite all of this information in the public domain before September 2001, the court holds that a reasonable jury could find that a reasonably prudent person who had suffered cardiovascular injuries while taking Vioxx was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   on inquiry notice of a potential claim against Merck. The rationale apparently is that the scientific data allowed for uncertainty about whether Vioxx caused cardiovascular injuries, and Merck was disputing the causal link.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In my view, the court's approach calls for more than the \"inquiry notice\" required to start the statute of limitations under Missouri law. The Missouri Court of Appeals, Eastern District, long ago ruled that a \"possible causation link\" based on literature in the medical community that \"suggested\" a \"causal connection\" was sufficient as a matter of law to start the limitations period running.\n   <em>\n    Ahearn v.

And once\n   the information is available to a reasonably prudent person, it does not matter whether the literature has been published for three weeks or three decades.

In\n   <em>\n    Giles\n   </em>\n   , there was a factual issue about whether the plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    condition\n   </em>\n   was capable of ascertainment\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   he was diagnosed.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6832966\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/475/184/\">\n    475 S.W.3d at 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But here, the relevant facts are uncontested. Levitt's condition of cardiovascular injury was diagnosed before September 2001. There is no dispute about the scientific literature, media reports, corporate annual reports, and publicly-filed lawsuits that were in the public domain before September 2001. The only fighting issue is a legal one: whether the publicly-available information placed a reasonably prudent person with cardiovascular injury after taking Vioxx on inquiry notice of a potential claim against Merck. By referring this issue to a jury, and characterizing it as a \"question of fact,\" the court ironically contemplates a possible ruling\n   <em>\n    against\n   </em>\n   Levitt based on scientific literature that the court says was \"only beginning to piece together\" a connection between Vioxx and cardiovascular injury. In my view, the better conclusion under Missouri law is that the relevant scientific literature, reports, and lawsuits described a \"possible causation link\" and \"suggested\" a causal connection, such that the limitations period began to run as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ahearn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9978120\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/729/501/#p503\">\n    729 S.W.2d at 503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Levitt was on inquiry notice that she had a potential claim against Merck before September 2001, but she did not file this action until September 2006. The five-year statute of limitations had therefore expired. Levitt argues alternatively that Merck fraudulently concealed her cause of action, but the district court correctly rejected this claim: facts in the public domain placed Levitt on inquiry notice by September 2001, and a putative defendant does not fraudulently conceal by disputing a theory of causation. For these reasons, I would affirm the judgment.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
