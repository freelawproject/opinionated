He challenges the district court's findings that his prior convictions for second-degree assault and second-degree murder under Washington law qualify as \"crimes of violence\" under section 4B1.2(a) of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\"U.S.S.G.\"). For the following reasons, we vacate and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Vederoff was charged with and pled guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As part of his written plea agreement, Vederoff acknowledged receiving each of the felony convictions listed in the indictment, including one conviction for second-degree assault and one conviction for second-degree murder, both under Washington law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Before sentencing, the United States Probation Office issued a Presentence Report (\"PSR\"). The PSR set the base offense level at 24, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, concluding that Vederoff's prior convictions for second-degree assault and second-degree murder qualified as \"crimes of violence.\" After a three-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, the PSR set Vederoff's total offense level at 21. The PSR calculated Vederoff's criminal history score as 13, and his criminal history category as VI. Accordingly, Vederoff's recommended Guidelines range was 77 to 96 months. The probation officer, however, recommended a 60-month sentence, balancing mitigating and aggravating factors in Vederoff's history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Vederoff objected to either of these convictions counting as \"crimes of violence\" under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a). He argued that, without the crimes of violence, the base offense level should be 14, and after adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, the Guidelines range would be 27 to 33 months.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Vederoff requested a sentence of 27 months of imprisonment, the lowest end of his proposed range. The government agreed with the PSR's crime of violence findings and recommended a sentence of 72 months of imprisonment, five months below the low end of the Guidelines range if both convictions counted as crimes of violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On May 5, 2017, the district court sentenced Vederoff to 60 months in custody after concluding that both convictions were crimes of violence. In explaining its decision, the district court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   So on the, you know, the [\n   <em>\n    United States v. Johnson [Johnson v.

If [defense counsel] is correct, it would be a level 14, Criminal History Category VI, with a 37 to 46 range.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Either way, looking at the factors, I really believe the right sentence is a five-year prison term. So I'm going to impose a 60-month prison term. It's either a departure downward from a range that's too high or a departure upward from a range that's too low. But the murder and the assault two are, in the Court's opinion, countable under the analysis of being a divisible crime in the assault two, and that the ways to commit aiding and abetting felony murder have to comport with the national standard of doing something active to join in a felony that's a serious felony, not some sort of hypothetical minor felony. It has to be during the commission of a dangerous felony or through conduct evincing reckless or depraved indifference to the serious dangers. But as I say, the range is not as important to me as what is the right sentence for this individual under these circumstances, and I think for the deterrent effect and the punishment effect, five years is correct for the prison term.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Vederoff timely appealed his sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, Vederoff had a base offense level of 24 if he had two or more felony convictions that qualify as a \"crime of violence.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2). If he had one, his base offense level would be 20, and if he had none, his base offense level would be 14. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4), (6). \"For the purposes of this guideline ... 'Crime of violence' has the meaning given that term in \u00a7 4B1.2(a) and Application Note 1 of the Commentary to \u00a7 4B1.2.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 cmt. n.1. At the time of Vederoff's offense and his sentencing, section 4B1.2(a), the career offender guideline, defined \"crime of violence\" as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   any offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (2) is murder, voluntary manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated assault,....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a). The first part of this definition is the \"force/elements clause,\" and the second is the \"enumerated clause.\" The commentary clarified that \"crime[s] of violence ... include the offenses of aiding and abetting, conspiring, and attempting to commit such offenses.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2 cmt. n.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   To determine whether a prior state conviction qualifies as a crime of violence, we apply the \"categorical approach.\"\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266542\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/869/933/#p936\">\n    869 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   936 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

The least culpable means within the Washington statute is assault with intent to commit a felony, Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 9A.36.021(1)(e), so we must determine whether the generic definition of aggravated assault covers such conduct. Our review of the common law,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Model Penal Code, treatises, and the laws of the other states,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Esparza-Herrera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3381657\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/557/1019/#p1022\">\n    557 F.3d at 1022-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , compels the conclusion that generic aggravated assault does not include assault with intent to commit a felony. The Model Penal Code defines aggravated assault as assault causing or attempting to cause bodily injury \"under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life\" or with a deadly weapon. Model Penal Code \u00a7 211.1(2). It does not include assault with intent to commit another felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   With respect to the laws of the states, only six states (including Washington) and the District of Columbia include assault with intent to commit\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   felony within their assault statutes (whether titled \"aggravated\" assault or not).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 11 states, aggravated assault includes assault with the intent to commit a narrower set of specific felonies\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   or assault committed during the commission of a felony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 33\n   states, aggravated assault\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   includes assault with the intent to commit a felony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second-degree assault under Washington law clearly covers a broader range of conduct than generic aggravated assault.
