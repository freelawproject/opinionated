The agents claim that American Family misclassified them as independent contractors, while treating them as employees, in order to avoid paying them benefits in compliance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   The sole issue in this interlocutory appeal concerns the nature of the parties' legal relationship: are the plaintiffs employees or independent contractors for American Family? The company appeals the district court's judgment that the plaintiffs are employees. Because American Family properly classified its agents as independent contractors, we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   As with many insurance companies, American Family sells its products primarily through a network of insurance agents. American Family, in keeping with common industry practice, classifies its agents as independent contractors rather than employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Taking issue with this designation and the consequences it has on their ability to enjoy the protections of ERISA, the plaintiffs brought a proposed class action against American Family in 2013, alleging\n   that the company misclassified them as independent contractors. The plaintiffs contended that their miscategorization \"deprived [them] of the rights and protections guaranteed by state and federal law to employees, including their rights under ERISA.\" They sought,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , a declaratory judgment that they are employees for all purposes, including but not limited to ERISA, and that as employees they are due benefits under ERISA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Both parties filed several pre-trial motions, including motions by American Family to dismiss and later for summary judgment. The plaintiffs, for their part, moved for class certification. The district court granted the plaintiffs' motion and denied each of American Family's motions in whole or in part. The company sought permission from this court to appeal the district court's order granting class certification, but we denied the company's request. The district court subsequently denied two motions by American Family to decertify the class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The case then proceeded to trial, which the district court bifurcated to allow for determination of the threshold question of the plaintiffs' employment status. Trial of this single issue took place before an advisory jury, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 39(c)(1), which permits district courts to \"try any issue with an advisory jury\" in an action that is \"not triable of right by a jury.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   During the twelve-day trial, the jury learned that the parties took many steps to structure their relationship consistent with American Family's position that its agents are independent contractors. Most pointedly, at the outset of the agents' tenure with the company, all agents signed a written agreement stating that they were independent contractors rather than employees. In keeping with this designation, the agents file their taxes as independent contractors and deduct their business expenses as self-employed business owners. American Family also pays its agents in commissions and does not provide them with vacation pay, holiday pay, sick pay, or paid time off.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Moreover, as the district court recounted, \"[t]he company calls its agents 'business owners' and 'partners' and tells new agents they will be 'agency business' owners and that they need to 'invest' in 'their business.' \" The agents work out of their own offices, set their own hours, and hire and pay their own staff. They also are responsible for providing most of the resources necessary to run their agencies, such as office furniture and office supplies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   But the plaintiffs also presented significant evidence to support their claim that American Family treats them more like employees than independent partners and business owners. The company classifies everyone in its sales force-other than its agents-as employees. Nevertheless, the company's training manuals refer to the agents as \"employees.\" Each agent must report to an Agency Sales Manager, and the plaintiffs presented testimony that American Family did not train these managers to treat the agents as independent contractors or even make the managers aware that the agents were classified as such.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   According to the plaintiffs, the managers exerted a great amount of control over their day-to-day activities. The managers insisted, among other required tasks, that\n   the agents complete daily activity reports, prioritize selling certain insurance policies, and participate in \"life-call\" nights in which the agents had to stay after normal business hours to solicit life insurance by calling prospective customers. The plaintiffs also offered testimony that the company retained some authority to approve or disapprove of the location of the agents' offices and to be involved in the hiring and firing of the agents' staff in a way that limited the plaintiffs' ability to run their own agencies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The jury also heard testimony that American Family teaches agents everything they need to know to become licensed, run an agency, and sell the company's products. All agents attend a two-to-three-month-long comprehensive training program run by American Family on how to sell insurance and how to operate an agency. Once hired, the agents must sell insurance exclusively for American Family, and they are discouraged-but not forbidden-from taking other work, even if it is unrelated to the insurance industry. There is no limit on the duration of the agency relationship, and American Family describes the agency position as a career position. Although the agents are not eligible for the same pension or retirement plans given to the company's employees, they are offered an \"extended earnings\" benefit that is described to them as a retirement plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   When and if their relationship with the company does come to an end, the agents are prohibited for a year from soliciting business from any of their former American Family customers. And unlike most business owners, the agents cannot sell their agencies or assign any rights to income from their agencies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At the close of the trial, the court presented the advisory jury with the following interrogatory:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Please answer the following question \"yes\" or \"no\" according to your findings: Did Plaintiffs prove by a preponderance of the evidence that they are employees of Defendant American Family?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The jury answered \"yes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After giving the parties a final opportunity to present their proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, the court issued an opinion in which it acknowledged that although it was not bound by the advisory jury's determination, it believed that the jury's verdict \"comport[ed] with the weight of the evidence presented at trial.\" Accordingly, the district court determined that the agents were employees for the purposes of ERISA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The district court certified its ruling for an interlocutory appeal under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201292\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), and American Family filed a petition for interlocutory review of the court's order. We granted permission to appeal, which American Family did, arguing that the district court erred in determining that the plaintiffs are employees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The determination of whether a plaintiff qualifies as an employee under ERISA is a mixed question of law and fact\n   that a judge normally can make as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Weary v.

While American Family provided \"pre-approved\" candidates, whom the agents could select as their staff, it did not require the agents to hire these pre-screened candidates.

American Family did not provide computer access to any non-approved appointed agency staff and required agency staff to agree to a lifetime non-solicitation agreement. American Family had the right to fire any agency staff, appointed or non-appointed, who did not live up to the American Family Code of Conduct, and it retained the right, although rarely exercised, to fire agency staff for any reason.

Because this inquiry exists in the legal context of ERISA benefits, this collection of factors-particularly the ones relating to the source of the instrumentalities and tools, the method of payment, the provision of employee benefits, and the agents' tax treatment-is especially important in determining the parties' financial structure. Accordingly, these factors should have carried greater weight in the district court's final analysis.

Yet, American Family does not provide its agents with numerous health, welfare, and retirement benefits, including \"a retirement plan, 401K plan, group health plan, group dental plan, group life plan, and long-term disability plan.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID # 20945.) American Family claims it is not required to provide these benefits\n   because it classifies its insurance agents as independent contractors, not employees, relieving it of all ERISA obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Plaintiffs represent a class of some 7,200 current and former American Family insurance agents seeking ERISA benefits who challenge that classification. Plaintiffs argue that the circumstances of their relationship with American Family demonstrate that they are employees, regardless of what American Family chooses to call them. Accordingly, the district court bifurcated this case to determine at the outset whether Plaintiffs are employees or independent contractors for purposes of ERISA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   A twelve-day trial before an advisory jury ensued. Twenty-seven witnesses were called, and extensive documentary evidence was submitted. At the conclusion of the trial, the advisory jury unanimously concluded that Plaintiffs were employees. Though it was not bound by the jury's verdict, the district court reached the same conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In reaching that conclusion, the district court relied on the factors articulated in\n   <em>\n    Nationwide Mut.

Thus, the majority's reliance upon\n   <em>\n    Ware\n   </em>\n   misses the point. That case says nothing about the\n   <em>\n    existence and degree\n   </em>\n   of each\n   <em>\n    Darden\n   </em>\n   factor, a distinct, factual determination that should be reviewed for clear error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The procedural posture of this case may help explain the difficulty with the majority's reasoning.

These include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) Plaintiffs did not own a book of business; (2) Plaintiffs did not own any policies; (3) Defendants unilaterally reassigned policies brought in by one agent to others; (4) Defendants could require Plaintiffs to service policies that they did not initiate, without any compensation; (5) Defendants did not allow Plaintiffs to sell insurance from other companies not financially connected to Defendants; (6) Defendants actively discouraged and in some cases prohibited Plaintiffs from taking on other employment, even if it was unrelated to insurances sales; (7) Defendants required Plaintiffs to sign a one-year non-compete agreement, and required Plaintiffs' staff to sign a lifetime non-compete agreement; and (8) Defendants trained their sales managers to believe they were Plaintiffs' bosses and had the authority to demand Plaintiffs' compliance-a belief which many acted upon. On these facts, and in accordance with this analysis, I agree with the district court that Plaintiffs are employees for purposes of ERISA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The majority's holding to the contrary-that Plaintiffs are independent contractors for purposes of ERISA-is again undermined by the cases on which it purports to rely. The majority first reasons that \"[b]ecause ERISA cases focus on the financial benefits that a company should have provided ... the\n   <em>\n    Darden\n   </em>\n   factors that most pertain to financial structure ... carry more weight,\" as opposed to the employer's ability to control job performance and the employment opportunities of the aggrieved individual. But in doing so, the majority relies solely on this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Ware\n   </em>\n   , in which this Court stated that \"the relative weight given each [\n   <em>\n    Darden\n   </em>\n   ] factor may differ depending upon the legal context of the determination.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7414977\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/67/574/#p576\">\n    67 F.3d at 578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
