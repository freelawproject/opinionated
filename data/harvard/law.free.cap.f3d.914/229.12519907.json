He appeals, contending that \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B), as long understood, is unconstitutionally vague. The Government concedes this point but urges us to abandon the settled meaning of the statute and employ a new definition of \"crime of violence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We cannot do so. Neither the statutory language nor controlling precedent offer any support for the Government's proposed reinterpretation. Rather, the text and structure of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) plainly set forth a definition of \"crime of violence\" that fails to comport with due process. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This case arises from an April 2014 conspiracy to rob a McDonald's in Goldsboro, North Carolina. Shortly after 1:00 a.m., Simms and a co-conspirator crawled into the McDonald's through the drive-through window; a third robber served as a lookout. When inside, Simms pointed a gun at the manager, attempted to strike another employee, and demanded money. The manager complied and opened the restaurant's safe. After removing the contents, Simms struck the manager with the gun, threw a cash drawer at the other employee, and fled with his two co-conspirators and $1,100.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After his arrest and indictment, Simms pleaded guilty to Count I, conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201951\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and Count II, brandishing a firearm during and in relation to a \"crime of violence\"-that is, the Hobbs Act conspiracy in Count I-in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)(A). But at sentencing, Simms argued that his conviction under Count II was unconstitutional in light of\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. 2551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    192 L.Ed.2d 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). He contended that Hobbs Act conspiracy was not a \"crime of violence\" because the definition of this term in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3)(B) was unconstitutionally vague, like the similar definition of \"violent felony\" that the Supreme Court struck down in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   . The district court rejected this argument and sentenced Simms to 115 months' incarceration on Count I and 84 months on Count II, for a total consecutive sentence of 199 months' imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Simms appealed, again contending that his conviction under Count II could not stand because \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) was unconstitutional.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   After the parties briefed and argued the appeal before a panel of this court, the Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutionally vague a statute containing language materially identical to that challenged by Simms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sessions v.

For the reasons that follow, we now reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We must determine whether the definition of \"crime of violence\" in \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) satisfies the requirements of due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In resolving this question, we first set forth the statutory framework and examine Supreme Court precedent interpreting text materially identical to that at issue here. We then address the contours of Simms's constitutional challenge, drawing on the Supreme Court's consideration of identical challenges to similar statutory language. Finally, we explain why, in light of the plain text and binding Supreme Court precedent, we must hold \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Federal law, as codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)(A), provides that a person who uses or carries a firearm \"during and in relation to any crime of violence\" or who \"possesses a firearm\" \"in furtherance of any such crime\" may be convicted of\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   the underlying crime (here, Hobbs Act conspiracy)\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the additional, distinct crime of utilizing a firearm in connection with a \"crime of violence,\" with the latter punishable by at least five consecutive years of imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Section 924(c)(3) defines \"crime of violence\" as \"an offense that is a felony\" and\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (A) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another, or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (B) that by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3). Courts commonly refer to \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A) as the \"force clause\" and to \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B), the provision at issue here, as the \"residual clause.\" For Simms's \u00a7 924(c) conviction to stand, his Hobbs Act conspiracy offense must constitute a \"crime of violence\" under one of these two definitions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Our analysis begins with the force clause, \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A). To determine whether an offense is a crime of violence under that clause, courts use an inquiry known as the \"categorical\" approach. They look to whether the statutory elements of the offense necessarily require the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Leocal v. Ashcroft\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3442217\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/1/#p7\">\n    543 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 7-10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3442217\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/1/#p7\">\n    125 S.Ct. 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3442217\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/1/#p7\">\n    160 L.Ed.2d 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004) (interpreting materially identical text in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2016\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) );\n   <em>\n    United States v.

This approach is \"categorical\" because courts consider only the crime as defined, not the particular facts in the case.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    McNeal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4250748\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/818/141/#p151\">\n    818 F.3d at 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To be more precise, we will refer to the force clause inquiry as the\n   <em>\n    elements-based\n   </em>\n   categorical approach, because it begins and ends with the offense's elements. When a statute defines an offense in a way that allows for both violent and nonviolent means of commission, that offense is not \"categorically\" a crime of violence under the force clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Simms's offense-conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery-does not categorically qualify as a crime of violence under the elements-based categorical approach, as the United States now concedes. Gov. 28(j) Letter at 1, ECF No. 44 (Oct. 19, 2016); Simms Suppl. Br. at 1. This is so because to convict a defendant of this offense, the Government must prove only that the defendant\n   agreed with another to commit actions that, if realized, would violate the Hobbs Act. Such an agreement does not invariably require the actual, attempted, or threatened use of physical force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Accordingly, the only way we can sustain Simms's conviction on Count II is if his commission of Hobbs Act conspiracy constitutes a crime of violence under the residual clause-that is, if we determine that he committed a felony offense \"that by its nature[ ] involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3)(B). Interpreting a materially identical clause in another statute, the Supreme Court has directed courts to employ a categorical approach that-as with the force clause-\"look[s] to the elements and the nature of the offense of conviction, rather than to the particular facts.\"\n   <em>\n    Leocal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3442217\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/1/#p7\">\n    543 U.S. at 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3442217\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/1/#p7\">\n    125 S.Ct. 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (interpreting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2016\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) to \"require[ ]\" categorical analysis);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Chittenden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517754\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/896/633/#p639\">\n    896 F.3d 633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 639 (4th Cir. 2018) (internal quotation marks omitted). At oral argument, the Government elaborated that the longstanding position of the United States that \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) required an ordinary-case categorical approach came \"more by way of assumption\" than reason, and that\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   \"caused a lot of searching in the Department [of Justice] to find the right answer.\" Oral Arg. at 1:27:41, 1:29:00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   This claim does not hold water.\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   was not the first case to indicate that the ordinary-case categorical approach generated serious constitutional doubts. At the very least, the Government was on notice as to these vagueness concerns after\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   was decided in 2015. Indeed, the Ninth Circuit held \u00a7 16(b) unconstitutionally vague four months later.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dimaya v.

But a full year thereafter, the Government asserted to us that \"the categorical approach [was] the proper interpretation\" of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) and that this conclusion was \"wholly unaffected by\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   .\" Gov. 28(j) Letter at 2. The United States has yet to offer a coherent justification for its shifts in position, and its invocation of\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   offers no answer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Government next asserts that excusing its abandonment would not prejudice Simms, who has had a full opportunity to respond to the Government's claims. That is certainly enough to convince us that we\n   <em>\n    can\n   </em>\n   look past the Government's change of heart,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In support of this contention, the Government argues that \"the Supreme Court has been very clear\" that the categorical approach is \"essentially a saving construction\" designed only to avoid the risk of unfairness that comes with reviewing conduct that underlies long-past convictions. Oral Arg. at 1:19:05. Alternatively, the Government claims that even if a conduct-specific approach is not the best reading of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B), we still must adopt it to avoid striking down the statute. Three of our sister circuits have embraced the Government's suggestion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   We cannot do so. The Supreme Court did not invent the categorical approach out of whole cloth, as the Government would have us believe. While some other statutes invoking categorical analysis have been less than clear, the text and structure of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) unambiguously require courts to analyze the attributes of an \"offense that is a felony ... by its nature\"-that is, categorically. And the Government's comparisons to cases involving very different statutes, rather than bolstering its preference for a new mode of analysis, support adherence to the established ordinary-case categorical approach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   As a preliminary matter, the Government presents a flawed historical premise. It claims that the categorical approach is nothing more than a \"saving construction,\" Oral Arg. at 1:19:05, \"purely [a] judge-made doctrine\" that was \"first endorsed\" less than thirty years ago, Gov. Supp. Br. at 17 (internal quotation marks omitted). Further, the Government asserts, this doctrine is grounded entirely in external considerations far afield from congressional language or intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   This is simply not so. Although categorical analysis may be complicated, the\n   rationale for it is simple and long-established: if Congress has conditioned a statutory penalty on commission of an offense generally-rather than on specific acts-courts must consider the crime as defined, rather than the offender's conduct.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Shepard v.

Such analysis became more frequent in the mid-1980s as Congress added general terms like \"violent felony,\" \"crime of violence,\" and \"aggravated felony\" to the United States Code, but the underlying principle is far from novel. Indeed, it has been an important part of American jurisprudence for more than a century.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    U.S. ex rel. Guarino v.

Thus, when analyzing ACCA four years after its passage, the Court looked first to \"the language of\" the statute, and only then to legislative history and practical concerns, to conclude that a categorical approach was \"the only plausible interpretation of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii).\"\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

Similarly, when defending application of the ordinary-case categorical approach as it relates to ACCA's residual clause in 2015, the Court again began with the statutory text before considering other arguments.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The Supreme Court's interpretation of ACCA in\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   was, of course, secondarily informed by considerations beyond the statutory text. But tellingly, the Court has deemed the text of \u00a7 16(b) -a statute far clearer than the ACCA residual clause and materially identical to the statute at issue here-so plain as to speak for itself. Thus, in 2004, when the Court first interpreted \u00a7 16(b) to require the ordinary-case categorical approach, it relied\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   on the text of the statute, and it did not invoke legislative history or practical concerns.\n   <em>\n    Leocal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3442217\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/1/#p7\">\n    543 U.S. at 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3442217\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/1/#p7\">\n    125 S.Ct. 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/#p1223\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (plurality opinion) (noting four-Justice plurality, Chief Justice, and Government all \"accept[ed] that \u00a7 16(b), as long interpreted, demands a categorical approach\").

Whatever a judge's personal feelings as to what does or does not constitute a crime of violence, we are bound to apply the definition that Congress has prescribed.

This well-established rule against surplusage further cuts against the Government's conduct-specific reading, which would empty the phrase \"by its nature\" of meaning. Indeed, even under the Government's interpretation, giving \"by its nature\" meaning would shift the \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) inquiry away from conduct-specific facts and back towards a subjective consideration of that conduct's \"inherent features\"-that is to say, another version of ordinary-case analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Government does not even attempt to address this problem.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, it simply quotes a dissent in\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   to contend that in the context of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B), \"the phrase 'by its nature' is reasonably understood to 'mean only that an offender who engages in risky conduct cannot benefit from the fortuitous fact that physical force was not actually used during his offense.' \" Gov.

One of the dissenters here similarly insists that \"by its nature\" \"broad[ens]\" the scope of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B), while another argues (seemingly to the contrary) that the phrase actually \"limits the residual clause\" by excluding conduct that risks force \"merely incidentally or by happenstance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   But the\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   Court did not embrace any of these readings of this text.

If we strike that phrase, \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) 's remaining language would require a finding that an offense \"involves a\n   <em>\n    substantial risk\n   </em>\n   that physical force ...\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   be used in the course of committing the offense.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3)(B) (emphasis added). This text read on its own would still encompass both actual uses of physical force and otherwise \"risky\" conduct in which force was not used. And the requirement that any risk be \"substantial\" would independently exclude \"incidental\" uses of force. In other words, under the Government's conduct-specific reinterpretation, \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) would have the same meaning without the phrase \"by its nature\" as it would with this phrase.

Refusing to abide by this instruction, the Government heavily relies on considerations unrelated to the unambiguous text to support its new conduct-specific interpretation of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B). We doubt such external considerations are relevant. But to the extent that they are, they confirm our decision to adhere to the ordinary-case categorical approach rather than adopting the Government's new conduct-specific reinterpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   We begin with practical considerations. The Government contends that notwithstanding the statutory text, we should apply a conduct-specific approach to \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) because it, unlike the ACCA residual clause or some applications of \u00a7 16(b), always involves charges prosecuted contemporaneously with any underlying crimes of violence. According to the Government, this means \"the categorical approach serves no purpose\" in the context of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B). Gov. Supp. Br. at 20. Even setting aside the plain text of the statute, the argument fails for two fundamental reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   First, \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) 's failure to require a court to assess past conduct hardly compels rejection of the categorical approach. Rather, the categorical approach applies to a number of statutes that require no assessment of past conduct. Most notably, the Government itself concedes that Congress has \"require[d] a categorical approach\" in defining a \"crime of violence\" under the force clause, \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A), the only other subsection of \u00a7 924(c)(3). Gov. Supp. Br. at 4. And the force clause, like the neighboring residual clause challenged here, applies\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   to contemporaneous offenses, not prior convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Congress, through \u00a7 16, has also applied the categorical approach to many other statutes that similarly involve contemporaneous prosecutions.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201952\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) (criminalizing travel or use of mail with intent to commit any \"crime of violence\");\n   <extracted-citation index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20842\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 842\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (p)(2)(A) (prohibiting teaching, demonstration, or dissemination of information intended for use in committing a \"crime of violence\"); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(c)(1)(A)(i) (mandating restitution to victims of certain \"crime[s] of violence,\" citing \u00a7 16 );\n   <extracted-citation index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205032\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5032\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (permitting federal trials of juveniles in certain cases where \"the offense charged is\n   a crime of violence that is a felony\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The second reason the Government's practical argument fails is that, contrary to its suggestion otherwise, use of the categorical approach in \u00a7 924(c) does serve important purposes. Congress acted with good reasons in mandating a categorical approach here, even if the real-world benefits differ from those that arise in the context of prior convictions. Specifically, \u00a7 924(c) 's categorical \"crime of violence\" analysis serves the purpose of limiting the statute's penalties to specific classes of federal crimes where the use of a firearm is especially dangerous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rosemond\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12707001\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/572/65/#p75\">\n    572 U.S. at 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12707001,12578373\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1240/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 1240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\" \u00a7 924(c)... punishes the temporal and relational conjunction of two separate acts, on the ground that together they pose an extreme risk of harm.\");\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Solem v.

Before 1984, \u00a7 924(c) criminalized the use or unlawful carrying of a firearm in conjunction with \"any [federal] felony.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (1982). In 1984, Congress narrowed the statute to \"crime[s] of violence,\" defined in relevant part as they are today. Comprehensive Crime Control Act, \u00a7 1005(a), 98 Stat. at 2138-39. Two years later, Congress limited these \"crimes of violence\" to felonies while adding \"drug trafficking crimes\" to the statute's scope. Firearm Owners' Protection Act, \u00a7 104, 100 Stat. at 456-59. Thus, Congress has amended \u00a7 924(c) to make it crystal clear that not every federal felony involving use of a gun constitutes a \"crime of violence.\" Rather, the modern statute requires the prosecution to make two distinct showings: first, that the defendant utilized a firearm, and second, that the defendant did so in conjunction with not just any felony, but specifically a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime.\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11457\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/223/#p227\">\n    508 U.S. at 227-28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11457\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/223/#p227\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2050\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The Government's interpretation of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) would eliminate Congress's intentional choice to narrow the application of \u00a7 924(c) from \"any felon[ies]\" to\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   \"crime[s] of violence\" and \"drug trafficking crime[s].\" As the Government acknowledges, its reading of the statute would require juries to consider at trial whether an offender's specific conduct involved a substantial risk of physical force. But the use, carrying, or possession of a firearm, standing alone, will always suffice to generate such a risk in a conduct-specific analysis, regardless of the nature of the underlying offense. If we were to adopt a conduct-specific approach, we would in effect judicially repeal the 1984 and 1986 congressional amendments to \u00a7 924(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Attempting to address this problem, the Government claims that jurors could avoid collapsing the firearm and crime of violence elements if they were instructed not to find a crime of violence based\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   on\n   the presence of a firearm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ovalles\n   </em>\n   , 905 F.3d at 1250 n.8 (adopting Government's proposed instruction). But this solution offers no affirmative principle to guide jury decision-making. How, exactly, are jurors to keep these two showings apart? Should they cross out facts involving the firearm? Imagine the firearm wasn't there? Pretend it was inoperable? Instead of condemning jurors to such an ill-defined inquiry, categorical analysis limits \u00a7 924(c) 's additional sanctions to the discrete and particularly serious classes of felonies selected by Congress-drug trafficking crimes and crimes of violence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   In sum, even if practical considerations could influence our construction of the clear text of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B), they do not offer the Government any refuge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Having opened the door to external considerations, it is noteworthy that the Government does not ask us to examine the legislative history of \u00a7 924(c). Perhaps that is because the legislative history suggests that Congress intended a categorical approach. Recall that before 1984, \u00a7 924(c) penalized the use of a firearm in conjunction with any federal felony. A 1979 Senate bill unsuccessfully proposed amending \u00a7 924(c) to narrow its application to crimes of violence, largely as defined today. Criminal Code Reform Act of 1979, S. 1722, 96th Cong. \u00a7 1823 (1979). The Senate Judiciary Committee stated it was \"doubtful\" that \"felonies involving the possession of narcotics with intent to distribute ... would be considered by their nature to involve a substantial risk of the use of physical force against another.\" S. Rep. No. 96-553, at 849 n.43 (1980). If \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) required a conduct-specific analysis, this statement would make no sense, because using a firearm during and in relation to a narcotics felony would almost certainly generate a substantial risk of force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Congress did not enact this specific bill. But it did subsequently limit \u00a7 924(c) to crimes of violence in 1984, and it defined the term \"crime of violence\" in \u00a7 16 at the same time. Comprehensive Crime Control Act, \u00a7\u00a7 1001, 1005(a), 98 Stat. at 2136, 2138-39. The Senate Judiciary Committee explained that it intended the revised statute to include \"all persons who commit Federal crimes of violence, including those crimes\n   <em>\n    set forth in statutes\n   </em>\n   which already provide for enhanced sentences for their commission with a dangerous weapon.\" S. Rep. No. 98-225, at 313 (1983) (emphasis added). The Committee additionally noted that the \"crime of violence\" limitation \"expand[ed] the scope of\n   <em>\n    predicate offenses\n   </em>\n   ... by including some violent misdemeanors, but restrict[ed] it by excluding non-violent felonies.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 313 n.9 (emphasis added). Though not dispositive, the Committee's language again supports a categorical interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   But, like practical considerations, quotes from committee reports cannot and do not control our reading of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B). We note, however, that the Government has produced nothing from the legislative record to support its conduct-specific interpretation. And if Congress truly intended the materially identical text in \u00a7 16(b) and \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) to embody such divergent\n   approaches, we would expect to find some explanation of that divergence. Instead, the legislative history of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) offers the Government no assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The bedrock doctrine of stare decisis further weakens the Government's position.

Both demand respect for the distinct functions that Congress and the judiciary fulfill in our constitutional republic. Due process requires Congress to speak in definite terms, particularly where the consequences for individual liberties are steep, in part because Congress alone-not the executive or the judiciary-is equipped to balance competing policy priorities and to define the boundaries of criminal law. For similar reasons, although courts must interpret statutes under the presumption that legislators do not intend to violate the Constitution, judges cannot revise invalid statutes.

The Government has not pointed to any other statute that our decision places in jeopardy, and there is no colorable argument that the elements-based categorical approach of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A) suffers from any similar indeterminacy. Section 924(c)(3)(B) is, in other words, the last\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   domino to fall.

Here, for example, the district court was authorized to sentence Simms to as much as 240 months' incarceration on his conviction for Hobbs Act conspiracy alone - that is, more than three years longer than the total sentence it actually imposed on both counts.

Applying the doctrine of constitutional avoidance to\n   <em>\n    narrow\n   </em>\n   a criminal statute's scope advances the interests served by the rule of lenity because it resolves the statutory ambiguity in the criminal defendant's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   By contrast, applying constitutional avoidance to\n   <em>\n    widen\n   </em>\n   a statute's reach fails to keep faith with the rule of lenity because it resolves a statutory ambiguity in a manner contrary to the interests of criminal defendants. Indeed, were the judiciary to rely on constitutional avoidance to interpret a statute's breadth in a manner that extends beyond what the text \"clearly warrants\"-as necessarily occurs when a court adopts a broad reading of an ambiguous statute-it would violate the due process principle of \"fair warning\" undergirding\n   the rule of lenity.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Rather, it is the government's post-\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   about-face as to the proper construction of Section 924(c)(3)(B), and my dissenting colleagues' embrace of that construction, that turns away from the historical understanding and application of that statute.

And they are right. That is why Congress has proscribed conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery and involuntary manslaughter, and why Congress has imposed substantial criminal penalties for individuals who commit those crimes. But that is\n   not the question we must address. Rather, we are tasked with deciding whether Congress intended to hold Defendant criminally liable for the\n   <em>\n    additional\n   </em>\n   offense of using a firearm in commission of an \"\n   <em>\n    offense\n   </em>\n   \" that \"\n   <em>\n    by its nature\n   </em>\n   , involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used.\" \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) (emphases added). And by expressly choosing to render unlawful only those \"offenses\" that \"by [their] nature\" involve application of violent force, Congress sought to limit the universe of defendants prosecutable under Section 924(c)(3)(B) to those defendants who commit crimes\n   <em>\n    the ordinary manifestation of which\n   </em>\n   \"involve[ ] a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   As the majority opinion ably explains, the Supreme Court long has held that when Congress uses that specific language, it intends for courts to apply the ordinary-case categorical approach. And in accordance with the Supreme Court's construction of that language, the government long has argued-including earlier in this case-that Congress intended for courts to apply the ordinary-case categorical approach in determining whether a defendant is amenable to prosecution under Section 924(c)(3)(B). Put simply, until\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   , the judiciary and the government agreed that Congress intended for Section 924(c)(3)(B) to require application of the ordinary-case categorical approach, and therefore that Congress did not contemplate prosecuting individuals like Defendant under that provision. Since Congress enacted Section 924(c)(3)(B) in 1986, Congress never has disturbed that settled understanding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Of course, Congress is free to amend Section 924(c)(3)(B) to permit\n   <em>\n    further\n   </em>\n   punishment of Defendant under that provision. But this Court is not free to expand the statute's reach through an unprecedented application of the doctrine of constitutional avoidance,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   , 543 U.S. at 382,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3442797\" index=\"293\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/371/#p382\">\n    125 S.Ct. 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005) (\"[Constitutional avoidance] is thus a means of giving effect to congressional intent, not of subverting it.\"), particularly in light of the Supreme Court's settled construction of the meaning of Section 924(c)(3)(B) 's key terms,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez de Quijas v.

And, for decades, courts-at the government's express invitation-have applied the ordinary-case categorical approach in accordance with the settled understanding of that statute's text. Constitutional avoidance is \"not a license for the judiciary to rewrite language enacted by the legislature.\"\n   <em>\n    Salinas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11470644\" index=\"297\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/522/52/#p60\">\n    522 U.S. at 60-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11470644\" index=\"298\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/522/52/#p60\">\n    118 S.Ct. 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But that is precisely what would occur if this Court followed my dissenting colleagues' suggestion and relied on constitutional avoidance to expand Section 924(c)(3)(B) 's reach.

After all, that case simply reflected the basic principle that sentencing is a fact-bound matter which requires the exercise of wide discretion by trial judges.

But\n   <em>\n    Gall\n   </em>\n   's promise was never fulfilled. By adopting, expanding, and rigidly applying the categorical approach to the characterization of crimes of violence by a defendant, appellate courts have subjected too many discretionary trial-court sentencing determinations to\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review. This appellate approach has not only led courts to \"reach counterintuitive results, and ones which are not what Congress intended.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

And my friends in the majority are certainly not alone in derogating the fact-finding function, but part of an overreach all too prevalent in appellate ranks throughout the country. The majority cloaks its latest arrogation of authority in dulcet reassurances: \"[N]othing in our holding restricts the broad discretion of district judges to make case-by-case sentencing determinations ... Although judges must consult the advisory Sentencing Guidelines, they may vary from these recommendations in light of the factors listed in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"374\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\" Maj. Op. at 252. It is true that district judges retain the ability to vary from the Sentencing Guidelines' recommendations. But variant sentences can shed their presumption of reasonableness and are more easily slapped down.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"375\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=242%20Fed.%20Appx.%207\">\n    242 Fed. Appx. 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 10 (4th Cir. 2007). What is more, the time and effort we are spending on making categorical determinations unmistakably sends this message: categorical holdings may, in the context of the Guidelines, be \"advisory,\" Maj. Op. at 252-53, but they carry the peremptory bearing of commands. Finally, despite the majority's reassurances, it is openly skeptical of the ability of triers of fact to make the kind of determinations a case-specific approach here would require. Maj. Op. at 247-78. Plainly the majority has far more faith in the ability of appellate judges to make legal determinations than it has in triers-of-fact to make factual ones.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Now triers of fact have suffered a double whammy. Just as application of the categorical approach to crime-of-violence sentencing determinations displaces the district judge, application of the categorical approach to the residual clause of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"376\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3) displaces both the trial judge and jury. The majority converts the question before us-whether Simms committed a crime of violence-from an ordinary one of fact into a lofty one of constitutional law that has nothing at all to do with Simms as an individual. It makes the standard of review\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   . It discards the limited sufficiency review normally reserved for jury verdicts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Musacchio v.

It jettisons the clear error review normally accorded district courts' sentencing findings. In so doing it runs the role of juries and trial judges further into the ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   To this, the majority offers only an adjectival denial that begs the question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at n. 12. Its whole exercise is systemically damaging. In certain circumstances, the categorical approach is useful because it relieves district courts of the institutional burden involved in reaching back through time to discover the undiscoverable.\n   <em>\n    Moncrieffe v. Holder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697041\" index=\"379\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/184/#p200\">\n    569 U.S. 184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 200-01,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697041\" index=\"380\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/184/#p200\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697041\" index=\"381\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/184/#p200\">\n    185 L.Ed.2d 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013). Those circumstances are not present here. Joseph Simms pleaded guilty, not because of some legal misunderstanding but because he robbed a McDonald's at gunpoint. Simms and his conspirator snuck into the occupied restaurant in the middle of the night through the drive-through window. Once inside, Simms used his gun to menace the employees and demand money. He even tried to strike one of them before ordering the workers to gather in the back office. He thereupon forced the manager at gunpoint to open the safe and hand over the money. With the money in hand, Simms struck the manager on the top of his head with the gun, threw the cash drawer at another employee, and fled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   Those are the facts. That is the actuality of it all. The trial court had this entire narrative at its disposal because, like all cases brought under \u00a7 924(c), this conduct was part of instant offense. Simms' actions are amply detailed in the pre-sentencing report which was not contested. Thus, there is not even an arguable institutional deficit at work here; the trier of fact's unique competence should be more than sufficient to decide whether Simms committed a crime of violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   Unlike the categorical approach, the case-specific approach would allow the trial judge and jury to look at what is before them and do what they do best.

Our review would be appropriately deferential and strictly limited, stepping in only if no reasonable trier of fact could have found a crime of violence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

Thus would the case-specific approach begin to right the indefensible imbalance occasioned by appellate micro-management.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Ah, but in abjuring the case-specific approach, the majority is able to say, as a matter of law naturally, that the statute is too vague and that Simms, in conspiring to rob a fast food restaurant at gunpoint, committed no crime of violence. And as it stands, I am left scratching my head and attempting to find some even remotely plausible explanation for the appellate assumption of what should be a routine fact-finding role. I suppose it could be an example of the old Barnum-and-Bailey urge to move our act to center ring. Or perhaps we simply do all this because we can-an exhibition of appellate muscularity profoundly at odds with the restraint belonging to the rule of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   This appellate regency is not consonant with common sense, and is at cross-purposes with the thrust of humane sentencing reforms. Those reforms have concentrated in major part on reducing mandatory sentences for drug offenses.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   First Step Act of 2018, S. 756, 115th Cong. \u00a7 401 (2018) (reducing mandatory minimums for prior drug offenders but expanding them to prior violent felons under the Controlled Substances\n   Act). Here, by contrast, the majority is mounting a transparent attack upon Congress' intent to punish crimes of violence-particularly recidivist crimes of violence-more severely, an intent grounded in the basic proposition that violent offenders,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"389\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), and repeat offenders,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"390\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e), pose a greater threat to public wellbeing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   To repeat, the majority's approach is even at odds with the asserted rationale of the categorical approach itself, which is to spare district courts the burden of relitigating difficult-to-ascertain facts to determine whether or not past offenses are crimes of violence.\n   <em>\n    Moncrieffe\n   </em>\n   , 569 U.S. at 200-01,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697041\" index=\"391\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/184/#p200\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But this is a present-offense case. The trier of fact here has all the tools it needs to do the job. Rather than use these tools, the majority would have us take yet another gratuitous flight from reality by throwing out the entire residual clause of \u00a7 924(c)(3) and potentially releasing a large and untold number of the most violent cohort of criminal offenders prematurely back on to the streets. This approach floats impossibly above the reality that the trier of fact could capably bring to the task. The hallmarks of the appellate ascendancy are once again painfully apparent, including an obliviousness to the fates of future victims, unknown and anonymous to judges, but whom Congress, in its wisdom, sought to shelter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   The credo now seems to be to inflict more, not less, damage upon the whole edifice of law. The majority is so wedded to the categorical approach that it would rather strike down the residual clause of \u00a7 924(c)(3) in its entirety than recognize trial courts' inherent capabilities. Constitutional assault now takes precedence over constitutional avoidance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    *\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   Only by adopting the categorical approach does the majority create constitutional problems for itself. The vagueness question that plagued the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Sessions v. Dimaya\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"392\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/#p1223\">\n    138 S.Ct. 1204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"393\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/#p1223\">\n    200 L.Ed.2d 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018), disappears altogether upon the adoption of the case-specific approach. The text of 18 U.S.C. 924(c)(3)(B) supports it: as Judge Niemeyer indicates, language like \"involves conduct\" and \"in the course of\" and \"by its nature\" can easily and fairly be read to mandate a case-specific approach. The elements clause of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"394\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3)(A) and the residual clause of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"395\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3)(B) were written very differently for a reason. Determinations of \"substantial risk\" are familiar territory to district judges and juries,\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

What, if anything, the text leaves ambiguous, Congress' purpose makes manifest: this statute was plainly intended to punish people like Joseph Simms who use firearms to inspire fear and visit lawless and unforgettable trauma upon their fellow citizens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   This whole enterprise will not end well. Territorial grabs are seldom becoming to the rule of law, and the ouster of trial courts, juries, and indeed Congress from their rightful place in criminal justice is becoming one of the worst. This case does not even mount a frontal assault upon the categorical approach, only to the most extreme manifestations of it. Lacking any rational explanation for the present state of affairs, I can only conclude that the very words \"categorical approach\" exert some irresistible pull on the appellate psyche. Like the children of medieval Hamelin, robbed of their reason, courts are left only to follow the pied piper's song off the cliff.

Specifically, Count I charged that Simms and others conspired to, and did in fact, rob McDonald's Restaurant # 31619 in Goldsboro, North Carolina, on April 14, 2014. To prove that Simms committed that crime, the government would have been required to show that Simms conspired unlawfully to obstruct, delay, or affect commerce by \"robbery,\" defined to mean:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-186\">\n   the unlawful taking or obtaining of personal property from the person or in the presence of another, against his will,\n   <em>\n    by means of actual or threatened force, or violence, or fear of injury\n   </em>\n   , immediate or future, to his person or property, or property in his custody or possession, or the person or property of a relative or member of his family or of anyone in his company at the time of the taking or obtaining.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 1951(b)(1) (emphasis added).

And\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   , he maintains, confirms this conclusion since the text of \" Section 924(c) 's residual clause [defining crime of violence] is identical to Section 16(b).\" According to Simms, \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) compels the use of \"the same ordinary case approach and risk inquiry\" that doomed the provisions in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   , and the same result must therefore also follow here.

Rather, it alleges specific offense conduct, which had to be proved with real-world facts in order to obtain a conviction. Simms was thus placed on full notice of the charges and of what had to be proved against him. The problem identified in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   with courts' imagining \"an 'idealized ordinary case of the crime,' \" such that \"no one could tell how much risk the offense generally posed,\"\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"468\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/#p1223\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"469\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2557 ), is simply not a problem in enforcing \u00a7 924(c). The prosecution of the offense does not involve divining the degree of risk from \"a judge-imagined abstraction-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , an idealized ordinary case of the crime.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1216 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   In short, in both\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court was presented with the problem of\n   <em>\n    applying the ordinary-case categorical approach to a prior conviction\n   </em>\n   and thus imagining an abstract offense with a risk that is unknowable due to that very act of judicial imagination. Under \u00a7 924(c), however, no prior conviction must be imagined. To the contrary, the commission of a crime of violence must be alleged as an\n   <em>\n    element\n   </em>\n   of the \u00a7 924(c) offense and must be proved with real-world facts that occurred on a particular occasion. Thus, the definition of crime of violence, as used in \u00a7 924(c) as an element of the offense, does not implicate the unique context identified in both\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   , where the analysis was limited by the severe restrictions imposed by the categorical approach as applied to assess\n   <em>\n    prior convictions\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   The majority argues that Congress adopted the \"categorical approach\" by including the language in \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) that a crime of violence includes a felony \"offense ... that\n   <em>\n    by its nature\n   </em>\n   , involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\" It asserts that the phrase \"offense ... that by its nature,\" naturally construed, means \"categorically\" and thus incorporates the \"categorical approach.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 239-40, 240-41. Indeed, the majority concludes that the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   \"plausible construction\" of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) is that it \"requires application of the ordinary-case categorical approach.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 240, 251.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   But the majority's insistence on interpreting \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) as requiring the \"categorical approach\" represents the judicial equivalent of cramming a square peg into a round hole. Again, the lynchpin of the majority's textual argument is \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) 's provision that an offense qualifies as a \"violent felony\" if \"\n   <em>\n    by its nature\n   </em>\n   \" it involves the requisite risk of physical force, and it notes that \"nature\" is defined as \"the basic or inherent features, character, or quality of something.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 241 (quoting Oxford Dictionary of English 1183 (3d ed. 2010)). But while the majority emphasizes that \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) uses the phrase \"by its nature\" to modify \"offense,\" it overlooks that \"offense\" is a word that, as the Supreme Court has recognized, is sometimes used in ordinary speech to \"refer to a generic crime, say, the crime of fraud or theft in general\" and other times readily used to \"refer to the specific acts in which an offender engaged on a specific occasion\"-\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , \"the fraud that the defendant planned and executed last month.\"\n   <em>\n    Nijhawan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658219\" index=\"470\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/29/#p33\">\n    557 U.S. at 33-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658219\" index=\"471\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/29/#p33\">\n    129 S.Ct. 2294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Subsection (A) provides that a \"crime of violence\" includes any felony offense that has \"\n   <em>\n    as an element\n   </em>\n   the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force,\" whereas subsection (B) provides that a \"crime of violence\" includes any felony offense that \"\n   <em>\n    by its nature\n   </em>\n   [ ] involves a substantial risk\" of physical force being used in the course of its\n   <em>\n    commission\n   </em>\n   . The phrase \"by its nature\" in subsection (B) is thus distinct from the use of \"elements\" in subsection (A), suggesting that the analysis under subsection (B) should focus not on how an offense is defined by law, but on the nature of the defendant's offense and the degree of risk posed by it. And this interpretation is only strengthened by subsection (B)'s focus on the risk that force may be \"used in the course of committing the offense.\" Moreover, such a distinction between subsections (A) and (B) makes good sense. Subsection (A) thus qualifies a felony as a \"crime of violence\" if its elements require proof that the defendant \"use[d], attempt[ed] [to] use, or threaten[ed] [to] use ... physical force,\" while subsection (B) allows that even if an offense does not have such an\n   <em>\n    element\n   </em>\n   , it can still qualify as a crime of violence if, as committed on a particular occasion, it\n   <em>\n    actually\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    involve[d]\n   </em>\n   a substantial risk\" of physical force being used. And Congress added further certain phrases to emphasize that this determination is intended to be relatively broad, covering even those particular violations that, \"\n   <em>\n    by [their] nature\n   </em>\n   , involve a substantial risk that physical force ...\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   be used.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   This last statutory feature in particular also precludes the majority's additional argument that the rule against surplusage\n   <em>\n    compels\n   </em>\n   a categorical interpretation of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   at 240-41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   To be sure, this reading of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) differs from the interpretation the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   gave to the similar language defining \"violent felony\" in \u00a7 924(e), as well as from the\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   plurality's interpretation of the materially identical text in \u00a7 16(b).

This statute provides two definitions of what constitutes a \"crime of violence.\" The first, sometimes called the \"elements clause,\" focuses on whether the \"elements\" of an offense include the \"use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force.\" The second, called the \"residual clause,\" focuses on whether the offense's \"nature\" involves \"a substantial risk that physical force\" may be \"used in the course of committing the offense.\" As its name conveys, the second clause is residual, meaning it operates as a catch-all for those offenders engaged in this type of risky conduct that might otherwise fail to meet the elements clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Second, a hypothetical one: Does a judicially imagined \"ordinary\" version of the offense involve conduct that presents a substantial risk of force? Third, a factual one: Does the specific offense involve actual conduct that presents a substantial risk of physical force?\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

This approach is similar to the first in that it is \"categorical\": once the courts decide whether a particular criminal statute satisfies the residual clause, that holding applies to any conviction under the statute, without a factfinder looking at what\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   defendant did. Yet it differs from the first in that it looks to conduct: namely \"whether the\n   <em>\n    conduct\n   </em>\n   encompassed by the elements of the offense, in the ordinary case, presents a serious potential risk.\"\n   <em>\n    James v.

This approach is like the second approach, and unlike the first, in that it looks at conduct. Yet unlike the second approach, it is not categorical and requires no judicial ingenuity: it asks only whether the actual conduct committed by the defendant presents a substantial risk on a case-by-case basis. The third approach has significant appeal, relieving judges of imagining hypotheticals and empowering factfinders (generally juries) to do their job.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ante at 262-63 (Wilkinson, J., dissenting).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

To be sure, the term \"offense\" can be read to encompass the formalistic concept of a crime as defined by its elements. Indeed, \"offense\" takes that meaning in subsection A's elements clause. Yet there is little else good to say about this interpretation, and two considerations make it untenable. First, Congress knew how to specify an elements-based approach and did so in subsection A, but not in subsection B.

In addition to the text and practical considerations, one of the main motivators of the \"categorical approach\" was the need to avoid a potential Sixth Amendment problem: if a mandatory sentencing enhancement arose from the facts underlying a prior conviction, as opposed to the fact of conviction itself, then those facts could not be determined by a judge (absent a defendant's wavier).\n   <em>\n    Shepard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5879404\" index=\"536\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/13/#p19\">\n    544 U.S. at 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5879404\" index=\"537\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/13/#p19\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (plurality opinion). The importance of the Sixth Amendment to the history of the categorical approach is hardly controversial. The Supreme Court itself has directed courts to consider \"the categorical approach's Sixth Amendment underpinnings\" when applying it.\n   <em>\n    Descamps\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698469\" index=\"538\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/254/#p267\">\n    570 U.S. at 269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698469\" index=\"539\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/254/#p267\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And multiple panel decisions by this Court have acknowledged as much.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Price\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3986916\" index=\"540\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/777/700/#p708\">\n    777 F.3d at 709-10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   Over time, the categorical approach was extended to new contexts. There are a\n   number of statutes that mix and match similar language to define \"crimes of violence\" or \"violent felonies.\" The language at issue in\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Shepard\n   </em>\n   , the classic cases, encompasses crimes that correspond to the \"generic\" definition of certain enumerated crimes. Other statutes include language resembling the \"elements clause\" of Section 924(c)(3)(A) and the \"residual clause\" of Section 924(c)(3)(B). Unsurprisingly, the Court transplanted the categorical approach into these similar contexts. Yet the Court continued to note the important Sixth Amendment problems that the categorical approach avoided.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556011\" index=\"541\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/192/#p201\">\n    550 U.S. at 213-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556011\" index=\"542\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/192/#p201\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-262\">\n   The majority identifies only two cases suggesting that statutory text alone-unaccompanied by constitutional and other considerations-was sufficient to support the categorical approach. Neither is persuasive in interpreting the statute at hand. The first case,\n   <em>\n    Leocal v. Ashcroft\n   </em>\n   , only superficially supports the majority. After quoting language from the residual clause in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"543\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2016\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (textually similar to the residual clause of Section 924(c)(3)(B) ), the Court stated: \"[t]his language requires us to look to the elements and the nature of the offense of conviction, rather than to the particular facts relating to petitioner's crime.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3442217\" index=\"544\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/1/#p7\">\n    543 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3442217\" index=\"545\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/1/#p7\">\n    125 S.Ct. 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3442217\" index=\"546\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/1/#p7\">\n    160 L.Ed.2d 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004). Yet it is hardly surprising that the Supreme Court did not analyze the issue in detail: the parties, amici, and the Court accepted the application of the categorical approach as an untested premise before addressing the issue presented.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sessions v.

So even were one to read\n   <em>\n    Leocal\n   </em>\n   as finding the \"best\" interpretation, that does not answer whether that is the only plausible interpretation. Moreover,\n   <em>\n    Leocal\n   </em>\n   addressed the application of Section 16 to prior convictions. It is in that context that applying a factual approach would raise the serious practical and Sixth Amendment concerns at issue in\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Shepard\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   . Section 924(c)(3) presents none of those problems, as it applies only to contemporaneous conduct. Nor did\n   <em>\n    Leocal\n   </em>\n   foresee that applying the \"ordinary case\" approach would be unconstitutionally vague under the Fifth Amendment. In fact,\n   <em>\n    Leocal\n   </em>\n   did not even use the term \"ordinary case.\" In sum,\n   <em>\n    Leocal\n   </em>\n   's acceptance of an undisputed premise while interpreting a different statute in a different context without discussing the plausibility of a saving construction does not dictate the interpretation of Section 924(c)(3)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-264\">\n   The second case,\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   , is even less supportive. It is true that Section IV(A) of Justice Kagan's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   held that similar language demands the use of the categorical approach, but that interpretation was only endorsed by a plurality of the Supreme Court. Justice Gorsuch chose not to join that section of the opinion. Under the\n   <em>\n    Marks\n   </em>\n   rule, the binding holding of the Court is the narrowest opinion from those concurring in the judgment.\n   <em>\n    Marks v.

Thus, Justice Gorsuch's narrower concurrence controls. He (like the parties) simply assumed that the \"ordinary case\" approach applied, and on that basis held that \u00a7 16(b) is impermissibly vague.\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 1232-33 (Gorsuch, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-265\">\n   As for the debated language, Justice Gorsuch noted that \"[p]lausibly, anyway,\n   the word 'nature' might refer to an inevitable characteristic of the offense; one that would present itself automatically, whenever the statute is violated.\"\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 1233. He continued, \"[w]hile I remain open to different arguments about our precedent and the proper reading of language like this, I would address them in another case, whether involving the INA or a different statute, where the parties have a chance to be heard and we might benefit from their learning.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, Justice Gorsuch unambiguously stated that he is open to other interpretations, even involving the statute at issue in his own opinion.

In truth, there is not one categorical approach; there are two. When the purely elements-based categorical approach from\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Shepard\n   </em>\n   was applied to residual clauses, it evolved (or perhaps devolved) into the \"ordinary case\" approach.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556011\" index=\"552\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/192/#p201\">\n    550 U.S. at 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556011\" index=\"553\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/192/#p201\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Those two approaches are only superficially similar. The elements-based approach looks only at the formal definition of the offense; the \"ordinary case\" approach tries to construct a hypothetical model of conduct for the offense. In both logic and application, they are as different from each other as they are from the case-specific approach. History has shown that the \"ordinary case\" approach is unworkable, so much so that its application has been declared unconstitutionally vague twice.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"554\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2563 ;\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 1232-33 (Gorsuch, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-267\">\n   In contexts where the Sixth Amendment applies-in particular, mandatory sentencing enhancements for prior convictions-the \"ordinary case\" approach is the only way to interpret a residual clause. But in many contexts, those Sixth Amendment concerns do not apply. This is one of them: The consideration of contemporaneous conduct under Section 924(c)(3)(B) need not create any Sixth Amendment concerns.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ante at 247-48 (Niemeyer, J., dissenting). And we have noted the importance of this distinction when rejecting specific applications of the categorical approach.\n   <em>\n    Price\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3986916\" index=\"555\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/777/700/#p708\">\n    777 F.3d at 709-10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting, in rejecting the categorical approach, that \"Sixth Amendment concerns that compel the judicial use of the categorical approach in other contexts are not present here\").

The Majority's Remaining Arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-269\">\n   The majority advances a grab-bag of other considerations to support its \"ordinary case\" interpretation. Many of these are unpersuasive on their face, but I mention three briefly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-270\">\n   First, the majority argues that adopting the factual approach to the residual clause would lead to a contradiction: \"offense that is a felony\" would be read to have a categorical interpretation in the elements clause, but a case-specific interpretation in the residual clause. Majority Op. at 242-43. This reasoning is hollow because, as I have already explained, there is not only one categorical approach. The hypothetical conduct of the \"ordinary case\" approach adopted by the majority differs substantially from the legal elements of the elements-based approach. Thus, the interpretation the majority adopts is similarly\n   contradictory. And in any event, neither \"contradiction\" is that concerning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nijhawan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658219\" index=\"556\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/29/#p33\">\n    557 U.S. at 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658219\" index=\"557\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/29/#p33\">\n    129 S.Ct. 2294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (The \"statute lists several of its 'offenses' in language that must refer to generic crimes ... [but] it lists certain other 'offenses' using language that almost certainly does not refer to generic crimes but refers to specific circumstances.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-271\">\n   The majority also suggests that reading the residual clause to apply to real-world factual conduct violates the rule against surplusage by draining the phrase \"by its nature\" of any meaning. At the outset, the Supreme Court has explained that the rule against surplusage \"is not absolute\" and is itself to be avoided when it causes more problems than it solves.\n   <em>\n    Lamie v. U.S. Trustee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897517\" index=\"558\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/526/#p536\">\n    540 U.S. 526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 536,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897517,9068198\" index=\"559\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/124/1023/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1023\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897517\" index=\"560\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/526/#p536\">\n    157 L.Ed.2d 1024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004). In any event, \"by its nature\" is not superfluous under the case-specific approach for two reasons. First, the phrase distinguishes subsection B's conduct-based residual clause from subsection A's elements clause. The latter addresses the legal elements of the offense (\"has as an element\"), while the former focuses more broadly on conduct (whether hypothetical or actual conduct).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Price\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3986916\" index=\"561\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/777/700/#p708\">\n    777 F.3d at 708-09\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, \"by its nature\" limits the residual clause to conduct that involves risk inherently or naturally, not merely incidentally or by happenstance. In this sense, the phrase \"by its nature\" acts as an intensifier that limits the clause's application to more dangerous crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-272\">\n   Finally, the majority makes passing reference to the rule of lenity. Majority Op. at 250-51. The majority cites no authority for the proposition that the rule of lenity, grounded in the need for fair warning, demands that this Court knowingly adopt an interpretation so unclear that it is unconstitutionally vague. Indeed, this makes no sense.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

It may well be that no ordinary person would be fairly warned that their conduct might be implicated by the hypothetical, \"ordinary case\" of robbery, but most everyone would understand that pistol whipping someone during an armed robbery is a crime of violence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-273\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-274\">\n   Occasionally we find ourselves so far down the rabbit hole that logic appears upside down. It is true that the faithful application of the law may lead to odd results. And I certainly do not fault the majority for following its analysis to this seemingly nonsensical result. For good judges must be willing to reach results that go against their preferences when those results are dictated by principles or precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-275\">\n   But judges are also required to exercise restraint. Voiding an act of Congress is an extraordinary exercise of judicial power, and accordingly, such power should only be invoked when it is incumbent upon us to do so. Here, the statute plausibly permits looking directly at Simms's conduct in pistol whipping a manager during a robbery in determining whether his conduct qualified as a crime of violence under the residual clause. We are therefore required to adopt that reading. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-293\">\n    Gov. 28(j) letter at 2, ECF No. 44 (Oct. 19, 2016);\n    <em>\n     see also, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Assuming it matters, I cannot as an empirical matter reasonably identify whether the former group is larger than the latter.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Dimaya\n    </em>\n    , 138 S.Ct. at 1232 (Gorsuch, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (rhetorically asking whether \"a conviction for witness tampering ordinarily involve[s] a threat to the kneecaps or just the promise of a bribe\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-309\">\n    Moreover, the concurrence's characterization of what it means to \"expand\" a statute's reach is perverse. A judicially-imagined \"ordinary case\" can ensnare a defendant whose actual conduct created no risk of violence, a result barred by the case-specific approach. It is the \"ordinary case\" approach that expands the statute to cover hypothetical conduct imagined by a court. And this is why the \"ordinary case\" approach is unconstitutionally vague. A far more precise approach is to let juries determine guilt based on the real actions taken by the defendant.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Harriss\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11302068\" index=\"590\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/347/612/#p617\">\n     347 U.S. at 618\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11302068\" index=\"591\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/347/612/#p617\">\n     74 S.Ct. 808\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (noting the duty to make the \"class of offenses ... constitutionally definite\"). It is entirely proper to replace an unworkable, unconstitutionally vague interpretation with a readily-comprehensible, textually-supported interpretation, even if that interpretation would \"expand\" liability by clarifying which conduct falls within the statute and which does not.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
