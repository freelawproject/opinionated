He was sentenced to 240 months in prison and ordered to pay $189,933.31 in restitution, with interest charged. The judgment provided that $100 was \"due immediately\" and provided the following payment schedule for the remaining amount:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   Balance due in payments of the greater of $25 per quarter or 50% of any wages earned while in prison in accordance with the Bureau of Prisons' Inmate Financial Responsibility Program. Any balance remaining after release from imprisonment shall be paid in equal monthly installments of $500 to commence 60 days after the release to a term of supervision.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Several years later the government discovered that Hughes had accumulated $3,464.85-largely prison wages-in his inmate trust account. Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203613\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3613\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), 3664(n), and 3664(k), the government\n   moved for the immediate turnover of those funds. Hughes opposed the request and filed a cross-motion to release funds, arguing,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the district court (1) only required him to make payments in installments and (2) \"specifically declined to order immediate payment of the entire amount.\" Agreeing with the government, however, the district court ordered the immediate turnover of \"funds up to the amount of $ 201,493.63,\" with a $200 carve out for Hughes's telephone and commissary needs. Hughes timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On appeal, Hughes argues that the district court erred in granting the government's motion because his criminal judgment required the restitution balance owed beyond $100 to be paid in quarterly installments and did not order that the balance be paid immediately. Because the government does not allege that he defaulted on his restitution payments, Hughes argues, the government lacked the authority to seek immediate payment of the full restitution amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The parties do not cite, and research has not revealed, any binding precedent from this court analyzing a case similar to Hughes's, in which the criminal judgment included a repayment schedule that began during the term of imprisonment but did not state that the full restitution amount was due immediately. Hughes, however, directs us to\n   <em>\n    United States v. Martinez\n   </em>\n   , in which the Tenth Circuit confronted a structurally similar payment schedule.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4085213\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/1200/\">\n    812 F.3d 1200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir. 2015). The judgment in\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   required the defendant to pay \"$300 immediately,\" with the \"balance due\" in accordance with an installment schedule.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4085213\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/1200/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4085213\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/1200/\">\n    at 1203-04\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although the defendant had complied with his payment plan, the government nevertheless sought garnishment of his retirement accounts.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4085213\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/1200/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4085213\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/1200/\">\n    at 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Tenth Circuit concluded that the government lacked the authority to garnish the defendant's retirement accounts because doing so would exceed the terms of the restitution order; it reasoned that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   By statute, it is the district court-not the government-that determines how a defendant is to pay restitution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [ 18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3664(f)(2) (\"[T]he\n   <em>\n    court\n   </em>\n   shall ... specify in the restitution order the manner in which, and the schedule according to which, the restitution is to be paid ....\" (emphasis added) ). Thus, the government can enforce only what the district court has ordered the defendant to pay.\n   <em>\n    See Enforce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   645 (10th ed. 2014) (defining \"enforce\" primarily as \"[t]o give force or effect to [a law]; to compel obedience to [a law]\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4085213\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/1200/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court rejected the government's argument that it could enforce the full amount notwithstanding the installment schedule, construing \u00a7 3572(d), which provides that \"[a] person sentenced to pay ... restitution ... shall make such payment immediately, unless, in the interest of justice, the court provides for payment ... in installments,\" to imply that the full restitution amount is not due immediately when a court orders repayment pursuant to an installment-based plan.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4085213\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/1200/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4085213\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/1200/\">\n    at 1205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We are persuaded by the Tenth Circuit's analysis. When a restitution order specifies an installment plan, unless there is language directing that the funds are also immediately due, the government cannot attempt to enforce the judgment beyond its plain terms absent a modification of the restitution order or default on the payment plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3572(d)(1);\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4085213\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/1200/\">\n    812 F.3d at 1205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Turning to Hughes's order, we find no language directing that the full restitution amount was immediately due or owing, and the government does\n   not allege he was in default.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Like\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   , Hughes's criminal judgment specifies that a small amount ($100) was due immediately, and for the remaining balance to be paid in installments. The government cannot enforce restitution payments beyond those terms unless Hughes defaults on his payments or the district court modifies the payment schedule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The government points to\n   <em>\n    United States v. Ekong\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556872\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/518/285/\">\n    518 F.3d 285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 2007) (per curiam) and\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Both are distinguishable because the judgments in those cases contained different language. The payment schedule in\n   <em>\n    Ekong\n   </em>\n   , for example, was conditioned on whether a balance remained when the defendant began her term of supervised release.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In rejecting the defendant's argument that the government was barred from seeking immediate payment \"because the criminal judgment specified that restitution be paid in installments,\" we noted that \"[t]here [was] nothing in the criminal judgment to the contrary.\"\n   <em>\n    Ekong\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556872\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/518/285/\">\n    518 F.3d at 286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . From this, we infer that the full restitution amount was collectible immediately simply because the payment schedule was never triggered.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556872\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/518/285/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4085213\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/1200/\">\n    812 F.3d at 1207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Ekong\n   </em>\n   is thus distinguishable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   And the judgment in\n   <em>\n    Diehl\n   </em>\n   did not specify a payment schedule; rather, it provided that \"[i]f the defendant is unable to pay this indebtedness at this time, the defendant shall cooperate fully with the [government] to make payment in full as so[o]n as possible, including during any period of incarceration.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277606\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/848/629/\">\n    848 F.3d at 630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The relevant issue there was whether the defendant's participation in the BOP's inmate financial responsibility program and adherence to its payment schedule barred the government from enforcing the full restitution amount.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277606\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/848/629/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277606\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/848/629/\">\n    at 633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although we agreed with the decisions of other courts \"determining that an inmate's compliance with an IFRP payment schedule does not change the fact that the Government may collect on a criminal monetary penalty immediately,\" we noted this would only be the case \"where the judgment does not specify a payment schedule.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277606\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/848/629/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Indeed, we held the government could demand immediate payment in\n   <em>\n    Diehl\n   </em>\n   because the judgment \"did not ... specify installment payments for satisfaction of either the fine or the special assessment as required by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203572\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3572\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) to disrupt the default rule of immediate payment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203572\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203572\">\n    at 635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Importantly, we noted that the government's \"enforcement of the order against Diehl's property, including surplus funds held in his inmate trust account,\n   <em>\n    did not exceed the terms of the original judgment\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203572\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). As discussed,\n   that is not the case here, as the government's attempt to enforce the full restitution amount conflicts with the installment-based directive in Hughes's original judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The government argues in the alternative that it is entitled to the funds in Hughes's trust account by virtue of \u00a7 3664(n), which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   If a person obligated to provide restitution, or pay a fine, receives substantial resources from any source, including inheritance, settlement, or other judgment, during a period of incarceration, such person shall be required to apply the value of such resources to any restitution or fine still owed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We do not think the gradual accumulation of prison wages constitutes \"substantial resources\" such that it fits within \u00a7 3664(n) 's ambit; rather we think this provision refers to windfalls or sudden financial injections.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, in\n   <em>\n    United States v.
