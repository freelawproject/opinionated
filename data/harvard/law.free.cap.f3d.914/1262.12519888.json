The tax refund was issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to United Western Bancorp, Inc. (UWBI), a thrift holding company that had, under the terms of a written \"Tax Allocation Agreement,\" filed consolidated returns on behalf of itself and several subsidiary corporations. The tax refund was the result, however, of net operating losses incurred by United Western Bank (the Bank), one of UWBI's subsidiaries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Simon Rodriguez, in his capacity as the Chapter 7 Trustee for the bankruptcy estate of UWBI, initiated this adversary proceeding against the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), as receiver for the Bank, alleging that the tax refund was owned by UWBI and was thus part of the bankruptcy estate. The bankruptcy court agreed and entered summary judgment in favor of the Trustee. The FDIC appealed to the district court, which reversed the decision of the bankruptcy court. The Trustee now appeals from the district court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Exercising jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20158\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1), we agree with the district court that the tax refund belongs to the FDIC, as receiver for the Bank.

Similar treatment is optional at UWBI discretion for nonregulated first-tier Affiliates. Any refund shall generally not exceed the amount claimed or received as a refund resulting from a carryback claim filed by UWBI. However, this shall not prevent UWBI from the ability to make a refund over the amount received or claimed as a refund or carryback, if in its sole discretion it believes such payment is in its best interest. Additionally, if part of [sic] all of an unused consolidated net operating loss, net capital loss, tax credit or similar type item is allocated to an Affiliate pursuant to Regulations Section 1.1502-21, and it is carried back, if utilized, or it is carried forward, whether or not utilized, to a year in which such Affiliate filed a separate income tax return or a consolidated federal income tax return with another group, any refund or reduction in tax liability arising from the carryback or carryforward shall be retained by such Affiliate and such item shall not enter into the calculation of liability to or from UWBI.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   2.

Based upon the Bank's 2010 net operating losses, UWBI, at some point in 2011, filed on behalf of the affiliated group a tax refund request of $4,846,625 to recover a portion of the taxes paid by the Bank on its 2008 taxable income.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    d) Appointment of the FDIC as receiver for the Bank\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Bank was a federally chartered savings and loan association. On January 21, 2011, the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) closed the Bank and appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as receiver. Shortly thereafter, the FDIC notified the IRS of these events.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    e) UWBI's bankruptcy proceedings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Because the Bank was UWBI's principal, if not sole, source of income, the Bank's receivership resulted in UWBI becoming insolvent. On March 2, 2012, UWBI filed a petition for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. As of that date, the tax refund request that UWBI filed in 2011 was still pending before the IRS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On August 30, 2012, the FDIC filed a proof of claim in UWBI's bankruptcy case in the aggregate amount of $4,847,000. The FDIC alleged that, as receiver for the Bank, it was entitled to the federal tax refund that was due and owing from the IRS to the affiliate group because the refund stemmed exclusively from the Bank's business loss carrybacks. The FDIC also alleged that its claim covered \"potential fraudulent transfers or unlawful dividends, unearned insurance premiums to the extent that the source of the premium payments was the Bank, insurance proceeds paid under applicable insurance coverage for any such losses, and other protective claims.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201504\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201504\">\n    at 62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The bankruptcy case was converted to a Chapter 7 proceeding on April 15, 2013.

The bankruptcy court subsequently authorized the tax refund to be deposited into the court's registry. On November 25, 2014, the FDIC filed a counterclaim alleging that the FDIC, as the receiver for and successor to the Bank, owned the tax refund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On October 30, 2015, the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. The FDIC argued that there was \"no provision in the ... Agreement that transfers ownership of the Bank-generated tax refunds to [UWBI], indicates that the Bank intended to transfer beneficial ownership of the tax refunds to [UWBI], or otherwise alters the widely recognized default rule regarding ownership of tax refunds by the entity\n   in a consolidated tax group that generated those tax refunds.\" Aplt. App., Vol. I at 78. The FDIC also argued that \"[e]ven if the anticipated tax refund is paid to [UWBI], [UWBI] acts as agent for the Affiliated Group and, therefore, would only hold bare legal title in the tax refund.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20542\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Trustee argued, in contrast, that the Agreement \"establishe[d] a debtor-creditor relationship between [UWBI] and the Bank with respect to any tax refunds\" and that \"[i]f and when the Refund [wa]s paid to UWBI the funds w[ould] therefore become property of the [bankruptcy] Estate and [the FDIC] w[ould] have an unsecured, nonpriority claim for its pro rata share.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20542\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20542\">\n    at 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In 2015, the IRS, after completing an audit, issued a refund in the amount of $4,081,334.67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On September 16, 2016, the bankruptcy court issued an opinion and order granting summary judgment in favor of the Trustee and denying the FDIC's motion for summary judgment.

App., Vol. II at 382 (quoting \u00a7 541(a) ). The bankruptcy court also noted that \"[a] long line of bankruptcy cases (even pre-dating the modern Bankruptcy Code) dictate that if a debtor owns or is entitled to a federal loss carryback tax refund, such refund generally becomes property of the debtor's bankruptcy estate.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20541\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20541\">\n    at 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The bankruptcy court concluded that the Agreement, \"the Internal Revenue Code, and the IRS regulations all dictate that [UWBI], as the bank holding company for the Affiliated Group has\n   <em>\n    at least bare legal title\n   </em>\n   to the Tax Refund.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20541\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20541\">\n    at 386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original). \"After all,\" the bankruptcy court noted, \"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201.1502-77\">\n    26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.1502-77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(5) requires that the Tax Refund be made 'directly to and in the name of' [UWBI].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201.1502-77\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The bankruptcy court in turn concluded that the FDIC failed to establish that the Bank had equitable ownership of the Tax Refund.

Specifically, certain of its provisions suggest the existence of an agency relationship, while other provisions suggest the intent to create something other than an agency relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   As noted, Section A.1 of the Agreement, which is contained under the heading \"General Rule - Federal,\" provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   If a regulated first-tier Affiliate incurs a net operating loss or excess tax credits, the regulated Affiliate is entitled to a refund equal to the amount that it would have been entitled to receive had it not joined in the filing of a consolidated return with UWBI. Similar treatment is optional at UWBI discretion for nonregulated first-tier Affiliates. Any refund shall generally not exceed the amount claimed or received as a refund resulting from a carryback claim filed by UWBI. However, this shall not prevent UWBI from the ability to make a refund over the amount received or claimed as a refund or carryback, if in its sole discretion it believes such payment is in its best interest. Additionally, if part of [sic] all of an unused consolidated net operating loss, net capital loss, tax credit or similar type item is allocated to an Affiliate pursuant to Regulations Section 1.1502-21, and it is carried back, if utilized, or it is carried forward, whether or not utilized, to a year in which such Affiliate filed a separate income tax return or a consolidated federal income tax return with another group, any refund or reduction in tax liability arising from the carryback or carryforward shall be retained by such Affiliate and such item shall not enter into the calculation of liability to or from UWBI.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Aplt. App., Vol. I at 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The first of these sentences-stating that \"[i]f a regulated first-tier Affiliate,\" i.e., the Bank, \"incurs a net operating loss or excess tax credits, the regulated Affiliate is entitled to a refund equal to the amount that it would have been entitled to receive had it not joined in the filing of a consolidated return with USBI\"-is arguably ambiguous. On the one hand, it purports to \"entitle[ ]\" the regulated affiliate \"to a refund equal to the amount that it would have received had it not joined in the filing of a consolidated return.\" On the other hand, when contrasted with the last sentence, it does not give the Bank the right to \"retain\" the refund. Instead, under the first sentence, a refund received by UWBI as a result of a net operating loss incurred by the Bank is taken into account by the parties in calculating their year-end liabilities to each other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The second and third sentences of Section A.1 afford UWBI with two types of discretion: (1) whether to pay any refund at all to a nonregulated affiliate; and (2) when it pays a refund to any affiliate, whether to pay an amount equivalent to the amount the affiliate would have received had it filed its own income tax return, or instead to pay a greater amount. These sentences thus arguably point toward something more than a mere agency relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The last sentence of Section A.1 indicates that if a net operating loss of any affiliate is carried back to a year when that affiliate was filing a separate income tax return (or filing a consolidated return with another group), then \"any refund ... shall be retained by such Affiliate and such item will not enter into the calculation of liability to or from UWBI.\" This arguably suggests that, in all other situations, an affiliate does not \"retain\" a tax refund and, instead, refunds are taken into consideration during the annual reconciliation of liability between the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Section A.2 of the Agreement, which is also contained under the heading \"General Rule - Federal,\" states: \"In essence, this Agreement requires that each first-tier subsidiary be treated as a separate taxpayer with UWBI merely being an intermediary between an Affiliate and the Internal Revenue Service ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6229968\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/393/#p398\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Although the term \"intermediary\" is not expressly defined in the Agreement, it is commonly understood to mean \"[a] mediator or go-between.\"\n   <em>\n    Intermediary\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). Thus, in contrast to\n   most of Section A.1, Section A.2 clearly points to the existence of an agency relationship between UWBI and its affiliates, rather than a debtor/creditor relationship. In other words, it suggests that UWBI will simply act as a conduit through which the refund will pass.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Section F of the Agreement, entitled \"Tax Settlement Payments - Federal and State,\" states, in pertinent part, that affiliates are to make \"[e]stimated payments of Federal ... taxes\" to UWBI on a specified quarterly basis (April 15, June 15, September 15, and December 15).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44.

In turn, Section E, when considered together with Section A, obligates UWBI to (1) refund to its affiliates, by November 15th following the end of the taxable year, any overpayments of estimated taxes, (2) expedite any such refund if an affiliate has a taxable loss for the year in question and the affiliate files with UWBI an expedited refund claim by February 15th following the end of the taxable year, and (3) ensure that, when a regulated first-tier affiliate incurs a net operating loss or excess tax credits, any such refunds paid to that affiliate are equal to or greater than the amount that such affiliate would have been entitled to receive had it not joined in the filing of the consolidated tax return.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Section G of the Agreement states that \"[e]ach Affiliate hereby appoints UWBI as its agent ... for the purpose of filing such consolidated Federal income tax returns for the UWBI group as UWBI may elect to file and making any election, application, or taking any action in connection therewith on behalf of the Affiliates.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Lastly, Section H of the Agreement, entitled \"Miscellaneous,\" contains two relevant paragraphs.

Affiliates are obligated, by way of both estimated and final tax payments, to pay UWBI the precise amount of their federal income tax obligations. UWBI, in turn, is obligated to refund to its affiliates any overpayments of estimated taxes. When an affiliate incurs a taxable loss due to net operating losses or excess tax credits, UWBI's obligations depend upon the nature of the affiliate. If the affiliate is a regulated, first-tier affiliate such as the Bank, then UWBI is obligated to pay that affiliate \"a refund equal to\" or greater than \"the amount that it would have been entitled to receive had it not joined in the filing of a consolidated return with UWBI.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41 (\u00a7 A.1 of the Agreement). For \"nonregulated first-tier Affiliates,\" UWBI has the discretion to decide whether or not to treat them similarly to regulated first-tier affiliates in terms of tax refunds. Id.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Critically, however, the Agreement is, on its face, ambiguous with respect to the type of relationship it intends to create between UWBI and regulated, first-tier affiliates, such as the Bank, regarding the ownership of refunds from the IRS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pinnacol Assurance v. Hoff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6795094\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/375/1214/#p1229\">\n    375 P.3d 1214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1229 (Colo. 2016) (noting that a contract is ambiguous if it is reasonably susceptible of more than one meaning);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6795094\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/375/1214/#p1229\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"Whether a written contract is ambiguous is a question of law that we review de novo.\"). On the one hand, portions of the Agreement quite clearly indicate the intent to create an agency relationship between UWBI and its regulated, first-tier affiliates. For example, Section A.2 states that \"each first-tier subsidiary [is to] be treated as a separate taxpayer with UWBI merely being an intermediary between an Affiliate and the\" IRS. Aplt. App., Vol. I at 41. Likewise, Section G states that UWBI is being appointed by each affiliate to act as its agent for purposes of filing the consolidated tax return and taking any action in connection therewith. On the other hand, portions of the Agreement arguably suggest the intent for UWBI to retain tax refunds before forwarding them on to regulated, first-tier\n   affiliates. For example, parts of Section A.1 imply that UWBI will retain tax refunds and then later take them into account during the annual settlement process. In addition, the fact that Section A.1 affords UWBI with discretion regarding the amount to refund a regulated, first-tier affiliate (i.e, the exact amount of the refund or a greater amount) seems to suggest something other than an agency relationship. Finally, the ambiguity of the Agreement on this issue is compounded by the fact that it contains no language requiring UWBI to utilize a trust or escrow for tax refunds-which would suggest the existence of an agency or trust relationship-nor does it contain provisions for interest and collateral-which would be indicative of a debtor-creditor relationship.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re NetBank, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699424,3656854\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/729/1344/\">\n    729 F.3d 1344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1351 (11th Cir. 2013) ;\n   <em>\n    Fed.

Section H.4 of the Agreement states that \"[a]ny ambiguity in the interpretation hereof shall be resolved, with a view to effectuating such intent [i.e., to provide an equitable allocation of the tax liability of the Group among UWBI and the Affiliates], in favor of any insured depository institution.\" Aplt. App., Vol. I at 45. Quite clearly, construing the Agreement to create an agency relationship between UWBI and the Bank with respect to federal tax refunds-and thereby affording ownership of the tax refund to the Bank-is more favorable to the Bank than construing the Agreement to create a debtor/creditor relationship and thus affording ownership of federal tax refunds to UWBI. We therefore conclude that the ambiguity in the Agreement must be construed in favor of the Bank and the FDIC, and that, consequently, the Agreement must be read as creating only an agency relationship between UWBI and the Bank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   In sum, we conclude that the Agreement creates an agency relationship between UWBI and the Bank and that, consequently, the Agreement's intended treatment of tax refunds does not differ from the general rule outlined in\n   <em>\n    Barnes\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Bob Richards\n   </em>\n   . Therefore, we conclude that the tax refund at issue belongs to the Bank, and that the FDIC, as receiver for the Bank, was entitled to summary judgment in its favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   We AFFIRM the judgment of the district court and REMAND to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    Prior to 2008, UWBI and its affiliates had filed taxes under similar, but not identical, written agreements.
