By his motion, Jones sought to be resentenced based on the contention that - in light of recent Supreme Court decisions - he no longer qualifies for the fifteen-year mandatory minimum sentence required by the Armed Career Criminal Act (the \"ACCA\"). According to Jones, he does not have the three predicate convictions that are required to be properly designated as an \"armed career criminal.\" More specifically, he maintains that his South Carolina felony conviction for assaulting, beating, or wounding a law enforcement officer while resisting arrest (hereinafter, the \"ABWO offense\") is not a \"violent felony\" predicate conviction under the ACCA. As explained below, we agree with Jones that the ABWO offense is not an ACCA \"violent felony,\" and we thus vacate and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On April 10, 2007, a jury in South Carolina found Jones guilty of the federal offense of possessing a firearm as a convicted felon, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1). Leading to his sentencing hearing, the probation officer prepared a presentence report (the \"PSR\") that recommended to the district court that Jones be designated as an \"armed career criminal\" under the ACCA. The ACCA mandates that a defendant who contravenes \u00a7 922(g)(1) is subject to a minimum sentence of fifteen years - as opposed to the otherwise applicable ten-year maximum for that offense - if the defendant has three prior \"violent felony\" or \"serious drug offense\" convictions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2), (e)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the PSR did not identify the specific offenses on which it relied for the ACCA enhancement, it identified several prior convictions of Jones for South Carolina offenses, including those for attempted burglary, second-degree\n   burglary, and strong arm robbery. In addition, the PSR relied on an ABWO offense, which violates South Carolina Code section 16-9-320(B) (hereinafter, the \"ABWO statute\"), plus two convictions for assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature (\"ABHAN\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the sentencing hearing conducted on March 20, 2008, the district court ruled - consistent with the PSR - that Jones was an armed career criminal because he had at least three prior \"violent felony\" convictions. Pursuant to the ACCA, a \"violent felony\" is any crime punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another [the \"force clause\"]; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives [the \"enumerated crimes clause\"], or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another [the \"residual clause\"].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B). The ACCA thus contains three distinct clauses (i.e., the force clause, the enumerated crimes clause, and the residual clause) that define a \"violent felony.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Relying on the ACCA's force and enumerated crimes clauses, the district court determined that Jones's prior convictions for attempted burglary, second-degree burglary, and strong arm robbery were ACCA \"violent felon[ies],\" and were thus ACCA predicate offenses. Although the Government argued that Jones's other convictions - the ABWO offense and the ABHAN offenses - also constituted ACCA predicates, the court did not address that proposition. Because of his armed career criminal designation, Jones was subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years. The court sentenced him to 456 months in prison.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Jones appealed his conviction and sentence to this Court, and his counsel filed what we call an \"\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   brief,\" advising us that he could not identify any reversible error, but questioning whether the sentencing court had correctly designated Jones to be an armed career criminal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Relying on Jones's convictions for second-degree burglary, strong arm robbery, and the ABHAN offenses, we ruled that Jones had been correctly classified as an armed career criminal and affirmed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The\n   <em>\n    Johnson II\n   </em>\n   decision had invalidated as unconstitutionally vague the residual clause of the ACCA's \"violent felony\" definition, as codified in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). That decision, however, left intact the ACCA's other two clauses defining a \"violent felony,\" i.e., the force clause and enumerated crimes clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Soon thereafter, in\n   <em>\n    Welch v. United States\n   </em>\n   , the Court ruled that\n   <em>\n    Johnson II\n   </em>\n   applies retroactively to cases on collateral review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12595643\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1257/#p1268\">\n    136 S.Ct. 1257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1268,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12595643\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1257/#p1268\">\n    194 L.Ed.2d 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). As a result of the Court's rulings in\n   <em>\n    Johnson II\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Welch\n   </em>\n   , we authorized Jones to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion in the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   By way of his \u00a7 2255 motion, Jones contended that he no longer qualified for an ACCA-enhanced sentence and that he was entitled to be resentenced to no more than ten years. The Government disagreed, however, and moved for summary judgment. It asserted - even after\n   <em>\n    Johnson II\n   </em>\n   - that Jones yet had at least three predicate \"violent felony\" convictions. In particular, the Government argued that Jones had been twice convicted of strong arm robbery in South Carolina and once convicted of the ABWO offense. Significantly, the Government no longer argued that Jones's convictions for attempted burglary, second-degree burglary, and the ABHAN offenses were ACCA predicate convictions, apparently because of intervening decisions from the Supreme Court and this Court interpreting the ACCA's definition of a \"violent felony.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On January 11, 2018, the district court granted summary judgment to the Government and denied Jones's \u00a7 2255 motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Jones\n   </em>\n   , No. 4:06-cr-01238 (D.S.C. Jan. 11, 2018), ECF No. 204. In so ruling, the court relied on our 2016 decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Doctor\n   </em>\n   , where we concluded - notwithstanding\n   <em>\n    Johnson II\n   </em>\n   - that South Carolina's strong arm robbery offense is a \"violent felony\" under the ACCA's force clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12126093\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/842/306/#p312\">\n    842 F.3d 306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 312 (4th Cir. 2016). The summary judgment decision thus ruled that Jones still had at least two ACCA predicate convictions. The court then also concluded that other convictions earlier used to declare Jones an armed career criminal - attempted burglary, second-degree burglary, and the ABHAN offenses - no longer qualify as ACCA predicate offenses. Consequently, the court recognized that Jones's armed career criminal designation depended solely on whether his ABWO offense constitutes an ACCA \"violent felony.\" The court then ruled that the ABWO offense is a \"violent felony\" under the force clause of the ACCA, that Jones had thus been properly sentenced as an armed career criminal, and that he was not entitled to \u00a7 2255 relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The district court nevertheless saw fit to issue Jones a certificate of appealability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202253\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (providing that a court of appeals can only review the final order in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding if a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability based on \"a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\").

Our plenary review of such a denial encompasses the question of whether a prior conviction qualifies as a \"violent felony\" under the ACCA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Put succinctly, an ACCA-enhanced sentence is illegal if a retroactive change in the applicable law leaves the enhancement unsupported by the necessary three predicate convictions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Jones maintains that the ABWO offense is not a \"violent felony\" under the applicable categorical approach because it does not have, as an element, the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force. More specifically, Jones argues that the Supreme Court has ruled that the ACCA's force clause applies only to those felony offenses that categorically involve violent physical force,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446767,3581927\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/133/\">\n    559 U.S. 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 140,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446767,3581927\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/133/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581927,12446767\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/176/1/\">\n    176 L.Ed.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010), and that the ABWO offense can be committed without the use, attempted use, or threatened use of such force.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Government agrees with Jones that the categorical approach applies in these proceedings. It nevertheless argues, however, that the district court did not err in ruling that the ABWO offense is a \"violent felony.\" The Government contends that the ABWO offense fits squarely within the ACCA's force clause because, in order to commit that offense, a person must use or threaten to use violent physical force\n   against another. Consequently, our resolution of this appeal turns on whether a conviction for the ABWO offense requires the use, attempted use, or threatened use of violent physical force.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Before resolving that question, however, we will first explain how the categorical approach applies to the ABWO offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We begin our analysis with the parties' agreement that the categorical approach applies to our assessment of the ABWO statute. As a general proposition, we are obliged to use the categorical approach when deciding whether a state offense constitutes a \"violent felony.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598042\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2243/#p2256\">\n    136 S.Ct. 2243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2256-57,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598042\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2243/#p2256\">\n    195 L.Ed.2d 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016) (explaining difference between elements of offense and means of commission). In other words, the ABWO statute contains a single physical action element and that element can be satisfied by proof of any one of the three specified means of commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   At least two other sound reasons support our determination concerning the applicability of the categorical approach. First, there is no authority from the South Carolina courts requiring that a jury agree on the way the defendant's physical action contravened the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mathis\n   </em>\n   , 136 S.Ct. at 2256 (observing that, where jury need not make unanimous finding as to any item contained in statutory list, the listed items are each single means of committing offense). To the contrary, the only South Carolina appellate decision we have identified that discusses jury instructions for the ABWO offense recounts that the trial court had instructed the jury that it only had to find that the defendant had assaulted, beaten, or wounded the police officer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2609772\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/367/192/\">\n    367 S.C. 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2609772\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/367/192/\">\n    624 S.E.2d 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 446 (S.C. Ct. App. 2005). Second, the ABWO statute does not provide for any alternative punishments that depend on whether the defendant had either assaulted,\n   beaten, or wounded the officer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mathis\n   </em>\n   , 136 S.Ct. at 2256 (explaining that court can look to whether \"statutory alternatives carry different punishments\"). We are therefore satisfied to apply the categorical approach to the ABWO offense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   With application of the categorical approach being resolved, we turn to how that approach applies in this appeal. We have recognized that the categorical approach \"focuses on the elements, rather than the facts, of the prior offense.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Because South Carolina courts have actually applied the ABWO statute in such a situation, we are convinced that the realistic probability test has been satisfied. Specifically, in\n   <em>\n    State v.

Because South Carolina applies the ABWO statute to conduct that does not involve the use, attempted use, or threatened use of violent physical force against another, the ABWO offense is not categorically a \"violent felony\" under the ACCA's force clause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Our conclusion is informed by, and faithful to, our 2013 decision concerning the South Carolina ABHAN offense in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Government fails, however, to identify any South Carolina precedent supporting that proposition.
