App'x 543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 544 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (Newman, J., dissenting) (noting that missing \"an opportunity for this court to determine whether the district court's decision was in compliance with the venue requirements revived by\n   <em>\n    TC Heartland\n   </em>\n   may have harsh consequences\" and collecting cases). Given our established practice\n   of taking up other important and undecided issues of judicial administration on mandamus in the wake of\n   <em>\n    TC Heartland\n   </em>\n   , I see no justification for us to sit idly by while uncertainty builds and litigants and courts expend their resources on issues that we could have provided guidance on here. I am confident that my colleagues will eventually appreciate the widespread implications of the issue before us in this case. The question is not if we will take this issue up, but when, and how many judicial and party resources will have been needlessly wasted by the time we do.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    Docket Navigator , https://compass.docketnavigator.com (last visited, February 1, 2019) (running search for Party: Google; Court: Texas Eastern District; and Case Filing Date: On or after 2018-10-29)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
