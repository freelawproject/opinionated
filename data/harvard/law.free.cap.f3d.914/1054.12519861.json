Our specific interest is the cattle industry. People have been raising cattle since the early Neolithic Age, some 10,000 years ago, when members of the\n   <em>\n    Bovidae\n   </em>\n   family were first domesticated. See Mario Melletti,\n   <em>\n    Cattle Domestication: from Aurochs to Cow\n   </em>\n   , CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY PRESS : FIF\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   TEENEIGHTYFOUR (Feb. 18, 2018), http://www.cambridgeblog.org/2016/02/cattle-domestication-from-aurochs-to-cow/. Not surprisingly, production techniques have evolved over the millennia. The innovation at the heart of the present controversy is the development of sperm-sorting technology. This process enables cattle breeders to determine the sex of calves by separating a sample of bull semen into X-chromosome bearing and Y-chromosome bearing sperm cells. The resulting product-\"sexed semen\"-is then used to inseminate cows artificially. With this technology, dairy farmers can be sure they will breed only milk-producing cows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Until recently, Inguran, LLC, which does business as Sexing Technologies (\"Sexing Tech\"), held a monopoly on the market for sexed cattle semen in the United States. ABS Global, Inc., which runs a large bull-stud operation, hoped to change that. Believing that its efforts had been thwarted in ways that violated the antitrust laws, ABS sued Sexing Tech in the Western District of Wisconsin in 2014. It alleged, among other things, that Sexing Tech had unlawfully monopolized the domestic sexed-semen market in violation of section 2 of the Sherman Act by using its market power to impose coercive contract terms. ABS sought a declaratory judgment proclaiming those contracts invalid, hoping to clear the way for its own entry into that market. Sexing Tech, along with its subsidiary, XY, LLC, (we use \"Sexing Tech\" to describe them collectively unless the distinction matters) counterclaimed that ABS infringed its patents and breached the contract between them by misappropriating trade secrets in developing ABS's competing technology. Both sides also added state-law theories to the mix.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In the end, only three claims went to trial: ABS's antitrust claim and Sexing Tech's patent infringement and breach of contract counterclaims. After a nearly two-week trial, the jury returned a mixed-and somewhat puzzling-verdict, which the court ratified in post-trial rulings. We conclude, as did the district court, that ABS violated a confidentiality agreement it had with Sexing Tech, and that Sexing Tech's patent was not invalid on obviousness grounds. The jury's assessments of two of the three patent claims still at issue, however, cannot be reconciled under the rules governing dependent claims and enablement, and so a new trial is necessary on them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The '987 Patent\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The basic processes at issue in this case are not hard to describe. They rely on cell sorters, which are devices that sort cells to select either for a desired characteristic or to weed out an undesirable characteristic. These sorters date back to the mid-1960s, but it was not until the early 1990s that the first person developed a device designed to sort sperm cells. Lawrence Johnson, then a scientist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, was the inventor. His technique is best explained with the help of a diagram:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This technique is a variation on a standard cell sorting technique called flow cytometric sorting. Johnson's process begins with a sample of stained sperm cells suspended in liquid. The stain allows the sorter to distinguish X-bearing cells from Y-bearing cells based on differences in their DNA content. The stained fluid is forced through a stream, spacing out the cells and orienting them single-file. Next, a laser identifies each cell as bearing either an X or Y chromosome. By this time, each sperm cell is contained in an individual droplet, and a different charge is applied to each droplet depending on whether it contains an X- or Y-bearing sperm cell. The individually charged cells are then passed through charged plates, which redirect the cells into three batches: X-bearing cells, Y-bearing cells, and waste. Because the cells are sorted while they are suspended in individual water droplets, this device is called a \"droplet sorter.\" Johnson first patented this technology in 1992 and wrote an article discussing improvements to the technique in 1999.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Sexing Tech holds a patent- U.S. Patent Number 8,206,987 (\"the '987 patent\") -over an alternative technique, developed by Gary Durack, for sorting sperm cells. The Durack patent issued in 2012, with an effective filing date relating back to a provisional application filed on March 28, 2003. Although the full text of the patent runs nearly 250 pages, the critical part for our purposes is the final section, where the claims covered by the patent are set out. Three of those claims are at issue in this case: Claims 1, 2, and 7. Claim 1 is an independent claim, meaning (as we explain more fully below) that it stands on its own, while Claims 2 and 7 are dependent claims. Each of the dependent claims begins by specifying \"a method of sorting a mixture of stained sperm cells according to claim 1.\" Each dependent claim then goes on to specify a limitation on the subject matter covered by Claim 1, as required by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20112\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). We set forth the full text of the disputed claims in the Appendix to this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The invention described in Claim 1 follows the same basic structure as the Johnson invention, but it substitutes a different method for sorting the cells at the final step. The Johnson method uses magnets to\n   redirect droplets depending on the cell they contain, while the '987 patent describes a photo-damage sorting method. Photo-damage sorting is straightforward: a \"kill laser\" destroys undesired cells identified by the detection laser, leaving only the desired cells alive. The end product of the two methods is thus different: the Johnson patent yields three separate outputs (characteristic A, characteristic B, and waste); the Durak patent (illustrated below) produces only one output, which is composed of living cells with the desired characteristic (A or B) and dead waste cells. Under ideal conditions, photo-damage sorters work faster than droplet sorters because their speed is not limited by the size of droplets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Dependent Claims 2 and 7 impose additional limitations on Claim 1 of the '987 patent. Claim 7 specifies that in the final step of Claim 1, \"Characteristic A\" must be \"a live X-chromosome bearing sperm cell\" and \"Characteristic B\" must be \"something other than a live X-chromosome bearing sperm cell.\" This means that a photo-damage sorter that sorts sperm cells for a characteristic other than sex (perhaps a set of genes on a different chromosome) would infringe Claim 1 of the patent, but not Claim 7. It also means that every violation of Claim 7 would\n   <em>\n    necessarily\n   </em>\n   violate the broader Claim 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Claim 2 restricts Claim 1 in a different way. Claim 2 covers a process \"wherein the step of selecting stained sperm cells in the flow path to photo-damage further comprises the step of photo-damaging sperm cells based upon a sort strategy.\" Thus, the only difference between Claim 1 and Claim 2 is whether the \"selection\" of stained sperm cells that occurs at the selection point (step (e) of Claim 1), is based solely on their classification as having characteristic A or B (Claim 1) or based both on their classification as A or B and a sort strategy (Claim 2) that would further narrow the results obtained. A photo-damage sorter that sorts sperm without an additional sort strategy would infringe Claim 1 of the patent, but not Claim 2, while all sorters that followed all of the Claim 1 steps and then implemented a sort strategy would violate both Claim 2 and Claim 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Although Sexing Tech holds a patent for photo-damage sorting of sperm cells, it had not commercialized the technology before this suit began-its commercial sorters all used the droplet sorting technique pioneered by Johnson. ABS says that it created its own commercially usable photo-damage sorter but found itself blocked by Sexing Tech's patents, bringing us to the present litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Issues on Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As we noted earlier, the jury reached a mixed verdict. It found that Sexing Tech had violated section 2 of the Sherman Act, but that ABS suffered no antitrust injury from that violation and thus was entitled only to injunctive relief. On the other hand, the jury found ABS liable for infringing the '987 patent and a second patent held by Sexing Tech,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and it concluded that ABS had breached its confidentiality contract with Sexing Tech. It accordingly awarded damages to Sexing Tech on those claims. With respect to the '987 patent, ABS argued only invalidity; it did not contest infringement. The jury found that independent Claim 1 and dependent Claim 7 of the '987 patent were valid, but that dependent Claim 2 was invalid. After trial, both parties moved for judgment as a matter of law, and ABS also moved for a new\n   trial and for a permanent injunction. The district court granted those motions in part and denied them in part, and it entered a permanent injunction barring Sexing Tech from enforcing certain contractual provisions as a remedy for its antitrust violation. ABS appealed. (Sexing Tech initially filed a cross-appeal, which it later voluntarily dismissed.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Three issues are now before us: two relate to patent law and one to contract interpretation. First, ABS argues that all three claims in the '987 patent are invalid on the ground of obviousness. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20103\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, ABS contends that the jury's decisions to uphold independent Claim 1 and dependent Claim 7, but to find dependent Claim 2 invalid, are irreconcilably inconsistent under the rules for enablement and thus a new trial is necessary. Finally, ABS asserts that the district court erred by finding a breach of the confidentiality agreement. It admits that it hired a former employee of Sexing Tech's subsidiary XY, and that this employee brought purloined trade secrets with her to ABS. Indeed, ABS stipulated to trade-secret liability for this wrongdoing, but Sexing Tech wanted and got more: the court held that ABS was separately liable for breach of a confidentiality agreement between the companies. ABS contends that information passed along by a disloyal former employee was not covered by the agreement and thus that it was entitled to judgment on this point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Appellate Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Because it is rare for our court to see a patent case, we take a moment to examine our appellate jurisdiction. The Federal Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction over any \"appeal from a final decision of a district court of the United States ... [1] in any civil action arising under, or [2] in any civil action in which a party has asserted a compulsory counterclaim arising under\" the Patent Act (\"the Act\").\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201295\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) ; FED. R. CIV. P. 13(a). We lack appellate jurisdiction if either basis for the Federal Circuit's exclusive jurisdiction was present in the district court, regardless of the claims brought on appeal. See\n   <em>\n    Kennedy v. Wright\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11357185\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/851/963/#p965\">\n    851 F.2d 963\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 965 (7th Cir. 1988).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Our first inquiry is whether, applying the well-pleaded complaint rule, this case arose under the patent laws.\n   <em>\n    Christianson v. Colt Indus. Operating Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6224266\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/800/#p809\">\n    486 U.S. 800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 809,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6224266\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/800/#p809\">\n    108 S.Ct. 2166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6224266\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/800/#p809\">\n    100 L.Ed.2d 811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988). Following long-established law, the Supreme Court held in\n   <em>\n    Christianson\n   </em>\n   that the complaint had to establish \"either that federal law creates the cause of action or that the plaintiff's right to relief necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial question of federal law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6224266\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/800/#p809\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6224266\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/800/#p809\">\n    at 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6224266\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/800/#p809\">\n    108 S.Ct. 2166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Franchise Tax Bd. v.

For patent cases, the well-pleaded complaint must \"establish[ ] either that federal patent law creates the cause of action or that the plaintiff's right to relief necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial question of federal patent law, in that patent law is a necessary element of one of the well-pleaded claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 809,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6224266\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/800/#p809\">\n    108 S.Ct. 2166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In our case, ABS's complaint had nothing to do with patent law: it invoked only federal antitrust law and state law. Thus, under\n   <em>\n    Christianson\n   </em>\n   this is not a case that arises under the patent laws, and the first potential source of the Federal Circuit's jurisdiction does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The second possibility-jurisdiction through a compulsory counterclaim-requires more attention. Patent issues entered this case when Sexing Tech filed a counterclaim asserting patent infringement. If that counterclaim was compulsory, this appeal belongs in the Federal Circuit; if it was permissive, it is properly in\n   this court. Section 1295(a) incorporates the standard of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 13(a) for determining whether a counterclaim is compulsory.\n   <em>\n    In re Rearden LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176514\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/841/1327/#p1332\">\n    841 F.3d 1327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1332 (Fed. Cir. 2016). In applying Rule 13(a), the Federal Circuit examines \"(1) whether the legal and factual issues raised by the claim and counterclaim are largely the same; (2) whether substantially the same evidence supports or refutes both the claim and the counterclaim; and (3) whether there is a logical relationship between the claim and the counterclaim.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176514\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/841/1327/#p1332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Our test adds a few additional points: we require \"that the claim (1) exist at the time of pleading, (2) arise out of the same transaction or occurrence as the opposing party's claim, and (3) not require for adjudication parties over whom the court may not acquire jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Burlington N. Ry. Co. v. Strong\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10539569\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/907/707/#p710\">\n    907 F.2d 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 710-11 (7th Cir. 1990).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The difference between these standards is immaterial for this case. Sexing Tech's claim existed at the time of pleading, and it does not require any additional parties, and so we need to assess only the \"transaction or occurrence\" requirement. To determine whether a claim arises from \"the same transaction or occurrence,\" this circuit uses the \"logical relationship\" test, which requires us to examine the factual allegations underlying each claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10539569\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/907/707/#p710\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10539569\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/907/707/#p710\">\n    at 711\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The patent and antitrust claims in this case are quite different. ABS's antitrust claims hinge on Sexing Tech's competitive practices, such as the use of evergreen clauses in its contracts and other allegedly coercive applications of market power. ABS did contend that Sexing Tech pooled patents for anticompetitive reasons, but the pooling of patents is distinct from questions of infringement and validity. Any relation between the patent and antitrust claims is minor. In fact, patent counterclaims are frequently permissive in antitrust cases. To hold otherwise \"would be to hold that the holder of a patent, which is presumptively and facially valid ... must immediately counterclaim with any and every and even, perhaps, every potential claim of infringement against that plaintiff or else lose such claims forever.\"\n   <em>\n    Xerox Corp. v. SCM Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"934581\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/576/1057/#p1061\">\n    576 F.2d 1057\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1061 (3d Cir. 1978) (citation omitted). The patent counterclaims in this case were permissive, and thus the appeal falls outside of the Federal Circuit's exclusive jurisdiction and is properly in this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Obviousness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The patent system is built on a trade-off. On one side of the ledger, the prospect of exclusivity gives inventors an incentive both to innovate and to disclose their inventions, to the benefit of society as a whole. Without the prospect of a patent, inventors may choose other pursuits or hide their innovations from the public. See\n   <em>\n    Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"84466\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/416/470/#p480\">\n    416 U.S. 470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 480-82,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"84466\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/416/470/#p480\">\n    94 S.Ct. 1879\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"84466\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/416/470/#p480\">\n    40 L.Ed.2d 315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1974) (noting the tradeoff between patent protection and trade-secret protection). On the other hand, a patent comes at a social cost: the exclusivity given to the inventor prevents competition with respect to the subject matter of the patent for 20 years, see\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20154\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2), increasing prices for users and preventing future innovators from building on or improving the invention without a license. The patent system may not calibrate those opposing incentives perfectly, see generally Stephen Yelderman,\n   <em>\n    The Value of Accuracy in the Patent System\n   </em>\n   , 84 U. CHI. L. REV. 1217 (2017), but we are not in the habit of demanding perfection from legislation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Nonetheless, the Patent Act includes a number of doctrines that are designed in the aggregate to come as close as possible to the socially optimal balance. Prime among them is the bar against the patentability\n   of obvious inventions, which the Supreme Court recognized as a constitutional \"absolute prerequisite to patentability\" even before Congress codified the requirement in 1952.\n   <em>\n    Dann v.

ABS says that the '987 patent would have been obvious at the time of its invention to a skilled artisan because it merely replaced the traditional droplet method for sorting sperm cells with the photo-damage method, which had been successfully used to sort other types of cells. Sexing Tech responds that there were many factors that would have made photo-damage sorting unlikely to work with sperm cells and thus experimenters would have been discouraged from trying to combine the methods. The jury in the present case found that ABS had infringed Sexing Tech's '987 patent ; it thus had to have found that the innovation was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   obvious.

It asserts that whether an artisan would have been \"motivated to combine\" the prior art is itself a factual question. Sexing Tech asserts that the jury implicitly concluded that the prior art \"teaches away\" from the '987 patent 's use of a photo-damage method. But that is hard to say, especially in a case such as this one, where the jury rendered only a general verdict. Special verdicts are the only reliable way to nail down such findings. See FED. R. CIV.

Sexing Tech's position overstates the importance of a motivation to combine or \"teaching away\" after\n   <em>\n    KSR\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    KSR\n   </em>\n   recognizes that \"expert testimony ... may resolve or keep open certain questions of fact,\" but \"[t]hat is not the end of the issue.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556178\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/398/#p416\">\n    550 U.S. at 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556178\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/398/#p416\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Some factors might point away from obviousness and other factors might point toward it, yet judgment as a matter of law might be appropriate. That is because the jury does not have the last word on obviousness; as we\n   noted earlier, it is the court that must resolve the ultimate legal issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   C. Nonobviousness of '987 Patent\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Out of all the evidence that was presented, only a small portion bears on the question whether the '987 patent was invalid for obviousness. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20103\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There were three pieces of documentary evidence: (1) Johnson's 1999 article describing his droplet method of sperm sorting; (2) a book chapter written by Jan Keij describing other applications of photo-damage sorting; and (3) the '987 patent itself. In addition, three witnesses opined on the relation among the three devices: Durack, the inventor of the '987 patent ; J. Paul Robinson, ABS's expert; and John Nolan, Sexing Tech's expert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   We already have discussed the '987 patent and Johnson's basic method: the former uses a kill laser to sort sperm cells, while the latter uses droplet sorting. ABS contends that the book chapter written by Keij, titled \"High-Speed Photo-damage Cell Sorting: An Evaluation of the ZAPPER Proto-type,\" provides a bridge from Johnson's work to the '987 patent. In the book, which was released in 1994, Keij describes the potential applications for a prototype photo-damage sorter he had created. The main benefit of his technique was speed: whereas a droplet sorter topped out at 40,000 sorts per second, a photo-damage sorter could reach 5,000,000 sorts per second. Keij opines that \"[s]orting of X or Y chromosome bearing sperm cells for insemination (Johnson\n   <em>\n    et al.\n   </em>\n   , 1989) is an interesting possibility.\" But he also mentions some drawbacks of the technique. The forces involved could kill cells at higher speeds, and tradeoffs would need to be made between yield and purity given imperfections in the kill-laser system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   A good portion of the trial testimony was spent teasing out the implications of Keij's work for sperm sorting. While ABS and Sexing Tech hotly contested those facts, they agreed on many others. There is no real dispute over what counts as prior art, the level of skill for someone having ordinary skill in the art, or over many secondary factors. Yet there were some clashes, including over the question whether it would have been obvious to a skilled artisan to use Keij's photo-damage method in a sperm cell sorter. Three disputes concerning Keij's work were particularly important.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   First, two of the witnesses questioned whether Keij actually had rendered the techniques discussed in his article practicable at the time the article was written. Keij's book chapter gives the impression that he had done so, but that was not clear. On cross, ABS's expert Robinson admitted that he previously told the Patent Office that \"the methods discussed in Keij were not at the time of publication operable even on the cells discussed therein.\" Durack characterized Keij's assessments as \"optimistic.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Second, the parties disputed how the physical properties of sperm cells would stand up against Keij's photo-damage technique. Nolan testified that sperm cells are \"large cells\" with \"fragile aspects,\" because sperm cells lack the DNA repair mechanisms that are present in other types of cells. Because Keij's kill laser was \"leaky\"-meaning it could not precisely and fully be turned off-these fragilities were worrisome. Yet other testimony suggested that these characteristics might not matter: Durack testified that the things that Keij thought might damage cells-sheer forces from the increased speeds of a photo-damage sorter-were not a problem for sperm cells. Durack identified the real weakness deterring the adoption of photo-damaging sperm as the lack of a proper digital signal processer, which\n   would allow the laser to sort more effectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Third, the parties disputed whether a skilled artisan would have had reason to think that photo-damage sorting could really work faster than droplet sorting when applied to sperm cells. Lawrence's 1999 article outlining the state of the art in droplet sorting of sperm cells was written after the Keij book chapter. By that time Lawrence had improved the speed of droplet sorters. Characteristics specific to sperm cells are likely to lower the top speeds otherwise possible through photo-damage techniques. This was enough to create a factual dispute over how much speed a reasonable artisan at the time could have expected to gain by switching to photo-damage sorting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   That brings us to the ultimate question: obviousness.

Until that patent issued, sperm cells had been sorted only through droplet sorting. Thus, as in\n   <em>\n    KSR\n   </em>\n   , the '987 patent substituted an \"identified, predictable solution[ ]\"-photo-damage sorting-into an existing sperm-sorting apparatus.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556178\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/398/#p416\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   If that were all we had, we might be inclined to find that the '987 patent failed for obviousness. But the record paints a more complex picture. Taking the facts in the light most favorable to Sexing Tech, we see significant support for nonobviousness and thus patentability: existing photo-damage sorters were more flawed than Keij implied; droplet sorters' speed had improved, narrowing the speed gap; and sperm cells differ in important ways from other commonly sorted cells.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    KSR\n   </em>\n   emphasizes that an invention may be obvious as a matter of law if it employs a \"predictable solution\" to a known problem.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556178\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/398/#p416\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The known problem identified by ABS is the need to increase sort speed. Many of the disputed facts suggest that photo-damage sorting would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   have been obvious even to try to fix this problem. For the final product-sexed semen-to be commercially usable, a sorter must achieve a high degree of purity. Witnesses testified that Keij's photo-damage method would result in potentially large trade-offs in purity and viability, with limited gains in speed. Viewed in this light, Durack did more than would be obvious to a reasonable artisan-even a creative one-by conceiving of a photo-damage sorter that could overcome these roadblocks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   (ABS separately argues that Durack did not succeed in that endeavor-meaning that his invention did not sufficiently enable his device-but enablement is different from obviousness. We address enablement below.) An inventor who finds a way to make workable an alternative that had been rejected as impracticable has done more than implement an obvious combination. We conclude that the '987 patent was nonobvious, and thus that the district court was correct to deny ABS's motion to invalidate it on that ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Enablement of Dependent Claim 2\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Even though the '987 patent does not fail for obviousness, another problem looms: the question whether the jury was fatally inconsistent in its findings that independent Claim 1 of the patent was valid, but that Claim 2, a dependent claim derivative of Claim 1, was not. ABS argues that this discrepancy sinks the verdict for Sexing Tech. Since we have ruled out obviousness as a ground for striking down the entire patent, that leaves only enablement as a possible problem on this record. According to Sexing Tech, the jury could validly have found that the dependent claim was not enabled (and thus was invalid), while finding at the same time that the independent claim was enabled (and thus valid). ABS argues to the contrary that this is logically impossible: an independent claim must encompass all features of the dependent claim, and thus one cannot have an enabled\n   <em>\n    independent\n   </em>\n   claim with a non-enabled\n   <em>\n    dependent\n   </em>\n   claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the verdicts are indeed irreconcilable, then ABS is entitled to a new trial.\n   <em>\n    ABM Marking, Inc. v.

The difference between the two types of claims is critical to the question before us. As one treatise puts it:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   ... [I]ndependent claims are free-standing. The scope of an independent claim can therefore be determined, at least in theory, by referring to that claim only and not to any other claims in the patent.

The scope of a dependent claim cannot be ascertained without referring to the claim from which it depends.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   1 MOY'S WALKER ON PATENTS \u00a7 4:102 (4th ed.). With this in mind, we can see that Claims 2 and 7-both of which specify a method \"according to Claim 1\"-can only be dependent claims. The finding of an inconsistency between Claim 1 and Claim 2 cannot, therefore, be salvaged by considering them to be two entirely different patents,\n   nor did either party ever press such an argument. Indeed, the parties accepted the claims construction provided by the district court. Any complaint about the court's conclusion that would amount to asserting a new claim construction for Claim 2 (\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   an assertion that it is an independent rather than a dependent one) is thus waived.

Dependent claims are subsets of an independent claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Sexing Tech recognizes that broad point, but it suggests that the jury's verdicts here are reconcilable because the \"further limitation\" specified in dependent Claim 2-the use of a sort strategy-may have required it to provide additional instructions beyond what it supplied to support Claim 1. In other words, Sexing Tech argues\n   that aspects of Claim 2 are\n   <em>\n    broader\n   </em>\n   than Claim 1. It concludes that the absence of additional information required to enable the broader parts of Claim 2 explains the jury's verdict. In our view, however, this fundamentally misunderstands the nature of a dependent claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Three examples illustrate the difference between the parties' positions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    Example 1:\n   </em>\n   The independent claim has three elements, ABC.

A dependent claim would then limit the original claim by specifying the particular variant of C, and describe an invention with elements ABC1 (dependent claim #1), or ABC2 (dependent claim #2).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    Example 3:\n   </em>\n   The independent claim has three elements, ABC. The inventor then wants to patent an invention whose limitation requires an additional process, element D. The inventor asserts that claim ABCD is dependent on claim ABC. D, however, is not contained within the scope of the independent claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Sexing Tech contends that what we have before us is an instance of Example 3. The failure adequately to describe element D, in this case the \"sort strategy,\" it says, might be the source of the lack of enablement for the dependent claim. It believes that the jury's problem with Claim 2 was that it describes a non-enabled superset of Claim 1 rather than a narrower subset of that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The problem with Sexing Tech's logic, as we already have shown, is that a dependent claim cannot include elements that are not found within the independent claim. What Sexing Tech is necessarily arguing, therefore, is that Claim 2 is not in fact a dependent claim reliant on-and importantly, narrower than-Claim 1.

At summary judgment, the district court interpreted Claims 1 and 2, and not only upheld Claim 2's status as a dependent claim but relied on Claim 2's identity as a narrower subset of Claim 2 to interpret Claim 1. That much was established when the jury received the case, and it had no power to revisit that interpretation of the two claims.

Moreover, nothing in the jury's verdict requires us to upset the court's construction of the claims and to adopt an entirely new theory.

As a matter of logic, assuming claims 2-5 are proper dependent claims and we see no reason why they are not, the examiner's decision that claims 2-5 are non-enabled\n   <em>\n    necessarily means\n   </em>\n   that claim 1 is non-enabled.\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   C. Enablement of the '987 Patent\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In our case, the parties disputed both the proper construction of \"sort strategy\" and how Claim 2 should be understood at the summary judgment stage. The district court identified at least three possible sort strategies: \"high purity,\" \"high recovery,\" and \"constant flow rate.\" The court also found that \"the process of 'selecting' sperm cells based upon their classification at Step (e) of Claim 1 does not necessarily require the application of a sort strategy.\" From these insights, the district court recognized that \"the application of a sort strategy [is] a more narrow method by which cells to be photo-damaged are identified.\" Thus, the district court interpreted Claim 2 as a variant within the broad scope of activity patented by Claim 1. Importantly, Claim 1 does and must cover both A/B sorting accomplished without a second-tier sorting strategy (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   random sorting), and A/B sorting that includes a further refinement (by purity, recovery, flow rate, or the like). The possibility that Claim 1 does not encompass particular sort strategies was rejected by the district court as a matter of law. Similar cases decided by the Federal Circuit illustrate this pattern of a broader independent claim and the need for the independent claim to enable all of the narrower dependent variants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Sitrick v.

It wrote that \"\n   <em>\n    Sitrick\n   </em>\n   stands for the proposition that all embodiments of a particular claim must be enabled, not that a nonenabled, dependent claim renders an enabled independent claim invalid as well.\" But this reasoning fails to take into account the fact that a dependent claim, by definition, is one embodiment of the independent claim on which it relies.\n   <em>\n    Nazomi Commc'ns, Inc. v.

Claim 1 covers a photo-damage sperm sorter that sorts cells based upon their classification for characteristic A or B, whether or not a secondary sort strategy (for purity, recovery, speed, or something else) is used. Claim 2 covers a photo-damage sperm sorter that sorts cells first based upon the A/B classification and then pursuant to a particular sort strategy. If, as Sexing Tech contends, the jury impliedly found that dependent Claim 2 was not enabled, then it follows that the full scope of Claim 1 was not enabled and it would fail for that reason. In short, for purposes of enablement, once Claim 1 is enabled, dependent Claim 2 must be also.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   An example involving simpler technology may help. At oral argument, counsel for Sexing Tech proposed a hypothetical patent for a recliner. The independent claim comprises (1) a headrest, (2) a reclining mechanism, and (3) a footrest. The dependent claim adds an additional limitation to the third limitation: the footrest must be adjustable. This is a proper limitation; it narrows the type of footrest to an adjustable one. A later recliner with a fixed footrest would infringe the independent claim but not the dependent claim. Counsel for Sexing Tech then argued that if the patent failed to teach how to make the footrest adjustable, the dependent claim would be invalid for enablement but the independent claim would not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   But Sexing Tech is describing an independent claim that is not fully enabled and thus invalid. The independent claim would have to cover both fixed and adjustable footrests, and enablement must exist for the full scope of the patent-in this case, all types of footrests. If the specification failed to enable an adjustable foot in the dependent claim, then (as\n   <em>\n    Alcon Research, supra,\n   </em>\n   indicated) the full scope of the invention is also not enabled in the independent claim, and\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   claims are invalid for non-enablement.

This result is not unduly harsh, because inventors who overreach and claim overbroad independent claims may fall back on whatever dependent claims remain valid. A separate dependent claim limiting \"footrest\" to \"fixed footrest\" would remain valid, even if the\n   <em>\n    independent\n   </em>\n   claim fails for lack of enablement of the adjustable option.

But as one can see from his citation to section 7.04[3] of the treatise, which discusses only the written-description requirement, Chisum is speaking here about the latter requirement, not enablement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6144333\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/322/471/#p483\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Of the two cases cited by Sexing Tech, one addresses only written description.

But it does require specificity as to the claim limitations....\") (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   For our purposes, the crucial difference between these two requirements is that the specification need not feature a written description of every specific variant within the scope of the claim. For example, \"every species in a genus need not be described in order that a genus meet the written description requirement.\"\n   <em>\n    AbbVie Deutschland GmbH &amp; Co. v. Janssen Biotech, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4156460\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/759/1285/#p1301\">\n    759 F.3d 1285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1301 (Fed.

Cir. 1997) ) (alterations omitted). Indeed, it would make little sense for a written description requirement explicitly to include every possible iteration of the broader invention. To do so would encourage patentholders to write out potentially infinite possibilities. Unlike enablement, where gaps in the specification can be filled by the knowledge of a skilled artisan, the written-description requirement is held to the letter and is satisfied only if a skilled artisan reading the application would understand that a given limitation is at issue. \"[C]onsider the case where the specification discusses only Compound A and contains no broadening language of any kind. This might very well enable one skilled in the art to make and use Compounds B and C; yet the class consisting of A, B and C has not been described.\"\n   <em>\n    In re DiLeone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6084465,2213486\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/436/1404/\">\n    436 F.2d 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1405 n.1 (C.C.P.A. 1971). Thus, the descriptions for dependent claims may be inadequate even if the description of the independent claim is fine. Indeed, dependent claims may be\n   <em>\n    more likely\n   </em>\n   than\n   independent claims to fail the written description requirement simply because they feature more limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   More limitations make for a heavier burden on the written description requirement, but they lessen the burden for enablement.\n   <em>\n    Ex Parte Grasselli\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=231%20U.S.P.Q.%20%28BNA%29%20393\">\n    231 U.S.P.Q. 393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1983%20WL%2051855\">\n    1983 WL 51855\n   </extracted-citation>\n   *2 (P.T.O.

App. 1983) (finding that \"the negative limitations recited in the present claims, which did not appear in the specification as filed, introduce new concepts and violate the [written] description requirement\" despite the Board's statement that it found no problem with lack of enablement). Limitations narrow the scope of the claim, and so there is less to be enabled. Although it is certainly possible for a dependent claim to be more enabled than the independent variant, it is impossible for it to be less so.\n   <em>\n    Martek Biosciences Corp. v.

A proper dependent claim cannot fail for lack of enablement while its independent claim stands, because the dependent claim's scope is a subset of the independent claim's scope. The full scope of Claim 1 of the '987 patent cannot have been enabled at the same time as the full scope of Claim 2 was not. With enablement and obviousness eliminated as possible explanations, there is no plausible explanation for the jury's verdict, and a new trial is necessary on this aspect of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. Confidentiality Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Finally, we step away from the world of patent law and back to more familiar territory: breach of contract. The contract at issue is the \"Semen Sorting Agreement,\" which is the main document governing the relationship between ABS and Sexing Tech. The jury found that ABS breached the confidentiality commitment in this agreement when Kathy Mean, a former employee of XY (recall that XY is a subsidiary of Sexing Tech), brought trade secrets with her to ABS. ABS concedes the theft but argues that the stolen trade secrets cannot give rise to a breach of contract because the agreement covered only information \"provided by Sexing Tech.\" The district court disagreed and denied ABS's motion for judgment as a matter of law, finding that the contract was ambiguous on this point. We review the district court's interpretation of the contract\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    BKCAP, LLC v.

Texas courts read contracts as a whole. See\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . The provision in question reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   As used herein, the term \"ST's Confidential Information\" shall mean (i) that information pertaining to the research, processing or production of Sorted Semen\n   that is disclosed by ST or its Affiliates to ABS and is confidential, non-public, proprietary and/or generally not known to the public, to include but not limited to: any and all information relating to technology, methods, techniques, processes, know-how, concepts, secrets, and scientific or technical know-how, whether such information be tangible, intellectual or otherwise; and (ii) any information related to Sorted Semen that is based on or derived from any of the foregoing, whether by ABS or ST or third parties. ST's Confidential Information shall encompass all of the foregoing information whether provided by ST in writing, orally or by other means. ABS agrees that as a recipient of ST's Confidential Information, ABS shall not use, disclose, or make available ST's Confidential Information to any third party, except for those representatives of ABS that have an actual need to know such ST's Confidential Information in connection with the performance of this Agreement. The foregoing confidentiality obligations shall continue for ten (10) years from the expiration or termination of this Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   ABS says that the provision limits \"ST's Confidential Information\" to information \"provided by\" or \"disclosed by\" Sexing Tech. Sexing Tech responds that subsection (ii) of the agreement brings information not provided directly by Sexing Tech within the meaning of \"Confidential Information,\" or at least creates enough ambiguity to send the issue to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The language of this provision is broad: it encompasses information disclosed either by Sexing Tech itself or its affiliates. It also covers all methods of providing information, whether in writing, orally, or \"by other means.\" This language comfortably includes Means's actions. Nothing indicates that she had a source other than Sexing Tech for the information she conveyed. She simply funneled that information from Sexing Tech to ABS. The jury's finding that this amounted to a breach by ABS of the confidentiality agreement thus rested on a proper understanding of the contract language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    VII. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The district court's decision denying ABS's motion for judgment as a matter of law on the ground that the '987 patent fails for obviousness is AFFIRMED . We also AFFIRM the court's denial of ABS's motion for judgment as a matter of law on the breach of the confidentiality agreement. We conclude that the jury's verdicts with respect to the enablement of Claims 1 and 2 are irreconcilably inconsistent. We therefore REVERSE the denial of ABS's motion for a new trial on the '987 patent and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
