He was sentenced to death for the murder. After exhausting state remedies, Williams petitioned the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court denied or stayed all of Williams' claims, except Ground Six, which asserted a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel resulting from trial counsel's failure to investigate potentially mitigating evidence of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (\"FAS\"). On this ground, the district court granted Williams' petition and the State now appeals. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On the morning of September 3, 2003, Williams entered a Greenville, South Carolina grocery store where his former girlfriend, Maranda Williams, worked. He confronted her, then forced her into a store office, where he held her at gunpoint for approximately 90 minutes. During this period she called 911 and hostage negotiators tried to convince Williams to release her. She eventually attempted to escape, but Williams pursued her, shooting her four times and killing her. Upon hearing the shots, law enforcement officers entered the store and apprehended Williams. Following\n   his arrest, Williams gave a statement in which he confessed to the crimes for which he was later charged. In February 2005, a Greenville County, South Carolina, jury convicted Williams of kidnapping, murder, and possession of a firearm during a violent crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At trial, Williams was represented by attorneys William Nettles and John Mauldin, both of whom were experienced in capital cases. Nettles had handled approximately five death penalty cases through trial and sentencing, as well as a handful of post-conviction relief cases. Mauldin had overseen \"close to a dozen [capital cases] to verdict\" and worked on nearly three times as many cases after a death notice had been filed. J.A. 493-94.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In preparation for the penalty phase, Nettles and Mauldin assembled a defense team that included, among others, social worker Jan Vogelsang, clinical neuropsychologist Dr. James Evans, clinical psychiatrist Dr. Robert Richards, neurologist Dr. David Griesemer, and forensic psychiatrist Dr. Seymour Halleck. As part of the investigation, Vogelsang gathered information about Williams' upbringing. She interviewed Williams' father, who told her that he had observed Williams' mother, Daisy Huckaby, drinking while pregnant, though he was unable to provide any additional details. Vogelsang also interviewed Williams' sister, who recalled that Huckaby drank while pregnant with Williams, but could not say how much. (The record indicates that Vogelsang either failed to ask Huckaby about her drinking or that Huckaby denied drinking while pregnant.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The defense team experts assessed Williams for neurological and psychological issues. Following an evaluation, Dr. Evans concluded that Williams suffered neurological impairments as the result of frontal lobe damage and, consequently, had learning difficulties. Dr. Richards examined Williams and diagnosed him with bipolar and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Finally, following an MRI and neurological exam the week prior to the trial, Dr. Griesemer reported that, though there were some cognitive issues, Williams' MRI showed a normal brain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   During the penalty phase,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   defense counsel presented mitigating evidence of Williams' troubled childhood-including his mother's alcoholism-as well as his mental illness and difficulties in school. To this end, counsel presented testimony from Williams' father and sister; Williams' first grade teacher; a co-worker of Daisy Huckaby; and their experts, including Dr. Richards, who testified about his diagnoses,\n   and Dr. Halleck, who opined that Williams suffered from major depressive disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder but was able to, with difficulty, conform his behavior to the requirements of the law. Moreover, through his cross-examination of the state psychiatrist, Nettles elicited additional mitigation testimony, including information about Williams' trouble with his parents' divorce, Huckaby's alcoholism, Williams' difficulty in school, and his untreated attention deficit disorder. In turn, the State alleged a single aggravating factor: \"Murder was committed while in the commission of kidnapping.\" J.A. 809.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On the second day of penalty phase deliberations, the jury sent a note to the trial court stating it was deadlocked nine to three in favor of death. Williams moved for a mistrial but the trial court denied the motion and instead gave an\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   charge. The jury resumed its deliberations and, after three hours and 45 minutes, returned a sentence of death. The Supreme Court of South Carolina affirmed Williams' convictions and death sentence,\n   <em>\n    State v.

In January 2013, the PCR court held an evidentiary hearing at which three FAS experts testified on Williams' behalf. Dr. Richard Adler, a forensic psychiatrist, diagnosed Williams with Partial Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, a form of FAS. Neuropsychologist Dr. Paul Connor testified that his assessment of Williams indicated severe functional impairments and damage to the corpus callosum, all consistent with or symptomatic of FAS. Finally, Dr. Natalie Novick Brown, a forensic psychologist, concluded that Williams' executive functions-including \"self-regulation\" and \"behavior control\"-were impaired due to FAS, leading to behavioral difficulties, including impulse control problems and coping skills equivalent to those of a nine year old. J.A. 588. All three experts acknowledged that at the time of the trial in 2005, a widely recognized protocol to forensically assess FAS in the criminal justice context had not yet been fully developed, but that individual practitioners had been addressing FAS and had developed a framework for diagnosing the condition and treating its symptoms.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Trial counsel also testified, but neither could recall a mitigation investigation into FAS, or why such an investigation was not conducted. Mauldin testified that although FAS awareness had become much more prevalent in the years since Williams' trial, the issue \"certainly existed well before\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   the 2003 American Bar Association Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   J.A. 500. The commentary in these Guidelines designated FAS as a potentially mitigating factor to be investigated by counsel in capital cases. He further acknowledged that, in hindsight, several issues should have indicated a potential FAS diagnosis for Williams when he was preparing for trial. First, Mauldin testified that he had reports in his files that indicated Huckaby drank during her pregnancy. Mauldin acknowledged that at the time of the trial, such drinking should have signaled a potential FAS issue for him. With this information about Huckaby's drinking, he should have, as a first step, directed a neurologist to conduct whatever testing would have been necessary to determine whether Williams was affected by FAS. Nonetheless, Mauldin testified, \"I honestly cannot say why [Huckaby's drinking] wasn't a red flag for me eight years ago.\" J.A. 500. \"[A]s extraordinary as that seems,\" he continued, \"I can't explain why there was no discussion or follow-up on that.\" J.A. 512. Second, Mauldin testified that the developmental delays and learning problems exhibited by Williams were issues he should have associated with FAS. Finally, Mauldin also explained that some of the follow-up information the defense team experts were seeking was of the type he should have associated with FAS. Specifically, Mauldin testified that at the time of the trial he was aware of the correlation between a significantly smaller head circumference at birth and FAS and knew that Dr. Richards, as of August 2004, had become interested in potential brain damage and had requested records containing the circumference of Williams' head at birth and recommended an MRI of Williams' brain. Nonetheless, Mauldin was unable to explain why the records were not produced to Dr. Richards, or why an MRI was not conducted until the week prior to the beginning of the trial in February 2005, rather than in August 2004.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Nettles testified that he was aware of the ABA Guidelines mandating investigation of mitigating evidence, including personal, family, and medical history, as part of penalty phase preparations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   But he could not remember at what point he developed an \"understanding\" of FAS. J.A. 465. He did recall that the subject of Huckaby's drinking came up, but testified that he was focused on it as evidence of Williams' difficult childhood, not of FAS. He also recalled some evidence of neurological damage. Nonetheless, he did not recall any discussion about FAS or FAS being considered as a potentially mitigating factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In denying Williams' petition, the PCR court concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [T]his Court finds that trial counsel had evidence that [Williams'] mother drank during pregnancy, and that trial counsel was aware of the resulting complications, including brain damage. Trial counsel also had evidence that [Williams] possibly suffered brain damage, based on Dr. Evans' reports. Trial counsel presented this information, along with other mitigation evidence, to the defense experts. Considering all of the information it had available and in\n   consultation with its experts, trial counsel developed a cogent strategy to present mitigation evidence-including evidence of the mother's alcohol addiction-but also\n   <em>\n    made a\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    strategic decision\n   </em>\n   not to present to the jury evidence of brain damage or a diagnosis of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (\n   <em>\n    though trial counsel was unable to articulate the reasons for that strategic decision\n   </em>\n   ). Instead, trial counsel's strategy was to present mitigation evidence regarding [Williams'] troubled childhood and his [other disorders], as diagnosed by defense experts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   J.A. 665 (emphases added). Finally, the PCR court also found that, even if Williams had presented evidence of FAS to the jury, it was unlikely that the jury would have returned a different sentence. The PCR court based its conclusion in part on a survey of eight jury verdicts from other jurisdictions demonstrating that defendants are sentenced to death in spite of mitigating evidence of FAS or organic brain damage. The South Carolina Supreme Court dismissed Williams' petition for writ of certiorari,\n   <em>\n    Williams v. South Carolina\n   </em>\n   , No. 2016-MO-012,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201458174\">\n    2016 WL 1458174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.C.

Ground One asserted that the trial court's\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   charge was improperly coercive. Ground Two asserted that the State elicited prejudicial testimony from its forensic psychiatrist by asking her if she became involved only in cases in which \"the death penalty may be considered.\"\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   J.A. 23-25,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   J.A. 276. Grounds Three and Four asserted that trial counsel failed to properly object to a series of allegedly prejudicial comments made during the State's closing argument. Ground Five asserted that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to assert Williams' right to seek assistance from the German government under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations based on his German citizenship. And of particular importance to this appeal, Ground Six asserted Williams was denied effective assistance of counsel after trial counsel failed to investigate evidence of FAS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The case was referred to a magistrate judge, who recommended the petition be granted as to Ground Six, and that Williams' death sentence be vacated as a result. The magistrate judge concluded that the PCR court's finding that trial counsel \"made a strategic decision\" was unreasonable given that this finding was directly contradicted by trial counsel's PCR testimony.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   J.A. 885,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   J.A. 665. The magistrate judge also concluded that Williams established prejudice: because the State put forward only one aggravating factor and \"the jury was deprived of powerful [mitigating] evidence,\" a reasonable probability existed that the jury would have returned a life sentence had this additional mitigating evidence been presented and credited by the jury. J.A. 888. Finally, the magistrate judge also recommended granting summary judgment to the State as to Grounds One through Five and Seven through Ten, and dismissing without prejudice Grounds Eleven through Fifteen.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The district court adopted the magistrate judge's recommendations as to Grounds One through Ten, including granting the petition as to Ground Six. The district court also granted Williams a stay as to Grounds Eleven through Fifteen, pending exhaustion of those claims in state court. Consequently, the district court vacated the death sentence and \"suggest[ed]\" a resentencing trial. J.A. 959.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The State filed a timely appeal as to Ground Six.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 2253.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) provides that a federal district court \"shall entertain an application for a writ of habeas corpus\" filed by a state prisoner \"only on the ground that he is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\" Generally speaking, before filing a \u00a7 2254 petition, a petitioner must exhaust all state court remedies.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2254(b) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

By counsel's own PCR-court admission, their failure to further investigate signs of FAS fell below the then-current standard for mitigation investigations: both attorneys acknowledged they were aware of the mitigating value of neurological defects at the time of Williams' sentencing-with Mauldin\n   <em>\n    specifically\n   </em>\n   testifying that he was aware at the time of the importance of FAS as a potential mitigating factor-yet they failed to investigate this issue. Mauldin noted that he\n   <em>\n    should\n   </em>\n   have been aware of the issue because the evidence of Williams' brain damage and Huckaby's alcohol consumption during her pregnancy, as well as Dr. Richards' request for medical records concerning the circumference of Williams' head at birth and an MRI, should have alerted counsel to this issue at the time of sentencing. But, as Mauldin testified, he was unable to explain why this information did not raise a red flag: \"I wish I could say I connected that, but I did not. ... I really don't have an explanation for why I was missing those kinds of indicators.\" J.A. 519. As he further stated, \"I am dumbfounded about why a certain course of action did not occur [as the result of being aware of Huckaby's drinking during her pregnancy]. ... [I]t is unexplainable to me.\" J.A. 525. Mauldin was similarly unable to explain why, despite awareness of Huckaby's drinking, counsel did not even consider whether Williams had FAS. Nettles' testimony confirmed Mauldin's: despite numerous indicators of FAS, they did not consider whether to pursue that evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Consequently, because there was no recognition of a potential FAS diagnosis by trial counsel, there was no further exploration of FAS as a potential mitigating factor. And because there was no further exploration, there was\n   <em>\n    necessarily\n   </em>\n   no opportunity for counsel to make a strategic decision about whether or not to further develop the FAS evidence or present it in mitigation. Rather, the investigation here was deficient for the same reasons that\n   <em>\n    Wiggins\n   </em>\n   found counsel's investigation to be deficient: the lack of an informed decision regarding mitigating evidence. In\n   <em>\n    Wiggins\n   </em>\n   , there was evidence of a Maryland death row inmate's alcoholic mother and his problems in foster care. Despite this evidence, counsel failed to follow up on these leads for potentially mitigating evidence.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8898384\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/510/#p520\">\n    539 U.S. at 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8898384\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/510/#p520\">\n    123 S.Ct. 2527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court held that counsel's failure to develop FAS evidence\n   was reasonable in light of two factors: first, there was no indication that the birth mother drank during her pregnancy (specifically, the birth mother denied abusing alcohol during her pregnancy and her records contained no contrary evidence); and second, there was no evidence of organic brain damage or FAS, particularly in the test results evaluated by the defense team.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9102546\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/339/203/#p206\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9102546\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/339/203/#p206\">\n    at 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Based upon [the] investigation and the absence of any evidence of organic brain dysfunction, trial counsel concluded that they did not have a sufficient factual basis to present FAS as evidence in mitigation.\").

First, although evidence of Huckaby's drinking during pregnancy was mixed, there was sufficient evidence of alcohol abuse that Vogelsang flagged it for general concern. Second, there was evidence of Williams' brain damage, including impairment of the front lobe. Furthermore, even though evidence of brain damage led Dr. Richards to suggest ordering an MRI of Williams' brain and to request medical records of Williams' head circumference at birth-information often correlated with a FAS diagnosis-the team failed to provide the medical records or to obtain the MRI until the week prior to trial. Consequently, evidence of FAS\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   reasonably available, but counsel failed to connect the indicators suggesting further investigation. And given that FAS evidence was widely acknowledged to be a significant mitigating factor that reasonable counsel should have at least explored-as outlined in the ABA Guidelines and caselaw at the time, and by counsel during their PCR testimony-counsel's actions were deficient.

Along the same lines, the State argues that Williams cannot establish prejudice because a main indicator of FAS (Huckaby's drinking), as well as two FAS-related or\n   FAS-like symptoms (Williams' mental illnesses and learning disabilities) were already before the jury. Consequently, the State argues, the addition of a diagnosis of FAS would not have changed the outcome.

First, as discussed previously, the FAS evidence was different from the other evidence of mental illness and behavioral issues because it could have established\n   <em>\n    cause and effect\n   </em>\n   for the jury-specifically, a FAS diagnosis could have provided to the jury evidence of a neurological defect that\n   <em>\n    caused\n   </em>\n   Williams' criminal behavior.

This could have been persuasive mitigating evidence for a jury-particularly a deadlocked one-considering the death penalty, and could have been outcome-determinative because of how it framed a defendant's culpability, particularly in comparison to the other mitigating factors submitted for the jury's consideration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rompilla v.

As an initial matter, we note that, by relying on the survey of jury verdicts, the PCR court failed to examine the facts of this case in view of the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   requirements and instead made a generalized assessment unrelated to the case before it.

As discussed above, the mitigating FAS evidence here could have been significant for the jury because it could have established cause and effect, thereby diminishing Williams' culpability. The evidence's significance is further heightened here given that the jury was initially deadlocked on whether to impose the death penalty.

The diagnosis of prenatal alcohol exposure had evolved to encompass, by the time of trial, assessing certain facial and neurological abnormalities. Such diagnoses were used to address, among other issues, permanent deficits exhibited by FAS patients in socialization, communication, motor, and daily living skills. In 2007, a protocolized approach for assessing FAS in the criminal justice context was developed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases (rev. ed. 2003),\n    <em>\n     reprinted in\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20Hofstra%20L.%20Rev.%20913\">\n     31 Hofstra L.

The presentation of this evidence does not predetermine a lesser sentence for Williams. In fact, as the State correctly notes, a FAS diagnosis can be a double-edged sword, given that it may also indicate future dangerousness to the jury. Consequently, we also cannot presuppose FAS evidence must be presented or will prevail in any further proceedings. We conclude only that\n    <em>\n     if\n    </em>\n    counsel had chosen to present this evidence, the jury\n    <em>\n     may have\n    </em>\n    returned a different verdict. Nothing in this opinion should be taken to conclude that counsel, after a proper investigation, is compelled to present FAS evidence in another sentencing proceeding.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
