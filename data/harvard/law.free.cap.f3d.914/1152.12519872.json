The district court classified Mora-Higuera as a career offender under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 4B1.1 and sentenced him to 292 months' imprisonment. As relevant here, the district court determined that one of Mora-Higuera's convictions-California second-degree robbery-qualified as a predicate \"crime of violence\" under \u00a7 4B1.2 of the Guidelines. We affirmed Mora-Higuera's sentence on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In practice, this usually means that a prisoner must file a motion within one year of \"the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final.\" \u00a7 2255(f)(1). \"He may file at a later date, however, if the motion comes within one year of 'the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if that right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.' \"\n   <em>\n    Russo v.

Mora-Higuera argues that\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   also effectively invalidated the residual clause of \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) of the mandatory Guidelines that were in effect at the time of his original sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mora-Higuera's arguments are foreclosed by\n   <em>\n    Russo\n   </em>\n   . In that case, we held that the right Mora-Higuera asserts here-\"a right under the Due Process Clause to be sentenced without reference to the residual clause of \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) under the mandatory guidelines\"-was \"not dictated by\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518489\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/902/880/#p882\">\n    902 F.3d at 882-83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To the contrary, we reasoned, \"[i]t is reasonably debatable whether\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   's holding regarding the ACCA extends to the former mandatory guidelines,\" and, accordingly, the petitioner in that case could not benefit from a renewed limitations period under \u00a7 2255(f)(3).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518489\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/902/880/#p882\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518489\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/902/880/#p882\">\n    at 883\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So too here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    The district court subsequently reduced Mora-Higuera's sentence to 262 months' imprisonment based on Amendment 782 to the Guidelines.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203582\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (c)(2). Mora-Higuera qualified for a reduction because the drug quantity table of \u00a7 2D1.1, rather than his career-offender status, set his original total offense level.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.

After Amendment 782, however, both Mora-Higuera's total offense level and his criminal history category were driven by his career-offender status.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    The Honorable Donovan W.
