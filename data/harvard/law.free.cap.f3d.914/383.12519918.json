At a disciplinary proceeding, DeMarco was found guilty of threatening Bynum and was placed in solitary confinement. DeMarco sued, claiming that the seizure of his legal and religious materials had occurred without due process of law, had deprived him of access to the courts, and had burdened his free exercise of religion. He further alleged that Bynum had confiscated his property and instituted the disciplinary action in retaliation for exercising First Amendment rights. Moreover, DeMarco insisted that Stephens and Boyle were deliberately indifferent to those constitutional violations. Finally, DeMarco claimed that Boyle had denied him due process at the disciplinary hearing by tampering with evidence and prohibiting him from calling his own witnesses. The district court severed DeMarco's challenge to the validity of the disciplinary hearing and dismissed the remainder of the complaint for failure to state a claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1915A(b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This court reviews dismissals under \u00a7 1915A(b)(1)\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   , using the standard applied under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\n   <em>\n    Legate v.

In his brief, DeMarco states that the retaliation was motivated by the submission of an earlier grievance on June 10, 2013. But in his answers to the district court's questionnaire, DeMarco maintained that he had filed the relevant grievance on May 27, 2013. He also alleged that the retaliation occurred because he had offered to serve as a witness against Bynum in 2012. This changing tale is conclusional at best. Because DeMarco has not demonstrated retaliatory intent through direct evidence or a clear chronology of events, he has failed to establish the second and fourth elements of his retaliation claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McDonald\n   </em>\n   , 132 F.3d at 231.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   E.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   DeMarco posits that Bynum burdened the free exercise of religion by confiscating his religious materials.

In evaluating the reasonableness of a prison policy, we consider (1) the existence of a \"valid, rational connection\" between the state action and the \"legitimate governmental interest put forward to justify it;\" (2) the availability of alternative means of exercising the right; (3) the impact an accommodation will have on guards, other inmates, and the allocation of prison resources; and (4) the absence of alternatives that \"fully accommodate[ ] the prisoner's right[ ] at\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   cost to valid penological interests.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   A plaintiff bears the burden of proving that a prison policy, as applied, is not reasonably related to legitimate penological objectives.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, prison officials are entitled to \"substantial deference\" in the exercise of their professional judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Overton\n   </em>\n   , 539 U.S. at 132,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897508\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/126/\">\n    123 S.Ct. 2162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).

The court suggested that because DeMarco had not requested the return of his religious materials, his professed faith was likely a sham. We disagree. Though DeMarco did not specify that he was a Christian, he averred that Bynum had confiscated copies of the Bible and religious books by Max Lucado, Charles Swindoll, and Joel Osteen. Moreover, DeMarco asserted that the taking of those books had placed a substantial burden on his practice of reading religious literature. His decision to seek damages-rather than the return of\n   his books-does not indicate that his religious belief is disingenuous. Indeed, his books were allegedly destroyed, leaving damages as his only recourse. Hence, with the benefit of liberal construction, DeMarco's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   pleadings establish that the seizure of his books burdened a sincere religious practice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Woodfox v.

Rather, as DeMarco alleges, Bynum merely stated that \"he could take whatever he wanted whenever he wanted.\" The district court therefore erred in dismissing DeMarco's free exercise claim against Bynum in his individual capacity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   On remand, the court should determine whether the alleged confiscation was reasonably related to a legitimate penological objective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Nevertheless, the district court properly dismissed DeMarco's free exercise claim against Boyle and Stephens. \"[T]o state a cause of action under section 1983, the plaintiff must identify defendants who were either personally involved in the constitutional violation or whose acts are causally connected to the constitutional violation alleged.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   DeMarco does not aver that Boyle or Stephens personally confiscated his religious materials. Instead, he claims that they caused the violation by failing to train their subordinates and by ignoring previous complaints about Bynum. But DeMarco does not specify any other examples of comparable violations. Nor does he explain how better training might have prevented the alleged violation. Such conclusional allegations are insufficient to show that the alleged violation resulted from Boyle and Stephens' actions.
