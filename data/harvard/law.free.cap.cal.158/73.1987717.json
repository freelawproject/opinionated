Under the constitution the district court has concurrent jurisdiction with the supreme court in original proceedings of this character. A judgment by that court is therefore an adjudication of the matters set forth in the petition. If this court should entertain a distinct application of the same character the petitioner would be met by an answer alleging the former adjudication in the district court, and that adjudication would be a bar. In such cases if the applicant desires the intervention of this court in the matter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>the only effectual-method of obtaining it is by application for a transfer of the case to this court for a reconsideration and decision. If the district court had decided the case without an adjudication upon the merits, perhaps its judgment would not be a bar, but petitioner\u2019s application shows that the adjudication of that court was a decision upon the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">For these reasons the application for a writ is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
