This action was brought to quiet title to a tract of land in San Joaquin County, and involves the validity of a conveyance made by one Kyle as attorney in fact for plaintiffs and one Sebree to Olive A. Jennings, under whom defendant claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-12\">This appeal presents practically the same questions as are involved in the case of <em>Alcorn </em>v. <em>Gieseke </em>(Sac. No. 1693), <em>ante, </em>p. 396, [111 Pac. 98], this day decided, affirming the judgment and order of the trial court. The defendants in both cases claim under Jennings to two separate portions of a larger tract conveyed to her by the deed whose validity is involved, and on the authority of <em>Alcorn </em>v. <em>Gieseke, </em>the judgment and order in the present appeal are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-13\">Hearing in Bank denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
