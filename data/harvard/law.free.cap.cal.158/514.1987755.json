The action was tried before a jury. Plaintiffs obtained a verdict, and from the. judgment which followed and from the order of the court refusing its motion for a new trial defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-12\">Plaintiffs were returning from an evening entertainment. Reaching their place of debarkation, the car stopped to permit them and other passengers to alight. The husband had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>stepped off the car and was awaiting to assist his wife therefrom when another car of defendant heedlessly collided with the rear of the stationary car. Mrs. Basler, who was standing at the time, was thrown across a seat and to the floor of the car, receiving the injuries for which compensation was sought. The answer was, first, by way of general denial, and, for a second and special defense, contributory negligence was charged against Mrs. Basler\u2019s husband. The court struck out this special defense, and its ruling in this regard first demands attention. This special defense alleged that Basler, debarking from the car, had reached the ground \u201cfor the purpose of assisting his wife to alight,\u201d when another ear came into collision with the car upon which plaintiffs had been passengers; that the other car was fully equipped with all necessary appliances, and that the motorman thereof was of long experience and skill in operating such cars; but that when approaching the stationary car he was \u201ctemporarily engrossed in his own personal affairs, and became excited and alarmed at the presence of the car upon which plaintiff had been riding, . . \u201e and upon the spur of the moment and in the exercise of his judgment under the circumstances, such employee failed to take proper action to stop such other car until the same struck the car upon which plaintiffs had been riding. . . . That plaintiff, Charles M. Basler, at the time of the approach of such other car was standing upon the ground alongside of such car upon which he and his wife had been riding and was not otherwise engaged, and saw such car approaching for a long distance and in ample time and full opportunity to have given a signal or alarm and caused such oncoming car to stop or the other car to move, but he gave no alarm or signal of any kind to the persons in charge of the car upon which he had been a \u25a0passenger and took no steps whatever to prevent such collision, but stood silently and idly by and observed such other car come in contact with the car upon which he had been riding and upon which his wife still was. That the persons in charge of the car upon which plaintiffs had been passengers were engaged in seeing that the passengers thereon were enabled to alight and did not see the approach of the car that caused the collision. That plaintiff, Charles M. Basler, claims to be familiar with the operation of cars and capable of judging of the speed of ears and of the best mode of controlling the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>same, but he made no effort to prevent such collision nor did he do anything whatever to avoid it, although fully aware that a collision was imminent. . . . Defendant avers that if the said Bessie M. Easier received any injury of any character by reason of such collision it was because she did not exercise due care on her part to avoid injury and also by the failure of plaintiff, Charles M. Easier, to notify the persons in charge of the car in which plaintiff, Bessie M. Easier, was riding, or to notify the employees of defendant on said other ear of the danger of collision, he thereby directly contributed to whatever injury may have been sustained by the said Bessie M. Easier.\u201d Appellant\u2019s contention is that this special defense charges a complete case of contributory negligence against the plaintiff husband, and that this negligence bars the right of either and of both plaintiffs to recover: 1. Because the wife was in the care and custody of her husband, and consequently his negligence is imputable to her, under the doctrine of <em>Lamb </em>v. <em>Harbaugh, </em>105 Cal. 680, [39 Pac. 56] ; <em>McKune </em>v. <em>Santa Clara etc. Co., </em>110 Cal. 487, [42 Pac. <em>980] ; Paine </em>v. <em>San Bernardino etc. Co., </em>143 Cal. 658, [77 Pac. 659], and 2. Regardless of the question as to- whether or not the wife was so in the husband\u2019s care and custody, if his negligence \u2022 contributed proximately to her injury (since under the laws of this state the recovery for her injuries is community property, in which the husband shares and over which he has control), the law will not permit him to benefit by his own wrong, and therefore a recovery will not be permitted. <em>(McFadden </em>v. <em>Santa Ana etc. Ry., </em>87 Cal. 468, [25 Pac. 681] ; Beach on Contributory Negligence, p. 165, note.) The propositions of law here advanced by appellant are sound and accepted doctrines in this state. It is also true that negligence may be active or passive in character. It may consist in heedlessly doing an improper thing or in heedlessly refraining from doing the proper thing. Whether the circumstances call for activity or passivity, one who does not do what he should is equally chargeable with negligence with him who does what he should not. These principles are but an elaboration of the maxim <em>idem est facere et non prohibere cum possis; et qui non prohibit, cum prohibere possit in culpa est (amt jubet). </em>The questions thus resolve to the single proposition, does or does not the special defense charge contributory negligence with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>legal particularity and certainty; in other words, are the allegations of this defense sufficient in law as a defense. Herein it is to be noted that the contributory negligence which will bar a recovery must be such as to establish that the person by failure to exercise the required amount of care proximately contributed to produce the injury complained of \u201cso that but for his concurring and co-operative fault the injury would not have happened.\u201d <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Co., </em>(Cal.) 9 Pac. 152 ; <em>Cross </em>v. <em>Califonia St. R. R. Co., </em>102 Cal. 315, [36 Pac. 673].) What does the defense aver in this respect? It declares that the motorman was \u201cengrossed by his personal affairs.\u201d That \u201che became excited and alarmed at the presence of the car upon which plaintiffs had been riding, at the place where the same had stopped.\u201d It does not say how far distant he was when he perceived the ear, why he should have become excited or alarmed, or whether or not he perceived the car when it was sufficiently distant to have enabled him to have stopped his own car. The declaration in this regard is merely to the effect that when he discovered the presence of the other car (and where his car was at the time of that discovery is not indicated), he \u201cfailed to take proper action to stop his car,\u201d and so the collision occurred. So much for the conduct of the motorman. Basler, it is averred, was standing upon the ground waiting to assist his wife to debark \u201cand was not otherwise engaged.\u201d He saw the approaching car for a long distance and in ample time to have given the signal or alarm and cause such oncoming car to stop or the other car to move on, but gave no alarm or signal of any kind and took no steps to prevent the collision, \u201cand stood silently and idly by and observed such other ear come in contact with the car upon which he had been riding and upon which his wife still was.\u201d The failure of the employees upon the stationary car to observe the approach of the other is then sought to be excused upon the allegation that they \u201cwere engaged in seeing that the passengers thereon were enabled to alight.\u201d But in this connection it is to be noted that the defense also avers that Basler \u201chad reached the ground for the purpose of assisting his wife to alight.\u201d It is then charged that the failure of Basler to notify the persons in charge of the car upon which he had been riding, or to notify the employee of the approaching car of the danger of collision, he thereby directly con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>tributed to Mrs. Basler\u2019s injuries. The plea is singular, in that the defendant excuses its own employees for non-observance of the approaching car upon the ground that they were \u201cseeing that the passengers were enabled to alight,\u201d but charges Basler with full knowledge of the approaching car, notwithstanding the fact that he was standing on the ground doing the very thing which is offered as an excuse for the conduct of defendant\u2019s employees, namely, watching and waiting for the purpose of assisting his wife to alight. However, the plea is not to be condemned for its singularity. It is to be condemned solely, if at all, for deficiency. But we think it is subject to condemnation upon this ground. To constitute a good plea of contributory negligence, it must, as has been said, be charged and made to appear that the act or omission was such that but for it the injury would not have happened. To sustain this plea it must be assumed and charged against Basler that he not only knew that the car was approaching, but knew also that its motorman was temporarily engrossed in his own personal affairs and did not know that he was nearing a collision, that when the motorman discovered that he was approaching a stationary car, although in time to avert the accident, he would become excited and alarmed and so not check the speed of his car. He must also be charged with knowing that the employees upon the stationary car whose duty it certainly was to protect their car from accident and injury, were themselves so engaged as not to discover the approach, and it must finally be charged against Basler, as matter of law, and under all these circumstances, that if he had notified the employee or motorman of the approaching car, the latter would not, as he did, become excited and alarmed, but with calmness and discretion would have pre? vented the accident. Such knowledge is not imputable to Basler and it may not be said that there is the slightest showing that if Basler had done that, which it is alleged he failed to do, the collision would have been in any wise averted. Basler was entitled to consider, as any other person would be entitled to consider, that it was a thing not to be expected, merely because one street-ear was running up behind another, that the danger of accident was imminent, and that it was his duty to sound an alarm. The case is entirely different from that presented by <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Fitchburg &amp; L. St. Ry. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number><em>Co., </em>201 Mass. 489, [87 N. E. 898], where upon a dark night a street-car ran into an automobile, stalled alongside the track, where the occupants of the automobile had ample time to make known their position, yet sat indifferent in the car, trusting to the motorman to see them and stop, and this, when their automobile was out of the traveled highway at a place where vehicles did not run and where the presence of a vehicle was not to be expected. In that case the supreme court merely declared that they omitted to employ any precaution to avert the accident which an ordinarily prudent person situated as were the plaintiffs would have used. But to say that that case is authority for the proposition that one must sound a warning when he sees a street-car approaching another stationary one from the rear is an extension of the doctrine of contributory negligence to which assent cannot be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">The court\u2019s action in striking out this matter rather than in sustaining a demurrer to it was an irregularity without injury. The special defense was doubtless as complete as it could be made and an amendment to cure its defects manifestly could not be pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Defendant offered to permit plaintiffs to take judgment in the sum of two thousand dollars and the offer was refused. It renewed its offer in its answer, with certain argumentative and exculpatory averments as to why it was made, and that it was made in reliance \u201csolely upon the statements of plaintiffs, their attorneys, physicians and representatives\u201d and more to the same effect. The court struck out this argumentative matter and left the simple offer as contemplated by section 997 of the Code of Civil Procedure. We are not disposed in the least to question the right of a defendant in an action for tort to make such an offer under the code provision. <em>(Douthitt </em>v. <em>Finch, </em>84 Cal. 215, [24 Pac. 929] <em>; Redding ton </em>v. <em>Pacific Postal Tel. Co., </em>107 Cal. 322, [48 Am. St. Rep. 122, 40 Pac. 432] ; <em>Kaw Valley Fair Assoc. </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>42 Kan. 20, [21 Pac. 794] ; <em>Hammond </em>v. <em>Northern Pac. R. Co., </em>23 Or. 157, [31 Pac. 299].): But it is not in contemplation of the law that the pleading of tender shall be burdened with explanatory, apologetic, or extenuating matters in no way going to the defense of the action, and the court properly struck out such matters here alleged as mere surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>Nor did the court err in overruling defendant\u2019s demurrer to the complaint. The husband was a necessary party to the action, notwithstanding that the action was solely for a recovery for damages for injuries inflicted upon the wife. The complaint sounded in damages for this reason and for this reason alone. Neither in the complaint nor in the taking of evidence is there any indication of a violation of the rule declared in <em>Tell </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>66 Cal. 249, [5 Pac. 233]. The whole argument of appellant in this regard is that the complaint asks compensation for the \u201cplaintiffs\u201d and \u201cupon such allegation it must be that two elements are involved,\u201d compensation for the husband and compensation for the wife. This position is absolutely untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">Much argument is indulged in to the effect that the court injuriously limited and curtailed the cross-examination of plaintiff Bessie M. Basler, and confined the defendant\u2019s inquiry into the condition of her health before the accident, to the year immediately preceding. It would be useless to answer in detail all that is urged upon this proposition, for the answer itself would consist principally of extracts and quotations from evidence actually introduced to show that the asserted grievance is ill-founded. Suffice it to say that we recognize the rule that where the defendant seeks to establish a previous condition of invalidism upon the part of plaintiff, or seeks to prove that the plaintiff is malingering, liberal latitude in cross-examination should be permitted. But that latitude was here allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">This same declaration will serve to answer many of the appellant\u2019s objections to the rulings of the court in the admission and rejection of testimony. Certain evidence was admitted, in establishing plaintiff\u2019s injuries, to show deterioration in her physical condition after the accident from what it had been shortly prior thereto. It is argued by appellant that the- admission of this evidence was error because the evidence itself was testimony touching the ability of the plaintiff to perform physical labor, and therefore involved the question of the husband\u2019s compensation for loss of her services, which question was, of course, not involved in the action. This objection, too, is over-refined. An excerpt from the evidence, declarations of counsel and rulings of the court will serve to illustrate this beyond argument:\u2014\u2022</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>\u201cTestimony oe Mrs. Basler.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-4\">\u201cQ.

Generally speaking, appellant was contending for the proposition that if it had used proper care in the equipment of its cars and in the furnishing of competent men to operate those cars, its responsibility was at an end, and that any other rule would make of the defendant company an absolute insurer. The court instructed in these matters that the defendant was not relieved from responsibility, notwithstanding that its employee might have been skillful, if in fact upon the particular occasion in question the employee did not use due care and skill. This is the law as universally recognized in this state. <em>(Cunningham </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Ry., </em>115 Cal. 561, [47 Pac. 452] ; <em>Bosqui </em>v. <em>Sutro Ry.
