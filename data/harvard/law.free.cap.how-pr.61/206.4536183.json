It has been repeatedly held in similar cases that the buyer\u2019s promise is an original one, and that he cannot avoid his own debt, because it incidentally discharges that of another. The case could be sustained under several of the rules often repeated by the authorities, which declare cases not within the statute. It is sufficient, however, to put the case under one of the most familiar rules, and one which Throop, in his Treatise on Verbal Agreements, mentions as \u201crule eighth\u201d <em>{page </em>565), following which he mentions a large number of cases, both English and American, sustaining the rule. The'following is the rule as he there cites it: \u201c A promise to pay the debt of another is not within the statute, if its consideration was the abandonment to the promisor of a security for the payment of the debt consisting of a lien upon, or interest in property to which the promisor then had a subordinate title.\u201d Whatever may be said about the wording of this rule\u2014for it certainly is more complex than that of chancellor Kent in <em>Leonard </em>agt. <em>Vredenburg </em>(8 <em>Johns. </em>29), where he classifies it as the third rule\u2014no one can doubt but that a case fitting all the conditions as thus expressed by Throop, is clearly not within the statute. This case certainly fits all the conditions thus expressed by him, for the Thurbers, the promisors, say to Hancox, the promisee, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number><em>\u201c </em>assign this mortgage to us and we will pay and cancel your notes in the bank.\u201d Both the promisors and the promisee had interests in the mortgage \u2014 that of the promisors subordinate to that of the promisee. The consideration of the promise was the abandonment and transfer to the promisor of a security for the payment of the debt consisting of a lien upon property to which the promisors had a subordinate lien. The rule is more simply expressed by chancellor Kent, and has always been recognized and sustained in this state. It xeads : \u201c When the promise to pay the debt of another arises .out of' some new and original consideration or benefit of harm moving between the newly contracting parties.\u201d Chief justice Comstock in <em>Mallory </em>agt. <em>Gillett </em>(21 <em>N. Y., </em>419), in commenting upon this rule, cites from chief justice Savage with approval his wording of the rule, which is as follows: <em>\u201c </em>In all these cases, founded on a new and original consideration of benefit to the defendant or harm to the plaintiff moving to the party making the promise, either from the plaintiff or original debtor, the subsisting liability of the original debtor is no objection to a recovery.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-5\">II.. The case should not be confounded with those where the considerations move not to the promisor, but moves to the original debtor, which belong to an entirely different class of cases, and that was the case with <em>Mallory </em>agt. <em>Gillett; </em>there the plaintiff relinquished his interest in the canal boat \u2014 not to the defendant but to the original debtor\u2014and the court held the agreement between the plaintiff and defendant in that case was collateral, because it was not sustained by a consideration moving between the plaintiff and defendant. The court in <em>Mallory </em>agt. <em>Gillett </em>cites .a number of cases, showing that where such an agreement is sustained by a consideration moving between the promisor and the promisee, it is an original undertaking and not within the statute. The court further on says: <em>\u201cFarley </em>agt. <em>Cleveland </em>(4 <em>Cow., </em>432, <em>and S. C. in error, </em>9 <em>Cow., </em>639), already mentioned, was entirely similar. The plaintiff held the note .of one Moon, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>which the defendant promised to pay in consideration of fifteen tons of hay sold to him by Moon. The promise was held to be not within the statute. The reporter\u2019s note truly expresses the principle of the decision. It is as follows: <em>\u2018 </em>Where a promise to pay the debt of a third person arises out of some new consideration of benefit to the promisor or harm to the promisee, moving to the promisor, either from the promisee or the original debtor, such promise is not within the statute of frauds, although the original debt still subsists and remains entirely unaffected by the new agreement.\u2019 \u201d By some commentators there is a disposition to ignore rules on this subject, but no one can deny that the authoritative cases in this state have established rules that have long been followed. And thus the whole subject is simplified. The reason for the rule that we contend governs this case is, that the promise is original; and the paying of another\u2019s debt is but a circumstance, or rather an incident to the original promise. So it is error in the case at bar, to consider Thurber\u2019s promise to Hancox, as a promise to pay the debt of Hal-comb. It is simply a promise on the part of the Thurbers to pay to Hancox a debt due to him in consideration of his assigning to the Thurbers a mortgage for $2,000. We sue the Thurbers on their own indebtedness. A simple statement of the case shows that there is no escape from the conclusion that the promise of the Thurbers is an original undertaking, and their failure to fulfill the same leaves their debt unpaid. Hancox held in his name a $2,000 mortgage, to secure, in the first place, whatever claims he might have against Holcomb, the mortgagor, on account of accommodation notes that Han-cox had given to Holcomb, which were discounted at the bank, and then running to maturity. The only interest the Thurbers had in it was an equitable right to receive from Hancox whatever was left after he had fully reimbursed himself, for whatever payments he might have made on his own notes which were discounted at the bank for the accommoda-. tion of the mortgagor. The Thurbers,, as prudent business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>men, wanted this $2,000 mortgage, they wanted both the legal and the equitable title in their name and under their control. The consideration for was, first, the amount of money they would pay out in taking up Hancox\u2019s notes in the bank; second, the $800 then due by Holcomb to the Thurbers and, third, the $600 the further credit that the Thurbers were about to give to Mrs. Holcomb. The cases cited by the other side bear out the principle contended for. <em>Prime </em>agt. <em>Koeller </em>(77 <em>N. Y., </em>91) is a case directly in favor of the plaintiff. For there was a verbal promise to pay the debt of another arising out of an original undertaking between the promisor and promisee. The defendant in that case would not have been held liable to pay the two installments of interest, were it not for Ms verbal promise to pay the same on condition that the defendant would not foreclose the mortgage, which the defendant agreed to. Thus the defendant being the owner of the land received a benefit from the agreement, 'in that no proceedings were taken to disturb Ms possession of the land. The court says, page 94: <em>\u201c </em>The circumstances bring the case directly with the tMrd class of cases enumerated in <em>Leonard </em>agt. <em>Vredenburg </em>(8 <em>J. T., </em>28), viz.: Where the promise to pay the debt of another arises out of the same, new and original consideration of benefit or harm running between the newly contracting parties. In this class of cases the subsisting liability of the original debtor is no objection to a recovery.\u201d The language in the first part of the opinion may at first glance appear a little deceiving, but it is to meet the statute, and in its broad sense it is correct, and refers only to collateral undertaMngs-to pay the debt of another. But the courts distinguish between that class of cases where the promise is merely collateral, and those were the paying of another\u2019s debt is a part performance of a new and original undertaking between the promisor and the promisee as will be seen further on in the opinion and the entire case itself. The case of <em>Belknap </em>agt. <em>Bender </em>(75 <em>N. Y., </em>446), has no bearing one way or the other with this case. There the court dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>tinctly held that there was no consideration moving to the defendant from the plaintiff. It says : \u201c The promise of the plaintiff to work for the defendant at what appeared to be a full compensation did not furnish a' consideration for the defendant\u2019s promise to pay Ward &amp; McVicker\u2019s debt \u201d <em>(Pfeffer </em>agt. <em>Adler, </em>37 N. <em>Y., </em>164), and the trial judge so held. The court held, and it was impossible to have held otherwise, that the defendant held the property under the written agreement set forth, which of course was controlling. This left the defendant\u2019s promise without any consideration which would not have been valid even in writing. The following from <em>Cook </em>agt. <em>Moore </em>(8 <em>N. Y. W. Dig., </em>263), shows that the rule on which the plaintiff\u2019s case is based is well settled: \u201c The county court erred in dismissing the complaint. The defendant undertook the payment for himself. This case is not within the statute of frauds, but rather falls within the third class of promises stated by Comstock, J., in <em>Mallory </em>agt. <em>Gillett </em>(21 <em>N. Y., </em>433), where, although the debt remains, the promise is founded upon a new consideration which moves to the promisor. This consideration may come from the debtor, as where he puts a fund in the hands of the promisor, either by absolute transfer or upon a trust to pay the debt \u201d <em>(Lippincott </em>agt. <em>Ashfield, </em>4 <em>Sand., </em>411). <em>\u201c </em>From the facts proved in this case, the law would imply a liability to apply the fund in the defendant\u2019s hands in the manner directed, and in which he undertook to do <em>(Barker </em>agt. <em>Bucklin, </em>2 <em>Denio, </em>45; <em>Lawrence </em>agt. <em>Fox, </em>20 <em>N. Y., </em>208 ; <em>Barlow </em>agt. <em>Myers, </em>64 <em>N. Y., </em>41). Where the law will imply a debt or duty against any man, his express promise to pay the same debt or perform the same duty, must, in its nature be original (21 <em>Af. Y., </em>430). Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to abide the event.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b217-5\"><em>E. More, </em>for respondents.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b217-6\">Beach, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AnU\">In considering this case it is needful to keep in view the fact that the agreement of the defendants was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>not made with the holder of the Haneox note. Had it been, a question would have arisen, controlled by the provisions of the statute of frauds, which enacts that every special promise to answer for the debts of another shall be void, unless such agreement or some note or memorandum thereof be in writing and subscribed by the party to be charged therewith. The case at bar is not affected by the enactment'.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The action is not brought by the creditor (the holder of the unpaid note) upon a parol promise made to him by the defendants, to pay it, but by the assignee of Haneox, the debtor, with whom the contract was found by the jury to have been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">The case in brief would seem thus: Haneox was primarily indebted to the holder upon the notes he had executed as maker for the accommodation of Holcomb, and held security for his indemnity. The defendants agreed, if he would assign to them this security, they would pay the paper whereon he was bound. He did so, and they failed to perform their part of the contract. This engagement was certainly made upon sufficient consideration, to wit, the possession and control of the mortgage and bond then assigned to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Had an action been brought by the bank as holder of the paper against the defendants, a recovery would have been had under the principle <em>\u201c </em>that when one person for a valuable consideration engages with another to do some act for the benefit of a third, the latter, who would enjoy the benefit of the act, may maintain an action for the breach of such engagement \u201d <em>(Schermerhorn </em>agt. Vanderheyden, 1 <em>Johns. R., </em>140; <em>The Del. &amp; Hud. Canal Co. </em>agt. <em>The Westchester County Bank, </em>4 <em>Den., </em>97; <em>Brewery </em>agt. <em>Dyer, </em>7 <em>Cush., </em>337; <em>Lawrence </em>agt. <em>Fay, </em>20 <em>N. Y. R., </em>268 ; <em>Huber </em>agt. <em>Ely, </em>45 <em>Barb., </em>169 ; <em>Wyman </em>agt. <em>Smith, </em>4 <em>N. Y. Superior Court R., </em>331; <em>May </em>agt. <em>The National Bank of Malone, </em>16 <em>Sup. Ct. R., </em>108).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">The holder of the notes being thus able to avail himself of the defendant\u2019s agreement, I see no reason why Haneox, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>whom the agreement was made, should not, especially so, he having paid the note. The plaintiff here, by assignment, succeeds to his rights <em>(Claflin, </em>agt. <em>Ostrom, </em>54 <em>N. Y. R., </em>581).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The facts in the above case were as follows: Hanford and Charles Ostrom were partners, and indebted to the plaintiff. On the dissolution of the firm by written agreement, Han-ford assigned all interest to his partner, and the latter agreed to pay plaintiff\u2019s debt among others. The defendant executed to Hanford a written guaranty that Charles Ostrom would perform all his covenants in the agreement. The plaintiff\u2019s debt being unpaid, they took an assignment of all Hanford\u2019s interest in and claim under the agreement and guaranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">In sustaining a judgment for plaintiffs, the court say: \u201c So too, Charles Ostrom having failed to pay the plaintiff\u2019s debt, committed a breach of his covenant with Hanford, which gave the latter a cause of action against him, and also against the defendant, his surety, and this cause of action he assigned to the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">It appears from the record that the premises covered by the mortgage, assigned by Hancox to the defendants, are now owned by them, although by what proceeding obtained is not clearly disclosed by the proofs. Hnder these circumstances it would be manifestly inequitable to relieve them from the. performance of their promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">The order must be reversed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
