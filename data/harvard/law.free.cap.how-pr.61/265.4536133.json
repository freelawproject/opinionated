The bill of particulars contained a large number of charges, and for that reason it was deemed a long account within the meaning of the rule existing upon this subject, and for that reason the reference was ordered. But as the services were performed and the disbursements made in the prosecution of a single action, that rule is not applicable to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-14\">The cause of action was still a single subject-matter, not within the rule permitting a compulsory reference to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>ordered.
