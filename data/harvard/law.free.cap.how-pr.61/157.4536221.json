M. Barnes and William Taylor; Barnes\u2019 remedy being by an action of ejectment.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">It appears that the relator\u2019s claim to the possession of the premises rested upon a lease or leases made by David Dudley Field, Esq., counselor-at-law, unto one Ann Connell, which appear to have been assigned by <em>mesne </em>conveyance to the relator, and that the tenant held possession under one of the assignors, upon the understanding that he was to occupy, the premises as long as he wanted them, or until he was given thirty days notice to quit. The lease referred to in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>assignments., however, was not produced, which may be the reason why the justice dismissed the proceedings, and upon the proposition, doubtless, .that the relation of landlord and tenant was not shown to have existed between the parties to this controversy, the chain of title not being perfected by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">But this was an erroneous view of the subject, because the tenant, having hired from one of the assignors of the lease, was precluded from controverting his landlord\u2019s title, and the relator, as assignee, succeeded to all the rights of the latter <em>(Taylor's Landlord and Tenant [7th ed.], </em>705, <em>and cases cited)/ </em>and, therefore, could maintain this proceeding to recover possession of the premises (1 <em>R. S., </em>147, 598; <em>Laws </em>1846, <em>chap. </em>274, <em>sec. </em>3; <em>Taylor's Landlord and Tenant </em>[7th <em>ed.], sec. </em>720, <em>and cases cited).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">There is no foundation for the point upon which the respondent made the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">It is impossible to sustain the judgment rendered, and therefore the proceedings must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">Ordered accordingly, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">Davis, P.
