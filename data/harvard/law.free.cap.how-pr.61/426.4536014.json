The plaintiffs were copartners in 1868 to 1876, at Bath, Steuben county, and delivered at divers times, articles of hardware, upon the agreement that the defendant should receive and sell them for plaintiffs, and pay over to the plaintiffs the moneys received upon the sales after deducting ten per cent for commissions to defendant for making such sales. The defendant failed to pay over sixty-six dollars and eighty-five cents. This action was brought to recover the same. The defense was: 1. That defendant did not receive the goods in a fiduciary character and, was therefore discharged from the debt by a composition in bankruptcy, and a tender of the money in court representing the dividend under such composition; and, 2. A counter-claim of twenty dollars.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b430-14\"><em>J. F.

The debt to plaintiff was not incurred by defendant while acting, in a fiduciary character, within the meaning of the bankrupt act, and was discharged by the bankruptcy com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>position. It is now a well settled law in this state at least, that the debt due from a factor to his principal, for goods sold upon commission, is discharged by a bankruptcy composition, or a discharge in bankruptcy <em>(Hennequin </em>agt. <em>Clews, 77 </em>N. <em>Y., </em>427). Before this question was Anally settled by the court of appeals for this state, the decisions in this and other states were far from being uniform. Under the act of 1841, the supreme court of the United States held that a factor who received the money of his principal was not a Aduciary, within the meaning of that act <em>(Chapman </em>agt. <em>Forsyth, </em>2 <em>How. </em>[U. <em>S.] R., </em>202). Soon after the passage of the banknrpt act of 1867, the question came up before judge Blatchfobd, then holding the United States district court for the southern district of Hew York <em>(In re Seymour, </em>1 N. <em>B. R., </em>27), whether such an obligation was discharged by a bankruptcy discharge, under the act of 1867. The court held that the rale laid down in <em>Chapman </em>agt. <em>Forsyth (supra), </em>.by reason of a slight difference in the phraseology in the two statutes, did not obtain under the act of 1867, and this decision was afterward approved in the case of <em>Kimball </em>(2 N. <em>B. R., </em>204). This decision in the <em>Seymour </em>case was also soon afterward approved and followed by this general term in the case of <em>Whittaker </em>agt. <em>Chapman </em>(3 <em>Lansing, </em>155), which is the only reported case in which this general term have passed on the question. The doctrine of the <em>Seymour </em>case was, however, not generally adopted as the correct construction of the law, a large majority of the courts holding that the rule laid-down in <em>Chapman </em>agt. <em>Forsyth (supra), </em>was also the rule under the act of 1867 <em>(Grover &amp; Baker </em>agt. <em>Clinton, </em>8 <em>N. B. R., </em>312\u2014Davis; <em>Owsley </em>agt. <em>Cobin, </em>15 <em>N. B. R., </em>490\u2014Waite ; <em>Keime </em>agt. <em>Graff &amp; </em>C., 17 <em>N. B. R., </em>319; <em>Woolsey </em>agt. <em>Cade, </em>15 N. <em>B. R. </em>238; 54 <em>Ala., </em>378; <em>Neal </em>agt. <em>Scroggs &amp; al., 17 N. B. R., </em>102 \u2014 Harlan; <em>Cronin </em>agt. <em>Cutting, </em>104 <em>Mass., </em>245; <em>Am. Law J., vol. </em>8, <em>p. </em>35). It will be observed that three of the above decisions were by judges of the supreme court of the United States, sitting in the circuit court, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>they uniformly adopted the rule laid down in <em>Chapman </em>agt. <em>Forsyth (supra). </em>The case of <em>Neal </em>agt. <em>Scroggs dk al., </em>went to the supreme court of the \u00danited States (5 <em>Otto, </em>708), and the court there followed- the case of <em>Chapman </em>agt. <em>Forsyth. </em>Soon after the latter decision the same question came again before the district court for the southern district of New York, the same court which had decided the <em>Seymour </em>case, and the court then decided that the case of <em>Seymour </em>was overruled by the case of <em>Neal </em>agt. <em>Scroggs </em>(5 <em>Otto), </em>and adopted the rule laid down in the case of <em>Chapman </em>agt. <em>Forsyth (supra) (In re Smith &amp; al., </em>18 <em>N. B. R., page </em>24). This question has lately come before our court of appeals in the case of <em>Hennequin </em>agt. <em>Clews et al. </em>(77 <em>N. Y., </em>427), and that court has decided that such debt is discharged by the bankruptcy composition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b432-5\">II. The composition proceedings were absolute, and a subsequent payment or tender of the amount, to which plaintiffs were entitled under the composition, was not necessary to give effect to the composition <em>(Citing Revised Statutes of the United States, section </em>5103; <em>Constitution, section </em>2, <em>art. </em>6; <em>In re James T.

The facts alleged in complaint showed a breach of trust by defendant, and therefore a tort. The identical moneys here received were to be paid over <em>(Swift </em>agt. <em>Wylie, </em>5 <em>Robertson, </em>680, 684; <em>and cases cited on page </em>684; <em>Barber </em>agt. <em>Sterling, </em>68 <em>N. Y., </em>267, <em>et seq; Merwin </em>agt. <em>Playford, </em>3 <em>Robertson, </em>703). Where the obligation is to pay over specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>proceeds, the action is a tort <em>(Robbins </em>agt. <em>Falconer, </em>43 <em>N. Y. Superior Ct. Reports, </em>11; <em>Jones &amp; Spencer, </em>371; <em>Duguid </em>agt. <em>Edwards, </em>50 <em>Barb., </em>288; <em>Standard Sugar Refinery </em>agt. <em>Dayton, </em>70 <em>N. Y., </em>486). Where the note given is the obligation of the debtor only, is not paid at maturity, the plaintiff still holds it and makes profert of it at the trial, the note does not extinguish the original demand, and defendant is still liable in the fiduciary capacity <em>(Shipman </em>agt. <em>Shafer, </em>14 <em>Abb. Pr., </em>449, 456; <em>Nichols </em>agt. <em>Michael, </em>23 <em>N. Y., </em>264, 272, 273; <em>Central City Bank </em>agt. <em>Dana, </em>32 <em>Barb., </em>296, 298 ; <em>Pettengill </em>agt. <em>Mather, </em>12 <em>Abb. Pr., </em>436). The above proposition is entirely settled and the original debt is not discharged <em>(Cole </em>agt. <em>Lachett c&amp; ano., </em>1 <em>Hill, </em>516, 518; <em>Edwards on Bills and Notes [2d ed.], marg. pp. </em>201, 234; <em>Higby </em>agt. <em>N.

But even if the allegations in complaint as to receiving the money by defendant were immaterial, the defendant denied them and them alone in his answer, and thereby made them a material issue which he could not evade on the trial <em>(Ayres </em>agt. <em>O'Farrell, </em>10 <em>Bosw., </em>143-145; <em>Livingston </em>agt. <em>Miller, </em>4 <em>Selden, </em>283, 289).</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-5\">II. The court properly refused to direct a verdict for defendant as asked, because: <em>(a.) A </em>composition in bankruptcy could not be available here as a defense, except upon the theory of a tender before suit of amount due under composition, for it is of no effect until the terms, are complied with by debtor, viz: payment of amount due under composition <em>(In re Beehet, </em>12 <em>Nat. Bankruptcy Register, </em>201). (b.) In this case defendant did not pay any money into court till on the trial. There was no proof of any\u2014the answer contained no allegation of paying money into court. Such tender cannot be available unless defendant pay money into court and allege that fact in his answer <em>(Becker </em>agt. <em>Boon et al., </em>61 <em>N. Y., </em>317, 321; <em>Simpson </em>agt. <em>French, </em>25 <em>How. Pr., </em>464, 465; <em>Gray </em>agt. <em>Green, </em>9 <em>Hun, </em>339; <em>Eddy </em>agt. <em>O'Hara, </em>14 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number><em>Wend., </em>221). <em>(c.) </em>And an answer omitting this allegation does not state facts sufficient to constitute a defense, and plaintiff may avail himself of the objection on the trial <em>(Becker </em>agt. <em>Boon, supra), (d.) </em>Plaintiff does not waive his right to insist on the objection by going to trial where there are other issues in the answer <em>(Becker </em>agt. <em>Boon, supra). </em>The cases of <em>Sheridan </em>agt. <em>Smith </em>(2 <em>Hill, </em>538), and <em>Knight </em>agt. <em>Beach </em>(7 <em>Abb. Pr. [new </em>series], 241), do' not interfere with this position, because in <em>Sheridan </em>agt. <em>Smith </em>the plaintiff took issue by reply upon the tender, and case is put upon that point, and in <em>Knight </em>agt. <em>Beach </em>the answer only contained one defense, viz.: tender, and the decision there is put on that ground, <em>(e.) </em>Another fatal defect to the tender is that there is no allegation in the answer \u201c that defendant has at all times been ready to pay,\u201d nor was there any proof of that fact in the case <em>(Roosevelt </em>agt. <em>Bull\u2019s Head Bank, </em>45 <em>Barb., </em>579, 584; <em>Brooklyn Bank </em>agt. DeGraw, 23 <em>Wend., </em>342, 345; <em>Ayres </em>agt. <em>Pease, </em>12 <em>Wend.</em>, 393; <em>Wilder </em>agt. <em>Seelye, </em>8 <em>Barb., </em>408).</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b434-6\">III. Even if there were a discharge in bankruptcy fully pleaded and proved by defendant in this case, it would not discharge the debt in this ease ( <em>Whittaker </em>agt. <em>Chapman, </em>3 <em>Lans., </em>155; <em>In re Seymour, </em>6 <em>Int. Rev. Rec., </em>61; <em>Argall </em>agt. <em>Jacobs, </em>21 <em>Hun, </em>114 ; <em>Talcott </em>agt. <em>Harris, </em>18 <em>Hun, </em>567; <em>Libbey </em>agt. <em>Strasburger, </em>14 <em>Hun, </em>120; 12 <em>Hun, </em>658). <em>(a.) </em>A composition in bankruptcy is no more potent to bar creditors\u2019 rights to sue on -a debt than a discharge in brankruptcy <em>(Libbey </em>agt. <em>Strasburger, </em>14 <em>Hun, </em>120; <em>Ansonia. B. </em>&amp; <em>C. Co. </em>agt. <em>New Lamp Chimney Co., </em>53 <em>N. Y., </em>123).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b434-7\">Hardin, <em>J</em>.</author>\n<p id=\"A_K\">It was decided by this department in <em>Whittaker, treasurer, etc., </em>agt. <em>Chapman </em>(3 <em>Lansing, </em>155), that a debt due from a factor for goods sold by him on commission, is a debt created in a fiduciary character, within the meaning of the bankrupt act of 1867, and is not covered by the debtor\u2019s discharge in bankruptcy. This case'-has not been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>overruled. It has been referred to and approved by subsequent cases. It was quoted by Miller, J., in <em>Barber </em>agt. <em>Sterling </em>(68 <em>N. Y., </em>273; <em>see, also, </em>53 <em>N. Y., </em>260); <em>Platt </em>agt. <em>White </em>(5 <em>Denio, </em>271; 50 <em>Barb., </em>288; 70 <em>N. Y., </em>486). Section 5117 of the laws of the \u00a1Revised Statutes of United States is as follows, viz.: \u201cHo debt created by * * * the bankiupt <em>* </em>* * while acting in any fiduciary character shall be discharged by proceedings in bankruptcy.\u201d It has been held that the meaning of the words \u201cfiduciary capacity \u201d having been ascertained and declared by judicial construction of the act 1841, is affixed to the term, and the fixed definition is carried into the new statute 1867 (104 <em>Mass., </em>245). It was held in <em>Johns </em>agt. <em>Russell </em>(11 <em>B. R., </em>478), that an auctioneer acts in a fiduciary capacity, or character, and his discharge does not relieve him from his liability for goods placed in his charge for sale <em>(See Cardin </em>agt. <em>Cardin, </em>8 <em>Barb., </em>41, <em>and Hullibent </em>agt. <em>Carter, </em>10 <em>N. B. R., </em>359, <em>and </em>155 <em>Mass., </em>435 ; <em>Treadwell </em>agt. <em>Halloway, </em>12 <em>N. B. R., 61, and </em>46 <em>California, </em>547). The appellant\u2019s learned counsel cite <em>Hennequin et al. </em>agt. <em>Clews </em>(77 <em>N. Y., </em>427), and argues that it is an authority upholding a contrary doctrine. We do not so understand that case. The defendant had received certain securities as pledge, with no other rights with respect to them than such as that relation entitled him to\u2014and had wrongfully hypothecated and sold them.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">The court held that his discharge in bankruptcy operated upon the plaintiff\u2019s claim, and the defendant was not, after such a discharge, liable to an order of arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">Hor does the case of <em>Neal </em>agt. <em>Clark </em>(95 <em>U. S. R., </em>704), aid the appellant. The case simply holds that an executor who, without any positive, active, affirmative fraud, had committed a <em>devastavit, </em>was discharged in proceedings in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">Hor can the composition proceedings have any greater effect than would a discharge. If one would not cut off the debt, the other would not <em>(Libbey </em>agt. <em>Strasburger, </em>14 <em>Hun, </em>120; <em>Argall </em>agt. Jacobs, 21 <em>Hun, </em>115). The second defense predi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>cated upon a separate independent contract, was improperly stricken out <em>(Patterson </em>agt. <em>Richardson, </em>22 <em>Barb., </em>145; <em>Bank </em>agt. <em>Monteith, </em>39 <em>N. Y., </em>297; <em>Chambers </em>agt. <em>Lewis, </em>11 <em>Abbott, </em>110 ; <em>Allen </em>agt. <em>Patterson, </em>3 <em>Seldon, </em>476; 53 <em>N. Y., </em>307; 42 <em>N. Y., </em>83).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">There was evidence upon which the jury were warranted in finding there was no authority to sell upon credit, and there was no proof of a custom to sell on credit shown to have been known to plaintiff (50 <em>Barb., </em>288). We see no other error in the course of trial calling for a reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Judgment reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs to abide the event, unless the plaintiff stipulates to reduce the verdict and judgment by deducting therefrom twenty dollars and interest from the 30th day of \"November, 1873, in which case the judgment as so modified is affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">Taloott, P.
