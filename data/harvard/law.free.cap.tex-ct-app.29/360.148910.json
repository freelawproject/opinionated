Complaint \u2014 Jurat. \u2014 A jurat to a complaint must be signed officially by the officer administering the oath. A jurat signed \u201cWin Greer, J. P.,\u201d is invalid. Such signature does not designate the official character of the person signing. It might be inferred that the letters \u201c J. P.\u201d meant \"justice of the peace,\" but in criminal pleading inferences will not be indulged. If the signature had been \u201cWin Greer, J. P. Prec. No. \u2014, W. C.,\u201d indicating the county and precinct, it would doubtless have been held sufficient.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b382-10\">2.

It was alleged in said motion, and also proved, that the letters \u201cJ. P.\u201d after the name \u201cWin Greer\u201d in the jurat were placed there after the information had been presented, and without the knowledge or consent of the defendant. Said motion was overruled by the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b383-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number><em>W. J.

P.,\u201d on July 30, 1888.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Without contradiction it is made to appear by affidavits that the letters \u201cJ. P.\u201d were added to the name \u201cWin Greer\u201d subsequent to the January Term, 1889, of the County Court of Waller County, by some one unknown to appellant, and without his consent. As to who wrote the letters \u201cJ. P.\u201d in said complaint nothing is shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">Had the defective jurat been called to the attention of the court at the proper time, the officer who administered the oath to the affiant could have been permitted to <em>teste </em>said complaint by placing his jurat thereto. It would have been- but making the complaint speak the truth. This must be done at the proper time, and it could not be done after verdict. No one else could place the officer\u2019s jurat to the complaint but the officer swearing the affiant. This he did not do.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">But the addition of \u201c J. P.\u201d to the name \u201cWin Greer\u201d was not sufficient as a designation of official capacity. It might be inferred that \u201c J. P.\u201d was an abbreviation of \u201cjustice of the peace,\u201d but in criminal pleading inferences will not be indulged to supply such defects. Before this inference could be indulged the addition of the two letters signifying that he was such justice of the peace must be supplied legitimately. This was not done. In order to hold the complaint valid we must supply the defects by an inference based upon a proved forgery. This the courts will not do. If Win Greer was a justice of the peace in Waller County, he was also such justice in one of the precincts of said county. He should have signed the same officially, and so tested the same. Willson\u2019s Crim. \u00a1Stats., sec. 2714. If he had added to his signature the letters and figures \u201c J. P. Prec. No. \u2014, W. C.,\u201d indicating the county and precinct, this would have doubtless been sufficient to identify his official character.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">As the complaint is presented in the record it has no jurat to it, and \u201cwithout a jurat such complaint will not support an information.
