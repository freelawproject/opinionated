Seduction.\u2014\u201cSeduction\u201d means to \u201clead away\u201d a female from the path of \"virtue; to entice or persuade her by means of a promise of marri\u00e1ge to surrender her chastity, and have carnal intercourse with the man making such promise.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b476-13\">2. Same.\u2014To constitute the offense of seduction in this State it must appear that carnal intercourse with the female was accomplished by means of a promise to marry her made at the time of the illicit intercourse. Such promise and yielding her virtue in consequence thereof constitute the gist of the offense. If she at first resists, but .finally assents in reliance upon such promise, the offense is committed. The female must be seduced\u2014that is, corrupted, deceived, drawn aside from the path of virtue which she was pursuing; her affections must be gained, her mind and thoughts polluted; and she must be debauched\u2014that is, carnally known. She must be both seduced and debauched by means of the promise of marriage.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b477-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>3.

B. Putman, did seduce Amanda Bay, by a promise to marry her, and by means thereof did obtain and have carnal knowledge of her, the said Amanda Bay, and you further find that at the time said Amanda Bay was under the age of twenty-five years and was unmarried, you will find him guilty as charged, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-9\">\u201c To justify a conviction in this case you must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the carnal knowledge of Amanda Bay by defendant was first obtained by reason of a promise on his part to marry Amanda.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-10\">\u201cIf you are satisfied that such carnal knowledge was the result of mutual desires on the part of the defendant and Amanda Bay, and was had without any promise of marriage by defendant to Amanda, then the defendant, under the law, would not be guilty.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-11\">Ho bill of exception to the charge of the court appears, in the record, and it does not appear that any additional charge was requested by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-12\">The questions discussed in the opinion do not require a statement of the facts of the cause.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b477-13\"><em>W.

The court erred in failing to explain to the jury the definition and character of the crime of seduction and the meaning of the word \u201cseduce.\u201d Willson\u2019s Crim. Stats., sec. 1421; The State v. Reevis, 97 Mo., 668; Cole v. The State, 40 Texas, 147.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b477-14\">2. The court erred in instructing the jury that to justify a conviction they must be satisfied that a carnal knowledge of Amanda Bay by defendant was first obtained by reason of a promise to marry her, without reference to seduction. The idea of seduction is omitted from the charge, and the jury are in effect told that they must convict the defendant if he had carnal knowledge of Amanda Bay by a promise to marry. They are told in effect that if she consented to grant a present favor to defendant in consideration of his future marriage with her, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>his carnal knowledge of her would be seduction. This would be hire or salary, not seduction. The State v. Reeves, 10 Am. St. Rep., 349; The State v. Patterson, 88 Mo., 88.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-3\">3. The court erred in instructing the jury that if the carnal knowledge was the result of mutual desire, and was had without any promise of marriage, the defendant would not be guilty. If the carnal knowledge was the result of mutual desire there was no seduction, although there was a promise to marry. The People v. Clark, 33 Mich., 112; Bewers v. State, 29 Ohio St., 542.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b478-4\"><em>R. H. Harrison, </em>Assistant Attorney-General, for the State.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b478-5\">WHITE, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Ab-\">This prosecution and conviction in the court below was for the crime of seduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Our statutory provisions, in so far as they are involved in the questions submitted on the appeal here presented, are: \u201cIf any person by promise to marry shall seduce an unmarried female under the age of twenty-five years, and shall have carnal knowledge of such female, he shall be punished by imprisonment in the penitentiary not less than two nor more than five years, or by fine not exceeding $5000.\u201d Penal Code, art. 814.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">\u201cThe term 'seduction\u2019 is used in the sense in which it is commonly understood.\u201d Penal Code, art. 815.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">Mr. Webster defines \u201cseduction\u201d to be \u201cthe act of seducing or of enticing from the path of duty; specifically the act or crime of persuading a female to surrender her chastity. 2. That which seduces or is adapted or employed to seduce; means of leading estray,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">The word \u201cseduction\u201d is derived from two Latin words, <em>se, </em>which means \u201caway,\u201d and <em>duoe, </em>which means \u201cto lead;\u201d and together they mean \u201cto lead away.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">\u201cSeduction,\u201d then, implies that the female is led away from the paths of rectitude and virtue, and induced to indulge in carnal intercourse by the means used. '' Generally, in order to establish the charge of seduction it must be made to appear that the intercourse was accomplished by some artifice or deception; and it is held that something more than a mere appeal to the lust or passion of the woman must be shown before the law will inflict the penalty prescribed for that crime.\u201d The State v. Fitzgerald, 63 Iowa, 268.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">Our statute expressly provides that the seduction must be accomplished by means of a \u201cpromise to marry.\u201d As was said in The People v. De Fore, 64 Michigan, 693 (8 Amer. St. Rep., 863): \u201cUnder this statute the offense is committed if the man has carnal intercourse to which the woman assented, if such assent was obtained by a promise of marriage made by the man at the time, and to which without such promise she would not have yielded. (The People v. Millspaugh, 11 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>Mich., 278.) The offense consists in enticing a woman from the path of virtue, and obtaining her consent to illicit intercourse by promises made at the time. The promise and yielding her virtue in consequence thereof is the gist of the offense. If she resists, but finally assents or yields thereto in reliance upon the promise made, the offense is committed.\u201d Boyce v. The People, 55 N. Y., 644.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-3\">Mr. Bishop, in his work upon Statutory Crimes, p. 638, second edition, says: \u201cThough the parties are already under marriage engagement, if the woman yields, not by reason of the man\u2019s promise of marriage, but simply for the gratification of a criminal desire, he does not commit the offense, yet the subsistence of the engagement does not render his act less a crime if she submits from reliance thereon.\u201d In the words of Bleckley, J. (58 Ga., 328): \u201cTo make love to a woman, woo her, make honorable proposals of marriage, have them accepted, and afterward undo her under a solemn repetition of the engagement vow, is to employ persuasion as well as promise of marriage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Under a statute quite similar to ours, where the language of the statute was, \u201cIf any person shall, under promise of marriage, seduce and debauch any unmarried female,\u201d etc., the Supreme Court of Missouri, in an able opinion by Sherwood, J., says: \u201cThere are two steps necessary to be taken in order to consummate the crime under discussion. First, the female must be seduced\u2014that is, corrupted, deceived, drawn aside from the path of virtue which she was pursuing; her affections must be gained, her mind and thoughts polluted; and second, in order to complete the offense, she must be debauched\u2014that is, she must be \u25a0 carnally known before the guilty agent becomes answerable to human laws.\u201d Thus it will be seen that a female may be seduced without being debauched, or debauched without being seduced. A similar view of the proper construction of a statute substantially identical with our own was taken in Pennsylvania in Commonwealth v. McCarty, 2 Clark, 135, and cited with approval in The State v. Patterson, 88 Missouri, 88; The State v. Beeves, 97 Missouri, 668.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">In the State v. Patterson, 88 Missouri, supra, we find a definition of the statutory word \u201cseduce,\u201d which commends itself to our minds as eminently correct. It is as follows: \u201cThe word \u2018seduce,\u2019 though a general term and having a variety of meanings according to the subject to which it is applied, has, when it is used with reference to the conduct of a man toward a female, a precise and determinate signification, and is universally understood to mean an enticement of her on his part to surrender her chastity by means of some art, influence, promise, or deception calculated to accomplish that object, and to include the yielding of her person to him as much as if it was expressly stated.\u201d Citing The State v. Bierce, 22 Conn., 319; Dinkey v. The Commonwealth. 17 Pa. St. 319.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>As is pertinently said in The State v. Beeves, <em>supra: </em>\u201cBo one can with any degree of plausibility contend that a virtuous female could be seduced without any of those arts, wiles, and blandishments so necessary to win the hearts of the weaker sex. To say that such a one was seduced by simply a blunt offer of wedlock <em>in futuro </em>in exchange for sexual favors <em>in praesenti, </em>is an announcement that smacks too much of bargain and barter and not enough of betrayal. \u2019Tis hire or salary, not seduction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-3\">In his charge to the jury in the case in hand the learned trial judge did not sufficiently submit to the jury the law of seduction as it is well settled and established in accordance with the principles above announced. There was no explanation whatever of the legal term \u201cseduction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">In Cole v. The State, 40 Texas, 147, Moore, J., says: \u201cThe charge of the court would have been more satisfactory if the inducement to commit the unlawful act with the defendant had been more fully explained. The jury might not have understood fully the nature of the accusation and the facts that must be proved to warrant a conviction. The term \u201cseduction,\u201d when used in the sense in which it is commonly understood, does not convey the full meaning of the offense which is intended to be punished by the code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">That case was reversed for defects in the charge. The charge of the court in this case is objectionable for errors of omission to the same extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Because the charge of the court failed to submit sufficiently the law applicable t\u00f3 the case, the judgment is reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">Judges all present and concurring.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
