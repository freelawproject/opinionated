That the several signatures to the note were in the proper hand-writing of the defendants respectively. 2. That Jacob Sisson paid to the holder of the note, upon his request, the sum of \u00a71122,50 on the 1st of October, 1847, and that the amount of his claim against the defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>at the time' of the trial, for principal and interest, was $ 1215,22, being one-half the note; and that on the same day, but a little time after, Caleb D. Barrett paid to the holder the sum of $&gt;1122,50, being the other half. 3. That the said Caleb D. Barrett was a surety for Edward L.

Barrett the first signer. The jury have found, by the special verdict, that Caleb D. Barrett was a surety for Edward L. Barrett. Sisson, the third signer, added to his signature the word \u201c surety.\u201d There is nothing else to show the understanding of the parties, or the circumstances under which their respective signatures were made. The single question then arises, upon this state of facts, whether the legal effect of the word \u201c surety,\u201d added to the plaintiff\u2019s name, constitutes him a surety, as to <em>both of </em>the previous signers, or a <em>co-surety </em>with Caleb for the real principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">We have come to the conclusion that this addition of \u201csurety\u201d does not materially affect the rights of the parties. This seems to follow from the established doctrine that the question of suretiship is a question of fact open to parol proof; and although all the signers may be liable to a bona fide holder of the paper, their rights as between each other, may be varied by extrinsic evidence. Although, therefore, this addition would as a <em>matter of evidence, </em>establish the fact that the plaintiff was a surety, it can not, by any means, preclude any other signer from proving the same fact in regard to himself, in the ordinary way; and when the fact is thus found by the jury, the two sureties stand upon the same footing. The effect of the plaintiff\u2019s precaution in this cause, is to dispense with the necessity of proving <em>aliunde </em>the fact of his being surety. Caleb Barrett not having taken the same precaution, was compelled to resort to his proof before a jury. The verdict has annexed the word <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>surety to his name, and the two stand now on the footing of <em>cosureties. </em>We do not mean to say that the plaintiff could not have guarded himself against his liability as a co-surety by adding to his signature an express declaration that he signed as surety for all the previous signers, as was done in <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Warner, </em>(13 <em>Wend. </em>400;) nor that he might not have recovered against Caleb Barrett by showing a state of facts by which it should appear positively, or by legal intendment, that he intended, as to the plaintiff, to stand in the character of principal, according to the case of <em>Warner </em>v. <em>Price, </em>(3 <em>Wend. </em>397.) But the present case does not come within either of the principles adverted to. It presents a bare struggle between two sureties, in which one seeks to charge the other with the whole payment, without showing any thing, beyond the face of the paper, that tends to establish any other relationship between them than that of co-sureties. We think he can not recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Judgment for defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
