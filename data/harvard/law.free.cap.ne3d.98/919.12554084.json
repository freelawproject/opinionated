For the reasons set forth below, we reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Grabowski and his girlfriend, Janice Malishefski (\"Malishefski\") were both charged with one count of first-degree misdemeanor assault in Garfield Heights Municipal Court. These assault charges stemmed from an alleged physical confrontation between Grabowski and Malishefski over a text message Grabowski received, which Malishefski thought was from another woman. They each made separate 911 calls to report the other for assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On April 4, 2016, Grabowski, without the benefit of counsel, entered a no contest plea to an amended charge of disorderly conduct, a fourth-degree misdemeanor. On the same day, he was sentenced to 30 days in jail, which the court suspended, fined $150, assessed court costs, and was placed on one year of inactive probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On April 29, 2016, Grabowski filed a motion to vacate or withdraw his no contest plea and sentence under Crim.R. 32.1. The trial court ordered briefing on Grabowski's motion and scheduled a hearing. The court held a hearing and denied Grabowski's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} It is from this judgment that Grabowski now appeals, raising the following assignment of error for review.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Assignment of Error\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The trial court abused its discretion in failing to correct a manifest injustice by denying [Grabowski's] motion to withdraw his formerly entered [no contest] plea.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In May 2017, we sua sponte ordered the parties to address the issue of the trial court's acceptance of Grabowski's no contest plea without first advising him of his right to counsel and obtaining his waiver of counsel. In the supplemental brief on this issue, Grabowski raises the following additional assignment of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Supplemental Assignment of Error\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The trial court erred to the prejudice of [Grabowski] in accepting his plea of [no contest] prior to advising him of his right to counsel so that his [no contest] plea was not knowing, intelligent and voluntary.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 7} We will first consider Grabowski's supplemental assignment of error because we find it dispositive of this appeal. While the parties were ordered to brief the issue of the trial court's failure to advise Grabowski of his right to counsel prior to accepting his no contest plea, both of the parties addressed whether the trial court\n   complied with Crim.R. 11(E). We also note that Grabowski did not directly appeal his conviction and sentence, but rather filed a postsentence motion to withdraw his plea with the trial court within the time frame that he could have filed a direct appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 8} In this supplemental assignment of error, Grabowski argues the trial court erred in failing to advise him of his right to counsel prior to taking his uncounseled plea. Grabowski also argues that \"there was not * * * substantial compliance with the requirements of [ Crim.R. 11 ]\" and \"it appears there was no compliance [with Crim.R. 11 ] at all\" when the trial court accepted his plea. We agree that the trial court erred in accepting his uncounseled no contest plea without first advising him of his right to counsel and obtaining his written waiver of counsel on the record. We also find that his plea is invalid because the trial court failed to advise him of the effect of his no contest plea as required by Crim.R. 11(E).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Crim.R. 32.1 provides that \"to correct manifest injustice[,] the court may set aside the judgment of conviction and permit the defendant to withdraw his or her plea.\" A \"manifest injustice\" is defined as a clear or openly unjust act.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

GALLAGHER, J., DISSENTING:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 27} I respectfully dissent. After oral argument, we directed the parties \"to address the issue of the trial court's acceptance of Grabowski's guilty plea without first advising Grabowski of his right to counsel.\" The city responded by referencing Grabowski's March 30, 2016 signed acknowledgment of being advised in open court of his right to be represented by an attorney in the proceeding. The change of plea hearing occurred on April 4, 2016, and therefore, the city satisfied any concern with respect to notifying Grabowski of his right to counsel before he pleaded no contest to the charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 28} At the change of plea hearing, the trial court went through most of Grabowski's rights a second time before orally asking for his plea-the trial court had inadvertently missed the right to counsel. Immediately after Grabowski announced his intention to plead no contest, however, the trial court handed him a \"change of plea\" form, which detailed all the rights Grabowski sacrificed in pleading no contest, and the trial court orally advised Grabowski of his right to counsel. Grabowski signed the form, formally pleaded no contest, and acknowledged for at least the second time in writing that he had been advised of his right to counsel. He also affirmatively waived his right to counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 29} During the hearing on his motion to withdraw the plea, Grabowski conceded that he was not challenging any procedural aspects of the change of plea hearing. Tr. 5:17-23. This would include a concession as to whether Grabowski was advised of the effects of the no-contest plea. Thus, the only issue preserved was Grabowski's uncounseled plea.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%20691406\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Grabowski claimed that had he retained counsel, the attorney would have conducted discovery to find that the allegations in the complaint were unfounded. Evidently, the other person involved in the scuffle that led to the disorderly conduct charge recanted after Grabowski pleaded no contest. The trial court concluded that Grabowski was aware of what occurred during the incident giving rise to the complaint and, therefore, Grabowski failed to demonstrate a manifest injustice. The trial court correctly defined \"manifest injustice\" as a fundamental flaw in the proceedings, which results in a miscarriage of justice.\n   <em>\n    State v. Lintner\n   </em>\n   , 7th Dist.

When a convicted offender files a motion to withdraw a plea after the sentence is imposed, a trial court is required to determine whether withdrawing the plea would correct a manifest injustice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7. The majority does not find error with the denial of the motion to withdraw the plea, but\n   instead finds error in the trial court accepting the no contest plea because it was not voluntarily, knowingly, or intelligently entered. In other words, the majority is applying the standard of review for an offender seeking to withdraw his plea before the sentence is imposed.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v.

This is not an extraordinary circumstance, nor has Grabowski explained how it could be considered as such. Grabowski acknowledged his being advised of all the rights he sacrificed in pleading no contest on at least two occasions, and on a third occasion, the trial court orally advised him of all but his right to counsel, before the change of plea was formally entered. Further, Grabowski conceded that there were no procedural flaws in the change of plea process. There is no manifest injustice, and I would affirm.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
