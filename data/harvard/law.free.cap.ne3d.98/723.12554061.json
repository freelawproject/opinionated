Because the case originated in a local criminal court and the proceedings were not transcribed by a court stenographer, the appeal was not properly taken due to the failure to serve or file an affidavit of errors (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   CPL 460.10[3] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Chief Judge DiFiore and Judges Rivera, Stein, Fahey, Garcia, Wilson and Feinman concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
