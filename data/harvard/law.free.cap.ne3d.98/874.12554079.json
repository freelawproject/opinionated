Johnson, on Sericola's claims arising from alleged legal malpractice. The issues to be determined by this court are whether summary judgment is proper in a legal malpractice case when the damages that occurred were a result of actions taken by the plaintiff rather than the attorney, and whether the trial court abuses its discretion in denying a motion to reconsider the denial of the plaintiff's request for summary judgment when the evidence supports granting the defendant's motion for summary judgment. For the following reasons, we affirm the decision of the lower court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Sericola was previously involved in litigation in Trumbull County Court of Common Pleas Case No. 2011 CV 1717, where he was represented by appellee, Attorney Robert Johnson. The case related to Sericola's alleged involvement in running a Ponzi scheme and defrauding plaintiffs out of their investments. In that matter, summary judgment was granted against Sericola and he purportedly entered into a settlement agreement in March 2013 to sign over an annuity worth approximately $328,000 in exchange for a release of all claims. On April 24, 2013, at a hearing on a motion to enforce the settlement agreement, Sericola signed an Agreed Judgment Entry to give up that annuity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Sericola subsequently filed an appeal with this court, which held that the settlement constituted a waiver of \"the right to appeal any issues other than those related to the formation or acceptance of the settlement.\"\n   <em>\n    Carbone v.

These arose from allegations that Johnson failed to provide competent representation in the aforementioned legal proceedings. Among Sericola's complaints were Johnson's failure to file various motions and responses, as well as the failure to communicate with Sericola. Sericola alleged that Johnson\n   \"fraudulently advise[d]\" him to settle without disclosing that summary judgment had already been granted and agreed to a settlement without Sericola's consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On June 12, 2014, Johnson's counsel filed a Notice of Appearance and Request for Leave to Plead. On June 20, 2014, Sericola filed an Application for Default Judgment. The trial court issued a Judgment Entry on July 17, 2014, granting Johnson's Request for Leave, with the Application for Default Judgment rendered moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Johnson filed an Answer on July 22, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Sericola filed a Motion for Admission of Facts Per Rule 36 on May 20, 2015, arguing that certain facts should be deemed admitted due to Johnson's failure to respond to discovery requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On June 26, 2015, Sericola filed a Motion for Summary Judgment. Attached to the Motion was Sericola's affidavit, in which he averred that Johnson did not communicate with him about possible defenses, did not inform him that the court had granted summary judgment against him, told him that the case could not be won, and agreed to sign over the annuity against Sericola's wishes. The affidavit also explained that Sericola later signed over the annuity during an April 2013 hearing at which the \"magistrate * * * told [Sericola] that [he] would be sanctioned if [he] did not sign over the annuity.\" Sericola stated that, as a result of this, he has \"been in serious emotional distress over [his] finances.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Johnson filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on June 29, 2015, attached to which was his affidavit, in which he averred that he had been in repeated contact with Sericola during the prior proceedings, that he had advised Sericola of the motion for summary judgment, that Sericola refused to comply with requests for information to defend the motion for summary judgment, that he discussed settlement with Sericola based upon factors including his violation of a preliminary injunction, and that Sericola had orally agreed to the settlement. Also attached was an April 24, 2013 Agreed Judgment Entry in 2011 CV 1717, signed by Sericola, in which he agreed to settle the matter and sign over his annuity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On July 22, 2015, the trial court issued a Judgment Entry granting Johnson's Motion for Summary Judgment and denying Sericola's Motion for Summary Judgment, finding no genuine issue of material fact existed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Sericola appealed to this court in\n   <em>\n    Sericola v.

This court held that the trial court had failed to give Sericola proper notice of a hearing date for Johnson's Motion for Summary Judgment and reversed in part and remanded \"to give Sericola notice of the date of the hearing on Johnson's Motion for Summary Judgment (whether it be oral or non-oral) and to allow him time to respond to the Motion prior to that date.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 12} On April 26, 2016, Sericola filed a Motion for Summary Judgment, which states that it is a \"Response to Johnson's Motion for Summary Judgment that was filed on June 29, 2015.\" Attached was an affidavit containing the same averments outlined above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 13} On April 28, 2016, Sericola filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the July 22, 2015 Judgment Entry as it related to the denial of his Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The trial court issued a May 19, 2016 Judgment Entry, in which it denied Sericola's Motion for Reconsideration, given\n   this court's reversal of the July 22, 2015 Judgment Entry. As to summary judgment, it found that \"Sericola entered into a settlement agreement with the Plaintiffs in the first litigation on the sound advice of his legal counsel. Sericola then terminated his legal counsel and again entered into the same agreement of his own free will and volition and without any undue influence.\" The court noted that prior attempts to invalidate the settlement had been denied by the trial court and the appellate court, and Sericola's suggestion that the magistrate \"strong arm[ed]\" Sericola into signing an Agreed Judgment Entry was false. Finding that there were no genuine issues of material fact under dispute, the court granted Johnson's Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Sericola timely appeals and raises the following assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 16} \"[1.] The trial court for the Trumbull County Court of Common Pleas erred in denying Sericola's Motion for Reconsideration of the denial of Sericola's Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 17} \"[2.] The trial court for the Trumbull County Court of Common Pleas erred in granting a motion for summary judgment in favor of the defendant.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 18} For ease of discussion, we will address Sericola's assignments of error in reverse order. In his second assignment of error, Sericola argues that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in Johnson's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Pursuant to Civil Rule 56(C), summary judgment is proper when (1) the evidence shows \"that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact\" to be litigated, (2) \"the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law,\" and (3) \"it appears from the evidence * * * that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, that party being entitled to have the evidence * * * construed most strongly in the party's favor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 20} A trial court's decision to grant summary judgment is reviewed by an appellate court under a de novo standard of review.\n   <em>\n    Grafton v.

Sericola's and Johnson's affidavits present conflicting versions of the events, including whether Johnson was truthful in his assertions that he discussed the summary judgment motion and the court's ruling on the motion with Sericola, and whether Johnson misrepresented Sericola's intention to settle. Generally, \"[i]n the summary judgment process, when a genuine issue of fact is presented by conflicting affidavits, the trial court must reserve its judgment on the credibility of the affiants by setting the matter for trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Scott\n   </em>\n   , 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 26552,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015-Ohio-3269\">\n    2015-Ohio-3269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204873000\">\n    2015 WL 4873000\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 26. Thus, it would be improper at this stage to grant summary judgment solely on the grounds that Johnson has denied the allegations about his conduct made by Sericola. As is evident from further review, however, these factual disputes are solely on issues unnecessary for proper resolution of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 27} For the Malpractice, Fraud/Misrepresentation, and Breach of Fiduciary Duty claims, a critical element that must be proven to prevail is that Johnson's conduct, even when viewed in a light most favorable to Sericola, caused the damages that he requests. Sericola contends that Johnson's conduct caused him to sign over his annuity. A review of the undisputed facts, however, supports a conclusion that Johnson's conduct did not cause the damage/loss requested by Sericola.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 28} In March 2013, the possibility of settlement in 2011 CV 1717 was discussed. Both parties state in their affidavits that there was an agreement communicated to the plaintiffs that Sericola would sign over his annuity. Sericola's affidavit indicated that he told Johnson he did not want to do so but that Johnson \"went ahead and agreed for me to sign over the annuity against [my] wishes.\" Johnson's affidavit indicates that, following settlement discussions in March, \"the trial court was advised of all of the details of the settlement agreement and a signed entry by the parties was to be submitted to the court,\" however, Sericola did not agree to sign it. \"Upon [Sericola] refusing to sign the settlement agreement, a request to enforce settlement agreement was filed.\" On the date that the enforceability of the settlement was set for a hearing, April 24, 2013, Sericola signed an Agreed Judgment Entry, in which he agreed to surrender his annuity to settle the claims against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 29} As this court held in\n   <em>\n    Carbone\n   </em>\n   , at the time Sericola signed that Agreed Judgment\n   Entry, he \"affirmatively stated that he understood the settlement terms and that settlement was of his own free will.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014-Ohio-3526\">\n    2014-Ohio-3526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204057429\">\n    2014 WL 4057429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Considering these facts, which are not disputed in the opposing affidavits, it cannot be determined that Johnson was responsible for the signing over of the annuity. Sericola, after indicating displeasure and concern with Johnson's representation, had terminated him at the time he signed the April 24 Agreed Judgment Entry. Sericola did not show that the court would have enforced the settlement agreement at that hearing, had he himself not decided to sign the Agreed Judgment Entry. Sericola chose to do this on his own, while no longer represented by Johnson, and that Judgment Entry resulted in Sericola's liability. In March 2013, when the parties apparently reached an agreement but Sericola did not sign it, the plaintiffs properly requested that the court enforce settlement and, the court was entitled to determine whether that agreement was enforceable. In such circumstances, the trial court could have and would have considered whether the parties had actually even agreed to a settlement, as well as evaluating \"whether the parties' expressions are uncertain due to or 'in light of accompanying factors and circumstances' arising in the particular case.\"\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

Such distress, even if present, was not adequately linked to the alleged actions of Johnson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Sericola argues that the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Johnson was based on the prior settlement rather than the issues raised in his response to Johnson's Motion for Summary Judgment. For the reasons outlined above, the settlement was a relevant consideration in determining whether a grant of summary judgment was proper in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Sericola also contends that Johnson's affidavit supporting summary judgment was in conflict with \"facts already admitted by him\" due to his failure to respond to requests for admissions in the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 36} A review of the record shows that on May 20, 2015, Sericola filed a Motion for Admission of Facts Per Rule 36, in which he alleged that he received no response to a Request for Admissions sent to Johnson's attorney. He also raised this issue in his summary judgment pleadings. The trial court ruled that it would \"not allow a procedural mechanism in the Civil Rules to rewrite history in favor of Sericola under these circumstances.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Even if, for the sake of argument, we concluded that these facts were admitted, it would not change the result in this case. None of the alleged admissions relate to the facts necessary to reach a determination that summary judgment was warranted given the lack of a relationship between Johnson's alleged conduct and the \"injury\" of Sericola signing over his annuity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 38} The second assignment of error is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 39} In his first assignment of error, Sericola argues that the trial court improperly rejected his Motion for Reconsideration of the judgment denying his Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 40} \"It is well established that the filing of a motion for reconsideration from a final order in the trial court is a nullity.\"\n   <em>\n    Kuss v.
