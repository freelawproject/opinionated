Schlabach contends that the trial court erred by considering parol evidence, and applying the wrong statute of limitations, which resulted in an erroneous disposition of the parties' cross motions for summary judgment. Although the trial court erred in considering parol evidence, it nonetheless correctly concluded that Schlabach's claims against Appellees are time barred. Thus, for the following reasons, the trial court's summary judgment in favor of Appellees is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In 1982, the Berrys entered into an oil and gas lease with Floyd Kimble, encumbering 957 acres of their property. The oil and gas lease contained an initial ten-year term, which continues in perpetuity so long as oil and gas or their constituents exist in paying quantities on the property. Wells on the property are producing in paying quantities. Pertinent to this appeal the lease, in addition to royalties, provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   The Lessor has the right to approve the location of all wells, tanks, pipelines and roadways. Lessee will utilize Lessor's equipment wherever possible to do reclamation work. Lessor will receive sufficient free gas for one dwelling for each well drilled.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In 1985, Kimble executed a cancellation and release of the oil and gas lease on the Berry property, with the exception of three tracts of land, which, in 1999, Mrs. Berry transferred 160 acres of those tracts to Schlabach. The record demonstrates and the parties do not dispute that Mrs. Berry transferred both the surface and mineral rights to Schlabach, subject to the oil and gas lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Within a year, Schlabach subdivided his property and entered into purchase agreements with various individuals, including the Sinclairs, on June 23, 2000, and the Mackos on September 30, 2000. Both the Sinclairs and the Mackos executed identical one-page form purchase agreements, which read, in pertinent part, \"8.\n   <strong>\n    ALL MINERAL RIGHTS\n   </strong>\n   shall pass to\n   <strong>\n    BUYER\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <strong>\n    SELLER\n   </strong>\n   reserves rights to any existing leases.\" (Emphasis in original)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} In 2010 or 2011, Schlabach realized that he might have the right to collect royalties under the lease, and discovered that the reservation of rights in the lease provided for in the purchase agreements had been omitted from the Sinclair and Macko deeds as well as some but not all of the other deeds. Schlabach initially asked the purchasers to voluntarily reform the deeds and some agreed. Because Appellees refused to do so voluntarily, Schlabach filed an equitable action for deed reformation based upon mutual mistake on July 16, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} During discovery, Schlabach provided conflicting testimony regarding the rights he intended to reserve in the Sinclair and Macko purchase agreements. When asked to describe those rights at his deposition, he responded \"All the rights that go with an oil and gas lease; location of wells, amending, future unitization for different formations, I guess. And there is a royalty percentage.\" However, later in his testimony, Schlabach was asked if he intend to reserve the same rights in both the Sinclair and another agreement wherein he reserved the right to royalties and other types of payment. He responded yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} In resolving the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment, the trial court relied on Schlabach's statement to conclude that the Sinclair and Macko agreements reserved only the right to royalties. As a result, the trial court reasoned Schlabach's claim was to recover personal property interests, governed by the ten-year statute of limitations in R.C. 2305.14. The trial court rejected Schlabach's argument that he retained something greater than the right to royalties in the purchase agreements; specifically, \"the right to approve the location of all wells, tanks, pipelines and roadways.\" He posits that this constitutes an interest in land and thus the 21 year statute of limitation in R.C. 2305.04 controls. Neither party disputes that the execution of the deeds on July 30, 2000 (the Sinclairs) and November 8, 2000 (the Mackos), started running the limitations clock.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Parol Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 8} We will review Schlabach's assigned errors out of order and his second and third together for clarity of analysis, which assert respectively:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The trial court erred in relying upon evidence outside the four corners of the parties' unambiguous purchase and sale agreement to determine its meaning.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The trial court erred by basing its summary judgment upon a certain statement made within a deposition and ignoring other statements made on the same issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 9} An appellate court reviews de novo a trial court's decision to grant summary judgment, using the same Civ.R. 56(C) standards as the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Grafton v.

In order to apply the correct statute of limitations, the trial court had to determine the nature of the interest reserved by Schlabach in the purchase agreements. In doing so, the trial court relied on extrinsic evidence, which Schlabach contends was erroneous because the terms of the purchase agreements were unambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Courts presume that the intent of the parties to a contract resides in the language they chose to employ.\n   <em>\n    Kelly v.

Further, the alleged mutual mistake is that Schlabach's reservation of rights were\n   <em>\n    omitted in the deeds\n   </em>\n   , not that those rights were mistakenly\n   <em>\n    included in the purchase agreements\n   </em>\n   . As there is no ambiguity in section eight and no assertion of mutual mistake with respect to its inclusion in the purchase agreements, what Schlabach allegedly told Appelles about section eight is parol evidence which cannot be considered, and is irrelevant.

Schlabach's right is not personal; So long as the lease is in effect, his rights are assignable. Had the language from the purchase agreements been included in the deeds, there is no question that purchasers would take the land subject to Schlabach's right to approve the location of all wells, tanks, pipelines and roadways.

Nonetheless, the trial court correctly entered summary judgment in favor of Appellees and denied Schlabach's motion for summary judgment as this action is time barred by R.C. 2304.14. Because this deed reformation case is not an action to recover title to or possession of real property, R.C. 2305.04 does not apply. Accordingly, the judgment entry of the trial court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Donofrio, J., concurs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Waite, J., concurs.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
