Payne, appeals from the judgment entry of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas granting summary judgment in favor of defendants-appellees, Ohio Performance Academy, Inc. (\"OPA\"), VV Venue, LLC (\"VV Venue\"), and Vaud-Villities Productions, Inc. (\"VVP\"). For the following reasons, we affirm the decision of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Unless otherwise noted, the following facts are undisputed. VV Venue owns the real estate and facility at 4411 Tamarack Boulevard in Columbus, Ohio that houses the Northland Performing Arts Center (\"NPAC\"). The NPAC building includes the Black Box Theater. OPA holds a long-term lease with VV Venue and rents the space out for performances and other events.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Pertinent to this appeal, on March 12, 2014, OPA entered into a rental agreement with the Columbus Dance Theater (\"CDT\") for a one-time performance. According to the rental agreement between OPA and CDT, CDT director Tim Veach rented the Black Box Theater, green room, and lobby from OPA for a performance to occur on April 12, 2014. OPA designated itself as \"landlord\" within the agreement, and Scott Jones, an independent contractor hired by OPA to handle rentals at the NPAC facility, signed on OPA's behalf. (Rental Agreement at 6.) VV Venue and VVP were not parties to the rental agreement. The rental term included the performance day and the day prior to the event, Friday, April 11, 2014, for rehearsal and room set-up. Under the terms of the agreement, CDT was permitted to occupy and make reasonable use of the premises for the purpose of the event and such systems and equipment identified in the agreement. The \"[s]ystems\" identified in the agreement are:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \u2022 Standard Stage Layout (No Runway), Standard Sound and Lights, Wireless microphones\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \u2022 Standard Seating on risers\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u2022 (21) 60? Rnd. 8 Top Tables with white full length table cloth\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 CD Play, Projectors/Screens\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 Kitchen access for caterer\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 Sound and lighting engineers for event\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 Black Box Theater lights adjusted for banquet seating by NPAC\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 Tiktz.com\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (Rental Agreement at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The rental agreement states that CDT was subject to all OPA policies applicable to use of the premises and was obligated to comply with all reasonable requests by OPA's staff and personnel. OPA was responsible for utilities and alcohol sales for the event. The agreement further indicates that CDT inspected the premises, fixtures, and any systems it will use, and acknowledges that they are in a reasonable and acceptable condition for CDT's intended use. CDT agreed, under a \"disclaimer, limitation of liability and indemnification\" clause, that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [T]he Premises and use of any systems or Services provided hereunder are provided on an \"AS IS, WHERE IS\" basis, and that Landlord, its officers, employees, agents, successors and assigns make no warranty or representation as to their condition or suitability for Renter's purpose(s) and shall have no liability whatsoever for any damage or injury to Renter, its guests or invitees, that may arise directly or indirectly under this Agreement or from the use of the Premise and any systems or Services provided hereunder. Further, except where specifically provided otherwise in this agreement, landlord has no obligation and is not responsible to provide any labor, services, systems, equipment or property for any purpose (for setup, teardown, use of systems and equipment, or otherwise) and shall bear no responsibility whatsoever for any services, systems, equipment or property volunteered for the benefit of Renter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (Emphasis sic.) (Rental Agreement at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On April 11, 2014, set-up and rehearsal day, OPA provided an elevated\n   modular stage comprised of panels sitting on frames, along with movable stairs two-to-three steps high, a mid-stage curtain, and a curtain behind the stage that covers the back wall. With this set up, when the general and work lights are off, the backstage area behind the mid-stage curtain is completely dark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Jones and Veach were present for rehearsal. According to Veach, when he arrived for rehearsal he noticed that no \"[g]low [t]ape,\" tape that glows in the dark, was placed on the edge of the backstage, so he requested glow tape from someone who he believed to be a part of OPA's crew. (Veach Dep. at 22.) Veach agreed that he assumed glow tape was then put down when he saw people move. However, the parties do not dispute that glow tape was not applied along the edge of the stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Appellant, who CDT had hired as the featured performer as an independent contractor, arrived for rehearsal, walked up onto the stage by using a few steps, and sat at a piano situated at the front of the stage. For the first 30 to 45 minutes, appellant worked with the sound engineer, a time in which the curtain to backstage was open. At one point during the rehearsal, the curtain was closed and Veach instructed appellant to go backstage in order to practice her entrance from behind the curtain. Appellant moved from her piano, which was still in the light, through the curtain to backstage, which was \"[t]otally dark\"-she could not see anything-intending to wait there until her name was called. (Payne Dep. at 51.) According to appellant, this was the first time she had been behind the curtain, but she was not surprised that it was dark backstage based on her prior general experience in theater. After a few steps behind the curtain, appellant states she did not see glow tape and therefore assumed she was safe, so she turned to face stage front. While doing so, her right foot went to the side and off the edge of the stage, and appellant fell the down stairs sustaining injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On May 1, 2015, appellant filed a complaint against appellees and CDT alleging causes of action of premises liability and respondeat superior. On June 2, 2015, CDT answered and filed a cross-claim against appellees for indemnity and contribution, and several days later, appellees answered and filed a cross-claim for breach of contract, indemnification, and contribution against CDT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On February 5, 2016, appellees filed a motion for summary judgment as to the claims raised by appellant based on darkness as an open and obvious hazard and the \"step-in-the-dark\" rule, and a motion for summary judgment as to CDT's cross-claim. (Mot. For Summ. Jgmt. at 8.) Appellant filed a memorandum contra on February 24, 2017 asserting that defendants, including OPA, owed her a duty of care as a business invitee and failed to maintain their facility in a safe manner by failing to place glow tape in a dangerous area, that OPA was responsible for the stage layout which includes placement of glow tape as an industry standard, the condition was not open and obvious, and that, as a seasoned performer, appellant's step into the dark was reasonable given that she saw no glow tape defining an edge. Appellant additionally asserted that the rental agreement is unconscionable to the extent it bars a claim for OPA's failure to place glow tape. On March 2, 2016, appellees replied reasserting that it owed no duty to appellant because darkness is an open and obvious condition, the rental agreement did not require OPA to apply glow tape, and the rental agreement was not unconscionable. CDT likewise filed a motion for summary judgment as to appellant's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On January 9, 2017, the trial court issued a decision granting appellees'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   motions for summary judgment as to appellant's claims and as to CDT's cross-claim, and denying CDT's motion for summary judgment as to appellant's claims. Regarding OPA, the trial court stated that a lease agreement transfers both possession and control of the premises to the tenant absent a contrary agreement and disagreed with appellant's argument that OPA had a duty, pursuant to the rental agreement, to mark the stage boundaries with glow tape. The trial court did not address the open and obvious or step-in-the-dark rule in relation to OPA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court notes that the rental agreement did not require OPA to install glow tape but \"merely provides that OPA shall provide [ ]Standard Stage Layout (No Runway), Standard Sound and Lights, Wireless Microphones,\" and that OPA leased the space in an \"AS IS, WHERE IS\" condition. (Emphasis sic.) (Trial Ct. Decision at 7.) The trial court concluded that appellant failed to provide evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact. Regarding VV Venue, the trial court found that the lease agreement between VV Venue and OPA divested VV Venue of possession and control of the premises and that VV Venue did not otherwise occupy, manage, or control the NPAC Black Box Theater at the time of the incident. Thus, the trial court found that VV Venue neither owed or breached a duty to appellant. Regarding VVP, the trial court likewise found that VVP was not exercising any of its rights under its sub-lease and otherwise had no involvement in the occurrence leading to appellant's injury. However, in regard to CDT, the trial court found that genuine issues of material fact exist concerning whether CDT breached a duty owed to appellant when its agent (Veach) directed appellant to step in the dark and \"whether a reasonable person in [appellant's] position would have no reason to expect danger or would have reason to not expect it.\" (Trial Ct. Decision at 9.) Thus, the court found summary judgment in favor of appellees appropriate but denied summary judgment in favor of CDT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Thereafter, on February 7, 2017, appellant filed a notice dismissing CDT as a defendant pursuant to Civ.R. 41(A). On the same day, appellant filed an appeal to this court. On February 14, 2017, appellees filed a notice dismissing its cross-claim against CDT, and CDT filed a notice dismissing its cross-claim against appellees. On February 16, 2017, the trial court filed an order stating that CDT's notice of dismissal terminated the case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Appellant presents two assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [1.] THE TRIAL [COURT] ERRED IN GRANTING SUMMARY JUDGMENT BY FINDING OHIO PERFORMANCE ACADEMY, INC.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    A. First Assignment of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Under the first assignment of error, appellant contends the trial court erred in determining that OPA was not required to place the glow tape and leased the premises \"[a]s is, [w]here is.\" (Appellant's Brief at 12.) We find appellant's assignment of error lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Appellant first argues that an issue of fact remains as to whether placement of the glow tape was the responsibility of OPA as a part of the \"standard stage\n   layout\" provision of the rental agreement and by way of Veach asking for the tape to be placed. Appellees counter that the rental agreement passed possession or control of the NPAC space at the time the incident occurred to CDT, and, with no evidence of a contrary agreement, OPA neither owed nor breached a duty to appellant. OPA states that the rental agreement did not contain a provision requiring glow tape and did contain an \"as is, where is\" provision and notes that no testimony to an industry standard came from an expert witness. Furthermore, appellees argue that even if there is an issue of fact as to whether appellant is an invitee as to OPA (rather than CDT), OPA still owes her no duty by virtue of the open-and-obvious doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 17} To prevail on her claim of premises liability, appellant was required to prove (1) the existence of a duty, (2) a breach of that duty, and (3) an injury proximately resulting from the breach.\n   <em>\n    Beair v.

If glow tape is \"standard,\" then the business of VV Venue and Vaud-Villities Productions, Inc. in ownership of the NPAC to provide a venue for stage shows, performances and events, and OPA's long-term lease with VV Venue and its role in renting out space for performances and other events suggest similar missions. And CDT's rental of the Black Box Theater, green room, and lobby for the April 12, 2014 show was also not dissimilar to the basic purpose of use of the venue by all parties involved.

Here, there is a factual question as to whether the lack of glow tape was a condition created by VV Venue, OPA, and/or CDT. This is a question that should be placed before a jury, and this conclusion is supported by the paucity of evidence in the record relied on for summary judgment. Rather than to cite\n   <em>\n    Krause\n   </em>\n   as a basis to award freedom from liability for this dearth of evidence, my view is that the better course is to allow a factfinder to make a determination on evidence that will be available at a later juncture of the matter returned to the trial court. Moreover, it may be necessary to know from expert testimony or at least from an informed fact witness that glow tape is a \"standard\" piece of stage equipment\n   that should or should not have been supplied and applied to the stage under the terms of the contract between OPA and CDT. This is not clear from the record, and the question is material enough to preclude summary judgment for both VV Venue and OPA, even with CDT dismissed from the suit at this juncture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   {\u00b6 45} Accordingly, I would sustain Payne's second assignment of error, finding the first assignment of error moot for now. I would order the trial court to order the presentation of more evidence to determine the existence of a duty under the \"open and obvious\" analysis as concerns the first assignment of error. I would instruct the trial court to order the parties to engage in such factual development to enable it to decide the open and obvious question as a matter of law as is contemplated by the dual applications of\n   <em>\n    Krause\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Walker.\n   </em>\n   For these reasons, I respectfully dissent from the decision of the majority.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
