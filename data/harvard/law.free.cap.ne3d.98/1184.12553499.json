Quinn appeals from the denial of his February 17, 2015 petition for post-conviction\n   relief. We hereby affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Quinn was convicted, following a jury trial on March 24-25, 2014, of two counts of domestic violence, in violation of R.C. 2919.25(A), felonies of the third degree; two counts of kidnapping, in violation of R.C. 2905.01(B)(1), felonies of the first degree; one count of abduction, in violation of R.C. 2905.02(A), a felony of the third degree; and one count of intimidation, in violation of R.C. 2921.04(B)(1), a felony of the third degree. After the kidnapping offenses and the abduction offense were merged for sentencing, Quinn received an aggregate consecutive sentence of 20 years. The victim of the offenses is his mother, Beverly Quinn. Quinn's convictions were affirmed on appeal.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Attached to the motion were Beverly's affidavits, in which she averred in part that \"[a]t this time I realized that my son could not have been the one who committed the crimes against me. I did not have my glasses on, nor my hearing aid. I am 100% sure that it was not James.\" This Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court on the motion for a new trial on the same day it affirmed Quinn's convictions.\n   <em>\n    State v.

In December 2013, Quinn's girlfriend, Samantha Ferrell, was living with Quinn's mother, Beverly, in her two-bedroom house. At that time, Quinn was under indictment for a domestic violence incident involving his mother; as a condition of bond he was subject to a no-contact order with his mother. Late in the evening, Beverly was awakened by noise, and found Quinn and Ferrell in her home, drinking vodka and watching television. Beverly told Quinn he was not allowed to be there and asked Quinn to leave, to turn off the television, and for Samantha to go to her room. Quinn became very angry with his mother, pushed her into a chair, and hit her. When Quinn suggested to Samantha that they take his mother to \"mental health,\" Samantha suggested that they take Beverly out into the country and dump her. Beverly then ran to her own bedroom, locked the door, and left the house by crawling out of the bedroom window. Beverly went to a neighbor's house and called the police. During the 911 call, Quinn identifies her son, James Quinn, as the person who has abused her, and states that Quinn left her house driving a white station wagon. Quinn and Samantha left Beverly's house before the police arrived. The police took photos of Beverly's bruises, and allowed her to return to her own home after they verified it was empty and secured. One of the two officers who spoke with Beverly at this time testified that Beverly was very articulate and said it was her son who had struck her in the face. No charges were filed against Quinn at this time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   According to Beverly's testimony at trial, several hours later Quinn returned to his mother's home, without Samantha, forced entrance into his mother's bedroom, and forced his mother to leave the house with him, threatening to take her to the country and make her jump off a bridge. Beverly described her son as very angry and intoxicated on alcohol and drugs. Beverly left with her son\n   because she felt she had no choice. He drove out into the country, stopped at a bridge and said, \"if you don't jump, I'll push you.\" According to Beverly, Quinn decided he could not do it, and told her that he wouldn't do anything to her as long as she did not testify against him. Beverly testified at trial that Quinn then drove to Walmart, hitting her in the head numerous times as he was driving. After he left the car, Beverly got out of the car and approached a Walmart employee for help. She told the employee that her son had hurt her and was trying to kill her. The Walmart employee verified this course of events and testified that Beverly was scared, but she knew who she was, where she was, and was not disoriented or confused. The Walmart employee testified that as Beverly was talking to him, a man came up to both of them, grabbed Beverly's arm and complained that she was trying to hurt him. The employee insisted that he let go and leave her alone. A surveillance video of the Walmart parking lot corroborates this testimony, but is taken from too far a distance to identify the man's facial features. The surveillance video shows that Beverly approached the employee, a man approached them, and then the unidentified man left in a white station wagon. The employee could not identify Quinn as the person he saw and talked with in the parking lot. Beverly testified at trial that Quinn was driving her car, which she described as a tan sedan, not a white station wagon. No witness identified Quinn as the man depicted in the video in the Walmart parking lot.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The detective who interviewed Beverly at Walmart testified that Beverly identified her son, James Quinn, as the person who attacked her in her home, who forced her into a car, threatened to harm her, and hit her face, causing visible injuries. The detective also testified that during his interview on the scene, Beverly was very emotional, but lucid and articulate about the events of the evening. Based on this interview, the detective obtained a search warrant. A search of Beverly's home revealed evidence that her bedroom door had been damaged as the result of being forced open.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Beverly was transported to the hospital by ambulance and treated in the Emergency Room at Springfield Regional Medical Center. The paramedic who transported Beverly testified that she was alert and oriented. The ER Nurse testified that Beverly was oriented, and did not appear to suffer from dementia or any other mental defect. The ER Nurse testified that Beverly identified her son as the person who had hit and injured her.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On February 17, 2015, Quinn filed a petition for post-conviction relief, asserting nine claims. In his first claim, Quinn asserted that there \"was exculpatory evidence that was not disclosed to me that was in the car.\" The following statement in support of the first claim is attached:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   A white station wagon, claimed to be used in the crimes I am currently incarcerated for, was found on Montego Drive in the Northridge area of Clark County. As stated in the highlighted area of the connected affidavit, a Deputy Sherriff [sic] was at the car. The car description and plate number appeared on the police report associated with this incident. The car had a law enforcement bulletin associated with it, as it was said to be used in criminal activity, also noted by the Deputy Sherriff [sic]. The car belonged to Beverly Quinn. As the owner of the car, Beverly Quinn spoke to the deputy, asking if she could take the car, the deputy said no, as it was involved in\n   a crime. She then asked if she could remove things from the car, and again told no. As pointed out in the affidavit, there was a cell phone and a man's jacket, neither of these items that were in the car she recognized. I lived with her for several years and she knew I had no cell phone and she knew it was not my jacket.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   I was asked by Deputy Lisle at the jail if I would release the keys to the prosecution or my Mother, as her house key was also on the key ring. I first stated to get the key from Samantha, as she had a set, and was the last to drive.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The car, nor the items in it, were ever in discovery. The car was towed to Maines at the deputy's order. The keys were never given to my Mother, as the people at Maines had the keys. My defense attorney * * * asked about the car in trial and was told they (the police) did not think it was impounded, but were not sure. (tr. Pg. 137) The prosecution had the obligation, at that time, to reveal where the car was, they did not. * * * This is not so much about the car, as the items in it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   * * * This, coupled with Caleb Hilt, the store clerk's testimony, would acquit the appellant or defendant. Mr. Hilt, the store clerk, was the only eyewitness other than Ms. Quinn. He clearly states in his testimony several times, the defendant is not the man in the video, thus not guilty. The fact there is a cell phone and jacket, that do not belong to the defendant, in the same vehicle, on video, the assailant is seen getting out of and into, with the testimony of a man that was conversating [sic] and checking the man's face for injuries (Tr. Pgs. 162-175) and said he is not the same man that was on trial is enough to acquit!! * * * The jacket and cell phone, with Caleb Hilt's testimony, would cast extreme reasonable doubt. * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Also attached is what purports to be Beverly's affidavit, which provides that on the date of the offenses, she observed Ferrell \"injecting\" something into the vodka Quinn was drinking, and that Ferrell struck her and told Beverly that \"she would get her boyfriend to kill me.\" Beverly stated that after she went to sleep, she was awakened by a man she believes to be Ferrell's boyfriend, who did not let her get her glasses before removing her from her home. She stated that the prosecutor came to her apartment and accused her of lying. Beverly stated her \"prior affidavits were true. Ms. McCormick came to my apartment and was quite nasty, saying they were not true.\" Beverly stated that she told the police and hospital personnel that she did not have her glasses and could not see well. Beverly questioned, \"Why did Jim's attorney not question me? * * * Why did they not check the car, which had a strange male coat and telephone in it? Neither of those belonged to Jim.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Also attached is the affidavit of Techo Peterson, a fellow inmate of Quinn's, which provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   I, Techo Peterson, herein Affiant, after being duly cautioned and sworn according to law do hereby attest that the following is true and correct to the best of my knowledge, understanding and belief:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   I would testify if need be, that shortly after James Quinn was placed in my pod in December of 2013, the jailer, I believe was Sherriff [sic] Lisle, asked James if he wanted to give his car keys to his mom or the prosecutor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 8} In his second claim Quinn asserted that he was denied a fair trial because Beverly told the police she was not wearing her glasses in the course of the offenses and had trouble seeing, and the\n   State did not disclose this information to Quinn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 9} In his third claim, Quinn asserted that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because his attorney did not call \"any defense witnesses,\" namely Kirk Savage. Savage's attached affidavit provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   I Kirk Savage, affiant herein, after being first duly cautioned and sworn according to law, do hereby depose, attest, and swear that I am of sound mind and do state that the following is true and correct to the best of my knowledge, understanding and belief. Affiant further state that:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   I Kirk Savage saw James Quinn early Saturday morning before he was on the new [sic] in December of 2013 I was puting [sic] a motor in my truck so I left from Washington Courthouse late. I got to Mark Rafferty [sic] house around 3 or 3:30 am due to heavy snow. James was asleep on the couch. I tryd [sic] to wake him but could not I stayed till 6:30 or 7:00 a.m. I left after a young girl stoped [sic] and picked him up. She was saying something about WalMart. I called the public defender's office because the Court told me he would be apointed [sic] a atterny [sic]. I called the public atterny [sic] office several times. Never got a response so I called over * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   There is an arrow drawn on the affidavit following the word \"over,\" but there is nothing on the back of the page.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 10} In his fourth claim, Quinn cited the trial court's decision overruling his motion for a new trial, in which the court noted as follows: \"The victim is the defendant's mother and it is only natural that she might change her testimony as she has done in past hearings, but the Wal-Mart video clearly supports the victim's testimony at trial.\" Quinn asserted that he was denied due process because the State did not disclose to Quinn that the victim had recanted previous testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 11} In his fifth claim, Quinn asserted that prosecutorial misconduct occurred when Beverly \"was terrorized\" by the prosecutor after Beverly provided supporting affidavits for the motion for a new trial. In his sixth claim, Quinn asserted he was denied due process rights because the \"inside\" video from Walmart was never retrieved, and the parking lot video is of poor quality. In his seventh claim, Quinn asserted that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney did not investigate the car containing the phone and jacket. In his eighth claim Quinn asserted that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney failed to interview \"all witnesses,\" specifically Walmart employee Caleb Hilt who responded to Beverly in the parking lot. Finally, in his ninth claim Quinn asserted that he was denied due process because two days after his arrest he tested positive for heroin, which \"is exculpatory evidence that easily would have shown the intent of Samantha Ferrell, a heroin addict,\" and further its presence in his system rendered him incapable of committing the offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 12} On March 26, 2015, the State filed an Answer and a Motion for Summary Judgment. Quinn opposed the Motion for Summary Judgment on April 14, 2015. On July 14, 2015, the court overruled the State's Motion for Summary Judgment as being untimely filed beyond the 20 day period provided in R.C. 2953.21(D). On October 26, 2015, the court dismissed Quinn's petition for post-conviction relief, noting that it \"considered that petition, the State's answer, and the facts presented during the course of the defendant's trial,\" and concluded that the \"petition fails to set forth substantive grounds for relief.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Quinn appealed from the dismissal (2015-CA-0105). On March 9, 2016, the\n   trial court issued findings of fact and conclusions of law, and Quinn filed a Notice of Appeal (2016-CA-0021). This Court dismissed 2015-CA-0105 on March 29, 2016 and 2016-CA-0021 on April 15, 2016 for lack of final appealable orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 14} On August 3, 2016, Quinn filed a \"Motion Amending Post Conviction Petition.\" It provides as follows\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   The Defendant['s] original post conviction relief was filed in 2015 and the Defendant is supplementing those claims. Supplementing claim one on the original post conviction relief with One(A), One(B), One(C) and One(D). So please read One(A), One(B), One(C) and One(D) in conjunction with the [original] Claim One. Read the supplemental Claim Three(A) in conjunction with the original Claim[s] 3, 7, and 8 that are in the original post conviction relief. Please read Claim Nine (A) in conjunction with the original Claim Nine.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   All of this information was discovered after the original claims were completed, and due to the trial court retaining jurisdiction, a successive post conviction relief [cannot] be submitted, so I am amending the original. Furthermore it would be contrary to judicial economy to produce a successive claim while the original claim is still pending in the trial court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   The Defendant will put the supplemental Claims * * * at the beginning of the amendment and then the following claims will be in numerical order starting with ten, due to the fact that the original post conviction relief ended with Claim Nine. * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Quinn set forth eight additional claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 15} On August 8, Quinn filed a \"Motion to Amend Petition for Post Conviction,\" which provides that he \"wishes to add exhibit twenty two to his motion, which is the docket sheet that shows the defendant filed a demand for discovery prior to the defendant['s] trial.\" On September 21, 2016, the trial court issued an Entry that provides: \"The Court hereby re-issues its March 9, 2016 findings of fact and conclusions of law reference the defendant's February 17, 2015 petition for post-conviction relief. The Court's March 9, 2016 Entry is incorporated by reference herein.\" The court's \"Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\" are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Upon a review of the case file, defendant's motion and a review of the jury trial transcript, the Court makes the following findings of fact;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   On December 13, 2013, Beverly Quinn, defendant's mother, a seventy-seven year old woman, was hit by her forty-nine year old son.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Testimony was that he threatened to dump her out in the country. Ms. Quinn, in fear of her life, escaped through a bedroom window and ran to a neighbor and police were called.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Defendant had fled the scene when officers arrived. The officers conducted an investigation and took pictures of Mrs. Quinn. There was visible redness on her forehead. They secured the property and encouraged Mrs. Quinn to stay with a family member or a neighbor. She stayed at her home.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Quinn returned in the early morning hours of December 14, 2013 and dragged his mother from her bed, took her to his car, and would not permit her to leave.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Defendant drove to a bridge on Ohio 334 and ordered her to jump off the\n   bridge, saying, \"if you don't jump, I'll push you\". Defendant changed his mind and did not push his mother off the bridge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   He got back into the car and ordered his mother to recant her earlier statement to the police. She agreed to do so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   The defendant then drove his mother to the Wal-Mart on Bechtle Ave., Springfield, Ohio, so he could get something. Her testimony was that he repeatedly struck her with the butt of his right hand in her head. She testified that he struck her ten to fifteen times.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   She received severe bruising and pain to her head. He left the car and walked towards Wal-Mart and Mrs. Quinn ran towards a Wal-Mart employee. Mr. Quinn came over to the employee and tried to grab his mother's arm but the employee stopped him. He fled the scene. All of these events were captured on a Wal-Mart surveillance video.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Police and EMS arrived on scene and Mrs. Quinn was taken to the hospital where she told the police and nurses that the injuries she sustained were from her son, James Quinn.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   THEREFORE, as a matter of law, the Court finds, based on the above findings of fact, that defendant's motion for post conviction relief does not demonstrate sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief. The defendant has offered no new evidence that would create a strong probability that a different result would occur if he were granted a new trial. The victim's testimony was clearly supported by the surveillance video from Wal-Mart.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 16} We note that on May 1, 2017, Quinn filed a \"Motion for Leave to File Brief in Excess of Twenty Five Pages,\" and on May 12, 2017, this Court issued an Order noting that \"Appellant's brief totaling thirty-one (31) pages is accepted as filed on May 1, 2017.\" On May 22, 2017, Quinn filed a \"Motion for Leave to Amend/Supplement the Appellant[']s Brief,\" seeking to add \"two extra pages,\" and on June 7, 2017, his motion was sustained. On August 8, 2017, and on August 15, 2017, Quinn filed documents entitled \"Actual Notice,\" which appear to be further replies to the State's brief. App.R. 18 provides for the filing of an Appellant's brief, an Appellee's brief, and an Appellant's reply brief, and not for additional Actual Notices addressed to the State's brief, and we will accordingly not consider the Actual Notices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Quinn's amended brief includes ten assignments of error, and 26 Exhibits are attached to the brief. According to Quinn, on a page entitled \"Appellant[']s Exhibits,\" he is \"submitting the exhibits used for his post conviction with new exhibits. These include exhibits 1-26. There are new exhibits with the ones used on the post conviction. I found it more effective to put the new ones with the old ones and submit them as one.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 18} We note that the State initially argues that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to consider Quinn's petition because it was untimely. The version of R.C. 2953.21(A)(2) in effect at the time Quinn's petition was filed provides in part as follows: \"* * * a petition under division (A)(1) of this section shall be filed no later than one hundred eighty days after the date on which the trial transcript is filed in the court of appeals in the direct appeal of the judgment of conviction * * *.\" The transcript filed in Quinn's direct appeal is time-stamped August 18, 2014. 180 days from that date is Saturday, February 14, 2015. Quinn then had until the following Monday, February 16, 2015, to file his petition. As Quinn asserts in his Reply however, that day was President's Day,\n   and the court was closed, meaning that he had until the following day to file his petition. Civ.R. 6(A). His petition is time-stamped February 17, 2015, and we conclude it was timely filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Quinn's first assignment of error is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT FAILED TO CONSIDER THE APPELLANT[']S CLAIMS BY FAILING TO RULE ON THEM INDIVIDUALLY. THE APPELLANT PROPERLY AMENDED HIS POST CONVICTION WITHOUT LEAVE OF COURT, AND THE TRIAL COURT FAILED TO RULE ON THOSE ALSO.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 20} R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(a) provides that \"Any person who has been convicted of a criminal offense * * * may file a petition in the court that imposed sentence, stating the grounds for relief relied upon, and asking the court to vacate or set aside the judgment or sentence or to grant other appropriate relief.\" The statute further provides that the \"petitioner may file a supporting affidavit and other documentary evidence in support of the claim for relief.\" \"We review trial court decisions on petitions for post-conviction relief under an abuse of discretion standard.\" (Citations omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

Before granting a hearing on a petition filed under division (A) of this section, the court shall determine whether there are substantive grounds for relief.

However, it is not clear and Quinn does not establish by an admissible affidavit or any documentary evidence how Simms' or Raferty's testimony would have aided his defense.

Quinn's petition is not supported by any affidavit by him, but only by his statements in support of the petition, which are legally insufficient to establish operative facts. Beverly failed to confirm her statement by oath or affirmation, and it is accordingly not an affidavit and of no effect. Peterson's affidavit does not establish that exculpatory items were in the car or that the State withheld them from Quinn. Finally, we note that the only other affidavit attached to Quinn's petition, the Savage affidavit, which purports to provide an alibi for Quinn's whereabouts at the time of the offenses, does not state the precise date that he avers he observed Quinn sleeping on Raferty's couch. For the foregoing reasons, Quinn's remaining assigned errors are overruled, and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   FROELICH, J. and TUCKER, J., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    The above text appears in capital letters and bold print in the Motion, and Quinn indicated that this is \"so that the individuals that read this are not misled or lose their way.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
