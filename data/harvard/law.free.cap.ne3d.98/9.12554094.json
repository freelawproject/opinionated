Meuller and Melody L. Meuller, (hereinafter \"Appellants\") are the maternal grandfather and step-grandmother of B.M. Appellants are now appealing the entries of the Hocking County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, filed July 9, 2014 and May 3, 2016. Upon review of the record, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Appellants' complaint/motion for custody of B.M. Because we find no error, we affirm the judgment of the trial court. Appellants' assignments of error are overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 2} This matter concerns \"B.M.,\" who was born in 2002.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   B.M.'s parents are Melissa Meuller-Rose (hereinafter \"Mother\") and Nickolas R. Mabry, (hereinafter \"Father\"). B.M.'s parents did not marry and lived together intermittently during the first 3-4 years of B.M.'s life. A detailed chronology of the procedural history of the case will be set forth below in our discussion of the first assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In 2005, the Hocking County Juvenile Court designated Mother as the residential parent and established a child support order. At that time, the court noted\n   B.M. and her mother resided in Laurelville, Ohio, in Hocking County. Father was properly served notice of the proceeding but did not make an appearance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In November, 2013, Appellants filed a complaint for grandparent custody in Shelby County, Ohio.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In December 2013, the Father filed a complaint for custody in Shelby County as well. Then in early 2014, Appellants and B.M.'s Father also filed complaints for custody in Hocking County Juvenile Court. On January 28, 2014, the Hocking County Juvenile Court found that Hocking County had first acquired jurisdiction in 2005. All proceedings were cancelled in Shelby County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The Hocking County Juvenile Court held a final hearing on the motion for change of custody and the grandparents' complaint on June 27, 2014. By the court's entry dated July 9, 2014, the court found that both parents were suitable and denied the Appellants' complaint for custody. The court further found a substantial change in circumstances since the time custody was granted to the Mother. The trial court found it in the best interests of B.M. to grant the Father's motion for custody and also granted the Mother standard visitation rights pursuant to local rule. The trial court continued Appellants' motion for visitation pending further order of the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Appellants commenced a timely appeal. On April 15, 2015, this court dismissed the grandparents' appeal for lack of a final appealable order due to the Appellants' unresolved claim for visitation with B.M. On May 3, 2016, the visitation request came on for hearing. By agreement of parties, the trial court granted Appellants visitation one weekend per month. On June 1, 2016, Appellants instituted the current appeal, challenging the trial court's judgments dated July 9, 2014 and May 3, 2016. Where relevant, additional facts will be set forth below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR ONE AND TWO\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \"I.

On appeal, Appellants argue the Hocking County Juvenile Court does not possess subject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to R.C. 2151.23(A)(2) or R.C. 2151.06, read together. Appellants point out the Hocking County Juvenile Court acquired jurisdiction in 2005 only by virtue of the child support case filed by the Hocking County Child Support Enforcement Agency. However, when the Father filed his ex parte motion for temporary custody on January 14, 2014, none of the parties resided in Hocking County. Appellants contend the Hocking County Juvenile Court has no jurisdiction in these proceedings due to the fact of the Father's residence in Franklin County, and also due to the fact B.M.'s mother is no longer a resident of Hocking County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 10} \"The juvenile court possesses only the jurisdiction that the General Assembly has expressly conferred upon it.\"\n   <em>\n    In re T.J.B.\n   </em>\n   , 1st Dist.

Here, the record reflects the following chronology of filings in the Shelby County Juvenile and Probate Courts and Hocking County Juvenile courts:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-28\">Hocking JC, Aug. 8, 2005 - Hocking CSEA filed motion for support and medical insurance. Hocking JC, Oct. 13, 2005 - Hocking JC designated Mother as residential parent and established child support order. Shelby PC, Oct. 28, 2013 - Grandparents granted guardianship. Shelby JC, Nov. 4, 2013 - Grandparents filed for Ex Parte custody and full legal custody as B.M.</pre>\n  <pre id=\"p-29\">had been with them since June 2013. Both parents alleged to be unsuitable. Grandparents were current legal guardians. Shelby PC, Nov. 15, 2013 - Court sua sponte dismissed guardianship as grandparents had filed for custody and juvenile court had jurisdiction. Shelby JC, Nov. 14, 2013 - Grandparents granted Ex Parte temporary custody of B.M. Shelby JC, Dec. 12, 2013 - Father filed complaint for temporary and permanent custody. Father also filed motion to dismiss Grandparents' complaint. Hocking JC, Jan. 14, 2014 - Father filed Ex Parte complaint for emergency custody. B.M. was staying with Grandparents and not being cared for by Mother. Shelby JC, Jan. 15, 2014 - Father filed motion to dismiss the Grandparents' complaint in Shelby JC for lack of jurisdiction. Alleged Grandparents were forum shopping and jurisdiction was previously acquired in Hocking County in 2005. Hocking JC, Jan. 21, 2014 - Court granted Ex Parte custody to Father. Shelby JC, Jan 24, 2014 - Grandparents filed motion in response to Father's motion to dimiss. They stood in loco parentis to B.M. and jurisdiction was appropriate in county where B.M. resided. In the alternative, Grandparents requested transfer of venue to Hocking County.</pre>\n  <pre id=\"p-30\">Shelby JC, Jan. 27, 2014 - Shelby JC transferred matter to Hocking JC. Hocking JC, Jan. 28, 2014 - Court accepted transfer of case. Hocking JC, Feb. 27, 2014 - Grandparents filed motion for visitation.</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 13} For the reasons which follow, we agree with the trial court's determination that it properly retained subject-matter jurisdiction in this case. The facts in the record clearly demonstrate that the Hocking County Juvenile Court acquired jurisdiction in 2005. R.C. 2151.23(B) also provides: \"* * * [T]he juvenile court has original jurisdiction under the Revised Code: (4) To hear and determine an application for an order for the support of any child, if the child is not a ward of another court of this state.\" The record demonstrates at the time of the 2005 child support proceeding in which the Mother was designated the residential parent, B.M. and her Mother resided in Hocking County. B.M. was not a ward of the Shelby County Probate Court or any other court of the state at the time Hocking County established jurisdiction. The simple passage of time between the 2005 child support order and the 2013 custody filings did not somehow function to deprive Hocking County of its original jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 14} In their brief, Appellants argue:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \"At the time and that father filed his\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   motion for temporary custody of the child, the county that had jurisdiction was Shelby County * * *. The county having jurisdiction did not change by virtue of the agreement of the courts or any of the parties. Only the statute can confer jurisdiction, and the county is not Hocking County.\" (sic.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 15} We disagree with Appellants' construal of the clear record and construal of the facts regarding the transfer of the Shelby County proceedings to Hocking County. It does not appear that the judges simply \"agreed\" to confer jurisdiction on Hocking County without a consideration of the facts. When Appellants filed their complaint for custody in Shelby County, either by inadvertence, misrepresentation, or simple lack of knowledge, they failed to report on the attached parenting proceeding affidavit that proceedings involving B.M. had previously taken place in Hocking County.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   When the Shelby County Juvenile Court became aware of Hocking County's prior jurisdiction in the matter, it was then discussed between the judges and agreed that the case be transferred back to Hocking County where proceedings involving B.M. originated in 2005. The Hocking County Juvenile Court's entry filed January 28, 2014 reflects that when Judge Zimmerman in Shelby County and Judge Wallar in Hocking County realized there were conflicting ex parte custody orders issued from their courts, and conflicting court dates, and they engaged in discussion to resolve the matter of \"competing\" jurisdictions of the two juvenile courts. Given the clear record of the proceedings, these circumstances certainly do not characterize any improper \"conferral\" or agreement regarding transfer of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Jurisdiction is a legal question which may be raised at any time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Parker v.

However, we also observe that while B.M. was residing with Appellants in Shelby County in 2013 when they filed the grandparents' complaint for custody, Appellants did not protest the Hocking County Juvenile Court's jurisdiction until they received an unfavorable decision. Appellants filed a motion to transfer the matter to Hocking County Juvenile Court as an alternative, in response to the Father's motion to dismiss their complaint for custody in Shelby County. After Appellants filed for custody in February 2014, they followed up with multiple appearances and filings, voluntarily appearing and submitting themselves to the authority of the Hocking County Juvenile Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 17} For the foregoing reasons, we find no improper subterfuge between the trial courts regarding jurisdiction. We find subject-matter jurisdiction of these proceedings involving B.M. was properly retained in Hocking County Juvenile Court. As such, Appellants' first assignment of error has no merit and is hereby overruled.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   II.

Appellants argue the trial court erred in failing to find the Father's errors or omissions constituted abandonment of B.M. Appellants point out (1) Father had failed to obtain a visitation order or exercise visitation rights; (2) Father had failed to pay child support from 2005 to the present; and (3) B.M. testified that she had little contact with her father and he allowed smoking in his household. Here, the trial court heard testimony from the Father and other witnesses. The trial court also conducted two in camera interviews of B.M.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 24} The Father testified he is married to Melinda Mabry, they have one child together, and her two other children live with them. The Father is employed by a computer company. He drives a truck through the State of Ohio and delivers computer items.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Father testified he has had a relationship with B.M. her entire life. After B.M. was born, Father and Mother lived together for the first 3-4 years of her life. However, when Mother married Jeremy Rose, she moved to Middletown, Ohio, and\n   \"fell off the globe.\" Father did not have a contact number for Mother and he lost contact with B.M. for approximately 9 months. Eventually, through a mutual friend, he sent a message for Mother to contact him and although he did not have court-ordered visitation, he again began to see B.M. on weekends. Mother or another family member met him to exchange B.M. for visitation. Mother and Father remained civil to each other. According to Father, he saw B.M. every weekend or every other weekend, if his work schedule interfered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 26} In June 2013, B.M. had been in Father's care for 10-11 days. He had dropped her off to stay with Jennifer Meuller, B.M.'s maternal aunt, for a couple of days. On June 15th, Ms. Meuller called Father and advised him of B.M.'s allegations of abuse against Jeremy Rose. On June 15th, Father met Ms. Meuller in Pickaway County. The sheriff and a social worker were also there to question B.M. about the abuse. Then, Father took B.M. back to Columbus. The next day he took her to Franklin County Children's Services. However, because Father was not the legal guardian, B.M. was not questioned. Early the next morning, Appellants arrived and took B.M. with them. Father testified B.M. was kicking and screaming when she left and did not want to go with Appellants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Father testified he and B.M. had a good relationship until June 15, 2013 when Appellants took her to stay with them. Since the ongoing custody dispute, he feels B.M. has distanced herself from him. However, once she is at his home, she's fine. Father admitted the Appellants had facilitated weekend visitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Regarding child support, Father testified he was behind in payments 2-3 years when he first moved to Columbus. However, Mother had indicated she did not want child support and that Father \"was doing his part.\" He did not know he was ordered to pay child support until he received a letter from the BMV indicating his license was suspended. Currently, child support is taken out of his paycheck and he has been current the last couple of years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Father testified he wants custody of B.M. and thinks she will adjust. Father always had a good relationship with the Mother until she became involved with Jeremy Rose. If granted custody, Father was willing that Mother have visitation because B.M. needs Mother in her life. Father testified he doesn't think visitation with Appellants would be a good idea. In his opinion, their continued involvement would interrupt his rekindling of his relationship with her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 30} When B.M. went to stay with the Appellants on June 15th, he did not see her for 9 months. Appellants told him B.M. could not come to his house because Mother would take her away. Appellants indicated B.M. was supposed to stay with them until the children's services investigation was over. Father explained he did not know where to file for custody because of Mother's transient lifestyle, but when he hired an attorney, he was advised to file in Shelby County when he should have filed in Hocking County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Father testified B.M. loves her father's family and looked forward to seeing them. He testified B.M. had never rebelled against coming to see him or talking on the phone. He has an album full of pictures with B.M. in most of them. To him, B.M. appears happy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 32} On cross-examination, Father denied complaining about driving some distance when visitation was set up in the case. He denied complaining about attending B.M.'s basketball games in Shelby County. He testified that he could not take\n   off time from work if he was to support his family. He further testified he was advised to stay out of Shelby County by the police chief. Father denied ignoring the guardianship order Appellants were granted in Shelby County.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 33} On cross-examination, Father admitted he has not paid off his arrears, but he is set up on a monthly payment and his taxes have been intercepted once. Father admitted there was friction between him and B.M. and, to an extent, he took some responsibility. Father testified in his opinion, Appellants have controlled how B.M. acts at his home by making promises to her. He cited B.M.'s lack of respect for him, Mother, and the rest of the family.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Father testified Mother advised him B.M. was doing well in school. He admitted has never seen her report card. He admitted not knowing if B.M.'s immunizations were current.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Father's observation is that Appellants have \"bought\" B.M.'s happiness. Although he admitted she was physically healthy, he opined Appellants had not taken good care of her \"psychologically or mentally.\" Father testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   \"Mr. Mueller did say one time and standing in McDonald's parking lot that I was taking [B.M.'s] golden ticket and [B.M.] is looking at me like I'm a monster because he can provide so much for her up her in Botkins and he-if my daughter comes and lives with me down in Columbus, she's going to become a little whore at thirteen years old, knocked up and pregnant.\" * * * \"Nick, you got three or four kids up there, you know, I've got nothing but time to kill up here and you can ask my wife the very same question.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 36} On cross-examination by the guardian ad litem, Father stated he would honor the Court's orders because he didn't want to be in contempt. He stated he was trying to do things the \"right way.\" B.M. needed everybody involved in her life. Father expressed doubt that Jeremy Rose was completely \"out of the picture.\" Father would take legal steps if necessary to protect B.M. from further abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Melinda Mabry, Father's spouse; Appellants; Jennifer Meuller, B.M.'s maternal aunt; and the court-appointed guardian ad litem also testified.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   We reiterate that we have thoroughly reviewed the record and the transcripts of all the witnesses' testimony. The trial court's entry of July 9, 2014 states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   \"This court finds that [B.M.] has a strong bond with her mother, father Nickolas, stepmother Melinda Mabry, grandparents Mark and Melody Meuller and maternal aunt Jennifer Meuller and her children.

Emphasizing a trial court's discretion in custody matters, the appellate court, however, noted, the only question presented was \"whether Mother is a suitable custodian, \" 'not whether someone else is more suitable.' \" (Emphasis sic.)\n   <em>\n    In re D.C.J.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012-Ohio-4154\">\n    2012-Ohio-4154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=976%20N.E.2d%20931\">\n    976 N.E.2d 931\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 58, quoting\n   <em>\n    In re S.M.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1174327\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/160/794/\">\n    160 Ohio App.3d 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005-Ohio-2187\">\n    2005-Ohio-2187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=828%20N.E.2d%201044\">\n    828 N.E.2d 1044\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 31 (8th Dist.)

Appellants point to the testimony regarding Mother's transient lifestyle. All witnesses testified to this fact. Jennifer Mueller recognized her sister had not provided stability for B.M. by moving so frequently. However, she also expressed no hesitation or concern about Mother's continuing as B.M.'s legal guardian in her own right. Ms. Mueller's only concern had to do with Jeremy Rose's possible involvement in Mother's and B.M.'s lives. None of the parties wished to exclude Mother from B.M.'s life. Again, given the court's better position to weigh credibility of all witnesses, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it also found Mother to be a suitable parent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 44} Appellants' argument that the trial court did not properly inquire into the circumstances of the allegations of child abuse when B.M. resided with her mother is particularly without merit. We disagree. Upon review of the record, we observe the trial court showed great concern with regard to the abuse allegations. In the trial court's July 9, 2014 entry, the trial court explicitly stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   \"The sworn testimony established that * * * did allege physical and sexual abuse by her stepfather, Jeremy Rose, while the child was living with her Mother and Jeremy Rose. She also alleged abuse by step-grandfather Mr. Passmore in Pickaway County Ohio.
