Because we hold that there was no probable cause to search Ward's vehicle, we reverse the trial court's ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The grand jury indicted Ward for carrying a concealed weapon, in violation of R.C. 2923.12(A)(2), and improperly handling firearms in a motor vehicle, in violation of R.C. 2923.16(B), both fourth-degree felonies. The charges stemmed from a traffic stop on December 20, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Ward filed a motion to suppress evidence found following a search of his vehicle, and the trial court held a suppression hearing at which the arresting officer, Corey Gould, and Ward testified. The officer\n   testified that, at approximately 9 p.m. on the night in question, he pulled onto Ridgeway Avenue and observed Ward's car \"parked at the curb of 711 Ridgeway, which is a * * * known drug trafficking area.\" He testified that he observed an individual stepping away from Ward's vehicle, and that, a few moments later, he initiated a traffic stop because Ward had pulled away from the curb without using his turn signal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The officer testified that he had been a police officer for eight years, and that he had frequently witnessed drug transactions. He testified that when he saw Ward's vehicle, he \"believe[d] that [a drug transaction occurring] was a very strong possibility. Given the area and the fact, you know, there was an individual that was leaning into his car as I pulled up. That's typically how we see those things go down.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The officer further testified: \"I made contact with the defendant. Ran his information through our computer system. Found out that he was suspended and that there was a warrant from the State of Kentucky that they were going to extradite for.\" The warrant was for nonsupport. The officer then placed Ward under arrest due to the outstanding Kentucky warrant, and, after securing Ward in his vehicle, searched the interior of Ward's vehicle \"based on the arrest and the activity [the officer] had observed when [he] pulled up to Ridgeway.\" The officer testified that he believed drugs were in the car, and while he did not find drugs, he did find a \"loaded nine millimeter semi-auto in the center console.\" He also testified that Ward was cooperative during the traffic stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The officer testified that his cruiser's camera had videotaped the encounter, and the video was played in court. Having reviewed the video, we conclude that the officer's testimony is fully in accord with what the video depicts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Ward then testified that the person he was speaking to was his uncle, and that his uncle had flagged him down to ask him for money. Ward testified that he had been speaking with his uncle for a minute or two before the officer approached, and that he had given his uncle some money. Ward testified that he received nothing in exchange from his uncle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} In denying Ward's motion to suppress, the trial court stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The defendant admits that there was an exchange of money.\n   <em>\n    Officer says he saw an exchange of money in what he thought was a drug deal\n   </em>\n   . And the defendant says 'I never dealt with drugs. I don't deal with drugs.' That doesn't take away from the appearance or the conclusions that the officer made. Even though the officer, according to the defendant, is wrong in those conclusions, they are reasonable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Contrary to the trial court's statement, a review of the officer's testimony reveals that he never testified that he \"saw an exchange of money,\" or that he saw any transaction. Additionally, the video footage does not include an exchange of money or other hand-to-hand transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Ward pleaded no contest and was sentenced to community control. He timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Assignment of Error\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Ward's sole assignment of error is that \"the trial court erred as a matter of law in overruling [his] motion to suppress.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 12} \"Our review of a trial court's ruling on a motion to suppress presents a mixed question of law and fact.

But the trial court mistakenly believed that the officer had testified that he saw an exchange of money in what he thought was a drug deal.

Therefore, the issue before us is whether, under the totality of the circumstances known to the officer-and discounting the trial court's mistaken finding of fact-the officer's warrantless search of Ward's vehicle was permitted under the automobile exception.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Based on the facts known to the officer at the time of the search, there was not a \"fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime would be found in\" Ward's vehicle.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feliciano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"964203\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/115/646/#p663\">\n    115 Ohio App.3d at 663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=685%20N.E.2d%201307\">\n    685 N.E.2d 1307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
