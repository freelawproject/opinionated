Respondents have filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6). Because the motion presented matters outside the record, this Court converted the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Civ.R. 56(C) provides before summary judgment may be granted, it must be determined (1) no genuine issue as to any material fact remains to be litigated, (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and viewing such evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made.\n   <em>\n    Temple v.

The property is being developed as an apartment complex and is located outside the New Philadelphia City limits. The current mayor and planning commission have indicated they are unaware of the former mayor's alleged agreement to provide the water and sewer services. The mayor and planning commission have indicated the services will not be provided unless the property is annexed into the City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Relators rely on New Philadelphia Codified Ordinance 935.01 in support of their contention they are entitled to the services. Section 935.01 provides,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 6} 935.01 NEW CONNECTIONS OUTSIDE CITY.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 7} (a) New water or sewer or other utility hook ups shall be permitted to the utility system of the City, from outside the corporate limits of the City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Prior to this ordinance being passed, the City's ordinance relative to utility service outside the city limits was Section 931.05 titled, \"Connections Outside City Prohibited.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 9} In short, the City went from prohibiting to permitting utility service outside city limits. Relators argue the statutory language of 935.01, \"shall be permitted\" makes the provision of utilities outside the city limits mandatory. Relators argue the ordinance which states \"hook ups shall be permitted\" means: \"hook ups must be permitted\" rather than \"hook ups shall be allowed.\" Relators' complaint at Paragraph 9 states, \"The\n   <strong>\n    only\n   </strong>\n   requirement for utility connections outside of the City, is that the cost of the connection be 'borne entirely by the contractor, owner or party requesting service.' \" (emphasis added). Under Relators' interpretation of the ordinance, the City would be required to provide utility services to Cleveland, Columbus, or anywhere outside the city limits upon request. We find Relators' interpretation could cause an absurd result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 10} A basic tenet is \"statutes [are] construed to avoid unreasonable or absurd consequences.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Dispatch Printing Co. v. Wells,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1819109\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/18/382/#p384\">\n    18 Ohio St.3d 382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 384,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=481%20N.E.2d%20632\">\n    481 N.E.2d 632\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1985). Stated another way, \"as a general rule of statutory construction, a \" 'statute should be given that construction, unless such is prohibited by the letter of the statute, which will accord with common sense and reason and not result in absurdity or great inconvenience.' \"\n   <em>\n    Paulus v. Paulus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1758878\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/95/612/#p614\">\n    95 Ohio App.3d 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 614,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=643%20N.E.2d%20165\">\n    643 N.E.2d 165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994), quoting\n   <em>\n    Kundrat v. Kundrat\n   </em>\n   , 11th Dist. Lake No. 92-L-097,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1993%20WL%2076243\">\n    1993 WL 76243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Feb. 26, 1993).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 11} We find the ordinance is meant to permit the City to provide utilities outside the city limits if the City chooses to provide those services. There is no genuine issue of material fact as to the meaning of\n   the ordinance. The ordinance can only be read to mean the City shall be allowed to provide utilities outside of the city limits. To hold otherwise would force the City to provide utilities to any and all properties upon request without regard to the City's interests in conserving utilities for its own citizens and businesses which would not accord with common sense and reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Because Relators have failed to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that Respondents have a clear legal duty to provide utility hook ups, mandamus does not lie. For this reason, the motion for summary judgment is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Wise, John, J. and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Baldwin, J., concur\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
