For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In 2014, Todd Anthony Thornton (\"Thornton\") and Darvale Thomas (\"Thomas\") were involved in an automobile accident. At the time of the accident, Thornton was insured with Progressive. Thomas retained the law firm of KNR to represent him for all claims arising from the accident. Thomas and KNR entered into a contingent fee agreement, which gave KNR a charging lien on the proceeds of any insurance settlement, judgment, verdict, award or property obtained on Thomas's behalf. While negotiating with Progressive on Thomas's behalf, KNR presented a settlement package and demand and obtained a settlement offer of $12,500.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 3} During the course of its representation of Thomas, however, KNR became aware that Thomas discussed his accident with another law firm. KNR contacted both the other firm and Progressive and notified them of its fee agreement and charging lien with Thomas. Thomas then began negotiating, on his own, his claim with Progressive. Progressive eventually settled the claim directly with Thomas, despite its prior knowledge of KNR's charging lien.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In November 2015, KNR sought payment of its legal fees and expenses by filing a complaint against Progressive, Thornton, and Thomas. KNR alleged that it met its obligations under the contingent fee agreement with Thomas and obtained a settlement offer from Progressive but did not receive any payment for its services. KNR's claims against Thomas were for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, and quantum meruit/unjust enrichment. It alleged that Thomas intentionally breached the terms of the contingent fee agreement by settling the claim directly with Progressive after KNR obtained a settlement offer. As a result, Thomas was unjustly enriched by accepting KNR's services and advancement of claim expenses without reimbursing KNR for its services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} KNR's claims against Progressive and Thornton were to enforce the charging lien and for tortious interference. It alleged that Progressive and Thornton (through his agent, Progressive) had actual knowledge of its charging lien prior to settling directly with Thomas and distributing the proceeds to him solely. KNR further alleged that Progressive and Thornton knew of the contingency fee agreement between Thomas and KNR and intentionally procured Thomas's breach of\n   the fee agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 6} KNR voluntarily dismissed Thornton from the action and conceded that it did not have a claim of tortious interference against Progressive. The trial court granted default judgment in KNR's favor against Thomas. As a result, the only remaining issues related to Progressive were whether KNR had a right to \"enforce the charging lien\" and whether KNR was entitled to damages based on quantum meruit/unjust enrichment. Both Progressive and KNR filed motions for summary judgment as they relate to these issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The trial court denied Progressive's motion for summary judgment but granted KNR's motion for summary judgment. It found that Progressive \"had a duty to protect [KNR's] interest in the settlement proceeds.\" The trial court held that Progressive owed KNR the amount of KNR's interest in the settlement proceeds; therefore, Progressive was \"liable for the quantum meruit value of [KNR's] legal services which include litigation expense[s].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Progressive now appeals, raising the following single assignment of error for our review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Assignment of Error\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The trial court committed reversible error by entering summary judgment in favor of [KNR] and against [Progressive] with respect to [KNR's] claim for an \"equitable lien\" for contingent attorney fees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Progressive argues the trial court erred because it was not in privity of contract with KNR and there is no statute obligating it to assist KNR in the recovery of fees owed to KNR by Thomas. Progressive contends that KNR's remedy lies with KNR pursuing Thomas only, not Progressive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Appellate review of summary judgment is de novo.\n   <em>\n    Grafton v.

Progressive was aware of the charging lien, a point Progressive concedes. As a result, KNR contends that Progressive \"remains liable for the quantum meruit value of KNR's services and expenses KNR advanced on [Thomas's] behalf despite its settlement\n   with Thomas and distribution of the settlement proceeds.\" In support of its motion, KNR submitted the contingent fee agreement entered into between Thomas and the firm, which provides in relevant part that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [t]he Attorneys shall receive as a fee for their services, one-quarter (\u00bc) of the total gross amount of recovery of any and all amounts recovered, and Client hereby assigns said amount to Attorneys and authorizes Attorneys to deduct said amount from the proceeds recovered.

KNR presented a settlement package and demand to Progressive on Thomas's behalf. On June 30, 2015, Progressive made an offer to KNR to settle Thomas's claim for $12,500. On July 9, 2015, KNR learned that Thomas had talked to another law firm regarding his claim. That same day, KNR advised Progressive that it was asserting a lien against any settlement funds paid to Thomas. Then on July 14, 2015, Progressive, despite knowing that KNR had asserted a charging lien for its expenses and fees on any settlement proceeds paid to Thomas, settled the claim directly with Thomas.

In\n   <em>\n    Meros\n   </em>\n   , the attorney settled his claim against his former client before pursuing an action against the tortfeasor, which forfeited his right to recover fees he might have in equity.
