On July 15, 2015, appellees John and Lori Wischt filed a complaint for quiet title and action to enforce settlement against appellants, the Heirs of Ruth Pearl Mourer: Donald Mourer, Wanda Colvin, Wanita Oliver, Charles Mourer, William Mourer, Timothy Mourer, Marsha Wilson, and Wayne Mourer. Appellees claimed that, either via quiet title or via an agreed settlement, they had a right-of-way through appellants' property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Appellants filed an amended counterclaim against appellees for adverse possession, prescriptive easement, ejectment, and trespass. Appellants claim they, through adverse possession, have title to an eleven acre portion of appellees' land.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The chain of title to appellees' property is as follows: appellees acquired the property through a general warranty deed dated March 21, 2014, from James E. Kittle, the trustee of the Cora E. Kittle Revocable Trust dated Feb. 23, 1993 to John and Lori Wischt; the James and Cora E. Kittle Revocable Trust dated Feb. 23, 1993 acquired the property via a quit-claim deed dated Feb. 23, 1993 from James and Cora Kittle. James and Cora Kittle acquired the property via a warranty deed dated April 4, 1951 from Samuel Gibson to James E. and Cora E. Kittle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The chain of title to appellants' property is as follows: on April 1, 1949, Arthur and Grace Mourer acquired the property via a deed from J.W. Angle and Grace Angle; via a deed dated December 11, 1967, Charles and Ruth Pearl Mourer acquired the property from Arthur and Grace Mourer; on March 11, 2008, Charles and Ruth Pearl Mourer signed a survivorship deed, deeding the property to themselves; on March 16, 2008, Ruth Pearl Mourer executed a transfer on death deed, from herself to her son Donald Mourer, daughter Wanda Colvin, daughter Wanita Oliver, son Charles Mourer, son William Mourer, son Timothy Mourer, daughter Marsha Wilson, and son Wayne Mourer; and an affidavit dated June 29, 2015 by Donald Mourer provides that Ruth Pearl Mourer died on April 29, 2015 and thus her interest in the property is terminated by her death and her children are now the owners of the entire fee simple interest in the real estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The trial court issued a judgment entry on November 14, 2016. The trial court: found appellees failed to provide any reliable evidence that an easement exists on appellants' property; dismissed appellees' claim to quiet title alleging an easement on appellants' property; and dismissed appellees' action to enforce settlement. The trial court noted an issue remained as to the claimed adverse possession by appellants of an eleven acre tract of land and stated it would come on for further hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On December 9, 2016, appellants filed a motion for summary judgment regarding the eleven acres. In their motion, appellants agreed that according to the deposition of James Kittle (\"Kittle\"), who was the prior owner of appellees' property, Kittle agreed in the 1950's that the Mourers could use the eleven acres. However, appellants argued since Kittle had not been on or used the property since the 1950's, no additional consent was given since the 1950's and what began as consensual use developed into an adverse use. Attached to appellants' motion for summary judgment is the affidavit of one of the appellants, Wanita Oliver. Wanita Oliver avers that she has personal knowledge that, \"her mother and father, Charles and Pearl, openly, continuously, exclusively, adversely, and notoriously used this property referred to as the \"11 acres\" since they purchased the property in 1967.\" Further, that the Mourers have used the referenced acreage as pasture and cattle accessible property since at least 1967.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Appellees filed their own motion for summary judgment regarding the eleven acres and argued that, pursuant to the deposition of Kittle, appellants' parents used the land with permission. Appellees also filed a response in opposition to appellants' motion for summary judgment, again citing the deposition of Kittle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Kittle, now deceased, testified during his deposition that he sold the property\n   at issue to appellees and he had been on the property three times since purchasing it as an investment property. Kittle stated his parents were friends of Charles and Pearl Mourer. Further, that Charles and Pearl knew both him and his parents. Kittle had a good relationship with Charles and Pearl and he kept in contact with them through the years. Kittle stated he and Charles and Pearl had a \"very good relationship\" with regards to the property. Kittle never had any issues with the Mourers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Kittle testified there was a fence dividing the property that had fallen down. He and his father did not want to rebuild the fence, so his father, representing him, told Charles and Pearl they could water their cows without building a fence. Kittle stated, \"so that gave the Mourers the right to water the cows from the spring that was on my property.\" Kittle was unsure of the exact date his father, representing him, gave this permission to Charles and Pearl. However, he believes it was after the 1950's, but before his father died in 1975. Kittle stated he never revoked the right he gave to the Mourers, through his father, to water their cows. When asked how Kittle permitted the Mourers to water their cows on his land, he testified that his father made the arrangements with Charles Mourer. Kittle confirmed he gave his approval of the permission his father gave to Charles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Kittle testified the property was timbered a couple of times. He had it timbered just prior to when he sold it in 2014, it had been previously timbered approximately ten or fifteen years ago, and at least once before his father died. Kittle stated he did not use the part of the property at issue. Kittle testified that he never saw any cattle or other animals on his land.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 11} The trial court issued a judgment entry on February 16, 2017 on appellants' and appellees' motions for summary judgment. The trial court found Kittle granted permission to use the real estate to the Mourer family to water their cattle and this permission was never revoked. Thus, the trial court granted appellees' motion for summary judgment and denied appellants' motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Appellants appeal the February 16, 2017 judgment entry of the Guernsey County Court of Common Pleas and assign the following as error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 13} \"I.

Ramunno\n   </em>\n   , 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 09 MA 162,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010-Ohio-4316\">\n    2010-Ohio-4316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%203554278\">\n    2010 WL 3554278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Seventh District stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Although it is true that permission cannot ripen into adversity by mere lapse of time, this concept applies only to those persons to whom the permission was given. Where, for instance, the invited occupier leaves and a wholly new occupier begins possession, the original permissive use is not automatically extended. Rather, the landowner must renew his permission to subsequent occupiers in order to avoid adverse possession and to maintain the express permission. In other words, although prior permissive use of a predecessor is relevant to erase the adversity element for periods within the relevant twenty-one year period, it does not make a current occupier's use permissive.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 23} We first note that this Court has not adopted the holding of the Seventh District and has stated in previous cases that, \"when the original entry onto another's property is permissive or conferred by grant, then any use reasonably consistent with such a grant or permission is not adverse.\"\n   <em>\n    Rodgers v.

Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Eckman\n   </em>\n   , where the occupiers were different, unrelated individuals throughout the twenty-one years, the occupiers of the property since 1949 are family members. See\n   <em>\n    Harris v.

Kittle never mentions permission with regards to Arthur and/or Grace and does not testify to any relationship his family had with Arthur and/or Grace. Arthur and/or Grace are not mentioned at all in Kittle's deposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Eckman\n   </em>\n   , the relevant inquiry is the permission as it relates to the occupier of the property, not the owner of the property. Appellants have provided no evidence disputing Kittle's testimony or providing evidence that permission was given to Arthur and/or Grace rather than Charles. Thus, Charles was the person, \"to whom the permission was given\" and this permission given to Charles cannot ripen into adversity by the mere lapse of time. The first date Charles was not the occupier of the property was after his death in 2008. A period of twenty-one years has not elapsed since that date and thus appellants cannot demonstrate adverse use for a period of twenty-one years. Accordingly, summary judgment is appropriate in favor of appellees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Appellants next contend the affidavit of Wanita Oliver, an appellant in this case, is sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to permission. Wanita Oliver's affidavit provides, \"her mother and father, Charles and Pearl, openly, continuously, exclusively, adversely, and notoriously used this property referred to as the \"11 acres\" since they purchased the property in 1967.\" We first note that appellants did not file a response to appellees' motion for summary judgment.
