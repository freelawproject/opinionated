For the\n   reasons that follow, we affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Assignment of Errors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Appellant sets forth the following assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   1. Appellees failed to raise the affirmative defense of \"honest belief\" in their Answer; therefore, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on this affirmative defense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   2. The \"honest belief\" defense of Federal case law is incompatible with Ohio Civ.R.56 and should not have been applied as contrary to Ohio procedural law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   3. The trial court erred in granting summary judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Background Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Appellant started working as a teacher for Toledo Public Schools (\"TPS\") in 1996. Starting in the fall of 2007, appellant was assistant principal at DeVeaux Middle School (\"DeVeaux\"), and for a short stint, appellant served as DeVeaux's acting principal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In January 2009, a new principal was hired at DeVeaux. At first, the new principal praised appellant's work, but by January 2010, the principal began to give appellant declining marks on her employee evaluations. By the end of the 2009-2010 school year, the principal had contacted his immediate superior regarding appellant's failure to perform her job duties and unprofessional conduct toward students and parents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 5} In January 2011, DeVeaux's principal completed an employee evaluation for appellant wherein he recommended appellant be transferred and given assistance through an intervention program or a similar program for professional growth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Appellant was transferred to Spring Elementary School (\"Spring\") for the 2011-2012 school year. In early September 2011, Spring's principal and the Assistant Superintendent of the TPS Board met with appellant to discuss concerns about appellant's professionalism. On October 1, 2011, appellant was assigned a mentor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Complaints soon surfaced concerning appellant's behavior, including inappropriate language and conduct with students, parents and teachers, and numerous occasions of appellant being late to cover or failing to cover her cafeteria shifts during the 2011-2012 school year. Appellant disputed most of these claims as being misrepresented or false.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 8} In June 2012, a three-day internal hearing was held to address five disciplinary charges brought against appellant by TPS. On July 30, 2012, the hearing officer found the allegations were founded and constituted insubordination, and recommended that appellant's employment be terminated. Appellant appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The Board requested an impartial referee be appointed by the Ohio Department of Education (\"ODE\") to hear appellant's appeal. In November 2012, a six-day evidentiary hearing was held before an impartial referee. In January 2013, appellant filed a race discrimination charge with the Ohio Civil Rights Commission (\"OCRC\"). In May 2013, the referee issued a written recommendation not to terminate appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On June 25, 2013, the Board passed a resolution terminating appellant's employment because she engaged in a pattern of misconduct from the 2009-2010 school year through the 2011-2012 school year. The resolution contained specific reasons why the referee's recommendation was rejected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 11} In July 2013, appellant filed a second charge with the OCRC claiming her employment was terminated in retaliation for the charge she filed in January 2013. The OCRC ultimately closed both cases, at appellant's request, without a determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Also in July 2013, appellant appealed the Board's decision to the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas, being case no. CI13-3777.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    Case No. CI13-3777\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 13} In her amended complaint, appellant alleged the following claims against the Board: violation of R.C. 3319.16 (termination of contract without good and just cause); violation of R.C. 3319.12 ; malicious breach of contract; defamation; intentional infliction of emotional distress; unlawful gender and race discrimination at DeVeaux; unlawful race discrimination at Spring; unlawful race discrimination by the Assistant Superintendent of the Board; and, unlawful retaliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The Board filed a motion to dismiss all of appellant's claims except the violation of R.C. 3319.16 claim, and filed a brief addressing that claim. The court granted the motion to dismiss with respect to the R.C. 3319.12 and malicious breach of contract claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Speller v. Toledo Pub. Schools Dist.

The court also ruled on the R.C. 3319.16 claim, and affirmed the Board's decision to terminate appellant. The court found the Board presented substantial and credible evidence to support its charges and finding that it had good and just cause to reject the referee's recommendation, and issue a termination order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Speller v.

Appellant appealed the trial court's decision dismissing the R.C. 3319.12 and malicious breach of contract claims, as well as the trial court's ruling on the R.C. 3319.16 claim. On June, 30 2015, we affirmed the lower court's judgments in\n   <em>\n    Speller v. Toledo Pub. School Dist. Bd. of Edn.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015-Ohio-2672\">\n    2015-Ohio-2672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20N.E.3d%20509\">\n    38 N.E.3d 509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Dist.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    Case Nos. CI14-3172 and CI15-2918\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 16} On July 15, 2014, appellant filed a complaint against three Board administrative employees and John/Jane Does in the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas, being case no. CI14-3172.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 17} On June 8, 2015, appellant filed a complaint against the Board, in case no. CI15-2918, alleging the claims which she had previously dismissed without prejudice in case no. CI13-3777. Case no. CI15-2918 was consolidated with case no. CI14-3172. On October 14, 2015, appellant file a nine-count amended complaint against the Board, three administrators and John/Jane Does. In the consolidated amended complaint, appellant alleged: race and gender discrimination, hostile work environment in violation of R.C. 4112.02 against the Board and two administrators; race discrimination against the Board and two administrators; retaliation against the Board and one administrator; intentional infliction of emotional distress against all defendants; intentional interference with business relationship against the three administrators and John/Jane Does; false light against the three administrators and John/Jane Does; defamation; additional unlawful discrimination; aiding and abetting against all defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Appellees filed a motion for summary judgment contending appellant was terminated for good and just cause. Appellees outlined in their motion appellant's disciplinary issues during the 2009-2010,\n   2010-2011 and 2011-2012 school years. Appellees asserted appellant could not establish a prima facie case of race or gender discrimination or unlawful retaliation. Appellees also set forth arguments in support of their motion as to appellant's false light and defamation claims. Appellant opposed appellees' motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 19} On September 16, 2016, the trial court granted appellees' motion for summary judgment. The court found appellant had presented a prima facie case for race and gender discrimination, but appellees had an honest belief in the non-discriminatory reasons given for appellant's termination. The court noted two courts\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   had previously determined appellees had good and just cause to terminate appellant's employment. The court further found the analysis for the discrimination claims applied to the retaliation claim and the additional unlawful discrimination claim, and as such, appellees were entitled to summary judgment on those claims. The court also found appellant's remaining claims were moot, and granted summary judgment to appellees on those claims as well. Appellant timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 20} We will address appellant's third assignment of error first.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    Third Assignment of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Appellant contends she challenges dismissal of all of her claims, but discusses only the race and gender discrimination claims. Appellant maintains the trial court rejected all of her other claims because she could not create a genuine issue of material fact as to the discrimination claims. Appellant refers to several pages in her opposition to the motion for summary judgment for arguments in support of her other claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    Summary Judgment Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Summary judgment will be granted when there remains no genuine issue of material fact and, when construing the evidence most strongly in favor of the non-moving party, reasonable minds can only conclude that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

It is undisputed that appellant is a member of two statutorily protected classes, she was terminated, and she was qualified for her position. Thus, the only dispute is whether appellant was replaced by a person from outside of the protected class and/or whether there was a comparable person from outside of the protected class who was treated more favorably than appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 28} In her memorandum in opposition to appellees' motion for summary judgment, appellant argued she was replaced by a white male and there were numerous comparable, non-protected employees who were disciplined but not terminated. More specifically, appellant contends in her affidavit that ten white male employees and two white female employees were disciplined for various charges lodged against them, but the employees were not terminated by the Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Upon review, appellant's \"comparables\" were not \"similarly situated in all respects,\" as required by\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   . Appellant offered no evidence that the white employees dealt with her supervisor, were subject to the same standards, or engaged in the same conduct.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 30} With respect to conduct, most of the white employees offered by appellant as \"comparables\" had two charges levied against them, and the most charges made against any one employee were three charges. In contrast, the record shows appellant was terminated for a myriad of reasons: she displayed conduct which was inappropriate and contrary to the Board's policy of treating students with respect; she left students unattended in a classroom; she failed to cover her assigned lunchroom responsibilities on numerous occasions; she had rough and inappropriate\n   physical contact with students; she made inappropriate statements to parents; she used inappropriate language with students; she violated the principal's written directive; and, she wrongly criticized a teacher and school counselor for reporting suspected child abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Clearly, the charges lodged against the white employees were not as extensive as the charges lodged against appellant. We therefore find appellant has failed to meet her burden to produce evidence that comparable, nonprotected employees were treated more favorably than appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Appellant also argued she was replaced by a white male. In support, appellant avers in her affidavit \"my information is that I was in fact replaced by a white male who previously served at the Lakota School District.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Civ.R. 56(E) requires that affidavits supporting and opposing summary judgment be made on personal knowledge. Personal knowledge is the awareness \"of factual truth which does not depend on outside information or hearsay.\"\n   <em>\n    Shah v. Getz\n   </em>\n   , 6th Dist.

Appellant's averment is not based on her own personal knowledge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Civ.R. 56(E) also requires that affidavits \"show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated in the affidavit.\" Appellant does not show affirmatively the basis she has for believing the Board hired a white male to replace her, as she did not provide the man's name or his hire date or start date, nor did appellant produce any documentation or deposition testimony to corroborate her \"information\" that a white male was hired to replace her. As such, the averment is not proper evidence for summary judgment purposes and is insufficient as a matter of law either to establish that she was actually replaced by a white man or to create a genuine issue of material fact as to that issue. We therefore find appellant has failed to meet her burden to present evidence that she was replaced by a person from outside of the protected class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Based upon the foregoing, we find appellant failed to meet her initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of race or sex discrimination against appellees.

Appellant submits \"[i]n other words, until the decision issued, the Board was in limbo regarding any action respecting Plaintiff.\" Appellant offers \"[i]t is common knowledge that the Board holds regular meetings only once per month and that the meetings generally last for only one evening.\" Appellant maintains \"the correct inference is that only four Board 'working days' passed between the time the Plaintiff filed her OCRC charge and the time the Board enacted the retaliatory resolution.\" Appellant referred to a public announcement by the Board's president as well as Larry Sykes' affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Upon review, appellant did not establish a prima facie case of retaliation. The record does show that appellant engaged in a protected activity, by filing her OCRC charge, the Board knew of the charge, and the Board subsequently terminated appellant's employment. However, there is no evidence that the termination was causally related to the OCRC charge. While appellant argued \"the correct inference is that only four Board 'working days' passed between the time the Plaintiff filed her OCRC charge and the time the Board enacted the retaliatory resolution,\" this argument is not supported by evidence in the record, admissible or otherwise, and is insufficient to establish a causal link.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Based upon the foregoing, we find appellant failed to meet her burden of establishing a prima facie case of retaliation.

We further find appellant's examples constitute actions which are, at most, \"mere insults, indignities, * * * annoyances, petty oppressions, or other trivialities,\" and are not sufficient to establish a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.
