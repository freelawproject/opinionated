The motion judge denied the motion on the ground that MGED is not a \"public employer\" subject to the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act, and thus the presentment requirement of G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 4, did not apply. We disagree and remand so that the Superior Court can address whether the presentment requirement was satisfied on the facts here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The complaint alleges that the plaintiffs were injured in October, 2013, when a ladder they were near came into contact with an \"arc[ing]\" electrical current. They claim that the current came from an \"improperly grounded\" line maintained by MGED, and that MGED was negligent. Between November, 2013, and July, 2015, and prior to filing suit, the plaintiffs' attorney communicated with representatives of MGED multiple times, both orally and in writing. Eventually efforts at presuit resolution failed, and the plaintiffs filed this lawsuit on April 19, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   MGED filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the plaintiffs had failed to make presentment as required by the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act, G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 4. The plaintiffs responded (1) that no presentment was required because MGED is not a \"public employer\" as defined in G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 1, as amended by St. 1993, c. 110, \u00a7 227, and thus the Tort Claims Act does not apply and (2) that in any event the plaintiffs had satisfied the presentment requirement through correspondence with representatives of MGED. The motion judge denied MGED's motion on the ground that MGED was not a public employer, but rather was a \"commercial business.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . The question before us turns on the definition of \"public\n   employer,\" found at c. 258, \u00a7 1, which provides that \"public employer\" includes \"any ... town ... and any department ... thereof ... including a municipal gas\n   or electric plant.\" In construing a statute we begin with its plain language, and we think the language here admits of only one interpretation. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Stewart-Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3840378\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/78/592/#p600\">\n    78 Mass.

MGED is a department of the town of Middleborough, and it is a \"gas or electric plant.\" It squarely meets the statutory definition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The plaintiffs urge us to reach a contrary result based upon other language in the \"public employer\" definition that excludes \"the Massachusetts Port Authority, or any other\n   <em>\n    independent\n   </em>\n   body politic and corporate\" (emphasis added). See G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 1. The plaintiffs argue that MGED is one such \"independent\" entity. They rely in particular on a Supreme Judicial Court decision,\n   <em>\n    Middleborough\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Middleborough Gas &amp; Elec. Dept.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"890306\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/422/583/#p587\">\n    422 Mass. 583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 587-588,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=664%20N.E.2d%2025\">\n    664 N.E.2d 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996), that dealt specifically with MGED, and in which the court held that the town of Middleborough and MGED could be treated as sufficiently separate so that the town could sue MGED for losses from a fire it allegedly caused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Neither\n   <em>\n    Middleborough\n   </em>\n   nor the cases that succeed it support the position that the defendant gas and electric plant is not a \"public employer\" under the Tort Claims Act. In\n   <em>\n    Middleborough\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"890306\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/422/583/#p587\">\n    422 Mass. at 588\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=664%20N.E.2d%2025\">\n    664 N.E.2d 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Supreme Judicial Court expressly stated that it was not deciding whether the Tort Claims Act applied in suits against MGED. Furthermore, the court specifically noted that the amendment to the \"public employer\" definition that we rely upon here, adding gas and electric plants, postdated the cause of action at issue in\n   <em>\n    Middleborough\n   </em>\n   .

In so holding the court relied, in part, on the fact that \"[t]he Legislature has specifically placed the [gas and light] department in the class of entities subject to the Tort Claims Act, thereby reflecting its view that the department is in that class of entities afforded the protections of sovereign immunity.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=848%20N.E.2d%201197\">\n     Ibid\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=848%20N.E.2d%201197\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   The court went on to consider and distinguish the\n   <em>\n    Middleborough\n   </em>\n   decision, concluding that \"as a legal and practical matter, the [gas and electric] department is a department of the town and, like the town, is a public entity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 11,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=848%20N.E.2d%201197\">\n    848 N.E.2d 1197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   We conclude likewise here. In construing the term \"public employer\" in G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 1, we cannot read the language excluding \"other independent bod[ies]\" to override the\n   <em>\n    inclusion\n   </em>\n   of \"municipal gas or electric plant[s].\" See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Burgess\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"369463\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/426/206/#p224\">\n    426 Mass. 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 224-225,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=688%20N.E.2d%20439\">\n    688 N.E.2d 439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997), quoting from\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Menasche\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6931991\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/348/528/#p538\">\n    348 U.S. 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 538-539,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6931991\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/348/528/#p538\">\n    75 S.Ct. 513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=99%20L.%20Ed.%20615\">\n    99 L.Ed. 615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1955) (\"One of the cardinal principles of statutory construction is to give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute\").
