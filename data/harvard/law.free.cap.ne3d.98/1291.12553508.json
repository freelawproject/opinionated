CELEBREZZE, JR., J.:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 1} Defendant-appellant, William Frazier (\"appellant\"), brings this appeal challenging the trial court's sentence for drug possession, possessing criminal tools, and violating postrelease control. Specifically, appellant argues that the trial court made improper and prejudicial remarks during sentencing, erred by imposing a maximum sentence on the drug possession count, and erred by ordering him to serve the remainder of his postrelease control term consecutively. After a thorough review of the record and law, this court affirms in part, vacates in part, and remands for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In Cuyahoga C.P. No. CR-15-600584-B, the Cuyahoga County Grand Jury returned an eight-count indictment on November 13, 2015, against appellant and his codefendant, Aaron Pittmon. Counts 3 through 8 in the indictment pertained to appellant. Appellant was charged with: Count 3-drug possession, a fifth-degree felony in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A), with a one-year firearm specification and forfeiture specifications; Count 4-possessing criminal tools, a fifth-degree felony in violation of R.C. 2923.24(A), with forfeiture specifications; Count 5-drug possession, a fifth-degree felony in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A), with forfeiture specifications; Count 6-possessing criminal tools, a fifth-degree felony in violation of R.C. 2923.24(A), with forfeiture specifications; Count 7-drug possession, a fifth-degree felony in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A), with forfeiture specifications; and Count 8-drug possession, a minor misdemeanor in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A), with forfeiture specifications. Appellant was arraigned on November 18, 2015. He pled not guilty to the indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The parties reached a plea agreement. On January 7, 2016, appellant pled guilty to an amended Count 3, drug possession, without the one-year firearm specification. Further, appellant pled guilty to possessing criminal tools as charged in Counts 4 and 6 of the indictment. Pursuant to the plea agreement, appellant agreed to forfeit $40 in U.S. currency, a digital scale, three cell phones, a 2005 Buick LaCrosse, and a firearm. The remaining counts and specifications were nolled. During the change of plea hearing, appellant's counsel advised the trial court that appellant was on postrelease control when he committed these offenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court ordered a presentence investigation report and set the matter for sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The trial court held a sentencing hearing on January 28, 2016. Appellant's counsel, appellant, and the prosecutor addressed\n   the court. The trial court imposed a prison term of one year: one year on the drug possession count and six months on each count of possessing criminal tools. The trial court ordered the counts to run concurrently. Regarding the postrelease control violation, the trial court ordered appellant to serve the remainder of his sentence, approximately three years, consecutively to the one-year prison sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Appellant, acting pro se, filed an appeal on March 21, 2016. This court appointed appellate counsel to represent appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On August 1, 2016, this court, sua sponte, dismissed the appeal based on appellant's failure to file a brief. However, on August 12, 2016, this court granted appellant's motion for reconsideration and vacated the prior sua sponte dismissal of the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On November 9, 2016, this court concluded that the trial court's January 28, 2016 sentencing entry did not accurately reflect the sentence imposed in open court. As a result, this court remanded the matter to the trial court for a nunc pro tunc sentencing entry. The trial court issued a nunc pro tunc sentencing entry on December 30, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On February 8, 2017, this court remanded the matter to the trial court for a correction of the judgment of conviction so that it contained, in a single document, both the fact of conviction and sentence for each count.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On February 16, 2017, the trial court issued a nunc pro tunc sentencing entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On March 29, 2017, this court again remanded the matter to the trial court with instructions to enter a sentencing entry that complied with\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Lester\n   </em>\n   . The trial court issued a nunc pro tunc journal entry on March 29, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Appellant assigns three errors for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   I. The trial court abused its discretion when it interjected personal views of her own life in comparison to the appellant's [allocution] under Crim.R. 32 at sentencing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   II. The trial court erred when it sentenced the appellant to the maximum sentence on a felony of the fifth degree.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   III. The trial court erred when it invoked R.C. 2929.141 and imposed an additional three year sentence to be served consecutively to the one year sentence in Case No. 600584.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Trial Court's Statements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Appellant's first assignment of error pertains to certain statements that the trial court made before imposing its sentence. During the sentencing hearing, the trial court inquired as to why appellant decided to use heroin for the first time. Appellant explained that he was going through a lot of stress, but acknowledged that it did not excuse his actions. Thereafter, the trial court engaged in a colloquy with appellant during which the trial court examined the specific stressors that appellant had encountered in his life. Furthermore, the trial court explained that everyone experiences stress and suggested that many people encounter more stress than appellant without resorting to drug use. For instance, the trial court emphasized that appellant has yet to encounter common stressors such as marital problems or divorce, financial difficulties, raising children, and supporting children financially.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Appellant takes issue with the trial court's statements regarding stress, and challenges the statements on two grounds. First, he argues that the trial court abused its discretion by improperly interjecting personal views during the sentencing hearing. Furthermore, he appears to argue that the trial court abused its discretion by \"turn[ing] what was at maximum, a one year sentence that was amenable to a community control sanction * * * into a four year sentence[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 13} This court does not review a trial court's sentence for an abuse of discretion. As set forth in further detail below, we review felony sentences under the standard set forth in R.C. 2953.08(G)(2).\n   <em>\n    State v. Marcum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6774034\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/146/516/\">\n    146 Ohio St.3d 516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6774034\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/146/516/\">\n    2016-Ohio-1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=59%20N.E.3d%201231\">\n    59 N.E.3d 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 16. R.C. 2953.08(G)(2) provides that when reviewing felony sentences, a reviewing court may increase, reduce, or modify a sentence, or it may vacate and remand the matter for resentencing, only if we clearly and convincingly find that either the record does not support the sentencing court's statutory findings or the sentence is contrary to law.\n   <em>\n    State v. Martin\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 104354,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017-Ohio-99\">\n    2017-Ohio-99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20121774\">\n    2017 WL 121774\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Second, appellant appears to raise a judicial bias argument. Specifically, he argues that the trial court's statements regarding stress were prejudicial, indicated that the court was biased against him, and denied him a fair sentencing hearing. As such, appellant argues that this matter must be remanded for resentencing by a different judge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 15} We will interpret appellant's judicial bias claim as an argument that his sentence is contrary to law based on a due process violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Although the trial court vocalized its displeasure with appellant's statement that he decided to use heroin because he \"was going through a lot of stress,\" the court was in effect emphasizing that it was unacceptable for appellant to resort to drug use any time he encounters a stressful situation. Furthermore, we do not find that the sentence imposed is indicative of judicial bias or prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Appellant's statement that he decided to use heroin because he \"was going through a lot of stress\" is relevant in considering whether he is likely to reoffend in the future. R.C. 2929.12(D)(4) provides that an offender is more likely to commit future crimes if he \"has demonstrated a pattern of drug or alcohol abuse that is related to the offense, and [he] refuses to acknowledge that [he] has demonstrated that pattern, or [he] refuses treatment for the drug or alcohol abuse.\" The trial court, in discussing appellant's statement and this sentencing factor, could have reasonably been concerned that appellant is likely to reoffend in the future-particularly if and when he encounters stress or stressful situations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 21} The trial court did not proceed immediately to sentencing after the discussion regarding stress. Instead, the trial court inquired about the programs appellant participated in while he was incarcerated. Although the trial court imposed the maximum one-year sentence on the drug possession count, the court did not impose a maximum sentence on the counts of possessing criminal tools, nor order the counts to run consecutively pursuant to R.C. 2929.14(C)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Based on the foregoing analysis, we find no merit to appellant's claim of judicial bias.

The trial court's sentencing journal entry provides, in relevant part, \"the court considered all required factors of the law. The court finds that prison is consistent with the purpose of R.C. 2929.11.\" Aside from this notation in the sentencing entry, the record reflects that the trial court did, in fact, consider both R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12 when sentencing appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 33} The trial court considered the information in appellant's presentence investigation report. The trial court considered that appellant committed the offenses to which he pled guilty while he was on postrelease control. The trial court considered that appellant violated multiple conditions of his postrelease control, including\n   associating with known criminals and using drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 34} The trial court considered that appellant's substance abuse problem was getting progressively worse.

Appellant advised the trial court that he \"took up a trade in carpentry\" while he was incarcerated. (Tr. 27.) However, he acknowledged that he failed to complete the program. Appellant's counsel stated that appellant was working at a supermarket. The trial court considered that although appellant had been on postrelease control for two years, he failed to complete the carpentry program and had not applied to the union.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 36} The trial court considered that appellant was driving without a license on the night he was arrested.

The sentence is within the permissible statutory range and the record reflects that the trial court considered the purposes and principles of felony sentencing set forth in R.C. 2929.11 and the seriousness and recidivism factors in R.C. 2929.12.

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 51} After thoroughly reviewing the record, we affirm the sentence imposed on the drug possession count and the postrelease control violation. The record does not indicate that the trial court was biased or prejudiced against appellant, nor that appellant's due process rights were violated; appellant's one-year sentence on the drug possession count is not contrary to law; the trial court did not err by imposing a consecutive three-year sentence for appellant's postrelease control violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 52} The trial court erred by failing to merge the two counts of possessing criminal tools for sentencing purposes.
