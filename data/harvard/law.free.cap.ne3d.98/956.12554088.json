(\"NOHC\"), appeal the judgment of the Lorain County Court of Common Pleas. Plaintiffs-Appellees/Cross-Appellants, Ronnie and Carol Bolen also appeal the judgment of the Lorain County Court of Common Pleas. For the reasons that follow, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Mr. Bolen began having heart problems in 2005. At that time, Mr. Bolen received treatment from various physicians including Dr. Mohan, an adult cardiologist who practices interventional cardiology with NOHC. Although Mr. Bolen underwent a number of procedures, no complications arose and Mr. Bolen was discharged. However, on August 8, 2008, Mr. Bolen was admitted to Mercy Regional Medical Center after complaining of chest pressure. Consequently, on August 11, 2008, Dr. Mohan performed a cardiac catheterization and a balloon angioplasty on Mr. Bolen. Following the balloon angioplasty, Dr. Mohan decided to stent the area of blockage. However, after attempting to place three stents without success, Dr. Mohan determined that the first stent had come off the balloon during the procedure and was still in Mr. Bolen's left main coronary artery. The following day, Dr. O'Shaugnessy performed a cardiac catheterization on Mr. Bolen to determine the location of the stent and whether it could be removed. Dr. O'Shaugnessy ultimately removed the stent by performing open-heart surgery on August 13, 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Thereafter, Mr. Bolen and his wife, Carol Bolen, filed a complaint for damages resulting from medical malpractice against Dr. Mohan and NOHC. The matter ultimately proceeded to a trial and the jury returned a verdict in favor of the Bolens in the amount of $514,682.68.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Following the jury verdict, the parties filed a number of post-judgment motions. Dr. Mohan and NOHC filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or, in the alternative for a new trial, which was denied. Dr. Mohan and NOHC also filed a motion to enforce the non-economic damages cap pursuant to R.C. 2323.43. The trial court granted that motion, limiting the Bolen's non-economic damages to $269,048.04. The Bolens filed a motion for prejudgment interest, which the trial court denied without a hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Dr. Mohan and NOHC filed a timely appeal, raising three assignments of\n   error for our review. The Bolens also filed a timely appeal, raising one assignment of error. As Dr. Mohan and NOHC's first and second assignments of error raise similar issues, we elect to address them together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Dr. Mohan and NOHC's Assignment of Error I\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    The trial court erred in not granting directed verdict and/or denying [Dr. Mohan and NOHC's] motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict because Dr. Diaco was not competent to testify under Evid.R. 601(D).\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Dr. Mohan and NOHC's Assignment of Error II\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    The trial court erred in not granting directed verdict and/or denying [Dr. Mohan and NOHC's] motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict because Dr. Diaco failed to opine to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that the negligence of Dr. Mohan proximately caused Mr. Bolen to undergo open-heart surgery.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In their first assignment of error, Dr. Mohan and NOHC contend that the trial court erred when it denied their motions for directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict because Dr. Diaco was not competent to testify as an expert.

Evid.R. 601 governs the general rule of competency to be a witness. That rule states, in relevant part,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Every person is competent to be a witness except:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   A person giving expert testimony on the issue of liability in any medical claim * * * asserted in any civil action against a physician, podiatrist, or hospital arising out of the diagnosis, care, or treatment of any person by a physician or podiatrist, unless:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (1) The person testifying is licensed to practice medicine and surgery, osteopathic medicine and surgery, or podiatric medicine and surgery by the state medical board or by the licensing authority of any state;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (2) The person devotes at least one-half of his or her professional time to the active clinical practice in his or her field of licensure, or to its instruction in an accredited school and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (3) The person practices in the same or a substantially similar specialty as the defendant.

Neither Dr. Mohan nor NOHC filed a motion in limine challenging Dr. Diaco's competency to testify as an expert prior to trial, nor did they object to Dr. Diaco's testimony or move to strike his testimony based upon his competency to testify as an expert. Rather, Dr. Mohan and NOHC orally moved for a directed verdict after Dr. Mohan and NOHC thoroughly cross-examined Dr. Diaco and the Bolens had rested their case, arguing, inter alia, that the Bolens had failed to elicit any testimony from Dr. Diaco showing that he devotes at least one half of his professional time to the active clinical practice of medicine. In denying defendants' motion for directed verdict, the trial court stated that it did not believe the issue of competency was one that could be raised after the witness had testified. However, when looking broadly at Dr. Diaco's testimony, it was reasonable to conclude that he spends at least half of his professional time on the practice of cardiology and intervention cardiology.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Dr. Mohan and NOHC renewed their motion for directed verdict at the close of all evidence and the trial court denied it for the same reasons outlined above. Likewise, in denying Dr. Mohan and NOHC's subsequent motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the trial court found there was sufficient evidence and testimony presented at trial to qualify Dr. Diaco as an expert witness. The trial court further noted that Dr. Mohan and NOHC \"never objected to Dr. Diaco's qualifications or the appropriateness of his testimony during direct or cross examination or re-direct or re-cross examination\" and that \"[i]t is well settled that a party waives an error in the presentation of evidence by failing to object at the time it occurred.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Upon review of the record, we conclude that, by failing to object or move to strike Dr. Diaco's testimony, Dr. Mohan and NOHC forfeited the issue of his competency.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hyams v.

In considering Dr. Mohan and NOHC's motion for\n   directed verdict, the trial court reviewed Dr. Diaco's testimony and subsequently denied the motion. Dr. Mohan and NOHC renewed their motion for directed verdict at the close of evidence, which was also denied by the trial court. In denying the renewed motion for directed verdict, the trial court stated the following on the record:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Although there's a bit of a tortuous trail Dr. Diaco takes us on before he renders his opinion, he ultimately does opine that the surgery, open heart surgery, would not have been necessary if the stent had not been lodged in there; that because the stenting had been successful in the past, that that would have been the appropriate course of continuing treatment, except for the fact that this was lodged in there, this stent was lodged in there. And the doctor did agree that there was no alternative but to perform the open heart surgery as a result of this.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Similarly, in denying the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the trial court found \"there was competent, sufficient and proper testimony presented at trial by the [Bolens'] expert witness Dr. Diaco, based upon a reasonable medical probability and certainty, as to the appropriate standard of care, that [Dr. Mohan and NOHC] breached the standard of care and that the breach was the direct and proximate cause of injuries and damages to the [Bolens].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Indeed, a review of the record shows that Dr. Mohan testified on cross-examination during the Bolens' case-in-chief that she discussed the risks of the stenting procedure with Mr. Bolen prior to his surgery, including the possibility of open heart surgery. However, she further stated, \"[t]he open heart surgery would come in if in the event that something untoward happens at the time of the intervention\" and that \"here something untoward happened.\" Additionally, after Dr. Diaco testified as to how a stenting procedure is performed, he further opined to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that based on the location of the undeployed stent, had Dr. Mohan realized the stent had become dislodged from the balloon prior to attempting to deploy the two additional stents, that stent would have been easily snared. He further testified that the standard of care for cardiologists requires that anytime an undeployed stent is removed from the body, it should be examined, not just to ensure that the stent is still attached to the balloon, but also to look at the condition of the stent and the condition of the balloon. He then opined to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that it is below the standard of care to not check and determine if a stent is on the balloon when it is removed because Dr. Mohan \"would have never put the second stent in if she knew the first stent wasn't on the balloon.\" Dr. Diaco also stated that because Dr. Mohan attempted to push two additional stents beyond the first undeployed stent, the first undeployed stent became crumpled up in the circumflex and was sticking into the left main artery. Dr. Diaco also opined to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that notwithstanding the undeployed stent, based on Mr. Bolen's medical history, he would not have needed to have open-heart surgery because he could have been treated by continued stenting. However, because the undeployed stent\"could shut off all the vessels distal to where that stent is protruding in the left main\" causing a potentially lethal situation, \"the only way to deal with it at that time is to do bypass surgery.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Therefore, upon review of the record in this matter, we determine that the Bolens presented sufficient evidence that Dr. Mohan's negligence proximately caused Mr. Bolen's open-heart surgery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Therefore, Dr. Mohan and NOHC's second assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Dr. Mohan and NOHC's Assignment of Error III\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    The trial court abused its discretion in permitting introduction of medical bills because [the Bolens'] sole expert, Dr. Diaco, failed to state the care and treatment was causally related to the alleged negligence of [ ] Dr. Mohan.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 19} In their third assignment of error, Dr. Mohan and NOHC contend that the trial court erred when it permitted the introduction of Mr. Bolen's medical bills because Dr. Diaco failed to state that the care and treatment was causally related to the alleged negligence of Dr. Mohan.

Dr. Mohan and NOHC objected to the admission of some of the records on the basis that the Bolens did not present any expert testimony suggesting that the bills or the treatment rendered for those bills were the direct and proximate result of Dr. Mohan's negligence. The trial court ultimately allowed the medical records at issue to be admitted. In doing so, the trial court stated the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   From the Court's perspective, in light of the fact that the Plaintiff has produced the medical bills and medical records with regard to that that creates a certain level of presumption, or prima facie evidence rather, of reasonableness and necessity in that regard; and, in light of the fact there is expert testimony that the-although a bit tortuous, indicates to a jury that a reasonable-to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that bypass would not have been necessary if not for the stent being lodged in the artery, this Court is going to deny * * * the motion to exclude medical records.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 23} As recognized above, a review of the record shows that Dr. Diaco opined during his testimony that to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, notwithstanding the undeployed stent, Mr. Bolen would not have needed to have immediate open-heart surgery. However, because the undeployed stent\"could shut off all the vessels distal to where that stent is protruding in the left main\" causing a potentially lethal situation, \"the only way to deal with it at that time is to do bypass surgery.\" Moreover, Dr. Mohan specifically testified that \"[t]he open heart surgery would come in if\n   in the event that something untoward happens at the time of the intervention\" and that \"here something untoward happened.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Accordingly, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting the medical records at issue.

We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 26} R.C. 1343.03(C) governs the award of prejudgment interest in a tort action.
