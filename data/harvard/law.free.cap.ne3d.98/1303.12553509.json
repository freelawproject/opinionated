Appellee is the state of Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    STATEMENT OF THE CASE AND FACTS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On March 14, 2016, Appellant was indicted by the Richland County Grand Jury on one count of aggravated possession of drugs in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A), a felony of the fifth degree. He\n   was arrested on June 3, 2016, and released on a bail appearance bond that same day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Appellant entered a plea of no contest to the charge on October 12, 2016. He was placed in the pre-conviction Substance Abuse Treatment Court program. His probation officer later discovered while in the program, Appellant used his cell phone to send pictures of drugs and of weapons, signing his messages \"The Drug Dealer.\" He provided information to others in the diversion program to use LSD, as the drug screens would not reveal its presence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} As a result of Appellant's activities, he was terminated from the Substance Abuse Treatment Court program and found guilty upon his plea of no contest. The case proceeded to sentencing on February 22, 2017. At the sentencing hearing, Appellant's probation officer presented information to the court about Appellant's drug activities during the court treatment program. The court sentenced Appellant to twelve months incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Appellant prosecutes this appeal from the February 23, 2017 sentencing entry of the trial court, assigning as error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} \"WHETHER THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN IMPOSING A PRISON SENTENCE FOR A FELONY OF THE FIFTH DEGREE OF TWELVE MONTHS.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} We review felony sentences using the standard of review set forth in R.C. 2953.08.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Appellant argues he violated a condition of his diversion program, but not of his bond, and pursuant to R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(a), the court was required to sentence him to community control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 11} In\n   <em>\n    State v. Kelley,\n   </em>\n   5th Dist. Delaware No. 13 CAA 04 0028,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014-Ohio-464\">\n    2014-Ohio-464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%20548152\">\n    2014 WL 548152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the defendant violated the terms of his treatment in lieu of conviction\n   (ILC) program. The trial court sentenced him to prison pursuant to R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(b). We affirmed based on the trial court's specific findings the defendant was in violation of conditions of his bond and committed the offenses as part of organized criminal activity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b641.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Subsequently, several districts have distinguished\n   <em>\n    Kelley\n   </em>\n   in concluding violation of an ILC program does not constitute grounds for a prison sentence under R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(b). In\n   <em>\n    State v. Holt,\n   </em>\n   2nd Dist. Montgomery No. 26031,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014-Ohio-2204\">\n    2014-Ohio-2204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%202169542\">\n    2014 WL 2169542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Second District found\n   <em>\n    Kelley\n   </em>\n   did not apply where the trial court found the appellant had violated the terms of his supervision, not the terms of his bond. Violation of terms of supervision was insufficient, standing alone, to support a prison sanction pursuant to R.C. 2929.13(B)(1).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 4. Likewise, the Eighth District found a prison sentence contrary to law where the sentence was imposed for violation of an ILC program:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   The instant matter is indistinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Holt\n   </em>\n   . Lopez's violation of his ILC program, standing alone, is insufficient under R.C. 2929.13(B)(1) to support the trial court's decision to sentence him to a term of incarceration. Although the trial court found that Lopez violated the conditions of his ILC program, the court, like\n   <em>\n    Holt\n   </em>\n   , did not specifically find that Lopez violated the conditions of his bond.\n   <em>\n    Holt\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15. The circumstances surrounding Lopez's offense of possession of cocaine, a felony of the fifth degree, meet all of the requirements listed in R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(a). Furthermore, and unlike\n   <em>\n    Kelley\n   </em>\n   , where the trial court specifically found that the defendant: (1) violated the conditions of his bond while on ILC, and (2) committed the offenses as part of organized criminal activity, none of the exceptions enumerated in R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(b) are applicable to the facts of the instant case.\n   <em>\n    Kelley\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 41. Thus, the trial court-without making any of the R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(b)(i)-(xi) findings-had no discretion to sentence Lopez to a term of incarceration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    State v. Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015-Ohio-5269\">\n    2015-Ohio-5269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20N.E.3d%20492\">\n    43 N.E.3d 492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 55.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The instant case is indistinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Holt\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   . Unlike\n   <em>\n    Kelley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the trial court did not make a finding Appellant violated his bond. The record does not demonstrate Appellant violated his bond, but only violated the terms of his diversion program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The bond posted in the instant case is an appearance bond. While Appellant was to report to pretrial supervision as a special condition of the bond, the record does not reflect his activities in the drug diversion program violated any specific requirements of his bond, nor did the court so find. The bond only requires Appellant report to the pretrial supervision office upon release from jail. The bond was entered prior to Appellant's acceptance into SATC, and the conditions of continued participation in SATC are not also conditions of his bond. The mere fact Appellant was released on bond while he was participating in SATC does not convert a violation of the terms of SATC to a violation of his appearance bond. While the State argues in its brief, \"There can be no greater violation of bond than to commit a new crime,\" the record does not reflect his bond was revoked for his activities in the SATC program, nor does it reflect he was charged with a new crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 15} While the court's concerns with Appellant's alleged drug activity while participating in the diversion program are understandable, the legislature has not seen fit to include violation of the terms of a pre-conviction drug treatment program as an exception to the requirement an\n   offender who meets the criteria of R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(a) be sentenced to community control. Accordingly, we find Appellant's sentence was contrary to law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 16} The assignment of error is sustained. The judgment of the Richland County Common Pleas Court is reversed and this case is remanded to that court for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Delaney, P.J. and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Wise, John, J. concur\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Appellant's representation he met the criteria of R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(a) for a community control sanction has not been rebutted by the State in its brief. Further, the PSI report demonstrates Appellant meets the criteria set forth in R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(a)(i) and (iv).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
