(Complaint \u00b6 5-6; Scott Armstrong Dep. 8:14-23). On that day, Armstrong had driven to the Lakes to participate in a golf outing with other club members there. (Scott Armstrong Dep. 13:14-15). He chose to park his car along the curb closest to the clubhouse rather than in a parking space in the parking lot because he wanted to ensure that the car would not be hit by other vehicles. (Scott Armstrong Dep. 14:10-17). The golfing started at 1:00 p.m. (Scott Armstrong Dep. 16:18-22). By 6:00 p.m., Armstrong had finished playing, freshened up, and walked to the patio area, where the Lakes had set up some dining tables for the golfers. (Scott Armstrong Dep. 16:18-23; 49:6-21; 52:8-12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Armstrong was seated at a table near the fire pit with Damon Canfield, Mike Powers, Brad Perrine, and Garth Cox. (Scott Armstrong Dep. 22:15-18). The Lakes had provided food and drink service to Armstrong and the other golfers from the outing. (Scott Armstrong Dep. 53:1-8). Armstrong estimated at his deposition in October 2016 that he had consumed five or six alcoholic beverages between 1:00 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. on the day of the outing, but he contends that he was not intoxicated and had no difficulty walking. (Scott Armstrong Dep. 53:23-54:10; 59:5-9: 129:18-21; 130:10-13). Tammy Russell-a server at the Lakes-also testified at a deposition, explaining that she had served Armstrong and other golfers on the day of the outing and had not seen signs of intoxication in Armstrong that night. (Russell Dep. 38:4-7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} By 7:30 p.m., the sun was setting, which prompted Armstrong to leave the group so that he could drop off his sunglasses in his car. (Scott Armstrong Dep, 9:2-5; 16:16-17; 25:6-22). According to Armstrong, the sun was still providing some light in the sky. (Scott Armstrong Dep. 17:1-12). Instead of walking on a paved and lighted path through the terrace and around the clubhouse to reach his car, Armstrong chose to take an off the path shortcut across a five foot long mulched bed that lay between the patio bar and the parking lot. (Scott Armstrong Dep. 9:7-12; 15:1-3; 26:18-27:20; 28:2-6; 30:24-31:14). According to Armstrong, this shortcut was frequently used by other club members. (Scott Armstrong Dep. 27:21-28:1). Armstrong testified at his deposition that he himself had utilized this shortcut 12 to 15 times between 2003 and 2014. (Scott Armstrong Dep. 33:1-2; 47:2-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} As he walked with what he describes as a normal gait over the mulched bed and into the grassy area between that bed and his parked car, he felt heavy moisture under his left foot. When he took his next step with his right foot, that foot landed in a valve box that measured 8? x\n   10? or 10? x 12? at the top. (Scott Armstrong Dep. 9:12-20; 18:2-4; Julie Armstrong Dep. 25:5-7). The depth of the valve box remains unclear from the record, but Armstrong claimed during his deposition that his right knee was level with the ground once his foot hit the bottom of the box. (Scott Armstrong Dep. 83:2-18; 105:19-22; 107:11-19; 112:19-21). His uneven stance at that point caused him to lose his balance and he fell to the ground. (Scott Armstrong Dep. 9:18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Armstrong was not looking at the ground in front of him when he stepped into the valve box. (Scott Armstrong Dep. 9:18). Instead, he was focused at that moment on his parked car and on the people or vehicles moving in and out of the parking lot. (Scott Armstrong Dep. 84:7-10). After lying for a few minutes on his back in standing water that surrounded the valve box, Armstrong was able to roll over and get to his feet. (Scott Armstrong Dep. 87:1-3; 112:4-18). According to Armstrong, the cover to the valve box was off and lying next to it when he stepped into the valve box. (Scott Armstrong Dep. 83:2-18; 86:16-21; 105:19-22; 107:11-19; 112:19-21). He also testified that the lid was light green in color, and he could distinguish between it and the surrounding grass once he stood up. (Scott Armstrong Dep. 86:4-5; 113:3-10; 117:2-5). He testified, too, that once he returned to a standing position after his fall, he looked down and could see that the valve box was open. (Scott Armstrong Dep. 86:4-5; 113:3-10; 117:2-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Shortly after he stood up, Armstrong saw his friend Kendra Cook walking into the Lakes from the parking lot. (Scott Armstrong Dep. 118:10-14; 119:1-4). He called her over and asked her to find his wife Julie. (Scott Armstrong Dep. 119:19-20). Julie Armstrong soon arrived at the scene, and she helped her husband walk to his car and then drove him home. (Julie Armstrong Dep. 33:19-20: Scott Armstrong Dep. 136:18-20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Chris Haunty is the Lakes' superintendent. (Haunty Dep. 8:4-21). He is responsible for maintaining the grounds, including the lawns, flower beds, parking lots, and entryways, and he also oversees the drainage, irrigation, and watering system at the golf course. (Haunty Dep. Ex.10). The parties do not know why or when the valve-box lid was removed, and Haunty testified at his deposition that in the days leading up to September 19, 2014, no Lakes employees performed work on the valve box where Armstrong fell. (Haunty Dep. 46:21-47:4; 48:18-23; Spragg Dep. 245:8-21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Based on photographs taken the day after the accident, Haunty does not believe that the grass near the valve box had been recently mowed. (Haunty Dep. 82:17-23; 83:3-5). According to Haunty, the area where Armstrong fell was mowed on a weekly basis in the summer, but that mowing slowed down in September when the grass stopped growing as quickly. (Haunty Dep. 82:17-23; 83:3-5; 108:3-10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} James Spragg is the Chief Operating Officer of the Lakes. (Spragg Dep. 9:11-18). Lakes' officials first learned on the morning of September 20, 2014, about Armstrong's injury. (Spragg Dep. 18:20-23). Spragg testified at a deposition that he never saw or heard about anyone-other than Armstrong-walking across the mulched area where Armstrong was injured. (Spragg Dep. 54:12-17; 55:1-21; 56:4-21). According to Spragg, the area where Armstrong fell is not utilized by the Lakes for any club activities or as a walkway. (Spragg Dep. 60:1-6). Rather, Spragg testified that \"[t]here is a concrete walkway that is lit from the lower parking lot that our members take to that [patio bar] area as well as the golf area which is exactly\n   what the Lakes would want[.]\" (Spragg Dep. 69:11-15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} On July 5, 2016, Appellants Scott and Julie Armstrong filed a Complaint against Appellee Lakes Golf and Country Club, Inc. setting forth claims for premises liability negligence and loss of consortium.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 13} On April 29, 2017, Appellee filed a Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 14} On May 5, 2017, Appellants filed a Memorandum Contra to Appellee's Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 15} By Judgment entry filed July 14, 2017, the trial court granted Appellee's motion for summary judgment finding that the hole Appellant stepped into was open and obvious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Appellants now appeal, assigning the following error for review:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 17} \"I.

The moving party cannot discharge its initial burden under Civ.R. 56 simply by making a conclusory assertion the nonmoving party has no evidence to prove its case. Rather, the moving party must be able to specifically point to some evidence of the type listed in Civ.R. 56(C) which affirmatively demonstrates the nonmoving party has no evidence to support the nonmoving party's claims. If the moving party fails to satisfy its initial burden, the motion for summary judgment must be denied. However, if the moving party has satisfied its initial burden, the nonmoving party then has a reciprocal burden outlined\n   in Civ.R. 56(E) to set forth specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial and, if the nonmovant does not so respond, summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against the nonmoving party.\" The record on summary judgment must be viewed in the light most favorable to the opposing party.\n   <em>\n    Williams v.
