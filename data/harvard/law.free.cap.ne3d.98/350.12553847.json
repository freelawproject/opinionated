Box 499, Sidney, Ohio 45365, Attorneys for Defendant-Appellee\n </attorneys>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-7\">\n   WELBAUM, P.J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   {\u00b6 1} This case is before us on the pro se appeal of Plaintiff-Appellant, Gerald Dibert, from an order requiring him to pay $25 per month, beginning in July 2017, to satisfy a judgment of $411.30 in court costs. The order also overruled various motions Dibert had filed, including a motion for recusal, a motion for an order appointing a new judge, and a motion to dismiss the show cause hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In support of his appeal, Dibert contends that the trial court committed plain error by proceeding without jurisdiction; that the court erred by proceeding with a show cause hearing when no contempt motion had been filed; that the court erred in refusing to correct the record; and that the trial judge erred by refusing to recuse herself when she had twice before filed orders of recusal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} We conclude that the trial court erred in filing an order requiring Dibert to show cause why he should not be held in contempt, and in filing an entry reflecting that a show cause hearing for contempt had been held. Because court costs are a civil debt, the trial court could not file a show cause order seeking contempt, but, instead, was required to use only methods provided for the collection of civil judgments. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court will be reversed in part, and this cause will be remanded to the trial court for further proceedings. In all other respects, the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I. Facts and Course of Proceedings\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} This appeal is related to a probate action involving Dibert and Defendant-Appellee, Cynthia Carpenter, which has been\n   before us on a number of prior occasions. In discussing the factual background, we will refer only generally to two cases in which we issued opinions and will not include various decisions and entries that are referenced in the appellate opinions. The case's factual background is complicated and is not particularly relevant here, since the matters at issue occurred after the trial court entered a final judgment on the parties' substantive claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 5} In essence, this case involves two siblings, Dibert and Carpenter, who have, for years, been litigating issues regarding two trusts established by their grandfather in 1975. In November 2007, Dibert filed a complaint against Carpenter, individually, and in her capacity as a trustee. Carpenter responded by filing several counterclaims against Dibert in January 2008.\n   <em>\n    Dibert v. Carpenter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017-Ohio-689\">\n    2017-Ohio-689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=85%20N.E.3d%20419\">\n    85 N.E.3d 419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 14-15 (2d Dist.) (\n   <em>\n    Dibert II\n   </em>\n   ). Nothing of particular note occurred until the trial judge (Judge Reisinger) recused herself and another newly-elected judge from the case shortly after Judge Reisinger assumed office in February 2009. The recusal was based on a conflict of interest, and a retired judge was appointed to hear the case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In 2011, we considered Dibert's appeal and Carpenter's cross-appeal from interlocutory decisions of the trial court. We concluded that Dibert's claim for fraudulent inducement to transfer real property from one trust to another was barred by the statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dibert v. Carpenter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6947616\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/196/1/\">\n    196 Ohio App.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011-Ohio-5691\">\n    2011-Ohio-5691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=961%20N.E.2d%201217\">\n    961 N.E.2d 1217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 35 (2d Dist.) (\n   <em>\n    Dibert I\n   </em>\n   ). At that time, we also dismissed Carpenter's cross-appeal, which involved the trial court's denial of her motion for partial summary judgment on Dibert's claim for conversion. We concluded that the order denying summary judgment was not a final appealable order because such orders are interlocutory. In addition, issues for equitable accounting, conversion, and unjust enrichment were still pending.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 40-41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 7} After the case was remanded, the parties reached agreement in November 2012 concerning Dibert's complaint, with Carpenter agreeing that she owed $120,000 to one of the trusts (the \"Pickering Trust\"). The trial court filed an agreed entry addressing distribution of the assets in that trust, and no appeal was taken.\n   <em>\n    Dibert II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017-Ohio-689\">\n    2017-Ohio-689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=85%20N.E.3d%20419\">\n    85 N.E.3d 419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 24. Trial was then scheduled on Carpenter's counterclaims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25. However, in June 2013, the assigned judge recused himself, and Judge Reisinger filed an order indicating that she would be the presiding judge for purposes of finalizing the mater.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26. In August 2013, Dibert's counsel raised questions about the judge's personal contact with litigants and/or persons close to the litigants; however, the request to recuse was withdrawn following a conference with the court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Trial began before Judge Reisinger on October 22, 2013, at which time the court overruled Dibert's motion for leave to amend his answer to the counterclaims. The purpose of the amendment was to add claims relating to the other trust (the \"Dibert Trust\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31. During a second day of trial on October 31, 2013, the judge orally granted Dibert's motion to reconsider in part, and let Dibert file only his motion for leave, not his proposed amended answer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 9} During a third day of trial on November 27, 2013, it appeared that testimony might be required from Judge Reisinger's father. The court, therefore, called a recess to let the parties consider this issue. During the recess, Dibert filed his motion for leave to file the amended answer, and the court later orally overruled the motion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33-34. After the recess,\n   Dibert indicated that he intended to call the judge's father as a witness; as a result, Judge Reisinger again recused herself to avoid any perception of a conflict of interest.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 10} A retired judge from another county was appointed to hear the matter, but before the certificate of assignment was filed in the trial court, Judge Reisinger issued entries outlining the events and oral rulings that had occurred on October 22 and 31, and November 27, 2013.\n   <em>\n    Dibert II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017-Ohio-689\">\n    2017-Ohio-689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=85%20N.E.3d%20419\">\n    85 N.E.3d 419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 36. Subsequently, the assigned trial judge reviewed Dibert's motion for leave to file an amended answer, and overruled the motion in September 2014. This was shortly before the scheduled trial date, but trial did not occur at that time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38-39. In January 2015, the judge reviewed the chronology of proceedings and again affirmed the denial of Dibert's motion for leave to amend his answer. However, the judge also concluded that Dibert should have been allowed to file his proposed answer and counterclaim. The judge, therefore ordered that Dibert could file the document at any time before trial began on January 15, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 11} The trial was ultimately completed in February 2015, and the court entered judgment in May 2015 in favor of the successor of the Dibert Trust on four of the counterclaims against Dibert. The judgment ordered Dibert to pay the trust a total of $287,786.32.\n   <em>\n    Dibert II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017-Ohio-689\">\n    2017-Ohio-689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=85%20N.E.3d%20419\">\n    85 N.E.3d 419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 2 and 43. At the time judgment was rendered, Carpenter had withdrawn three counterclaims, and the court had dismissed several of her other counterclaims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 12} After Dibert appealed from the judgment, we remanded the case on a limited basis to let the trial court consider Carpenter's motion for attorney fees. On remand, the court awarded Carpenter $105,127 in attorney fees and $719.50 in deposition costs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 45. When the case returned to our court, we affirmed the judgment of the trial court with respect to both the money judgment on the counterclaims and the award of attorney fees and deposition costs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 116. Our opinion was filed on February 24, 2017. We then overruled Dibert's motion for reconsideration of our opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dibert v. Carpenter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017-Ohio-689\">\n    2017-Ohio-689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=85%20N.E.3d%20419\">\n    85 N.E.3d 419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Dist.)

Case No. 2017-0711. On January 31, 2018, the Supreme Court of Ohio declined to accept jurisdiction of Dibert's appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12284865,12284772,12284805,12284783,12284817,12284849,12284758,12284732,12284830\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio/2018/365/\">\n    2018-Ohio-365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Dibert has filed a motion asking the Supreme Court to reconsider its decision to decline jurisdiction, which remains pending before the Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The record certified to our court from the trial court in connection with the current appeal contains 35 docket entries, dated from November 10, 2015, through July 10, 2017. 26 of these entries are irrelevant, as they are dated prior to our decision of February 24, 2017 (and deal with matters like certifying the transcript for that particular appellate case). The first pertinent entry, Doc. # 27, is a journal entry filed by Judge Reisinger on April 25, 2017. This entry states, in relevant part, that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff, Gerald Dibert has failed to pay his outstanding Court costs in the above-referenced manner.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Therefore, a show cause hearing is scheduled before Administrative Judge Lori L.

A few hours before the scheduled contempt hearing, the judge filed an entry indicating she would address all the pending motions at the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 16} A transcript of the May 9, 2017 contempt hearing has been filed. Dibert appeared at the hearing without counsel, and no other parties to the case were present. Dibert objected to the court's use of a show cause order for civil costs, contending that court costs are civil debts. In response, the judge stated that: \"I didn't say it was for contempt. I'm showing cause why there's a court order that you pay costs and they have not been paid.\" Transcript of May 9, 2017 Proceedings, p. 3. After further discussion, Dibert again asked the court to dismiss the show cause hearing, citing\n   <em>\n    Galluzzo v. Galluzzo\n   </em>\n   , 2d Dist.

At this point, the trial judge commented that \"the Supreme Court had made different rules\" since our decision, and that\n   <em>\n    Galluzzo\n   </em>\n   \"was no longer good law.\" Transcript at p. 9. The court then stated that \"We'll take as little as $25 a month, if you would like.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%204536836\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Although Dibert asserted that he could not afford to pay the costs, the court eventually obtained his agreement to pay $25 per month on the costs, beginning July 15, 2017, and continuing on the 15th of each month thereafter, until the debt was paid.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 11-12. The judge also stated during the hearing that she was only there to collect the court costs, and that the trial court had done, with respect to the record, everything the court of appeals had requested. This was in response to the motion to correct the record.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 18} On May 11, 2017, the trial judge filed an entry stating that \"the matter came on to be heard for a show cause hearing as to why Gerard Dibert should not be\n   <em>\n    held in contempt for failing to follow the Court's May 17, 2015 Order, ordering him to pay costs\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) Doc. # 33, Journal Entry, p. 1. The judge further noted that Dibert had agreed to pay $25 per month beginning July 15, 2017, until the costs were paid in full. In addition, the judge overruled the motions and objections Dibert had filed,\n   but did not provide any further reasoning for these rulings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Dibert timely appealed, pro se, from the judgment filed on May 11, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   II. Alleged Error Concerning Show Cause Order\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Dibert's First Assignment of Error states that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Judge Lori L. Reisinger Committed Plain Error by Proceeding Without Jurisdiction When She Entered a Journal Entry Ordering Appellant to Appear and Show Cause to Explain Why Appellant Should Not Be Held in Contempt for Non-Payment of Court Costs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Under this assignment of error, Dibert contends that the trial court erred by filing a contempt citation when that is an improper procedure for collecting civil costs. Dibert further contends that the court ignored case law and erroneously represented that our decision in\n   <em>\n    Galluzzo,\n   </em>\n   2d Dist. Champaign No. 2012 CA 43,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013-Ohio-3647\">\n    2013-Ohio-3647\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , had been overruled. According to Dibert, the cases that\n   <em>\n    Galluzzo\n   </em>\n   cited, are, in fact, contained in a document the Supreme Court of Ohio updated in May 2017. The document that Dibert cites is entitled \"Bench Card References: Collection of Court Costs and Fines in Adult Trial Courts.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Carpenter has filed a brief, and notes that the trial court's ruling on collection of court costs does not affect her. Brief of Defendant-Appellee, Cynthia Sue Carpenter, p. 5, fn. 3. Nonetheless, Carpenter contends that Dibert waived his right to appeal, because he entered into an agreement to pay the court costs. In support of her position, Carpenter cites cases dealing with oral settlement agreements entered into by parties to a case.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mullins v. Zelnick\n   </em>\n   , 2d Dist.

Although Carpenter is not affected by the collection issue, we conclude that we should address this issue before considering the merits of this assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 23} In\n   <em>\n    Mullins\n   </em>\n   , we held that \"[w]here the parties in an action enter into an oral settlement agreement in the presence of the court, such agreement constitutes a binding contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2, citing\n   <em>\n    Spercel v.

The fact that a settlement agreement may be binding does not mean that the right to appeal has been waived; a party could still file an appeal, but the appeal would likely not succeed. Consistent with this point,\n   <em>\n    Mullins\n   </em>\n   simply indicated that settlement agreements between parties are binding and may not be avoided by a party's failure to sign a consent judgment entry.\n   <em>\n    Mullins\n   </em>\n   at *2. We did not state in\n   <em>\n    Mullins\n   </em>\n   that the appeal had been waived. We also noted that the party challenging the settlement agreement in\n   <em>\n    Mullins\n   </em>\n   did not file a motion to vacate the agreement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=285%20N.E.2d%20324\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In contrast,\n   <em>\n    Spercel\n   </em>\n   had held that a settlement agreement between parties is binding and may not be rescinded unless one of the parties files a motion to set aside the agreement.\n   <em>\n    Spercel\n   </em>\n   at 41,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=285%20N.E.2d%20324\">\n    285 N.E.2d 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 24} In\n   <em>\n    Spercel\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court of Ohio also commented on the facts of that case. Specifically, almost two years after the settlement, defense counsel notified the plaintiff that counsel was filing a motion asking the trial court to enter a nunc pro tunc entry concerning the settlement.

The court of appeals subsequently held that the right to bring irregularities before the EBR and courts was too important to be waived by agreement. However, the Supreme Court of Ohio disagreed.

This is not comparable to situations in which a party is ordered to appear in court on purported contempt charges. More importantly, Dibert objected prior to trial and during the hearing, before the judge indicated that his objections were not valid.

Furthermore, even if Dibert made any payments, the judgment\n   would not have been satisfied by its own terms for more than 16 months, or in October or November 2018. While mootness of an appeal should not be based on how long an appellate court takes to resolve an appeal, the fact is that there is no evidence in the record that the judgment for court costs has been fully satisfied. As a result, the trial court could still require Dibert to appear for another \"show cause\" hearing. Accordingly, we conclude that the issue of whether the trial court properly attempted to collect court costs is not moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 36} As was noted, the trial court ordered Dibert into court by using a \"show cause\" order, which ordered Dibert to show cause why he should not be held in contempt for failure to pay court costs. R.C. 2705.02 outlines various acts, including disobedience of a court judgment, that are considered contempt of court, and R.C. 2705.03 provides that in such cases, \"a charge in writing shall be filed with the clerk of the court, an entry thereof made upon the journal, and an opportunity given to the accused to be heard, by himself or counsel. This section does not prevent the court from issuing process to bring the accused into court, or from holding him in custody, pending such proceedings.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 37} When Dibert appeared and challenged the court's authority to proceed in this manner, the court told Dibert that the case upon which he had relied (\n   <em>\n    Galluzzo\n   </em>\n   , 2d Dist.

Despite the plain wording in the order, the court also denied during the hearing that it was attempting to hold Dibert in contempt. And finally, contrary to the court's comments during the hearing, the order that was filed thereafter indicated that \"the matter came on to be heard for a show cause hearing as to why Gerard Dibert should not be held\n   <em>\n    in contempt\n   </em>\n   for failing to follow the Court's May 17, 2015 Order, ordering him to pay costs.\" (Emphasis added.)

The court could not file a show cause order, indicating the party summoned was to appear in court to show cause why he should not be held in contempt, and then state during the hearing that the court was not holding a contempt hearing. Furthermore, despite the court's indication that it was not holding a contempt hearing, the judgment entry filed thereafter indicated that Dibert had appeared at a hearing to show cause why he should not be held in contempt and that he had agreed to a schedule for paying costs. The clear implication from this order is that Dibert could be summoned to court again on a show cause order for contempt if he failed to comply with the payment schedule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   {\u00b6 47} This was simply a way of doing indirectly what we prohibited in\n   <em>\n    Galluzzo\n   </em>\n   and other cases.

As a result, the trial court erred in this regard as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   {\u00b6 56} Based on the preceding discussion, the First Assignment of Error is sustained. Our decision is not intended to indicate that trial courts may not assess court costs or that Dibert is not required to pay the court costs that were apparently assessed (the entry assessing costs is not in the record before us). Instead, trial courts must collect judgments for court costs using appropriate civil enforcement mechanisms rather than issuing show cause orders. This is consistent with R.C. 2101.23, which restricts the probate court's power to issue contempt orders by stating that: \"If a person neglects or refuses to perform an order or judgment of a probate court,\n   <em>\n    other than for the payment of money\n   </em>\n   , the person is guilty of contempt of court, and the judge shall issue a summons directing the person to appear before the court within two days from the service of the summons and show cause why the person should not be punished for contempt.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   III. Lack of Written Charge of Contempt\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   {\u00b6 57} Dibert's Second Assignment of Error states that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   The Champaign County Family Court Judge Reisinger Erred When She Failed to Dismiss the Show Cause Hearing Upon Written Motion for Lack of a Filed Charge of Contempt, Which Is a Violation of Due Process and Therefore a Failure of Jurisdiction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   {\u00b6 58} Under this assignment of error, Dibert contends that the trial court erred by failing to comply with the requirements for show cause orders, which require the court to file a charge in writing and provide various procedural safeguards. Because we have already concluded that the trial court erred in issuing a show cause order for contempt, this assignment of error is overruled as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   IV. Motion to Correct the Record\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   {\u00b6 59} Dibert's Third Assignment of Error states that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   In the Alternative, If this Court Decides that Judge Reisinger Had Jurisdiction as a Result of the Order of April 25, 2017, Then Plain Error Was Committed When She Denied the Motion to Correct the Record.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   {\u00b6 60} Under this assignment of error, Dibert contends that even if the trial court had jurisdiction to hear the contempt order, the court committed plain error by refusing to correct the record to certify that a proposed answer and counterclaim was in the court's file. The trial court's only response to this issue at the hearing was that the court had done everything that the court of appeals told it to do.
