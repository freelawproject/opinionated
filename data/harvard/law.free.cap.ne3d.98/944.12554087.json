The magistrate found that the commission violated relator's right to due process of law when it denied relator's PTD application on the basis of voluntary abandonment of the workforce without giving relator an opportunity to present evidence on that issue. Therefore, the magistrate has recommended that we grant a limited writ of mandamus that provides relator the opportunity to address the issue of voluntary workforce abandonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The commission has filed objections to the magistrate's decision. In its first objection, the commission argues that the magistrate erred when it found that relator's right to due process of law was violated because the commission sua sponte denied relator's PTD application on the basis of voluntary workforce abandonment. Essentially, the commission argues that the issue of voluntary abandonment is always a part of a PTD determination because a claimant is not entitled to PTD compensation if he or she has voluntarily abandoned the workforce. The commission's argument is misguided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} We agree that a claimant is not entitled to PTD compensation if he or she has voluntarily abandoned the workforce and that this issue potentially can be raised in connection with any PTD application. However, voluntary abandonment of the workforce is an affirmative defense. Therefore, the burden of proof falls upon the employer or the administrator.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Black v. Indus.

The commission may also raise this issue sua sponte.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Garrison v. Indus. Comm.\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist. No. 08AP-419,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009-Ohio-2898\">\n    2009-Ohio-2898\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%201709041\">\n    2009 WL 1709041\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 46-47. We agree with the magistrate that due process of law principles require that relator receive notice that the issue of voluntary workforce abandonment has been raised and relator must be given the opportunity to address that issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Here, it is uncontested that no party raised or argued the issue of voluntary workforce abandonment at the hearing. Nor did the staff hearing officer (\"SHO\") raise the issue during the hearing. It appears that the SHO raised this issue for the first time in the decision denying relator's PTD application. Therefore, relator had no reason to address this issue at the hearing. We agree with the magistrate that the commission violated relator's due process rights by denying his PTD application on the basis of voluntary workforce abandonment without giving relator sufficient notice and an opportunity to present evidence on that issue. For this reason, we overrule the commission's first objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In its second objection, the commission contends that the magistrate erred by failing to apply the holding in\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Roxbury v. Indus. Comm.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4183063\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/138/91/\">\n    138 Ohio St.3d 91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014-Ohio-84\">\n    2014-Ohio-84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=3%20N.E.3d%201190\">\n    3 N.E.3d 1190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Again, we disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 7}\n   <em>\n    Roxbury\n   </em>\n   provides guidance regarding what the commission may consider in deciding whether a claimant has voluntarily abandoned the workforce. However,\n   <em>\n    Roxbury\n   </em>\n   is irrelevant to the magistrate's due process analysis. Until relator has the opportunity to address the issue of voluntary workforce abandonment,\n   <em>\n    Roxbury\n   </em>\n   has no application. Therefore, we overrule the commission's second objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Following an independent review of this matter, we find that the magistrate has properly determined the facts and applied the appropriate law. Therefore, we adopt the decision as our own, including the findings of fact and conclusions of law contained therein. In accordance with the magistrate's decision, we grant a limited writ of mandamus and order the commission to vacate the November 12, 2015 order of its SHO and to conduct further proceedings that allow relator the opportunity to rebut the allegation of voluntary workforce abandonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Objections overruled; limited writ of mandamus granted.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   BROWN and SADLER, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     APPENDIX\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF OHIO\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   TENTH APPELLATE DISTRICT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The State ex rel.

On November 12, 2003, relator injured his left shoulder and cervical area while employed as a janitor for respondent Northwestern Schools, a state-fund employer under Ohio's workers' compensation laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 11} 2. The industrial claim (No. 03-461176) is allowed for:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Left shoulder sprain ; cervical sprain ; left shoulder contusion; left shoulder tendonosis; aggravation of pre-existing osteoarthritis of the left shoulder; aggravation of pre-existing degenerative disc disease ; disc herniation at C5-6 and C6-7.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 12} 3. In January 2004, relator underwent surgery to the cervical spine. The surgery is described as: \"Posterior cervical laminectomy at C5, 6, and 7 with foraminotomies at C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 bilaterally.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 13} 4. On October 26, 2012, relator filed his first application for PTD compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 14} 5. On January 31, 2013, at the commission's request, relator was examined by Eugene Lin, M.D. In his four-page narrative report, Dr. Lin opines:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Review of the medical records shows the claimant was able to tolerate work due to the conditions within the scope of this claim at a medium physical demand level. Current physical examination shows no persistence of any focal motor or sensory deficits. There is good range of motion of the left shoulder. Recent treatment has been chiropractic treatment for self-limited muscle spasms. As such, based on the allowed conditions the claimant would be able to continue to work in a medium demand category.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 15} 6. On February 15, 2013, Dr. Lin completed a Physical Strength Rating form. On the form, Dr. Lin indicated by his mark that relator is capable of \"medium work.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 16} 7. Following an April 10, 2013 hearing, an SHO issued an order denying relator's first PTD application. For the determination of residual functional capacity, Ohio Adm.Code 4121-3-34(B)(4), the SHO relied exclusively on the report of Dr. Lin and his finding that relator is capable of medium work. The SHO's order also considers the non-medical disability factors. The SHO's order concludes that relator \"is capable of sustained gainful employment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 17} 8. On December 26, 2013, relator filed his second PTD application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 18} 9. On February 10, 2014, at the commission's request, relator was examined by James J. Sardo, M.D. In his four-page narrative report, Dr. Sardo opines \"injured worker is capable of medium work.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 19} 10. On February 10, 2014, Dr. Sardo completed a Physical Strength Rating form. On the form, Dr. Sardo indicated by his mark that relator is capable of \"medium work.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 20} 11. Following an April 1, 2014 hearing, an SHO issued an order denying relator's second PTD application. For the determination of residual functional capacity, the SHO relied exclusively on the report of Dr. Sardo and his finding that relator is capable of medium work. The SHO's order also considers the non-medical disability factors. The SHO's order of April 1, 2014 concludes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Finally, the Staff Hearing Officer notes the Injured Worker previously requested permanent total disability compensation and such was denied by order issued 04/16/2013. There is no evidence since that decision to indicate the Injured Worker attempted a return to work or initiated a retraining or rehabilitation program in order to facilitate a return to the work force. This is a factor against the application for permanent total disability compensation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Accordingly, finding the Injured Worker physically capable of up to medium strength work and noting the Injured Worker's education and work experience are vocational assets for a return to work as well as the fact that the Injured Worker has made no recent attempt to return to the work force, the Staff Hearing Officer finds the allowed conditions do not render the Injured Worker permanently and totally disabled.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 21} 12. On June 10, 2015, relator filed his third application for PTD compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 22} 13. On July 27, 2015, at the commission's request, relator was examined by John W. Cunningham, M.D. In his four-page narrative report, Dr. Cunningham opined:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   In my medical opinion, this individual is capable of sedentary physical work activity, provided he is not asked to use his arms at or above mid-chest level, and provided he is not asked to lift, carry, push, pull, or otherwise move objects greater than 5 lbs. with either or both hands above mid-chest level.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 23} 14. On July 27, 2015, Dr. Cunningham completed a Physical Strength Rating form. On the form, Dr. Cunningham indicated by his mark that relator is capable of \"sedentary work.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 24} 15. On November 12, 2015, relator's third PTD application was heard by an SHO. The hearing was not recorded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 25} 16. Following the November 12, 2015 hearing, the SHO issued an order denying the third PTD application based on a finding that relator voluntarily abandoned the workforce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 26} On the order, the SHO indicates that \"Mr. Barnhart\" and his client, \"Mr. Jenkins,\" appeared. The order also indicates that \"Mr. Goins\" appeared for the administrator of the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation (\"bureau\"). No one appeared for the employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Mailed November 14, 2015, the SHO's order of November 12, 2015 explains:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   The Injured Worker is found to have voluntarily abandoned his employment. Therefore, the Injured Worker has no wages to replace, and he is not entitled to permanent total disability compensation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   The Injured Worker last worked in 2011, when he was 62 years of age. The Injured Worker testified at hearing that he began to receive Social Security Retirement benefits in 2011, when he first qualified for these benefits. There is no evidence that the Injured Worker ever attempted to return to work after 2011.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   The Injured Worker was previously denied permanent total disability by the Industrial Commission at hearing on 04/10/2013. The Hearing Officer in that decision found based on the report of Eugene Lin, M.D., the Injured Worker related to the allowed claim retained the capacity to perform work of a medium nature. The Injured Worker after the 04/10/2013 order was issued never attempted to return to work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   The Injured Worker was again denied permanent total disability by the Commission\n   after a hearing on 04/01/2014. The Hearing Officer in that decision relied upon the 02/10/2014 report from James Sardo, M.D. Dr. Sardo found the Injured Worker related to the allowed claim was able to perform work at the medium classification. The Injured Worker after this decision was issued never attempted to return to work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   Related to the Injured Worker's most recent application for Permanent Total Disability, the Injured Worker was examined on behalf of the Industrial Commission by John Cunningham, M.D. on 07/27/2015. Dr. Cunningham's report is on record and is dated 08/05/2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   Dr. Cunningham states in this report that the Injured Worker told the Doctor he last worked in 2011, the year he retired. Dr. Cunningham states further the Injured Worker reported to him that his symptoms are worse in the last year and that his symptoms have progressed as he has grown older.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   Dr. Cunningham does find a significant difference in the Injured Worker's condition compared with the prior reports from Dr. Lin and Dr. Sardo. Dr. Cunningham states in his report that presently the Injured Worker is limited to sedentary work related to the allowed claim. Dr. Cunningham's findings would be consistent with the Injured Worker's reported statements to Dr. Cunningham that he has gotten worse in the last year.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   The Injured Worker has on two previous occasions in 2013 and 2014 been found capable of working related to the allowed claim. The Injured Worker after these previous findings never made any attempt to rehabilitate himself or return to work. The Injured Worker appears to have retired for reasons unrelated to the allowed claim and to have voluntarily left the work force.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   The Courts have consistently stated that an award of permanent total disability is an award of last resort, and that an Injured Worker prior to qualifying for this award, where he is deemed to have the potential to return to work, must make a good faith effort to return to work. The Injured Worker has not made any effort to return to work after either of the previous denials of his applications for permanent total disability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   The Courts have also stated that an award of permanent total is not made simply because an Injured Worker has grown older. The Injured Worker's condition, based on the report from Dr. Cunningham, does appear to have worsened since the last denial of permanent total disability compensation in this claim. However, the Injured Worker has never returned to work since 2011. The Injured Worker reportedly told Dr. Cunningham that he retired in 2011. The Injured Worker after previous denials of permanent total disability never attempted a return to work. The Injured Worker has previously been found capable of working and he has never made any attempt to return to work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Because the Injured Worker abandoned the workforce, he has no wages to replace, and he is not entitled to an award of permanent total disability compensation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 28} 17. On November 23, 2015, on form C-86, relator timely moved for the commission's reconsideration of the SHO's order of November 12, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 29} 18. On the C-86 form, in the space provided for description of the request, relator stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   Now comes claimant and moves the Industrial Commission to grant reconsideration on the denial of the permanent\n   total disability from the order issued from [sic] by Staff Hearing Officer Havener on November 12, 2015. The SHO committed a clear mistake of law by adjudicating the issue of voluntary abandonment when no argument was raised below by either the administrator or by the hearing officer in his questioning of the injured worker prior to making a decision. This is a clear error of law according to [\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Stevens v. Indus. Comm.\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist. No. 10AP-1147,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012-Ohio-4408\">\n    2012-Ohio-4408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%204497817\">\n    2012 WL 4497817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ]. Furthermore, the previous two orders of the Industrial Commission on the denial of permanent total disability have never raised the issue of voluntary abandonment. Consequently, the matter should be considered to be res judicata, or at least collaterally estopped.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 30} In support of the motion, relator, through counsel, submitted a memorandum in support of reconsideration and the affidavit of David B. Barnhart, Esq., who appeared at the November 12, 2015 hearing for relator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 31} The Barnhart affidavit avers in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   I am an attorney licensed to practice law before the Supreme Court of the State of Ohio, and have been so licensed since November of 1981.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   Since November of 1981, I have practiced exclusively in the area of workers' compensation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   On November 12, 2015, I traveled to Portsmouth, Ohio to appear before Staff Hearing Officer John Havener on the claim file of Ralph Jenkins, claim no. 03-461176.

The reason for this is that the administrative representative, Mr. Goins, never raised the question of voluntary abandonment. His argument was limited to approximately two sentences. (1) The hearing officer should rely upon previous two denials; and (2) Dr. Cunningham indicated the claimant could engage in sedentary work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   Mr. Havener questioned Mr. Jenkins about his employment history. Mr. Jenkins responded to the questions and indicated that, \"He and his wife worked at a doctor's office doing cleaning of the doctor's offices two days a week, for one hour each day.\" Mr. Jenkins indicated his wife did more of the heavier work, such as mopping and sweeping, and Mr. Jenkins cleaned the offices or performed the trash removal.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   At no time, did Mr. Havener inquire of me or Mr. Jenkins about the issue of \"voluntary abandonment.\" Mr. Goins never uttered the phrase voluntary abandonment in the course of his argument.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   I did not address the issue of voluntary abandonment inasmuch as it was not raised by any of the parties at the hearing. Mr. Havener did not phrase any question regarding the issue of voluntary abandonment. His inquiry was limited strictly to what Mr. Jenkins did for the doctor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   Mr. Jenkins then testified about his difficulties with education, the fact that he did graduate from high school at age 19, after being held back a number of years,\n   and his education being primarily in special education classes. He then testified about his other work experience which is that of a truck driver.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   At no time were we given the opportunity to address or argue the question of voluntary abandonment inasmuch as there was never a question raised by the hearing officer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   {\u00b6 32} 19.

Nor does our record reflect any steps taken by relator to complete the record in any other ways. A silent record does not change the applicable burdens under the facts of this case, however. The relator, not the respondent, bears the burden to prove entitlement to mandamus relief, and a relator may not avoid that burden simply by noting the absence of a transcript. Just as this court concluded in\n   <em>\n    Ormet\n   </em>\n   , we conclude here that, if there is a deficiency in the record, it is because relator failed in her burden of proof. Having failed to meet her burden, she is not entitled to relief in mandamus on the question of continuing jurisdiction, and we sustain the commission's objection to the magistrate's decision.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <strong>\n    The Commission's Authority to Sua Sponte Raise an Issue in Adjudicating a PTD Application\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   {\u00b6 54} In\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Nothing in the\n   <em>\n    Quarto Mining\n   </em>\n   case prohibited the SHO from questioning relator regarding the circumstances of his October 30, 2003 job departure and on that basis entering a determination on the issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   While the\n   <em>\n    Quarto Mining\n   </em>\n   court placed the burden on the employer to raise and produce evidence on the retirement issue, it did not prohibit the commission itself from undertaking the burden of raising the issue and producing evidence by questioning the PTD claimant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 46-47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   {\u00b6 55} The magistrate notes that this court adopted the magistrate's decision as its own, including the findings of fact and conclusions of law.

On motion for reconsideration, relator claimed a deprivation of due process of law because the bureau's representative at the hearing, Mr. Goins, did not raise the issue of workforce abandonment, nor did the SHO mention workforce abandonment at the hearing. According to relator, because the issue was not raised at the hearing, he had no reason to endeavor to rebut the issue at the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   {\u00b6 59} According to relator, because the SHO\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   addressed workforce abandonment\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the hearing and the commission refused to grant reconsideration, relator was deprived of due process of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   {\u00b6 60} As the\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   case instructs, relator has the burden of proof in this mandamus action to show by clear and convincing evidence his entitlement to the writ.\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   instructs as to how an unrecorded hearing can be remedied by a party who bears the burden of proof. That is, relator can file an affidavit as to what transpired at the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   {\u00b6 61} Here, relator's counsel did file an affidavit averring that workforce abandonment was not raised by the bureau at the hearing, and that the SHO failed to indicate at the hearing that workforce abandonment was an issue to be addressed by the SHO in the order to be issued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   {\u00b6 62} Significantly, the bureau could have offered an opposing affidavit but did not do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   {\u00b6 63} Under the circumstances, the magistrate finds that relator has met his burden in this mandamus action showing that relator was deprived of due process of law by the absence of any meaningful notice that workforce abandonment would be sua sponte addressed in the order adjudicating the PTD application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   {\u00b6 64} Accordingly, it is the magistrate's decision that this court issue a writ of mandamus ordering the commission to vacate the November 12, 2015 order of its SHO that denies the PTD application, and to conduct further proceedings that allow relator the opportunity to rebut the allegation of voluntary workforce abandonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   <em>\n    /S/ MAGISTRATE\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   KENNETH W.
