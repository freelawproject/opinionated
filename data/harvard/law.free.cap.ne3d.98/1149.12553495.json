The following testimony was presented by Sergeant Comstock at the hearing:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Shortly after 3:00 a.m. on March 27, 2016, Sgt. Comstock was on routine patrol when he observed a man, later identified as Defendant-Appellant Kwame Imani, slumped over the steering wheel of a vehicle parked on the side of a public roadway. (Supp. T. at 5-6, 60). Sgt. Comstock parked behind the vehicle without his overhead lights activated, exited his cruiser and approached the parked vehicle from the passenger side to conduct a welfare check on Appellant. (Supp. T. at 6, 61). Sgt. Comstock was shining his flashlight into the vehicle as he approached, and he observed that Appellant was looking at his cell phone. (Supp. T. at 7). When Appellant noticed the light, he appeared startled so Sgt. Comstock shined the light on his badge, identified himself as the police, and asked if Appellant was okay. (Supp. at 7). Sgt. Comstock testified that if Appellant had responded that he was okay, Sgt. Comstock would have asked for identification to run for warrants, but otherwise he would have left. (Supp. T. at 63-64). Appellant did not tell Sgt. Comstock that everything was fine but instead began frantically moving around, digging in his pockets, and suddenly exited the vehicle. (Supp. T. at 7). Appellant reached in and out of his pockets approximately ten (10) times and jumped out of the vehicle within five (5) seconds. (Supp. T. at 24). Appellant was not ordered out of the vehicle and Sgt. Comstock did not have a weapon drawn. (Supp. T. at 7, 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} When Appellant exited the vehicle, he began digging in his pockets and continually putting his hands down. (Supp. T. at 8). Sgt. Comstock stated that he was concerned by Appellant's behavior in exiting his vehicle abruptly after learning it was the police, and digging in his pockets, so he ordered him to place his hands on top of the vehicle. (Supp. T. at 8). Appellant placed his hands on the top of the vehicle briefly before taking them back off, turning away from Sgt. Comstock, reaching into his front right pocket, completely turning his back to Sgt. Comstock, looking over his shoulder at him, and failing to follow Sgt. Comstock's commands. (Supp. T. at 8-9, 68). From the time Sgt. Comstock first approached the vehicle to the time that Appellant exited the vehicle, turned away from Sgt. Comstock, and was reaching into his pocket, not even thirty (30) seconds had passed. (Supp. T. at 8, 63).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Sgt. Comstock testified that he called dispatch for assistance and secured Appellant for officer safety. (Supp. T. at 9,\n   12, 68-69, 72). Sgt. Comstock stated that he observed something shiny in the front pocket of Appellant's hooded sweatshirt and asked what it was. (Supp. T. at 11, 55-56). Appellant told Sgt. Comstock that he had been drinking and Sgt. Comstock retrieved an open container of alcohol from the pocket. (Supp. T. at 11). Appellant then admitted that he had marijuana on him. (Supp. T. at 11). Appellant's pockets were searched and plastic baggies containing marijuana and cocaine were found on his person. (Supp. T. at 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On November 17, 2016, the trial court denied Appellant's motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On November 23, 2016, Appellant entered a plea of No Contest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On December 19, 2016, the trial court sentenced Appellant to two (2) years of community control, with an alternate sentence of eleven (11) months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Appellant now appeals, setting forth the following assignment of error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 12} \"I.

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 14} There are three methods of challenging on appeal a trial court's ruling on a motion to suppress. First, an appellant may challenge the trial court's findings of fact. In reviewing a challenge of this nature, an appellate court must determine whether said findings of fact are against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    State v. Fanning\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1809976\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/1/19/\">\n    1 Ohio St.3d 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=437%20N.E.2d%20583\">\n    437 N.E.2d 583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1982) ;\n   <em>\n    State v. Klein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1473054\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/73/486/\">\n    73 Ohio App.3d 486\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=597%20N.E.2d%201141\">\n    597 N.E.2d 1141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Dist.1991) ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

Second, an appellant may argue the trial court failed to apply the appropriate test or correct law to the findings of fact. In that case, an appellate court can reverse the trial court for committing an error of law.\n   <em>\n    State v. Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1692088\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/86/37/\">\n    86 Ohio App.3d 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=619%20N.E.2d%201141\">\n    619 N.E.2d 1141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Dist.1993). Finally, assuming the trial court's findings of fact are not against the manifest weight of the evidence and it has properly identified the law to be applied, an appellant may argue the trial court has incorrectly decided the ultimate or final issue raised in the motion to suppress. When reviewing this type of claim, an appellate court must independently determine, without deference to the trial court's conclusion, whether the facts meet the appropriate legal standard in any given case.\n   <em>\n    State v. Curry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1758945\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/95/93/\">\n    95 Ohio App.3d 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=641%20N.E.2d%201172\">\n    641 N.E.2d 1172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Dist.1994) ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

Appellant argues the officers lacked reasonable articulable facts to stop him and conduct an investigation. More specifically, Appellant herein argues that the he was unlawfully seized when the officer shined the flashlight on him and identified himself as a police officer while he was lawfully parked on a public street. Appellant argues the officer had no right to approach\n   the vehicle in which he was sitting and search him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 16} The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Section 14, Article I, Ohio Constitution, prohibit the government from conducting unreasonable searches and seizures of persons or their property.\n   <em>\n    Terry v.
