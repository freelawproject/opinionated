MCARC filed a timely notice of appeal with this Court on May 10, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The incident which forms the basis for the instant appeal occurred on July 18, 2015, at approximately 8:15 p.m., when an individual named Sherry Lapinski was walking her dog, Zoe, down Mesmer Avenue in Dayton, Ohio. Both Lapinski and Squirt's owner, Johnson, lived at residences located on Mesmer Avenue and were previously acquainted with one another. As Lapinski walked Zoe down the street, Johnson's dog, Squirt, jumped its fence and charged Zoe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Squirt bit Zoe on the neck while Lapinski attempted to hit Squirt with an umbrella that she was carrying. Apparently, Lapinski's screams caused Squirt to run away. At some point in time, Lapinski tripped, fell down, and received two minor scratches to her right leg. As a result of a bite to her neck, Zoe was treated by a veterinarian who closed the wound with staples.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Shortly thereafter, the attack was investigated by the MCARC, which designated Squirt as a \"dangerous dog\" in a report generated on July 21, 2015, and filed in the trial court on July 27, 2015. Johnson sent a letter to the trial court requesting a hearing to challenge Squirt's designation as a \"dangerous dog.\" On September 9, 2015, a hearing was held before the magistrate. Lapinski testified on behalf of the MCARC, and Johnson represented herself at the hearing. On October 30, 2015, the magistrate issued a decision reversing the MCARC's designation of Squirt as a \"dangerous dog,\" thereafter designating it as a \"nuisance dog.\" The magistrate found that the factors listed in R.C. 955.11(A)(1)(a) necessary to designate Squirt as a \"dangerous dog\" were not met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 5} MCARC filed objections to the magistrate's decision on November 9, 2015. On April 12, 2016, the trial court issued an entry adopting the decision of the magistrate which designated Squirt to be a \"nuisance dog\" pursuant to R.C. 955.11(A)(3)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 6} It is from this decision that MCARC appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 7} MCARC's sole assignment of error is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 8} \"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY OVERRULING PLAINTIFF-APPELLANT [MCARC]'S OBJECTIONS TO THE MAGISTRATE'S DECISION AND ADOPTING THE MAGISTRATE'S DECISION FINDING THE DOG AT ISSUE IN THIS CASE TO BE A NUISANCE DOG AS OPPOSED TO A DANGEROUS DOG.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 9} In its sole assignment, MCARC contends that the trial court erred when it adopted the magistrate's decision rejecting Squirt's previous designation as a \"dangerous\n   dog\" and thereafter designating it as a \"nuisance dog\" pursuant to R.C. 955.11(A)(3)(a). Specifically, MCARC argues that the trial court's judgment was not supported by sufficient evidence and was against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 10} In\n   <em>\n    State v.

Essentially, MCARC asserts that if not for Squirt leaving his property and attacking Zoe, Lapinski would not have sustained two scratches when she fell down. It is the position of the MCARC that Squirt \"set in motion the chain of events that resulted in injury to *** Lapinski.\" MCARC argues that Squirt caused an injury to a person pursuant to R.C. 955.11(A)(1) and should have been designated a \"dangerous dog.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 18} In support of its argument, MCARC relies upon a case from the Fifth District Court of Appeals,\n   <em>\n    Spangler v. Stark County Dog Warden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013-Ohio-4774\">\n    2013-Ohio-4774\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=999%20N.E.2d%201247\">\n    999 N.E.2d 1247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Dist.). In\n   <em>\n    Spangler\n   </em>\n   , the complaining witness testified that while he was walking his dog, another dog named Shadow tried to attack his dog. When the complaining witness attempted to pull the dogs apart, Shadow bit him in the calf. Because Shadow bit the complaining witness during the altercation, the trial court designated it a \"dangerous dog\" pursuant to R.C. 955.11(A)(1). The appellate court upheld the designation finding that the trial court had before it clear and convincing evidence that Shadow bit the complaining witness \" 'caus[ing] injury' without provocation.\" Upon review,\n   <em>\n    Spangler\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from the case at bar. In\n   <em>\n    Spangler\n   </em>\n   , there was no question that the dog, without provocation, caused the person's injury during the attack.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 19} In the instant case, Squirt's attack was directed at Lapinski's dog, Zoe. Unlike the complaining witness in\n   <em>\n    Spangler\n   </em>\n   who was actually bitten by the dog, there was a lack of evidence adduced at the hearing that the attack on Lapinski's dog involved any attempt to bite, attack, or otherwise bring about injury to Lapinski or any other person. Lapinski acknowledged that she fell and scratched her leg when she tripped. The evidence is thin as to the exact sequence of events and is not clear if the scratches occurred after the altercation ceased. Pursuant to R.C. 955.222(C), \"[i]f the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog disagrees with the designation of the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as applicable, the owner, keeper, or harborer, not later than ten days after receiving notification of the designation, may request a hearing regarding the determination. *** At the hearing, the person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog has the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the dog is a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog. ***.\" We cannot find that the\n   MCARC met its burden of proof on this record. Furthermore, the trial court found\n   <em>\n    Spangler\n   </em>\n   distinguishable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Accordingly, the trial court did not err when it rejected MCARC's designation of Squirt as a \"dangerous dog\" pursuant to R.C. 955.11(A)(1). Based upon the evidence adduced in the instant case, we cannot find the trial court's decision rejecting Squirt's designation as a \"dangerous dog\" is against the manifest weight of the evidence. Simply put, MCARC did not adduce sufficient evidence in order to designate Squirt as a \"dangerous dog.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 21} MCARC's sole assignment of error is overruled,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 22} MCARC's sole assignment of error having been overruled, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   HALL, P.J. and FROELICH, J., concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
