GALLAGHER, P.J.:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 1} In this accelerated appeal, plaintiffs-appellants Haber Polk Kabat, L.L.P. and Thompson Hine L.L.P. (collectively the \"law firms\") appeal an order of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas appointing a receiver in an action they filed against their former client, defendant-appellee The Condominiums at Stonebridge Owners' Association (the \"Association\"), to collect attorney fees due under a written contingency fee agreement. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the trial court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual Background and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In September 2011, the Association retained the law firms on a contingency basis \"to represent [the Association] in any claim(s) and/or potential claim(s) against the developers, contractors, and architects, of Stonebridge Condominiums, as well as related adverse parties.\" Under the terms of the contingency fee agreement, the law firms were entitled to \"a contingency fee of forty percent (40%) of [the Association's] gross recovery.\" \"Gross recovery\" was not defined in the contingency fee agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In accordance with the contingency fee agreement, the law firms filed suit on behalf of the Association against the K &amp; D Group and other entities related to water infiltration issues at the Stonebridge Condominiums (the \"K &amp; D litigation\"). In August 2014, the parties reached an agreement in principle to settle the K &amp; D litigation and, in November 2014, a settlement agreement was executed. Under the terms of the settlement, the Association was to receive: (1) a cash payment of $12 million, (2) the transfer of 46 unencumbered condominium units, (3) the transfer of an adjacent parking lot with a minimum of 25 parking spaces and (4) the assignment of certain claims against third-party subcontractors. The Association paid the law firms 40% of the $12 million cash settlement-$4.8 million-and an additional $200,000 in fees from settlements of related actions against subcontractors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In December 2014, ownership of the 46 condominium units was transferred to the Association by general warranty deed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although there appears to be no dispute that the law firms were entitled to 40% of the entire settlement the Association received, i.e., both 40% of the cash received in the settlement and 40% of the noncash component of the settlement, there was no agreement between the Association and the law firms as to how to apply the contingency fee agreement to the noncash portion of the settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 5} For more than a year, the parties engaged in discussions regarding the value of the law firm's 40% interest in the 46 condominium units or, alternatively, the terms upon which 40% of the 46 condominium units could be transferred to the law firms to satisfy the law firms' 40% interest in the noncash portion of the settlement under the contingency fee agreement. However, the parties were unable to resolve the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On March 31, 2016, the Association advised the law firms that it had retained a commercial real estate broker, had decided to sell the 46 condominium units at a public auction and would pay the law firms 40% of the auction proceeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The following day, the law firms filed suit against the Association, asserting claims for breach of contract, fraud, unjust enrichment and an accounting. The law firms sought to recover compensatory damages, punitive damages, interest and attorney fees resulting from the Association's failure to pay them 40% of the value of the 46 condominium units due under the contingency fee agreement or \"[i]n the alternative, ownership, without encumbrance or restriction of 40% of the 46 condominium units at issue.\" On April 4, 2016, the law firms filed a certificate of lis pendens with the Cuyahoga County fiscal officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The Association filed an answer and counterclaims against the law firms and several partners of the law firms, attorneys Andrew Kabat, Richard Haber and Frank DeSantis (the \"individual counterclaim defendants\") (collectively the \"attorneys\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Association asserted (1) claims for declaratory judgment, to quash the certificate of lis pendens and to quiet title against the law firms, and (2) claims for breach of fiduciary duty and professional negligence against all of the attorneys. The Association alleged that the attorneys had breached their fiduciary obligations by (1) advising the Association that it was required to pay the law firms the cash equivalent of the value of the noncash portion of the settlement under the contingency fee agreement, (2) failing to advise the Association to seek separate counsel on the issue, and (3) acting to prevent the Association from selling the real property so that it could pay the law firms the sum owed under the contingency fee agreement. The law firms filed an answer to the counterclaims and the individual counterclaim defendants filed an answer, a cross-claim against the Association and a third-party complaint asserting a contribution claim against the Association's counsel, Thacker Robinson Zinz L.P.A. (\"Thacker Robinson\") and one of its partners, attorney Mark Wallach (incorporating by reference\n   the law firms' complaint and first amended complaint).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On January 10, 2017, the law firms were granted leave to file an amended complaint. In their first amended complaint, the law firms (1) alleged that the Association had breached a fiduciary duty owed to the law firms by failing to preserve the value of the property and failing to pay the law firms 40% of the collected rent, (2) sought additional attorney fees relating to the transfer of the parking lot to the Association and (3) asserted a contribution claim against Thacker Robinson and Attorney Wallach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The Association filed a motion to strike the attorneys' breach of fiduciary duty claims pursuant to Civ.R. 12(F) and a motion for partial summary judgment on the attorneys' fraud claims. The attorneys filed a motion for partial summary judgment on the Association's counterclaims for breach of fiduciary duty and professional negligence, and Thacker Robinson and Attorney Wallach filed a motion to dismiss the attorneys' contribution claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On February 21, 2017, the trial court, sua sponte, entered an order appointing a receiver pursuant to R.C. 2735.01(A)(7).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its journal entry, the trial court indicated that \"[t]he parties have [j]udicially admitted in their pleadings and agree that Plaintiff[s] are entitled to an undivided 40% of the value of the 46 condominium units * * * [and] the 25 parking lot spaces contained within the adjacent parking lot.\" It found that appointment of a receiver for the property was warranted under R.C. 2735.01(A)(7) based on the following findings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   This Court finds that the appointment of receiver is proper under the agreed and admitted facts and circumstances of this case as set forth in the pleadings; and that legal and equitable grounds dictate that the appointment of receiver of the real property as described above and any personal property attendant thereto is proper pursuant to O.R.C. 2735.01(A)(7). This court finds that the appointment of a receiver is proper and necessary in order to protect, preserve and maximize the value of the aforestated real and personal property attendant thereto.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 12} \"[S]ubject to modification as the court deems proper in the interests of maintaining, protecting, preserving the value of, maximizing the value of, appraising the value of, and selling for best value the property and rents at issue,\" the receiver was authorized to do the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   The appointed receiver may do any of the following in the interests of the real and personal property attendant thereto afore stated:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (1) Bring and defend actions in the receiver's own name as receiver;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (2) Take and keep possession of real or personal property;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (3) Collect rents and other obligations, and compromise demands;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (4) Enter into contracts, including, but not limited to contracts of sale, lease, or, so long as existing lien rights will not be impacted, contracts for construction and for the completion of construction work;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (5) Sell and make transfers of real or personal property;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (6) Execute deeds, leases, or other documents of conveyance of real or personal property;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (7) Open and maintain deposit accounts in the receiver's name;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (8) Obtain a neutral appraisal of all property as to the reasonable value;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (9) Generally do any other acts that the court authorizes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   The appointed receiver shall carry out his duties in [accordance] with ORC 2735.04 and Local Rule 26 * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The law firms appealed the order appointing a receiver, raising the following assignment of error for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   The trial court abused its discretion by appointing a receiver pursuant to Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2735.01(A)(7) where no party makes a motion or seeks the appointment of a receiver as a form of relief; where no evidence of any type is submitted, or considered by the court; where no evidentiary hearing is conducted by the court; and, where adequate remedies at law exist to protect the interests of the respective parties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The Association filed a motion to dismiss the law firms' appeal for lack of standing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 15} As a preliminary matter, we first consider whether the law firms have standing to appeal the trial court's appointment of a receiver.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Standing is a preliminary inquiry that must be resolved before a court may consider the merits of a claim.\n   <em>\n    Kincaid v.

The law firms contend that they have standing to challenge the appointment of the receiver because (1) they have a charging lien against proceeds of the settlement, including the condominium units, pursuant to the contingency fee agreement, (2) they have filed a certificate of lis pendens,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (3) the Association has, at times, taken the position that, under the terms of the contingency fee agreement, the law firms are entitled to a 40% interest in the real property, rather than a cash payment, in satisfaction of their outstanding contingency fee, and (4) the attorneys seek 40% ownership of the condominium units and 40% of the rent collected by the Association \"as an alternative remedy\" if the court were to determine that the contingency fee \"was not require[d] to be satisfied in cash.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 17} As established by the parties' admissions in the pleadings, the parties do not dispute that (1) the law firms and the Association had an enforceable contingency fee agreement, pursuant to which the law firms were entitled to 40% of the Association's gross recovery in the K &amp; D litigation, and (2) the Association acquired the real property at issue as a result of the settlement the law firms obtained for the Association in the K &amp; D litigation. Where, as here, an attorney secures an award of property on behalf of a client through a judgment or settlement, Ohio law recognizes an equitable right on the part of the attorney to enforce a lien against the property that is the subject of the award as security for payment for the services the attorney provided in securing the award:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   \"This right, though called a lien, rests * * * on the equity of an attorney to be paid his fees and disbursements out of the judgment which he has obtained,\n   and is upheld on the theory that his service and skill produced the judgment, and in accordance with the principle which gives a mechanic a lien upon a valuable thing which, by his skill and labor, he has produced.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    Cohen v.
