CANNON, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   {\u00b6 1} Appellant, Adam R. Cupp, appeals from the September 29, 2016 judgment entry of the Geauga County Court of Common Pleas convicting him of one count of Endangering Children. Appellant was sentenced to serve 36 months in prison. At issue is the written plea agreement, appellant's motion to withdraw plea, and the trial court's award of jail-time credit. For the reasons that follow, the trial court's judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the matter is remanded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On June 12, 2015, a complaint was filed against appellant in the Chardon Municipal Court, alleging one count of Rape, a first-degree felony, in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1) &amp; (B). Appellant posted bond on June 15, 2015, in the amount of $75,000.00 with conditions. Appellant waived his right to a preliminary hearing, and the matter was bound over to the Geauga County Court of Common Pleas on June 19, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On June 29, 2015, appellant was indicted by the Grand Jury on the following eight counts: one count of Rape, a first-degree felony in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b) (Count One); one count of Kidnapping, a first-degree felony in violation of R.C. 2905.01(A)(2) (Count Two); one count of Endangering Children, a second-degree felony in violation of R.C. 2919.22(B)(1) (Count Three); and five counts of Gross Sexual Imposition, third-degree felonies in violation of R.C. 2907.05(A)(4) (Counts Four through Eight). The alleged victim was a female minor, seven years old at the time of the indictment; the offenses allegedly occurred between July 1, 2012, and April 1, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On August 7, 2015, appellant made an initial appearance before the trial court and entered a plea of not guilty to all counts. The trial court set bond in the amount of $400,000.00 with conditions. It was determined that appellant was already being held in the Geauga County Jail for violating his probation in an unrelated Domestic Violence municipal court case. Appellant had tested positive for cocaine and morphine, was arrested, and either had not posted bond or was being held without bond as a result of his probation violation in that case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The matter was scheduled for trial before a jury in October 2015 but was delayed at various times due to appellant retaining and discharging three different attorneys. Appellant submitted speedy-trial waivers during this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 6} At a pre-trial hearing held on October 5, 2015, the prosecutor stated appellant had been sentenced by the municipal\n   court to approximately 500 days in jail for the Domestic Violence probation violation. Defense counsel stated she did not represent appellant in the Domestic Violence case but that it was her understanding appellant had not yet been sentenced; she indicated appellant was scheduled to appear before the municipal court that afternoon. There was some discussion that multiple municipal court cases might be involved and perhaps appellant had been sentenced on some but not others. Regardless, appellant remained confined in the Geauga County Jail on the municipal court charges and, in lieu of bail, on the common pleas charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On June 17, 2016, appellant entered into a written plea agreement with appellee, the state of Ohio, on two amended counts: one count of Attempted Abduction, a fourth-degree felony in violation of R.C. 2905.03 &amp; 2923.02 (Amended Count Two); and one count of Endangering Children, a third-degree felony in violation of R.C. 2919.22(A) &amp; (E)(2)(c) (Amended Count Three). The signed plea agreement provides that appellant understood he could receive 6 to 18 months in prison and up to a $5,000.00 fine on Amended Count Two, and 9 to 36 months in prison and up to a $10,000.00 fine on Amended Count Three. The agreement states issues of merger and jail-time credit would be addressed at sentencing. A handwritten note is included at the bottom of the agreement, which states: \"The parties agree\n   <em>\n    to recommend\n   </em>\n   that the defendant be on community control sanctions; if however, he violates he will get maximum time.\" (Emphasis added: \"to recommend\" was interlineated.) Appellant and defense counsel initialed below the handwritten note; the prosecutor initialed next to the interlineation of \"to recommend.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The written plea agreement was presented to the trial court at a hearing held that same day, June 17, 2016. At the outset, the trial court reiterated the substance of the handwritten portion of the agreement, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   The plea agreement goes on to provide for other matters, and includes the parties agreeing\n   <em>\n    to recommend\n   </em>\n   that the Defendant be placed on community control sanctions, which if violated, it is acknowledged that he would get the maximum time. And further, that the issue of jail time credit will be addressed at sentencing, if there is any jail time credit. We have addressed those with some notations to the original plea agreement that have been initialed by the parties and counsel[.] [Emphasis added.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Defense counsel stated, \"Every one of the amendments to the original plea agreement that you have alluded to in your opening colloquy, your Honor, have been discussed with my client, and you will find both his initials and mine in every step in the appropriate way.\" The prosecution added that it would nolle the remaining counts of the indictment at sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The trial court addressed appellant at the plea hearing, and the following colloquy, in pertinent part, was had on the record:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   THE COURT: Has anyone made you any promises or offered you any inducement or threatened you in any way in order to get you to plead guilty other than what is contained in the plea agreement?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   MR. CUPP: No, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   THE COURT: And you did go over the written plea agreement as represented by [defense counsel], and in detail with him, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   MR. CUPP: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   THE COURT: All right. Now, you understand, too, that this plea agreement contains some, I think I have already referenced that there is a provision that at sentencing, there would be an issue brought up as to the jail time credit, if any. And there is also a representation that the parties agree, and not just a representation, but an agreement that the parties are going to recommend that you be placed on community control. And you understand that when it comes to sentencing, the Court does not have to follow any recommendation, but that it can impose whatever sentence is authorized by the law of Ohio?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   MR. CUPP: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   THE COURT: And that the issue of jail time credit doesn't imply that there is any jail time credit. I understand you have been in jail not just because you haven't posted bond in this case, but because of a bond violation from another Court. So that may impact the availability of jail time credit in this case. You understand that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   MR. CUPP: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 11} The trial court accepted appellant's plea of guilty, made a finding of guilt based upon the plea, and ordered preparation of a presentence investigation report. The prosecution stated appellant was still being held on the probation violation in municipal court with a scheduled release date of July 29, 2016. The trial court revoked appellant's $400,000.00 bond and stated it could be addressed at a later date. Finally, appellant signed a waiver of his right to be prosecuted by way of an amended grand jury indictment. This was all journalized in a change of plea order entered on June 24, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 12} On August 3, 2016, appellant filed a \"Motion to Set Bond.\" In the motion, defense counsel asserted: \"As contemplated as part of the Plea Agreement made, Mr. Cupp would be able to get a personal bond, while waiting for sentencing, Mr. Cupp would use this time to demonstrate to the Court that he has turn[ed] his life around.\" The state of Ohio did not file a response in opposition. The trial court overruled the motion on August 4, 2016, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [C]ontrary to Defense counsel's assertion in its motion in support, there is no mention of a personal bond being granted to Defendant pending sentencing in either the written plea of guilty or the change of plea Order entered June 24, 2016. On the contrary, the latter provides the Defendant's bond was revoked-a not unexpected development for one who has just plead guilty to two felonies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 13} On August 9, 2016, appellant filed a \"Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea.\" Appellant, by and through counsel, asserted the motion was based on suspicions raised by the trial court's refusal to grant bond. The motion alleged the prosecutor had agreed not to object to appellant receiving a bond after his sentence in the municipal court case had run its course, although it also stated that \"[b]ond revocation is not an item contemplated by the written plea agreement signed by Mr. Cupp.\" Specifically, appellant stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   When the time arose for Mr. Cupp's release [from the municipal court case] this Court indicated that a bond would not be set in this case as 'might be expected where someone pleads to two felonies.' When the State failed to perform its agreed-to promise regarding bond, Mr. Cupp began to suspect that his ratification of the plea agreement would be used as an expedited tool to incarcerate regardless of the State's recommendation to this Honorable Court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The state filed a brief in response to appellant's motion to withdraw his plea, noting\n   it had not filed an objection to appellant's motion to set bond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 14} On August 17, 2016, after the issue was briefed by both parties, the trial court held a hearing on appellant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Defense counsel stated appellant desired to withdraw his plea because he is innocent and had hoped \"to be able * * * to have the better part of two plus weeks to demonstrate to this Court that he could put his financial house in order, save his home, satisfy his customers, reunite with his mom and his family and be able to be a good candidate for community control.\" The prosecutor, in addition to arguing the merits of the motion, responded it \"never went back on any portion of the deal. We never objected to his being released after his Muni time was set. * * * We are standing here ready to abide by our end of the bargain. We stated when he pled guilty to those two counts on June 17th, that we would agree to recommend that the Defendant be on community control sanctions. * * * We were prepared to do that again today.\" The prosecutor also argued withdrawal of the plea would prejudice the state, contrary to appellant's position, because the minor victim had already been informed she would not have to testify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 15} The trial court overruled the motion in an order issued August 22, 2016:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   The Court finds the motion not well taken. The grounds cited by the defense do not suffice. At the plea hearing the Defendant freely and voluntarily entered his plea. He acknowledged that no promises were made as inducements to the plea (other than what is in the plea agreement) and further acknowledged that the Court has discretion to impose any penalty authorized by law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   It is true that withdrawal of a guilty plea prior to sentencing should be granted upon a less stringent standard than post sentence. However, this case has been pending for months. Defendant engaged skilled counsel, there was a full Crim. R. 11 hearing, and Defendant represented himself as guilty of the crimes he pleaded guilty to. While he may have expected to be let out on bond pending sentencing (now that his Municipal Court sentences have been served) the expectation was unwarranted. There is nothing in the plea agreement regarding a bond reduction. Defendant's bond was set at $400,000.00 prior to plea and was revoked pending sentencing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Not every pre-sentence motion to withdraw plea is subject to withdrawal. This clearly is one of those situations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 16} On August 23, 2016, a notice of appearance was filed indicating appellant had again retained new counsel. That same day, newly-retained counsel filed a motion to withdraw appellant's previously filed motion to withdraw plea and requested sentencing be scheduled as soon as possible. The trial court overruled the motion to withdraw as moot, given it had already overruled the motion to withdraw plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 17} On September 22, 2016, appellant appeared before the trial court for sentencing. Defense counsel stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   I think it is very clear in the plea agreement, that everybody, including the victim's family, agreed that probation would be recommended to the Court. While I understand the Court certainly is not bound by it, I think it is at least the Prosecutor's belief and my belief that was recommended at that time. And I would ask the Court to certainly consider the recommendation of all the parties involved in this case, including the victim's.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The trial court did not ask the prosecutor to reiterate its sentencing recommendation, and it requested a discussion on the issues of merger and jail-time credit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Defense counsel argued jail-time credit should begin to run when appellant's bond was revoked on June 21, 2016. The prosecutor responded that appellant's jail-time credit should run from July 30, 2016, the day after his municipal court sentence ended. The trial court agreed with the state and awarded appellant jail-time credit from July 30, 2016. The trial court awarded 58 days jail-time credit, which apparently included three days appellant was held before he was sentenced on the municipal court probation violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 19} The prosecutor argued the two amended counts should not merge for purposes of sentencing because it could not be concluded that the elements of each count occurred at the same time. Specifically, the prosecutor stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   As I review it, your Honor, [Amended Count Three, Endangering Children,] covers a date range of July 1 of 2012 through April 12 of 2014, and the conduct described by the victim made in a series of disclosures is indicative of the Defendant's behaviors through that period of time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   He did create, in the periods of time when he had custody and control over the victim, he did create by his numerous behaviors substantial risk to her health or safety by violating his duty of care. It is not limited to one specific act but more of created by the entire range which is included in the Indictment in the original Count Three and also in the Amended Count Three.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Contrary to that, looking at the Amended Count Two, the Attempted Abduction, the State would argue it would not merge with the Endangering Children because that would focus more on specific instances where the Defendant did something to either restrain the liberty of the victim or would create circumstances that would create a risk of physical harm to her or place her in fear of physical harm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   And I know it is described in the pre-sentence investigation that certain period of times that something would happen, and then as a result, she would flee to her room and lock herself in out of fear, and that is a restraint of her liberty as a result of the actions of the Defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Defense counsel responded it could not be concluded that the acts did not occur at the same time and, thus, they should merge. The trial court agreed with the defense and found the two counts merge for purposes of sentencing. The state elected to proceed to sentencing on Amended Count Three, Endangering Children, a third-degree felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 20} The trial court then made the requisite findings and advised appellant of mandatory post-release control for a period of three years. The trial court found appellant not amenable to community control and sentenced him to the maximum prison term of 36 months, to which appellant objected. The remaining counts of the indictment were dismissed. This was all journalized in a judgment of conviction entered on September 29, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Appellant filed a timely appeal and raises four assignments of error, which we consider out of numerical order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Plea Agreement\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Appellant's third assignment of error states:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 23} \"The court erred by following a plea agreement that was materially different in its written form from what Mr. Cupp actually agreed to.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 24} The handwritten portion of the written plea agreement states, \"The parties agree\n   <em>\n    to recommend\n   </em>\n   that the defendant be on community control sanctions; if however, he violates he will get maximum\n   time.\" (Emphasis added: \"to recommend\" was interlineated.) Appellant and defense counsel initialed below the note; the prosecutor initialed next to the interlineation of \"to recommend.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Appellant asserts he signed the written plea agreement before \"to recommend\" was added to the handwritten note.

The written plea agreement provided the parties would jointly recommend to the trial court that appellant should be sentenced to community control sanctions. The state acknowledged this agreement at both the plea hearing and the hearing on appellant's motion to withdraw plea. At the sentencing hearing, the trial court did not ask the state to orally recite that recommendation. Instead, the trial court acknowledged the plea agreement but stated other issues also needed to be discussed. One of those issues was merger of the amended counts as allied offenses. In support of its argument that the amended counts should not merge, the prosecutor outlined the elements of each. Appellant concedes this was done for the purpose of the merger argument but asserts it also amounted to the prosecution outlining R.C. 2929.12(B) factors in support of a prison sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Any correspondence between elements of the crime argued for the purpose of merger and the consideration of sentencing factors, without more, does not support the conclusion that the state breached its agreement to recommend community control sanctions. There is no evidence in the record that the state failed to comply with the recommendation in the plea agreement. Further, even if there had been a breach, appellant has failed to show that his 36-month prison sentence would have been any different absent that breach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Appellant's fourth assignment of error is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Motion to Withdraw Plea\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Appellant's second assignment of error states:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 38} \"The court erred by not allowing Mr. Cupp to withdraw his plea prior to the sentencing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Appellant first argues the trial court applied the wrong legal standard to his motion to withdraw his guilty plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 40} \"A motion to withdraw a plea of guilty or no contest may be made only before sentence is imposed; but to correct manifest injustice the court after sentence may set aside the judgment of conviction and permit the defendant to withdraw his or her plea.\" Crim.R. 32.1.

A trial court does not abuse its discretion in overruling a motion to withdraw when (1) the defendant was represented by competent counsel; (2) the defendant was afforded a full plea hearing, pursuant to Crim.R. 11 ; (3) the defendant was provided a complete and impartial hearing on the motion to withdraw; and (4) the trial court gave full and fair consideration to the request.\n   <em>\n    Peterseim\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at paragraph three of the syllabus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 44} Appellant's next arguments relate to the third and fourth\n   <em>\n    Peterseim\n   </em>\n   factors.

At the outset of the hearing, the trial court stated it was \"going to entertain argument and/or the proffering of evidence on the part of the defense, inasmuch as it is the defense motion.\" Defense counsel proceeded to argue the merits of appellant's motion to withdraw plea, and the prosecutor responded in turn. The trial court then stated, \"[a]s the moving party, you get the last word,\" and again gave the floor to defense counsel for rebuttal. Before concluding, the trial court stated, \"All right. Is there anything else for the record before the Court adjourns the hearing, State of Ohio? Or defense?\" The state declined, and defense counsel stated, \"Nothing at this time, your Honor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 47} Nothing in the record supports appellant's assertion that the trial court denied him the opportunity to present evidence or testimony at this hearing. The record entirely supports the contrary conclusion. This argument is not well taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b6 48} Appellant next argues the trial court did not give full and fair consideration to the basis for his motion to withdraw plea, namely that the trial court \"tipped its hand when it did not reduce bond as recommended in the plea agreement, thus triggering the defendant's opportunity to withdraw a plea if the court is already not going to follow the agreement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b6 49} In its entry overruling the motion to withdraw plea, the trial court stated: \"While he may have expected to be let out on bond pending sentencing (now that his Municipal Court sentences have been served) the expectation was unwarranted. There is nothing in the plea agreement regarding a bond reduction. Defendant's bond was set at $400,000.00 prior to plea and was revoked pending sentencing.\" There is no mention of a bond reduction in the written plea agreement, and defense counsel agreed at the plea hearing that bond could be discussed at a later date. Thus, the trial court correctly concluded, after full and fair consideration, that there was no reasonable and legitimate basis for appellant's motion to withdraw plea. The\n   contrary assertion is also belied by the fact that appellant later filed a motion to withdraw his motion to withdraw plea. The record is devoid of any evidence to support appellant's argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   {\u00b6 50} Appellant's second assignment of error is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Jail-Time Credit\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   {\u00b6 51} Appellant's first assignment of error states:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   {\u00b6 52} \"The court erred by not awarding jail time credit that defendant served after he was arrested and the bond in this case was increased to $400,000 and subsequently revoked at sentencing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   {\u00b6 53} \"We review the trial court's determination as to the amount of credit to which [a defendant] is entitled under the 'clearly and convincingly' contrary to law standard.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

While in jail on the felony charges, the probation department sought to revoke the defendant's community control on the previous offense. At the sentencing hearing,\n   which addressed the felony charges and the community control violation, the trial court imposed concurrent prison terms. The trial court awarded jail-time credit on the sentence imposed for the community control violation but not for the felony offenses. The defendant appealed, arguing the trial court should have awarded jail-time credit on both sentences. The Ohio Supreme Court agreed with the defendant: \"When a defendant is sentenced to concurrent prison terms for multiple charges, jail-time credit pursuant to R.C. 2967.191 must be applied toward each concurrent prison term.\"\n   <em>\n    Fugate\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at syllabus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   {\u00b6 60} The majority opinion in\n   <em>\n    Caccamo\n   </em>\n   relied on the\n   <em>\n    Fugate\n   </em>\n   holding. The defendant in\n   <em>\n    Caccamo\n   </em>\n   was sentenced by the Lake County Court of Common Pleas to 150 days in the Lake County Jail and 2 years community control. While serving his community control, the defendant was arrested on a separate offense and held in the Cuyahoga County Jail, for which he was sentenced to 8 months in prison by the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas. As a result of his arrest in Cuyahoga County, the state moved to terminate the community control sanctions in Lake County, and the defendant was transferred from the state prison to county jail to await his termination hearing. The Lake County Court of Common Pleas sentenced the defendant to 26 months in prison on the community control violation, to be served concurrently with the remainder of his 8-month prison term in Cuyahoga County. The Lake County Court of Common Pleas credited the defendant with 33 days, which represented 12 days he was held prior to pleading guilty in the underlying Lake County case and 21 days he was held in the county jail awaiting his hearing and sentencing for violating community control in the Lake County case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   {\u00b6 61} The defendant appealed, arguing the trial court erred in its calculation of jail-time credit because his confinement in Cuyahoga County was based upon the alleged community control violation in Lake County. The majority opinion agreed because the Lake County Court of Common Pleas ordered its sentence be served concurrently with the Cuyahoga County sentence and because the offense in Cuyahoga County was the basis for the community control violation holder issued by Lake County. The majority held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   In attempting to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Fugate\n   </em>\n   , some appellate courts have concluded that the\n   <em>\n    Fugate\n   </em>\n   analysis should not be followed when the concurrent prison terms are imposed by different trial courts at different times.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, given that the existence of the holder justifies appellant's continuing incarceration had the Cuyahoga County charge been dismissed, the foregoing distinction is unpersuasive because it would defeat the underlying principle that a defendant is entitled to credit for all presentencing incarceration based upon the pending charges in the underlying case.

Thus, because appellant did not post bond, he has been incarcerated related to the instant offense since August 7, 2015. Appellant was sentenced on September 22, 2016, but the trial court only gave credit from July 30, 2016, the day after his municipal court sentence was completed. The plain language of the statute requires the trial court to give jail-time credit from August 7, 2015, through September 22, 2016, in addition to the three days appellant was held between his arrest and the day he was sentenced in the municipal court case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   {\u00b6 65} The trial court's determination as to the amount of credit to which appellant was entitled is clearly and convincingly contrary to law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   {\u00b6 66} Appellant's first assignment of error is with merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   {\u00b6 67} The judgment of the Geauga County Court of Common Pleas is hereby affirmed in part and reversed in part. This matter is remanded for the purpose of revising the sentencing entry to reflect the correct jail-time credit as set forth herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   THOMAS R.

The majority maintains that appellant is entitled to jail-time credit from August 7, 2015 through September 22, 2016 because the trial court increased his bail in the underlying offense to $400,000 and he did not post bond. In effect, the majority reasons that, even though appellant was being held on a separate, municipal court charge between August 7, 2015 and June 29, 2016, the increased bond in the instant case supports the conclusion that his confinement arose out of the instant offense. I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   {\u00b6 69} Appellant was confined in the Geauga County Jail from August 7, 2015 through June 29, 2016 for sentences arising out of probation violations in the Chardon Municipal Court where he was previously convicted of an unrelated domestic violence offense. It is not entirely clear how the offenses which occasioned the probation violations are related to the underlying offense. And simply because the time served for these offenses ran concurrently with the pre-detention phase of the instant case does not automatically trigger jail-time\n   credit for the instant case.\n   <em>\n    State v. Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016-Ohio-3510\">\n    2016-Ohio-3510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=67%20N.E.3d%2068\">\n    67 N.E.3d 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   illustrates the point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   {\u00b6 70} In\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   , the defendant was granted judicial release from a term of imprisonment in Ashtabula County. A request for capias was later filed by the Ashtabula County Adult Probation Department based on the defendant's failure to comply with the terms of his probation. At that time, he was incarcerated in the Lake County Jail awaiting sentencing on other charges. The defendant served a nine-month sentence for the Lake County convictions before he was brought to Ashtabula County for the probation violation. Ashtabula County found the defendant violated his probation by pleading guilty to felony offenses in Lake County\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   by failing to report to probation. The defendant argued he was entitled to jail-time credit in Ashtabula County for the entire nine months he served in Lake County because the capias was pending during that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   {\u00b6 71} A hearing was held on the jail-time credit issue, at which defense counsel presented a judgment of conviction from Lake County that did not reference the capias or the probation violation. Counsel argued the defendant would not have been permitted to get out of jail even if he posted bond in Lake County because of the capias. The trial court disagreed with the defendant's position and denied his motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   {\u00b6 72} On appeal, this court affirmed the trial court observing there was no relationship between the charges at issue and there was no evidence that Ashtabula County issued a holder. Further, the judgment ordering a capias to issue was not served on the defendant until he was released from Lake County. Also there was no evidence Lake County was informed the defendant should be held on the probation violation and the defendant did not argue such evidence was part of the record.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22. This court pointed out:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   {\u00b6 73} \"[J]ail-time credit is appropriate only when the facts and circumstances giving rise to the incarceration are the result of the charge for which the offender is eventually sentenced.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Appellant has not established any relationship between the offenses such that additional jail-time credit should be awarded. The only probation violations mentioned in\n   the hearings below were testing positive for cocaine and morphine and failing to comply with no-contact orders. Appellant's time served on the original term in the municipal court (due to probation violations) ran concurrently during the pre-detention phase of the felony offenses, but ended before he was sentenced on the felony offenses. Accordingly, appellant did not establish the offenses were in any way related. I would find appellant's first assignment of error without merit. In this regard, I dissent.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
