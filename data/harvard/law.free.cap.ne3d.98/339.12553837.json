Upon review, we reverse the decision of the trial court and remand the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On March 5, 2011, plaintiffs-appellees Wade Huffman (\"Huffman\") and Alan Bowles (\"Bowles\") were pedestrians who were struck by a vehicle driven by Russell H. Roupe, Jr. (\"Roupe\"). The accident occurred during a high-speed police chase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On the evening of the accident, Patrolman Hoover of the Newburgh Heights Police Department was on duty in a marked police vehicle. Shortly after 6:00 p.m., he received a radio broadcast from the Newburgh Heights 911 emergency dispatch regarding a possible child abduction. The caller could be heard in the background screaming in a hysterical manner. The 911 dispatcher relayed that the driver of a white truck heading from Gamma Avenue toward Fleet Avenue had a child that he was not supposed to have in the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Patrolman Hoover observed a white SUV enter E. 49th Street from Gamma Avenue at a high rate of speed. Patrolman Hoover informed the dispatcher that he was attempting to stop the suspect vehicle. According to his affidavit, he immediately activated his overhead flashing lights and police siren to signal the suspect vehicle to stop. The suspect vehicle did not stop but continued north on E. 49th Street to Fleet Avenue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Patrolman Hoover followed behind the suspect vehicle and attempted to get the driver to stop. The suspect vehicle, which was driven by defendant Roupe, stopped momentarily at a red light, but when the light turned green, the suspect vehicle accelerated and pulled to the left around other vehicles. Patrolman Hoover stated in his deposition that he was not able to see into the suspect vehicle, which had tinted windows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Patrolman Hoover followed and asked the dispatcher to confirm if there was a child in the suspect vehicle. The dispatcher indicated that the female caller was screaming \"he got my niece, he's got my niece\" and had apparently hung up. The dispatcher indicated she was trying to get a callback number and was going to notify Cleveland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Patrolman Hoover indicated in his affidavit that the suspect vehicle continued to accelerate to speeds approaching 70 m.p.h. The posted speed limit was 25 m.p.h. Patrolman Hoover continued to follow; however, he stated in his affidavit that he began slowing his vehicle so the suspect might also reduce his speed. The suspect continued at a high rate of speed and attempted to turn right onto E. 65th Street, where he lost control. The suspect vehicle struck an RTA bus shelter on the sidewalk. Plaintiffs Huffman and Bowles\n   were pedestrians who were injured in the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 8} As the pursuit was occurring, Patrolman Hoover informed the dispatcher: \"He's being erratic[,] we're at speeds of 70. Do you want to call it or is there a child?\" He then informed the dispatcher that the suspect vehicle had \"just wrecked.\" Sirens could be heard on the 911 emergency dispatch recording during the high-speed pursuit and as the crash was being reported.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The entire pursuit lasted one to two minutes. Patrolman Hoover stated in his affidavit that at the time he was engaged in the pursuit, he believed that the driver of the suspect vehicle had been involved in a child abduction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 10} After the crash, the suspect driver fled on foot. Patrolman Hoover apprehended the suspect and placed him under arrest. No child was found inside the suspect vehicle. Chief Barone was not on duty at the time of the police pursuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 11} The plaintiffs originally filed a complaint on March 4, 2013, against the Newburgh Heights defendants and Roupe. The case was removed to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, wherein the federal constitutional claim was disposed and the court dismissed the remaining state law claims without prejudice.\n   <em>\n    Huffman v.

The Newburgh Heights defendants filed a motion for summary judgment claiming statutory immunity under R.C. Chapter 2744. The trial court denied the motion upon finding genuine issues of material fact to exist. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 13} We note that the only matter properly before us on review is whether the Newburgh Heights defendants are entitled to statutory immunity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We recognize appellees have indicated that they will dismiss their nuisance claim in Count V, their negligent entrustment claim in Count VII, and their constitutional challenge to Chapter 2744 in Count XI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Appellants raise two assignments of error that challenge the trial court's decision to deny the motion for summary judgment (1) as to the village of Newburgh Heights, and (2) as to Patrolman Hoover and Chief Barone individually. We review the grant of summary judgment on the issue of immunity de novo using the standard set forth in Civ.R. 56.\n   <em>\n    Argabrite v.

Unlike R.C. 2744.03(A)(6), R.C. 2744.02(B)(1)(a), does not include the term \"reckless,\" and the Supreme Court of Ohio has made clear that the terms \"willful,\" \"wanton,\" and \"reckless\" are not interchangeable but, rather, describe different and distinct degrees of care.\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

Reasonable minds could only conclude from the evidence that Patrolman Hoover was called to duty upon receiving the 911 emergency dispatch reporting the suspect vehicle was involved with a child abduction and that he was responding to an emergency call.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 18} The terms \"willful misconduct\" and \"wanton misconduct\" have been described as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Willful misconduct implies an intentional deviation from a clear duty or from a definite rule of conduct, a deliberate purpose not to discharge some duty necessary to safety, or purposefully doing wrongful acts with knowledge or appreciation of the likelihood of resulting injury.

Also, there is no evidence that he failed to exercise any care so as to constitute wanton misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 20} The record reflects that Patrolman Hoover was responding to an emergency 911 dispatch concerning a potential child abduction. Although the high-speed\n   chase occurred on trafficked roads around 6:00 p.m., Patrolman Hoover indicated that it was still light. He also indicated that he activated his lights and sirens. Although appellees point to contradictions in his deposition relating to whether the lights and sirens were on intermittently or throughout the high-speed pursuit, on the 911 dispatch recording sirens could be heard during the high-speed pursuit and reported crash. Further, Patrolman Hoover indicated he was attempting to stop the vehicle and attempted to get it to slow down. The suspect vehicle stopped at a red light momentarily, and at one point Patrolman Hoover slowed his vehicle, but the suspect continued at a high rate of speed. Patrolman Hoover reported his location to dispatch as the pursuit transpired, and he sought confirmation regarding whether a child was in the vehicle. The pursuit was short, lasting only one to two minutes. Although appellees also point to a lack of pursuit training policies and question Patrolman Hoover's training and judgment, we are unable to find any willful or wanton misconduct in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Upon our review, we find that the village of Newburgh Heights is entitled to immunity under R.C. 2744.02(B)(1)(a).

The suspect vehicle stopped momentarily at a traffic light, and when the driver accelerated and became erratic, Patrolman Hoover slowed his vehicle.

In\n   <em>\n    Hardesty,\n   </em>\n   a genuine issue of material fact was found to exist regarding whether an officer's actions were wanton and reckless when there was evidence that the officer pursued a fleeing suspect in heavy traffic at speeds of 80 to 100 m.p.h., that the suspect drove through traffic signals and intersections without slowing, that the officer's sirens were deactivated during at least some of the pursuit, and that the officer was disciplined for failing to terminate the pursuit. Unlike\n   <em>\n    Hardesty\n   </em>\n   , the record herein shows that there was a 911 emergency report of a child abduction, that the suspect vehicle stopped at a traffic light, that the speeds approached 70 m.p.h., and that the officer's sirens were activated and could be heard on the 911 dispatch recording during the high-speed pursuit and at the time of the reported crash. These cases are factually distinguishable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Under the circumstances of this case, viewing the record in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, we find that there are no genuine issues of material fact in dispute, that the Newburgh Heights defendants are entitled to immunity as a matter of law, and that no reasonable juror could find that Chief Barone or Patrolman Hoover acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Judgment reversed; case remanded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   MARY EILEEN KILBANE, P.J., and ANITA LASTER MAYS, J., CONCUR\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    The complaint has 11 counts and includes a loss of consortium claim by plaintiff Marie Jessica Huffman.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    A denial of a motion for summary judgment is generally not a final appealable order.\n    <em>\n     Piazza v.
