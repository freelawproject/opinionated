The issue before this court is whether a police officer may, at his discretion, revoke a juvenile's privilege to enter and remain in a municipality's public parks when the juvenile has been involved in repeated disturbances at the parks. For the following reasons, we reverse the decision of the juvenile court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On November 25, 2015, a Complaint was filed in juvenile court alleging that B.J.M. committed Criminal Trespass, a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, if committed by an adult, in violation of R.C. 2911.21(A)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On January 7, 2016, a plea hearing was held and a plea of not true was entered on the charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On March 1, 2016, trial was held on the matter before a magistrate. The following testimony was presented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Officer Greg Williams of the Willowick Police Department testified that, on August 2, 2015, he was called to Dudley Park in response to a report of an argument between a pedestrian and occupants\n   of a vehicle. After arriving at the park, Officer Williams had occasion to speak with B.J.M. He advised him \"that he was no longer allowed in any of the parks of the city\" since he \"and his friends have been causing issues at the parks or in and around that area for the past several weeks.\" Officer Williams further advised B.J.M. that if, during the remainder of the calendar year, \"he's found in any park in the City of Willowick, * * * Dudley, Manry, Roosevelt, if he's found on any of the properties he'll be cited for trespassing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Officer Williams subsequently advised B.J.M.'s father of the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On August 14, 2015, Officer Williams was called to Dudley Park in response to a report that \"there was a group of kids by the basketball courts that were either talking about fighting or trying to start a fight.\" B.J.M. was among a group of juveniles \"over by the basketball courts * * * being loud and rambunctious.\" Officer Williams cited him for Trespassing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Officer Keith Lawrence of the Willowick Police Department testified that, on August 2, 2015, he responded to the reported disturbance in Dudley Park with Officer Williams. He testified that the decision to ban B.J.M. from the municipal parks was based on a number of issues: \"there [were] occasions where he was reported throwing rocks at another individual, smoking, * * * prior disturbances [involving] a group of juveniles being rowdy or wanting to fight.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Officer Lawrence again responded to Dudley Park on August 14, 2015, but did not witness any disturbance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 10} At the close of the testimony, counsel for B.J.M. made a \"Rule 29 motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence,\" which the magistrate denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On March 1, 2016, a Magistrate's Decision was issued, and was disapproved by the juvenile court on the same day (\"[t]he Court * * * finds that the Decision ought not to be adopted\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 12} On March 3, 2016, an Amended Magistrate's Decision was issued, finding the charge true, and approved by the juvenile court. B.J.M. was ordered to be placed on Community Control; to serve a 90-day suspended sentence in the Lake County Juvenile Detention Facility; to stay out of Willowick Parks pending further order; to continue with counseling; and to continue on probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 13} On January 13, 2017, B.J.M. sought leave of this court to file a delayed appeal, which we granted on April 5, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 14} On appeal, B.J.M. raises the following assignment of error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 15} \"[1.] The trial court erred in denying the juvenile's motion for acquittal on a charge of Criminal Trespass where the State failed to prove that the juvenile was 'without privilege' to enter a city park based upon a police officer's unilateral order banning the juvenile from city park grounds.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 16} \"A juvenile court proceeding is a civil action,\" to which there are \"criminal aspects,\" and must comply with \"basic due process requirements.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1287199\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/92/63/#p65\">\n    92 Ohio St.3d 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 65-66,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=748%20N.E.2d%2067\">\n    748 N.E.2d 67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001), syllabus.

The\n   <em>\n    Dickerson\n   </em>\n   case, however, is distinguishable from the present one and does not address whether police officers may ban persons from entering public property. In\n   <em>\n    Dickerson\n   </em>\n   , the defendants-appellants were found guilty of criminal trespass after they were asked to leave Cleveland Hopkins International Airport and refused to do so. The court of appeals found \"that[,] while the appellants had the privilege to enter the public airport for the purposes of using its restroom facilities, that privilege was not indefinite and was revoked once the officers separately asked Dickerson and Hendon to leave the property.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23. The court further pointed out \"that Dickerson and Hendon were only asked to leave the airport after they used the public restrooms and no longer had a 'legitimate basis' to be in the baggage area of the airport.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 24} In the present case, B.J.M. committed the trespass by entering Dudley Park contrary to Officer Williams' command not to enter municipal parks for a year.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Dickerson\n   </em>\n   case would apply to the situation on August 2, 2015, when officers expelled B.J.M. from the park for causing a disturbance. On August 14, 2015, B.J.M. was not cited or expelled for causing a disturbance, but was cited for being present on public property contrary to Officer Williams' August 2 command. Thus, the\n   <em>\n    Dickerson\n   </em>\n   case does not establish Officer Williams' authority to revoke the privilege of being in public parks, regardless of whether there is a legitimate purpose, for a given period of time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 25} The State also relies on the case of\n   <em>\n    State v. Craft\n   </em>\n   , 4th Dist. Athens No. 97 CA 53,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1998%20WL%20255442\">\n    1998 WL 255442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (May 14, 1998), wherein the defendant was convicted of criminal trespass after being advised by university police officers that he was not allowed to enter university property. The court of appeals upheld the conviction on the grounds \"that OUPD officers, agents of the Ohio University Board of Trustees, provided actual notice to appellant that he was not permitted to enter the campus grounds.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 26} We find\n   <em>\n    Craft\n   </em>\n   distinguishable in that the right of access to the grounds of a public university is subject to greater restriction than the right of access to a public park. In\n   <em>\n    Craft\n   </em>\n   , the prosecution noted a committee comment to the trespass statute that it is \"well-settled that property owned by a state or political subdivision is not automatically open to all members of the public, but is subject to limitations on access\n   and use which are reasonable in light of its purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. Additionally, university trustees are authorized by statute to \"adopt rules for the conduct of the students, faculty, visitors, and staff, and * * * provide for the ejection from college or university property, suspension or expulsion of a person who violates such regulations.\" R.C. 3345.21. The defendant in\n   <em>\n    Craft\n   </em>\n   was not a student and had previously violated university regulations. The court noted that \"[n]o evidence exists in the stipulated facts to indicate that appellant had any legitimate purpose to enter the university grounds.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 27} B.J.M. relies heavily on the case of\n   <em>\n    State v.

The defendant in\n   <em>\n    Shelton\n   </em>\n   had been advised that she would be arrested for trespassing if she continued to visit the public lobby of the sheriff's office \"because she was a nuisance.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 139,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=578%20N.E.2d%20473\">\n    578 N.E.2d 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . With minimal discussion, the court noted that the defendant \"did not enter a restricted area and did not refuse to leave,\" but had the privilege of entering the lobby revoked for being a nuisance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 139-140,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=578%20N.E.2d%20473\">\n    578 N.E.2d 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The officer who issued the warning acknowledged that he lacked any reasonable suspicion of criminal activity by the plaintiff but was requested to issue the warning because the plaintiff's conduct, staring at children, was making parents feel uncomfortable.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4216933\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/595/327/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4216933\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/595/327/\">\n    at 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The ban was based on the plaintiff's conduct in threatening the coaches of the municipal hockey team.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6. The plaintiff filed suit \"seeking a declaratory judgment that appellant's actions had deprived him of due process of law and seeking an injunction prohibiting appellant from enforcing its ban on him.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 31} This court acknowledged the municipal official's \"authority to maintain, operate, and police its facilities,\" but held that such official was not \"given unilateral authority to gather evidence, hold quasi-judicial proceedings, punish patrons for bad behavior, or prohibit someone from entering the public properties under his control.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33 and 28. Rather, this court observed that \"the offender should be charged with disorderly conduct or menacing, or another appropriate charge.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33. And \"[i]f [the municipality] wished to prevent an offender from entering its property, it could secure a restraining order\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   or \"adopt rules governing the conduct of persons in the arena and delegate the authority to enforce those rules.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 32} While none of the precedents cited are controlling, we conclude that, although a municipality has authority to ban persons from using public property and may delegate such authority to its agents, including police officers, due process requires that such persons have a meaningful opportunity to be heard and to contest the decision. B.J.M. in the present case was not afforded an opportunity to do so and, therefore, his privilege to enter Willowick public parks was not properly revoked. It follows that there was insufficient evidence to adjudicate him delinquent for acts constituting Criminal Trespass.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 33} We note that this holding applies to the categorical expulsion of persons from public property otherwise open to the general public. With respect to property designated for a particular purpose, such as an airport or school, for which access may be conditioned on visitors having a legitimate purpose, a different conclusion could apply. Nor does this holding apply to situations where police officers remove persons from public property on a given occasion to maintain order or when they could otherwise be cited or charged with causing a disturbance, as happened with B.J.M. on August 2, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 34} The State maintains that the trespass warning was reasonable in light of B.J.M.'s prior citations and repeated complaints about juveniles causing disturbances in municipal parks when B.J.M. was present. With respect to the due process analysis, however, the reasonableness of B.J.M.'s expulsion is not the determinative issue, but rather whether B.J.M. was afforded a meaningful opportunity to contest its reasonableness. He was not afforded such an opportunity. From the record before us, Officer Williams' decision to ban B.J.M. from municipal parks was not made according to rule, statute, regulation, or even informal policy. The criteria for banning B.J.M. appears to be nothing more than what Officer Williams found reasonable under the circumstances. While Officer Williams orally communicated the decision to both B.J.M. and his father, such notice was not for the purpose of affording B.J.M. an opportunity to be heard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Our decision in the present case is consistent with the decisions of other jurisdictions in similar factual situations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anthony v.
