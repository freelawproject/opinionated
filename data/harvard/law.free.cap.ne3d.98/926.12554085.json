Mulvey, appeals from a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas granting summary judgment in favor of defendants-appellees GuideOne Mutual Insurance Company, GuideOne America Insurance Company, GuideOne Specialty Mutual Insurance Company, GuideOne Elite Insurance Company, and GuideOne Services, L.L.C. (collectively \"GuideOne\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Mulvey began this action with a complaint seeking payment of severance benefits arising from termination of his employment with GuideOne in November 2002. The complaint sets forth claims for breach of written contract, unjust enrichment, quasi-contract, and detrimental reliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment and the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of GuideOne. Based on the evidence presented in support of and in opposition to summary judgment, the court concluded there remained no genuine issue of material fact because there was no written contract between the parties, the quasi-contract and unjust enrichment claims were time barred, and Ohio does not recognize an independent action for \"detrimental reliance,\" which is merely an element of actions for quasi-contract or promissory estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Assignments of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Appellant appeals and asserts the following two assignments of error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [I.] The Trial Court erred when it granted the Motion for Summary Judgment filed by Defendant-Appellee GuideOne Mutual Insurance Company by determining as a matter of law Thomas J. Mulvey was not entitled to severance pay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [II.] The Trial Court erred when it denied the Motion for Summary Judgment filed by Plaintiff-Appellant for the breach of contract claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Appellant's two assignments of error present identical issues and will be addressed together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The trial court decided this matter by summary judgment, which under Civ.R. 56(C) may be granted only when there remains no genuine issue of material fact, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, that conclusion being adverse to the party opposing the motion.\n   <em>\n    Tokles &amp; Son, Inc. v.

(Mulvey received a certificate in 2002 marking his 15 years of employment with GuideOne; this manifestly included his previous service with PSIC.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 9} GuideOne soon decided to divest itself of certain business units, including the activities arising from its recent acquisition of PSIC. In August 2000, GuideOne posted for employees a document entitled \"GuideOne Insurance Severance Pay Policy In The Event Of Qualifying Job Eliminations.\" (Aug. 31, 2016 Mulvey Mot. for Sum. Jgmt. at Ex. 3.) This document provided that, in the event of job eliminations within the company, \"affected employees who are terminated as a result of job elimination may qualify for severance pay and benefits continuation.\" (Aug. 31, 2016 Mulvey Mot. for Sum. Jgmt. at Ex. 3.) \"Qualified\" employees were required to execute a release before receiving their severance payments. A schedule appended to the policy announcement provided for severance payments in the amount of two or more weeks of pay per year of service, depending on employee grade and classification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Mulvey's deposition testimony and affidavit in support of summary judgment alleged that, in reliance on the posted severance policy,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   he remained an employee through a period of company\n   contraction until November 29, 2002, at which time he was terminated without severance pay. Mulvey does not dispute that no written and signed severance agreement or release was executed between the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 11} The stated reason for the company's denial of severance was that Mulvey could have accepted an equivalent position with the company that acquired his PSIC employment group from GuideOne. Shortly after termination, Mulvey wrote to his former employer to protest the lack of severance pay. He denied that he received an offer of comparable employment from the acquirer, which had only offered him a position of lesser responsibility and requiring more travel. He asserted that the posted severance policy contained no such restriction on eligibility for severance benefits, and that another similarly situated GuideOne employee had eventually been offered severance benefits despite her rejection of an offer from the PSIC group acquirer. The company declined to revisit the severance issue for Mulvey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 12} We first consider whether the severance policy constituted a binding written contract offered to certain GuideOne employees. Because Mulvey did not provide express assent to the terms of the severance policy by signature or otherwise, the contract, if formed, is in the form of a unilateral contract, which typically involves an offer made by a party which invites acceptance by performance rather than by a reciprocal promise to perform.\n   <em>\n    Bell v.

The Company also attempts to minimize the impact of job eliminations by transferring qualified employees where possible to available positions.

The employee also must be \"qualified\" to perform in an open position as determined in accordance with this policy. (Employees are considered \"qualified\" for a position if their education, training and job performance meet the minimum standards for the new position.)

If no suitable position is available, the employee will be terminated and the severance policy will then be made available.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   As with other positions offered by the Company, the affected employee may accept or reject any offer.

The court held in the alternative that, even if the policy were sufficiently definite to constitute a contractual offer, Mulvey had failed to satisfy a condition precedent because he did not execute the requisite release to claim severance benefits. We disagree with the conclusion of the trial court and reverse both the grant of summary judgment in favor of GuideOne and the denial of summary judgment for Mulvey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 18} First, we hold that the posted policy is sufficiently definite in its terms to constitute a contractual offer. The policy sets clearly defined parameters for employee eligibility and scope of benefits. In particular, the use of the term \"may\" does not indicate that the policy is discretionary, but only indicates that not all employees will meet the precisely defined terms for eligibility. The identity of the contracting parties and the consideration offered are clear, as is the manner of acceptance. \"Qualifying employees\" could therefore effect an acceptance-through-performance of this unilateral contract offer by continuing employment until terminated, thereby binding the employer to its contractual promise.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barron\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Helle\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Next, we conclude that Mulvey was a \"qualifying employee\" under the policy. The policy addresses two distinct forms of job elimination: in-house reductions in company workforce, and separation of staff through sale of company assets or business units. The options for employees affected by the former include reassignment within the company, with the right to refuse the new position and take severance. For the latter, which is Mulvey's case, the policy differs in that it does not discuss reassignment within GuideOne, nor does it require GuideOne employees to accept offers to continue employment with the purchaser/acquirer of the assets/business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 20} The policy regarding sale or transfer of assets merely states that no severance will be paid \"where an employee continues to work without interruption for a new employer.\" It does not further restrict severance eligibility for those who might refuse employment with the acquiring company. The stated ground for refusing severance benefits for Mulvey was that he had refused such an offer from the new employer. Because the language of the policy does not restrict his right to severance benefits in this way, he was a \"qualifying employee\" and GuideOne has asserted no other impediment, such as poor performance ratings,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and he is entitled to severance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Finally, we conclude that execution of a severance agreement and release was not a condition precedent until GuideOne had triggered it by offering severance pay to Mulvey. A condition precedent is a condition that must be performed before obligations in a contract become effective.\n   <em>\n    Transtar Elec., Inc. v. A.E.M. Elec.

In an October 17, 2000 information update, senior claims management informed GuideOne employees: \"You will have 45 days, once you have received your Severance Agreement &amp; Release, to sign the agreement and return it to us. Once you have returned your executed Severance Agreement, it will be signed by the appropriate person and a copy will be sent to you, along with a letter of reference explaining that your job was eliminated due to a business restructure.\" (Mulvey Depo., at Ex. 2.) GuideOne never established that it sent Mulvey the severance agreement and release. Therefore, Mulvey's not signing the release cannot be grounds at this time to deny severance. In other words, there was a condition precedent to the condition precedent: Mulvey could hardly execute a release until the company declared him eligible, offered severance, and tendered a release for signature. It did not do this; therefore, Mulvey did not forfeit any rights under the policy in this way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 24} In sum, we hold the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of GuideOne on Mulvey's claim for breach of a written contract. Mulvey himself was entitled to summary judgment on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 25} In accordance with the foregoing, we overrule in part and sustain in part Mulvey's first and second assignments of error. Accordingly, we affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas granting summary judgment in favor of GuideOne. The matter is remanded to that court to enter partial summary judgment in favor of Mulvey on his claim for breach of written contract of employment, and for further proceedings including the computation of damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment affirmed in part; reversed in part, and cause remanded.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   LUPER SCHUSTER, J., concurs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   HORTON, J., dissents.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    It appears that GuideOne also offered, and Mulvey accepted, a separate \"retention bonus\" offered to certain employees to encourage them to stay on in positions affected by cutbacks. This bonus operated independently of the severance policy and does not affect our analysis thereof.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    We also note that GuideOne did not aver that it had modified, revoked, suspended, terminated, or changed the policy effective August 16, 2000. The final paragraph of that policy states: \"This policy supersedes all previous policies related to job severance, job elimination or layoffs. The Company reserves the right to modify, revoke, suspend, terminate or change this policy, in whole or in part, at any time, with or without notice. The Senior Vice President or Assistant Vice President of Human Resources must approve any exceptions to this policy in writing.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"dissent\">\n  <author id=\"p-58\">\n   HORTON, J., dissenting.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 26} I respectfully dissent. I simply disagree with the majority's analysis and believe the trial court was spot on in its analysis and conclusions. This is a relatively simple case. If Mulvey was interested in receiving severance from GuideOne, pursuant to the posting, he was required to qualify as an employee (which he did), sign a release (which he did not), and continue working (which he did). Mulvey received compensation for the work he performed. Any additional compensation via severance required additional consideration, i.e., signing a release. He failed to sign a release and therefore should be precluded from receiving the benefits of severance as he\n   provided no additional consideration. Thus, as a matter of law, I would affirm the trial court on both assignments of error.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
