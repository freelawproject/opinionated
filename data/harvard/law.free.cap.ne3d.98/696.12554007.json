Defendant contends that he was denied his right of self-representation when the trial court denied his request to proceed pro se with \"standby counsel.\" Defendant further argues that he was deprived of a fair trial when the trial court precluded his proffered psychiatric testimony for failure to serve notice on the People pursuant to CPL 250.10. We agree with the courts below that neither contention is consistent with the controlling law. Therefore, we now affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    I.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In August of 2011, the police lawfully stopped defendant while he was driving a stolen car with a license that had been suspended and revoked. Defendant was searched and a loaded .45 caliber handgun was found in his jacket pocket. After the police seized the gun, defendant spontaneously declared that it was a good thing the officer had his gun drawn as quickly as he did because defendant would have shot him. Later at the precinct, defendant waived his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights and admitted to stealing the car at gunpoint. Toward the end of the 15-minute interview, defendant became agitated. He was later taken by police to a hospital for a psychiatric evaluation. Defendant was thereafter indicted for criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree, aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle in the third degree, and related counts. In August 2012, two psychiatrists examined defendant pursuant to CPL article 730, and a competency hearing was held. At the hearing, defense counsel questioned one of the examining psychiatrists about defendant's history of mental illness, and discussed the symptoms of schizophrenia that defendant exhibited. Defendant was found competent to stand trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A year later in 2013, and two weeks before trial, defendant requested to \"proceed as pro se.\" The trial court inquired if defendant wanted to represent himself, to which defendant replied that he did \"[n]ot\n   just [want to] represent myself, but having limitation with my counsel.\" The court plainly informed defendant that \"[y]ou either have a lawyer, or you don't have a lawyer.... You choose to represent yourself, you sit there by yourself. You want to have a lawyer, you have a lawyer.\" The\n   court then asked, \"All right?\" The record does not reflect defendant's response, if any, and defense counsel continued to represent defendant at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant raised the issue again after voir dire, when defense counsel informed the court that defendant had wanted to question the prospective jurors and sought to question the witnesses, in addition to the questioning done by his attorney. The court again told defendant that \"you have a right to represent yourself without an attorney. Or you have the right to have an attorney.\" Defendant maintained that the Sixth Amendment gave him the right to the assistance of counsel and he wanted \"assistance\" from his counsel-for his attorney to \"act[ ] like an aide.\" The court told defendant he could not have dual representation. Although defendant replied, \"I was asking if I could go pro se with standby counsel,\" he again clarified that he wanted the opportunity to ask any questions that his attorney failed to ask. The court denied the request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   During trial, despite having never served a CPL 250.10 notice, defense counsel sought to introduce the testimony of the psychiatrist who evaluated defendant, at the behest of the police, the day he was arrested. Counsel informed the court that the psychiatrist diagnosed defendant as \"bipolar, with psychotic features\" and, counsel argued, this diagnosis rendered defendant mentally incapable of voluntarily waiving his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights. After hearing from the psychiatrist outside the presence of the jury, the court precluded the evidence, concluding that (i) the proffered testimony was of slight probative value because the psychiatrist had no recollection of examining defendant; (ii) the evidence was insignificant; and (iii) the failure to serve a CPL 250.10 notice prejudiced the People.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The jury convicted defendant of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree, aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle in the third degree, and a related offense. The Appellate Division affirmed, determining that defendant's request to proceed pro se was equivocal since defendant asked only to proceed pro se with standby counsel (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175117\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/145/799/#p799\">\n    145 A.D.3d 799\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 799-800,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175117\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/145/799/#p799\">\n    43 N.Y.S.3d 461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [2d Dept. 2016] ).

Here, the record supports the trial court's conclusion that defendant's request to proceed pro se was equivocal, and was conditioned on the assistance of counsel. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in failing to conduct a further \"searching\" inquiry in response to defendant's request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Indeed, at the outset of the second request, defense counsel informed the court that defendant wanted to question prospective jurors and witnesses in addition to the questioning done by counsel. The court again explained to defendant that the court did not allow \"standby counsel,\" and that defendant had either the right to represent himself without counsel or the right to have an attorney. Defendant responded that the Sixth Amendment gave him the right to the aid and assistance of counsel. Defendant's invocation of the Sixth Amendment during the colloquy and his evident desire to have counsel question the prospective jurors and witnesses along with him is neither a waiver of the right to counsel nor the substance of an unequivocal request to represent himself. The United States Supreme Court \"explicit[ly]\" stated that the appointment of standby counsel is \"to relieve the [trial] judge of the need to explain and enforce basic rules of courtroom protocol or to assist the defendant in overcoming routine obstacles that stand in the way of the defendant's achievement of his own clearly indicated goals\" (\n   <em>\n    McKaskle v.

It is not to provide a defendant a cocounsel in front of the jury. Here, while defendant used the words \"standby counsel,\" the substance of his request-that he be permitted to ask questions in addition to those asked by his attorney-demonstrated that he was seeking dual representation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Whether his request is labeled as one of \"dual representation,\" \"hybrid representation,\" or \"pro se with standby counsel,\" the record supports the conclusion that what this defendant wanted was his right to the assistance of counsel at trial-i.e., he was not seeking to waive his constitutional right to counsel-and he never requested to proceed without counsel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, defendant did not satisfy\n   the first prong of\n   <em>\n    McIntyre\n   </em>\n   that he unequivocally request to represent himself and, therefore, the trial court did not err in failing to conduct a further inquiry.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant urges that a court presented with a request to proceed pro se with \"standby counsel\" should make an in-depth inquiry whether defendant still desires to represent himself, once defendant is informed that dual representation will not be provided. We hold that further colloquy by the trial court is not constitutionally required when a defendant remains equivocal, despite having been informed by the court on more than one occasion that his right to self-representation includes a waiver of the right to an attorney, as here. When a defendant asks to proceed \"pro se with standby counsel\" and the trial court explains the scope of the right to proceed pro se, and specifically denies the defendant's request for hybrid representation, the better practice would be to again ask the defendant if he or she still wants to proceed without counsel. Nevertheless, \"[w]hile such inquiries may be the better practice, we will not compel courts to engage in any particular catechism\" before denying an equivocal request to proceed pro se because \"[n]either our Constitution nor our precedent requires it\" (\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1189273\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/95/497/#p501\">\n    95 N.Y.2d at 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1189273\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/95/497/#p501\">\n    719 N.Y.S.2d 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1189273\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/95/497/#p501\">\n    741 N.E.2d 882\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

Defendant argues that the trial court erred in precluding his unnoticed psychiatric evidence because a challenge to the voluntariness of a confession pursuant to CPL 710.70 is not a \"defense\" and is thus outside the ambit of CPL 250.10(1)(c). We disagree.\n   Defendant narrowly construes the phrase \"any other defense\" in CPL 250.10(1)(c) to be limited to psychiatric evidence offered in support of a complete defense to an element of the crime, such as mens rea; he does not interpret the statute to include a defense strategy to offer evidence that allows the jury to negate the prosecution's evidence of guilt. As explained below, this argument ignores the legislative intent, our precedent espousing the very purpose of notice, and the fact that, if a defendant's confession was the primary evidence of guilt and the defendant raises the issue of voluntariness at trial, then voluntariness could be a complete defense to the crime (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12281392\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/28/355/#p359\">\n    28 N.Y.3d 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 359,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12281392\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/28/355/#p359\">\n    45 N.Y.S.3d 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12281392\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/28/355/#p359\">\n    68 N.E.3d 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [2016] ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Notably, our Court has previously labeled a defendant's challenge to the voluntariness of his statement pursuant to CPL 710.70 a \"defense\" (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v.

It is the very nature of psychiatric evidence that mandates the requirement of notice, if the defendant intends to rely on the evidence to negate the People's evidence of guilt. Thus, it is entirely consistent with the purpose of the statute to construe the phrase \"any other defense\" as used in CPL 250.10(1)(c), to apply to defendant's offer of psychiatric evidence in support of his contention that due to his mental illness, his statements, which are direct evidence of guilt, must be rejected by the jury (\n   <em>\n    see e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v.

Thus, in order not to defeat the purpose of the statute, we construe the phrase \"any other defense,\" as used in CPL 250.10(1)(c), to apply to psychiatric evidence offered by defendant in support of his contention that his statements to police were involuntary because his diagnosis of bipolar disorder rendered him incapable of understanding and waiving\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    B.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendant next argues that the record belies the trial court's finding that preclusion of the evidence was warranted on the ground that the surprise evidence prejudiced the People. In support, he claims the record shows that the People were aware early on that defendant had a mental illness. However, there are two critical flaws in this argument. First, knowing that defendant had a mental illness did not put the prosecutor on notice that defendant intended to introduce evidence at trial that his diagnosis rendered him incapable of giving a voluntary statement to the police. To be sure, defendant never even raised this voluntariness argument at his\n   <em>\n    Huntley\n   </em>\n   hearing. Second, defendant's contention ignores the law that his own medical records are privileged until he waives the privilege (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matter of Lee,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2297086\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/27/432/#p441\">\n    27 N.Y.2d at 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=318%20N.Y.S.2d%20705\">\n    318 N.Y.S.2d 705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=267%20N.E.2d%20452\">\n    267 N.E.2d 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). When defense counsel told the court that he had not received any hospital records from the prosecution, the court shrewdly observed that defendant's medical records were privileged and that the prosecution had no right to look at them. This is one of the primary reasons for CPL 250.10's existence. The People cannot have a mental health expert of their choosing examine a defendant nor can they obtain his or her medical records due to the privileged and confidential nature of the evidence, unless the defendant wants to affirmatively use a mental condition as evidence at trial, thereby waiving Fifth Amendment rights and statutory privileges\n   (\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=267%20N.E.2d%20452\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Segal,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2342115,1577877\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/54/58/\">\n    54 N.Y.2d at 64-65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1577877\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nys2d/444/588/\">\n    444 N.Y.S.2d 588\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1577877\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nys2d/444/588/\">\n    429 N.E.2d 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; CPLR 4507 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Finally, defendant contends that the court's refusal to excuse the lack of notice was an abuse of discretion since under the statute, the court may accept late notice \"[i]n the interest of justice and for good cause shown\" ( CPL 250.10[2] ). The record flatly refutes defense counsel's claim that good cause was shown for his untimeliness. Defense counsel was fully aware that defendant had a longstanding history of mental health problems, including diagnoses of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, as evidenced by the record of the CPL article 730 hearing, which took place a year before the trial. Furthermore, on the second day of trial, defense counsel informed the court that he had been trying unsuccessfully to contact the psychiatrist witness \"for weeks,\" contradicting his current assertion that he did not plan to challenge the voluntariness of defendant's\n   statements to the police until hearing the officer's trial testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The trial court, after examining the psychiatrist outside the presence of the jury, precluded the evidence-a police form containing a mere diagnosis-as speculative on the issue of voluntariness and because the People had no opportunity to examine defendant or obtain rebuttal evidence. That the psychiatrist testified that he had no recollection of the examination of defendant is also part of this equation. So too is the fact that there is no indication in the record that a diagnosis of bipolar disorder renders a defendant incapable of knowingly and voluntarily waiving his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights. Thus, the court reasonably decided to preclude the evidence at trial. Defendant's claim that the trial court abused its discretion in doing so is meritless.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   CPL 250.10 was designed to preserve the integrity of the trial process predicated on a principle of fairness. Accordingly, the trial court neither erred nor abused its discretion in precluding defendant's unnoticed psychiatric evidence as there was no justification for the surprise on this record, and to allow it would contradict the statutory purpose behind the notice requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    In the context of a defendant's constitutional right to counsel, we stated that a defendant asking the police \"should I speak to a lawyer\" did not amount to an unequivocal request for an attorney, such that his right to counsel did not attach and the statement he made to the police was not in violation of the Federal and State Constitutions (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     People v.

The majority offers no explanation\n   why Mr. Silburn should be treated differently from those who came before.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Nothing in Mr. Silburn's two statements-his only statements before the court summarily concluded the hearing-supports the majority's conclusion that his request to proceed pro se was\n   <em>\n    conditioned on,\n   </em>\n   rather than merely eventually\n   <em>\n    combined with,\n   </em>\n   his request for standby counsel. Consider the following illustration:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   CUSTOMER: Sir, excuse me, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   CASHIER: Yes?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   CUSTOMER: I would like to order a Big Burger.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   CASHIER: In other words, you want two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   CUSTOMER: Not just that, but I would also like fries with it-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   CASHIER: No, we don't do that. You either have a Big Burger, or you have fries. We don't serve combinations. You choose a Big Burger, you sit there without fries. You want fries, you have fries only.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   All Right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   Next customer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Would the cashier be justified in assuming the customer no longer desired a Big Burger and delivering an order of fries only? Should the customer go hungry for using a correlative conjunction?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   There are two important differences that make Mr. Silburn's situation grave, when compared to a fast-food fiasco. First, the court is tasked with determining which of two fundamental constitutional rights Mr. Silburn wishes to choose, if he must forgo one. That determination demands far more concern and precision than a simple lunch order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ironically here, although a \"lack of knowledge of legal principles\" and \"unfamiliarity with courtroom procedures\" cannot bar defendants from exercising their right to self-representation, the majority's decision uses those exact shortcomings to prevent Mr. Silburn from requesting to exercise his right (\n   <em>\n    People v. Davis,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4375003\" index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/49/114/#p120\">\n    49 N.Y.2d 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 120,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"226\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=424%20N.Y.S.2d%20372\">\n    424 N.Y.S.2d 372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"227\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=400%20N.E.2d%20313\">\n    400 N.E.2d 313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [1979] ). Second, the customer and cashier are on even footing, whereas Mr. Silburn is far less versed in law than the court. (Indeed, customers can take their money to the burger joint next door; Mr. Silburn is rooted to his spot.) The majority frees courts from engaging in \"any particular catechism\"-at the price of imposing a precise one on defendants (majority op. at 153, 74 N.Y.S.3d at 787, 98 N.E.3d at 702, quoting\n   <em>\n    People v. Rodriguez,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1189273\" index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/95/497/#p501\">\n    95 N.Y.2d 497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 502,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1189273\" index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/95/497/#p501\">\n    719 N.Y.S.2d 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1189273\" index=\"230\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/95/497/#p501\">\n    741 N.E.2d 882\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [2000] ). Yet who in that relationship has the pulpit?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Moreover, even assuming Mr. Silburn could be understood to have conditioned his request for self-representation on his request for the appointment of standby counsel, trial courts presented with those two requests should, if they deny the second, be required to ask defendants whether they prefer to reassert or recant the first. Mr. Silburn did not, as the majority would have it, \"remain equivocal despite having been informed of the scope of his right\" (majority op. at 153, 74 N.Y.S.3d at 787, 98 N.E.3d at 702); he remained silent. Given the court's decision to abruptly conclude the hearing after clarifying its rules,\n   we cannot interpret that silence as consent to representation by counsel. Only by asking follow-up questions that ascertain defendants' true intentions can trial courts avoid Sixth Amendment violations and foreclose the majority's concern that wily defendants will \"pervert the system\" by spouting ambiguities in a \"deliberate plot to manipulate the court\" (majority op. at 150, 152 n. 3, 74 N.Y.S.3d at 784-85, 786 n. 3, 98 N.E.3d at 699-700, 701 n. 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The injustice of the majority's approach is compounded by the fact that defendants reasonably expect their requests for standby counsel to be granted. It is unfair to punish a defendant for requesting what all assume-on the basis of our prior case law, their prior trials, the attestations of fellow inmates, the American Bar Association's (ABA) recommendations, or a colorable reading of the Sixth Amendment (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McIntyre,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2317234\" index=\"231\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/36/10/#p17\">\n    36 N.Y.2d at 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"232\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=364%20N.Y.S.2d%20837\">\n    364 N.Y.S.2d 837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"233\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=324%20N.E.2d%20322\">\n    324 N.E.2d 322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Crampe,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3690099\" index=\"234\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/17/469/\">\n    17 N.Y.3d at 475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3690099\" index=\"235\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/17/469/\">\n    932 N.Y.S.2d 765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3690099\" index=\"236\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/17/469/\">\n    957 N.E.2d 255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [defendant \"had previously represented himself with a lawyer's assistance\"]; Erica J.

Neither the majority nor the People contend that the court's failure to conduct a\n   <em>\n    McIntyre\n   </em>\n   inquiry upon Mr. Silburn's initial request was cured by his subsequent request. Nor could they plausibly argue that the second colloquy-which was, like the first, summarily curtailed by the court's abruptly adjourning proceedings for the day-supports the proposition that Mr. Silburn's initial request was conditioned on his receiving standby counsel. In that second colloquy, the court attempted to describe Mr. Silburn's earlier position, saying \"[Y]ou said you didn't want to represent yourself.\" Mr. Silburn immediately denied it: \"I never said that.\" The transcript plainly shows that Mr. Silburn, not the court, was correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In any event, Supreme Court also erred in refusing to contemplate even the possibility of assigning standby counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Whether to permit standby counsel is \"a subject for the discretion of the Trial Judge\" (\n   <em>\n    Mirenda\n   </em>\n   at 266,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"250\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=455%20N.Y.S.2d%20752\">\n    455 N.Y.S.2d 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"251\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=442%20N.E.2d%2049\">\n    442 N.E.2d 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   majority op. at 151, 74 N.Y.S.3d at 785-86, 98 N.E.3d at 700-01).

Those paragraphs enumerate certain statutory defenses that would, if established, completely exonerate the accused or mitigate the crimes charged-which is what a \"defense\" does. Read with its companions, paragraph (c) can only be meant to include evidence that would either raise a defense by creating reasonable doubt about the mens rea element of the crime or establish an affirmative defense (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Penal Law \u00a7 25.00 ;\n   <em>\n    see e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v.

There would be no reason to specify certain defenses in those paragraphs if (c) is meant, as the majority suggests, to apply to all psychiatric evidence whatsoever. In fact, there would be no reason to retain\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   of the 92 words of CPL 250.10(1) that follow \"[a]s used in this section, the term 'psychiatric evidence' means: (a) Evidence of mental disease or defect to be offered by the defendant\". What, in the majority's view, are we to make of the remaining 81% of the subdivision? Only the more limited interpretation propounded by Mr. Silburn gives meaning to paragraphs (a) and (b) while allowing them to inform the meaning of paragraph (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   It is unsurprising, then, that prior decisions of this Court have understood CPL 250.10(1)(c) in the same, limited terms.

Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    People v.

Yes, those statements are dicta. But they are suggestive of how \"the statutory language is generally construed according to its natural and most obvious sense\"-and thus further evidence of how effect should be given to it here (Statutes \u00a7 94).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The unambiguous meaning of CPL 250.10 allows no other result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Were we to look beyond the unambiguous language for evidence of the legislature's\n   intent, the legislative history and statutory context of the provision fully support the above interpretation. That history begins with the 1963 amendments to former Code of Criminal Procedure \u00a7 336. Those amendments were adopted to solve two specific problems that arose when a defendant surprised the People and the court by raising an insanity defense once a jury was impaneled: first, the inevitable adjournments that \"disturb[ed] the orderly progress of the trial, and could involve the reordering of proof and witnesses, all to the disservice of the court proceedings and the trier of fact\" (\n   <em>\n    Almonor,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"188555\" index=\"296\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/93/571/#p578\">\n    93 N.Y.2d at 579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"188555\" index=\"297\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/93/571/#p578\">\n    693 N.Y.S.2d 861\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"188555\" index=\"298\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/93/571/#p578\">\n    715 N.E.2d 1054\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ); second, the prospect that even those adjournments might provide the People \"insufficient opportunity to obtain the psychiatric and other evidence necessary ... to establish, as they must, the defendant's sanity beyond a reasonable doubt\" (\n   <em>\n    People v. Berk,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4438808\" index=\"299\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/88/257/#p264\">\n    88 N.Y.2d 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 264,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4438808\" index=\"300\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/88/257/#p264\">\n    644 N.Y.S.2d 658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4438808\" index=\"301\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/88/257/#p264\">\n    667 N.E.2d 308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [1996], quoting Mem of Commn on Rev of Penal Law and Crim Code following L 1963, ch 595, reprinted in 1963 McKinney's Session Laws of NY at 1986). The Code's new notice provision \"avoid[ed] delay\" and \"enable[d] the People to have defendant examined by their own experts within close temporal proximity to the offense\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4438808\" index=\"302\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/88/257/#p264\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4438808\" index=\"302\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/88/257/#p264\">\n    at 265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4438808\" index=\"303\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/88/257/#p264\">\n    644 N.Y.S.2d 658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4438808\" index=\"304\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/88/257/#p264\">\n    667 N.E.2d 308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). It came into being not to provide the People a preview of defendant's arguments, or to eliminate all surprise for its own sake-many things at trial are surprising-but to make it possible for them, within the limits imposed by the right to present a defense (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Letter from Thomas F. McCoy, St Administrator of Jud Conf, Apr. 15, 1963, Bill Jacket, L 1963, ch 595 at 6),to do their job without\n   <em>\n    unfair\n   </em>\n   surprise-that is, to make it possible for them in insanity defense cases, which turn on psychiatric evidence, to establish what they\n   <em>\n    must.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The extension of the statute from insanity to other psychiatric defenses followed a similar rationale. In 1981, we applied the logic of Code of Criminal Procedure \u00a7 336, by then operating under its present designation in the CPL, to a defendant's effort to introduce psychiatric evidence showing he suffered a memory impairment and\n   thus lacked the intent to provide false testimony that was an essential element of the People's perjury charge (\n   <em>\n    People v. Segal,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2342115,1577877\" index=\"305\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/54/58/\">\n    54 N.Y.2d 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1577877\" index=\"306\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nys2d/444/588/\">\n    444 N.Y.S.2d 588\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1577877\" index=\"307\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nys2d/444/588/\">\n    429 N.E.2d 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [1981] ). The \"basic point\" of the notice provision has always been the need to make it possible for the People to fulfill their obligation, which is \"fundamentally\" to \"prove every element of the crime, including intent whenever relevant\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 66,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1577877\" index=\"308\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nys2d/444/588/\">\n    444 N.Y.S.2d 588\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1577877\" index=\"309\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nys2d/444/588/\">\n    429 N.E.2d 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Without notice of psychiatric evidence that might undermine proof of an element of the crime, it would be simply impossible-rather than merely more difficult-for the People to carry that burden. Thus, \"[a]lthough proof of a mental defect other than insanity may not have acquired the status of a statutory defense, and will not constitute a 'complete' defense in the sense that it would relieve the defendant of responsibility for all his acts[,] it may in a particular case negate a specific intent necessary to establish guilt\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1577877\" index=\"310\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nys2d/444/588/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   [citations omitted] ). In such a case,\n   <em>\n    Segal\n   </em>\n   held, notice was required. The following year, the legislature codified that holding by adding paragraphs (b) and (c)-thereby writing\n   <em>\n    Segal\n   </em>\n   's narrow interpretation of what constitutes a defense for 250.10(1)(c) purposes into the law as it stands today (majority op. at 156, 74 N.Y.S.3d at 789, 98 N.E.3d at 704-05; William C.

CPL 250.10(2) brings the machinery of the section to life only when a defendant intends to proffer psychiatric evidence \"upon a trial\"; notice is not required before offering identical evidence at a pretrial hearing. Had Mr. Silburn proffered Dr. Elie's notes to contest the validity of his Miranda waiver at his suppression hearing-21 months into a 24-month pretrial detention period-but not planned to introduce them at trial, he would not have been required to provide notice at all. The majority has not provided an explanation of why evidence that could have been presented, without notice, at a hearing presents such a threat to the principle of fundamental fairness when adduced at trial. Instead, the majority argues that as a practical matter, \"timely notice ... would provide the People ample opportunity to obtain rebuttal evidence before the pretrial suppression hearing\" (majority op. at 159 n. 10, 74 N.Y.S.3d at 792 n. 10, 98 N.E.3d at 707 n. 10). That rejoinder misses the very point of my argument: very different types of psychiatric-evidence-based arguments are presented at suppression hearings and at trial. That focus on the trial itself strongly suggests the legislature intended to require notice of psychiatric evidence that proved the defenses typically raised at trial, and did not intend to bring into CPL 250.10's ambit psychiatric evidence that addressed the evidentiary issues, not generally fatal to the People's case, typically raised at pretrial hearings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \"This result does not offend the important policy considerations underlying the notice requirement\" (\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4293740\" index=\"320\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/22/539/#p545\">\n    22 N.Y.3d at 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4293740\" index=\"321\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/22/539/#p545\">\n    983 N.Y.S.2d 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4293740\" index=\"322\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/22/539/#p545\">\n    5 N.E.3d 1269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). In disagreeing with the majority's interpretation, I do not dispute that 250.10 furthers a \"compelling\" purpose, as it must to withstand the close scrutiny that attends any restriction on defendants' right to call witnesses on their behalf (\n   <em>\n    Almonor,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"188555\" index=\"323\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/93/571/#p578\">\n    93 N.Y.2d at 581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"188555\" index=\"324\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/93/571/#p578\">\n    693 N.Y.S.2d 861\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"188555\" index=\"325\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/93/571/#p578\">\n    715 N.E.2d 1054\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Ronson v.

When defendant seeks only to challenge evidence through which the People can\n   prove their case, however, rather than a required element of the offense or an affirmative defense, the concern for preventing unfair surprise is reduced. We, no less than the trial courts, \"must be vigilant in weighing a defendant's constitutional rights against the resultant prejudice to the People from the belated notice\" (\n   <em>\n    People v. Diaz,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3740878\" index=\"327\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/15/40/\">\n    15 N.Y.3d 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 47,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3740878\" index=\"328\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/15/40/\">\n    904 N.Y.S.2d 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3740878\" index=\"329\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/15/40/\">\n    930 N.E.2d 264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [2010] [internal quotation marks omitted] ). Here, that vigilance requires us to enforce the balance set by the legislature rather than bolster the People's position in ways that the legislature never intended. Adjusting that balance is not a task for this Court (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chem Specialties Mfrs. Ass'n v.

That is, even if the jury completely credited the psychiatric testimony, treated Mr. Silburn's Miranda waiver as ineffective, and utterly disregarded his subsequent inculpatory statements, no reasonable jury could have acquitted him. The psychiatric evidence, therefore, was unrelated to any \"other defense\", and is not subject to CPL 250.10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <em>\n    B.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Trial courts have the discretion to permit belated notice of an intent to proffer psychiatric evidence at any time \"in the interest of justice and for good cause shown\" ( CPL 250.10[2] ). The majority rejects Mr. Silburn's claim that, assuming notice was required, the trial court abused that discretion in refusing to permit late notice. In so doing, it propagates the trial court's confusion over which party had custody\n   of the records in question. The evidence the defendant sought to introduce was not a privileged medical record but a \"police form\" (majority op. at 161, 74 N.Y.S.3d at 793, 98 N.E.3d at 708). It was generated under the auspices of, and retained by, law enforcement officials. As such, it could have been admitted and the suppression issue argued without causing much more unfair surprise to the People than the unnoticed extreme emotional disturbance defense advanced on the People's proof that we approved in\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4293740\" index=\"333\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/22/539/#p545\">\n    22 N.Y.3d at 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4293740\" index=\"334\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/22/539/#p545\">\n    983 N.Y.S.2d 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4293740\" index=\"335\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/22/539/#p545\">\n    5 N.E.3d 1269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Where the People should not have been surprised by the evidence, the relevance of Mr. Silburn's mental health to the voluntariness of his confession was not plain until the interrogating officer testified at trial, and Mr. Silburn relied in good faith on what I believe to have been the correct, and on what was certainly a colorable, interpretation of CPL 250.10 in declining to provide notice, it was error for the trial court to refuse late notice under the statute. However, because I agree that the court was justified in precluding the evidence for its lack of probative value, and because the error would have been harmless, I concur in the result reached by the majority on this aspect of the CPL 250.10 question as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Accordingly, I would reverse Mr. Silburn's conviction and remand the case for a new trial before which his motion to proceed pro se, if renewed, could receive the requisite attention from the court.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    The majority's complaint that my illustration trivializes Mr. Silburn's constitutional rights underscores their error: a cashier would not treat a customer's request for a burger and fries this way; should a court treat Mr. Silburn's request for his constitutional rights with less or greater regard (majority op. at 152 n. 2, 74 N.Y.S.3d at 786 n. 2, 98 N.E.3d at 701 n. 2)? To \"trivialize\" something is to ascribe little worth or importance to it; who here has done so?\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    The flaws in the majority's definition can be illustrated by the following hypothetical: Imagine the police witnessed a defendant assault a fellow bar patron. That defendant tells her friends not to worry-she has a great defense-she intends to argue a video of the events in question should be suppressed as the fruit of an illegal search. Those friends would rightly object that that is no defense at all, and that the defendant should instead establish, e.g., an alibi, her infancy, or that she acted in self-defense.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    The majority hypothesizes that in some cases a defendant's confession is the sole or overwhelming evidence of guilt (majority op. at 154, 74 N.Y.S.3d at 787-88, 98 N.E.3d at 702-03). Even so, the nature of the prosecution's proof does not convert a question of admissibility into a defense. Moreover, the majority rests its hypothetical on a trial in which \"[t]he People's case, in addition to the inculpatory statements, included two eyewitnesses to the crime\" and the People admitted they \"were uncertain as to whether they were going to introduce defendant's statements\" (\n    <em>\n     People v. Miller,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12281392\" index=\"336\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/28/355/#p359\">\n     28 N.Y.3d 355\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 357,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12281392\" index=\"337\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/28/355/#p359\">\n     68 N.E.3d 61\n    </extracted-citation>\n    [2016] ). The inapposite citation suggests the hypothesized case is infrequent. Even were such cases common, I would nevertheless rest easy if the worst consequence of preferring the people's statutory pronouncements to the People's ease is that a prosecutor may someday have difficulty convincing a jury to convict primarily on the confession of defendants too mentally impaired to have waived their Miranda rights.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    Last year's Report of the Advisory Committee on Criminal Law and Procedure to the Chief Administrative Judge of the Courts of the State of New York (Jan. 2017) is similarly suggestive. Its discussion of CPL 250.10 recommends amending paragraph (1)(c) to refer to \"any other defense\n    <em>\n     or claim\n    </em>\n    \"-a step that would be unnecessary if the many luminaries on that committee shared the majority's expansive interpretation of the current statute (Report at 71). Additionally, that report's conclusion that the statute applies only to evidence of the defendant's mental disease or defect, and not to evidence of a third party's-even though such evidence might be relevant to, e.g., a justification defense-undermines the majority's claim that the statute was intended to eliminate all surprise (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    CPL 250.10[3] [allowing the People to apply for an order requiring the \"defendant submit to an examination\"] ).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    The difference is plainly rooted in type rather than timing. The legislature's intent in passing CPL 250.10 was to prevent two unfortunate consequences of introducing psychiatric evidence without prior notice: delaying the proceedings and delaying the prosecution's opportunity to obtain countervailing evidence that might be lost forever to the vagaries of mental health conditions if the People's psychiatrist did not examine the defendant shortly after the offense. The first consequence is of less concern in a suppression hearing, which is less likely to be compromised by a brief adjournment than is a jury trial already underway. The second consequence, however, is fully present; the suppression hearing will take place months or years after the contested statements. The opportunity to obtain reliable countervailing psychiatric evidence-the \"primary aim of the pretrial notice requirement\" (\n    <em>\n     Berk,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4438808\" index=\"338\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/88/257/#p264\">\n     88 N.Y.2d at 264\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4438808\" index=\"339\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/88/257/#p264\">\n     644 N.Y.S.2d 658\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4438808\" index=\"340\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/88/257/#p264\">\n     667 N.E.2d 308\n    </extracted-citation>\n    )-will be lost without notice, and yet notice is not required, even though the potential impact on the People's case-outright exclusion, rather than the possibility of a jury discounting evidence it has already been presented-is much greater. CPL 710.60(3) does not, despite the majority's effort to equate it to CPL 250.10, require before suppression hearings anything like the early notice required before introducing psychiatric evidence at trial. Instead, it allows the court to \"summarily deny the [suppression] motion if ... [t]he motion papers do not allege a ground constituting legal basis for the motion\". (CPL 710.60 [3 ][a] ).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"dissent\">\n  <author id=\"p-100\">\n   RIVERA, J.
