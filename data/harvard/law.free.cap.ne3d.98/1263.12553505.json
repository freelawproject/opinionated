For the reasons that follow, we affirm in part and dismiss in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Marcella King Piazza (\"Piazza\") began working for the county auditor's office in July 2003. She was transferred to the county board of revision and served as the office manager. Subsequently, in August 2010, Piazza was transferred to the Department of Justice Affairs as a victim advocate. Around the time of Piazza's transfer, the Plain Dealer Publishing Company (\"Plain Dealer\") started publishing a series of articles about the Cuyahoga County Board of Revision, claiming that an investigation was underway into the employees and board members' work habits and mismanagement within the department. One article characterized the matter as a \"scandal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On March 9, 2011, Piazza was terminated from employment with the county, along with Robert Chambers and Hanane Hmada, who previously worked in the board of revision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Within 90 minutes of her discharge, Piazza received a telephone call from a Plain Dealer reporter seeking comment on her discharge; Piazza declined to comment. Approximately 20 minutes later, at 11:50 a.m., the Plain Dealer published the initial article on www.cleveland.com, under the headline: \"Cuyahoga County Executive Ed FitzGerald fires three employees tied to the boards of revision scandal.\" In the article, former County Executive Edward FitzGerald's spokesperson explained that the firing was \"due to our reorganization of the board of revision.\" However, the cleveland.com post explained that the three terminated employees, including Piazza, were reassigned to other county departments in August after the\n   Plain Dealer reported about the poor work habits of board employees. The article repeated details of corruption at the board of revision, including that delays by the board members had cost local school districts and public agencies millions of dollars in tax revenue, and that altered tax documents had reduced property values in the county by more than $400 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} A second article, titled, \"Cuyahoga County Executive Ed FitzGerald says he couldn't justify keeping reassigned board of revision workers in new positions,\" was posted later that day at 6:22 p.m. The Plain Dealer stated that \"FitzGerald said he can't justify budgeting money for the positions Chambers and two other board castoffs were moved to, so * * * he fired all three.\" The article then identified the three employees-one of whom was Piazza. FitzGerald was quoted as saying \"instead of terminating them, the previous administration reassigned them. * * * We can't afford to reshuffle people for their own job security.\" Included in this article was a photograph of Piazza-a photograph that was provided by the county.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Although she was not a board member, Piazza claimed that the articles created an inference that she was a board member and involved in the \"county corruption scandal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} In 2015, Piazza filed a complaint against Cuyahoga County (\"the county\") and the Plain Dealer alleging false light invasion of privacy. The allegations stemmed from the quoted statements by FitzGerald, which were printed by the Plain Dealer. Piazza claimed that FitzGerald made the statements with a \"reckless disregard for the truth or falsity of his statement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The county moved for summary judgment, contending that it was immune from liability pursuant to R.C. 2744.02, and that Piazza's complaint was time-barred. In response, Piazza claimed that res judicata barred the county's claim of immunity. The trial court denied the county's motion, concluding that \"genuine issues of material fact exists [sic] and [Piazza's] false light claim is not time-barred, nor does political subdivision immunity apply to [Piazza's] claim arising from her employment relationship with [the county].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The county appeals on the authority of R.C. 2744.02(C), raising five assignments of error that will be addressed together where appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   I. Political Subdivision Immunity\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} In its first, second, third, and fourth assignments of error, the county contends that the trial court erred in denying its motion for political subdivision immunity on Piazza's sole claim for false light invasion of privacy. Specifically, the county raises the following assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Error No. 1: The trial court erred in finding that political subdivision immunity did not apply to plaintiff's sole claim for false light invasion of privacy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Error No. 2: The trial court erred in denying Appellant's Motion for Summary Judgment where none of the exceptions to political subdivision immunity applied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Error No. 3: The trial court erred in finding that plaintiff's claim arose from her employment relationship where plaintiff was not an employee and no causal connection or causal relationship between plaintiff's false light claim and the employment relationship was established.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Error No. 4: The trial court erred in denying Cuyahoga County's Motion for Summary Judgment where Plaintiff's sole opposition was an erroneous contention that res judicata barred Appellant's statutory immunity and statute of limitations\n   arguments and failed to oppose summary judgment with proper evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 11} An appellate court review a trial court's decision on a motion for summary judgment de novo.\n   <em>\n    Grafton v.

First, R.C. 2744.02(A)(1) sets forth the general blanket immunity applicable to political subdivisions. It provides that a political subdivision is generally not liable in a civil action for injury, death, or loss to persons or property incurred while performing governmental or proprietary functions. To overcome this statutory immunity, a plaintiff must show that one of the five exceptions contained in R.C. 2744.02(B) applies. If a plaintiff demonstrates that one of the five enumerated exceptions to governmental immunity applies, a political subdivision may then assert one of the defenses set forth in R.C. 2744.03(A) to revive its immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Piazza does not dispute that the county is a political subdivision and that none of the exceptions under R.C. 2744.02(B) apply in this matter. However, she contends on appeal that the county is not entitled to immunity pursuant to R.C. 2744.09, which provides,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   This chapter does not apply to, and shall not be construed to apply to, the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (B) Civil actions by an employee * * * against his political subdivision relative to any matter that arises out of the employment relationship between the employee and the political subdivision[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Accordingly, if the provisions in R.C. 2744.09(B) apply, then the immunity provisions do not apply to this matter. Piazza maintains that her termination and the statements made in reference to it was an employment matter, so immunity does not apply. The county, however, claims that the false light invasion of privacy claim did not \"arise out of the employment relationship\" because Piazza had been terminated prior to the county executive's statements and prior to her filing the complaint against the county.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 16} False light invasion of privacy is an intentional tort. Typically, \"an employer's intentional tort against an employee does not arise out of the employment relationship, but occurs outside the scope of employment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Brady v.

As recognized by\n   <em>\n    Fleming\n   </em>\n   , the legislature could have limited the application of the statute to cover only current employees; however, by using the language \"relative to any matter that arises out of the employment relationship,\" R.C. 2744.09(B) is intended to encompass more than just current employees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 19} We agree with\n   <em>\n    Fleming\n   </em>\n   that a strict reading of the statute would deny a former employee a remedy for intentional tortious comments made after his or her employment has ended.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"To hold otherwise would encourage employers to terminate employees to avoid potential liability when an incident has occurred.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 20}\n   <em>\n    Fleming's\n   </em>\n   interpretation of R.C. 2744.09(B) is consistent with this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    George v.

This court stated that when determining whether an individual's intentional tort claim arose out of the employment relationship with the political subdivision, the totality of the circumstances must be reviewed. In\n   <em>\n    George\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff, a detective with the village's police department, brought an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim against the village after he was laid off. George maintained that he was subject to a smear campaign by his fellow officers and others in the months preceding his lay-off and in the weeks immediately following. The tortious actions were allegedly a result of George's internal investigation of alleged misdoings within the police and other village departments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 21} This court concluded that \"the totality of the circumstances indicates that Detective George's claim * * * flowed from the actions taken by the Village in response to the internal investigation he was conducting. * * * [I]t is clear * * * that Detective George's claims stem from his employment with the Village.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23-24. This court made no distinction between the alleged comments made before George was laid off (employed) and after he was laid off (formerly employed) when determining whether George's claims stemmed from his \"employment relationship with the Village.\" Accordingly, this court found that the village was not immune from liability under R.C. 2744.09(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Whether there is a causal connection or causal relationship between Piazza's intentional-tort claim and her\n   employment relationship depends on the circumstances of the case. Looking at the factual basis for Piazza's claim, it is the alleged conduct and Piazza's employment relationship that govern the applicability of R.C. 2744.09. It cannot be ignored that the comments by the county executive or his spokesperson were made within two hours of Piazza's termination. Moreover, the only relationship between Piazza and the county executive was that of employment, and the comments arose out of her employment because they were directly related to Piazza's work performance and employment within the county. Finally, the comments explained why Piazza was terminated from employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Accordingly, Piazza's claims arose out of her employment relationship with the county, and the county is not immune from liability pursuant to the express exception in R.C. 2744.09(B). The county's first, second, third, and fourth assignments of error are overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   II. Statute of Limitations\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 24} In its fifth assignment of error, the county contends that the trial court erred by finding that the false light invasion of privacy claim was not barred by the relevant statute of limitations period. This court lacks jurisdiction to address this assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Generally, an order denying a motion to dismiss is not a final, appealable order.\n   <em>\n    DiGiorgio v.

The Eleventh District admitted that R.C. 2744.09(B), as written, could be interpreted to mean \"that the employee must have been currently employed at the time the tort occurred and at the time the lawsuit was filed,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30, but rejected that interpretation stating that, \"[i]f the legislature intended the statute to be as narrow as appellants suggest, it would have been quite simple to limit the application of the statute by stating just that.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Respectfully, R.C. 2744.09(B) says precisely what the Eleventh District rejects.

The word \"arises\" is present tense, so when used with the phrase \"employment relationship,\" it indisputably means that the employee's claim had to occur as a result of a current employment relationship (there can be no employment \"relationship\" if the person is not employed). If R.C. 2744.09(B) was intended to mean what both the Eleventh District and the majority believe, it could have been written accordingly: civil actions by a former employee relative to any matter that arose out of the employment relationship. Or at a minimum, the statute could make clear that it creates an exception to immunity under both circumstances: civil actions by an employee, past or present, relative to any matter arising out of the employment relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 34} In any event, to the extent that it is possible to give R.C. 2744.09(B) different interpretations, we must give it the interpretation that is most consistent with the idea that under the Political Subdivision Tort Liability Act, immunity is the rule, not the exception. The Ohio Supreme Court has made it clear that exceptions and defenses to immunity listed in R.C. 2744.02(B) are \"in derogation of a general grant of immunity, [so] they must be construed narrowly if the balances which have been struck by the state's policy choices are to be maintained.\"\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

Sampson's employment status at the time he filed suit would seem to suggest that a plaintiff need not be an employee of a political subdivision at the time he or she files an action for an intentional tort. However, Sampson's employment status at the time he filed his claim was neither raised nor addressed by the Supreme Court; the legal issue on appeal was whether an employer intentional tort, which had long been considered to be an act occurring outside of the employment relationship and thus not barred by the Workers' Compensation statutes,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blankenship v.

Given the framing of that issue, the Supreme Court had no occasion to consider whether Sampson was barred from invoking the R.C. 2744.09(B) exception because he was not employed at the time he filed his claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 36} But even if\n   <em>\n    Sampson\n   </em>\n   could be read to indicate that the Supreme Court was not reading R.C. 2744.09(B) to mean that a claimant must be an employee at the time the action against a political subdivision employer is filed, that interpretation would still leave Piazza outside of the exception. There is no dispute that at the time the statements at issue in this case were made, Piazza had been terminated. Once terminated, she no longer had an \"employment relationship\" with the county, so as a matter of law, the county executive's statements did not arise from an employment relationship.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   To be sure, the statements were ones related to work or employment at the county agency. However, in R.C. 2744.09(B) the word \"employment\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   specifically modifies the word \"relationship\" in a very specific way to indicate a relationship where a person performs services for remuneration under a contract of hire. As the statute is written, an act occurring after an employee no longer works for the employer cannot be said to \"arise from the employment relationship between the employee and the political subdivision.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 37} The Legislative Service Commission report\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   on R.C. 2744.09, 1985 HB 176, summarized the statute as liability provisions for political subdivisions \"and their employees,\" noting that the immunity political subdivisions enjoyed under R.C. 2744.02 do not apply to civil actions \"by an employee.\" Important is that R.C. 2744.09(B) does not refer to a \"person\" or \"anyone\" or even a \"former employee\" as those whose claims fall outside of political subdivision immunity. By using the word \"employee\" in the present tense, the statute references a current employment relationship where there would be an exception to immunity only for employees with actions against the political subdivision employer that arise out of the employment relationship between the two.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 38} The construction that the majority and the\n   <em>\n    Fleming\n   </em>\n   case give to the statute could also lead to unintended results. Because the false light cause of action would accrue when the allegedly defamatory statement is made, it seems that there would be no point in time when a political subdivision would no longer be exposed to liability for any statements made about a former employee regardless of how long the person has been a former employee, as long as the statement related to the former employee's employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 39} I share some of the majority's misgivings with the impact of R.C. 2744.09(B) when applied as written. I recognize, as the majority notes in adopting the decision in\n   <em>\n    Fleming\n   </em>\n   , that a strict reading of the statute prevents former employees of political subdivisions-more precisely, former employees whose claims arise after the employment relationship has ended-from being able to sustain their claims against a political subdivision in the face of governmental immunity. But what the majority fails to recognize is, as harsh or as unfair as that result may be (particularly to people who may be unjustly terminated), carving out an exception to immunity for such a clearly defined group appears to be precisely what the General Assembly intended. The legislature may plausibly have intended to maintain the immunity of political subdivisions for post-termination statements made about a former employee. Again, immunity is the rule, so exceptions are to be narrowly construed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Piazza was not an employee at the time the county executive's statements were made, so the statements did not arise out of an employment relationship between an employee and a political subdivision for purposes of R.C. 2744.09(B). I would disapprove\n   <em>\n    Fleming\n   </em>\n   and find, as a matter of law, that the county is immune from the false light invasion of privacy action.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    The majority's reliance on\n    <em>\n     George v.
