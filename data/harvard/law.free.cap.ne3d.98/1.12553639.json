On appeal, Appellant raises two assignments of error, contending that 1) the trial court erred in calculating his income on remand; and 2) the trial court erred in computing his gross income for purposes of the motion to modify child support. Because we find the trial court abused its discretion in disregarding the mandate given in our limited remand order, the trial court's July 28, 2016, Remand Decision and Journal Entry is reversed, and the matter is again remanded for the limited purpose of determining how much of Appellant's income, as already determined by the trial court to be $258, 427.00, constituted imputed income. Further, because we find that the trial court failed to dispose of\n   all pending issues that were newly raised post-remand, the trial court's August 18, 2016, Decision on Child Support and Judgment Entry does not constitute a final, appealable order and we lack jurisdiction to consider it. Accordingly, these appeals, which have been consolidated, are reversed, in part, remanded, in part, and dismissed, in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} We set forth the facts as previously observed in\n   <em>\n    Cummin v. Cummin, supra:\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   \"The parties were married on July 18, 1992 and have four children, all of which are still minors. A divorce decree was issued on November 4, 2011. As part of the divorce decree, the trial court ordered shared parenting, ordered Appellant to pay child support based upon the parties' full combined annual income, which exceeded $300,000.00, and also ordered Appellant to pay spousal support to Appellee. Appellant is a physician and Appellee, at the time of the divorce, had been out of the work force for several years while raising the parties' four children. However, at the time of the divorce, it was anticipated that Appellee would return to work and the trial court imputed income in the amount of $65,000.00 to Appellee for purposes of calculating child support. No initial direct appeal was taken from the divorce decree and associated orders.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Subsequently, Appellant filed a motion to modify support on January 7, 2014. Appellee then filed a cross-motion to modify child support, as well as a motion to modify visitation. A final hearing was held on June 25, 2014, with the parties having already worked out the majority of the parenting time issues. As such, the hearing primarily focused on financial issues that pertained to the motions to modify support. Appellant's new wife, Crystal Cummin, testified at the hearing. She testified that she and Appellant had been on several trips, including an Aruba vacation in which they took Appellant's children, a honeymoon to Croatia, a cruise to Puerto Rico, which was paid for by her employer, and a trip to New York. She testified that she earns approximately $116,000.00 annually working for Johnson &amp; Johnson.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Appellant testified that he earns $25,100.00 annually as the elected county coroner, most recently had a business net income of $150,206.00 and also has rental property income. He testified, however, that although he previously earned $11,000.00 annually as the hospital chief of staff, he would no longer receive that income because he was term-barred from continuing in that position. He further testified that his rental income had decreased and would continue to decrease in future years, as he had lost tenants and did not expect to be able to find new tenants. He also testified that his income had decreased due to the fact that he no longer performed inpatient hospital work. He testified that inpatient work did not pay well, and that he had reduced his work load in order to spend more time with his children. He estimated that he had decreased his weekly working hours from over one hundred hours to about seventy hours. On cross-examination, Appellant testified that he completed eighteen hours of continuing medical education while he was in Croatia for his honeymoon and, as a result, he deducted those travel expenses from his business income.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Appellee also testified during the hearing. She testified that her annual income was between sixty-eight and sixty-nine thousand dollars, not including any support payments she receives. She testified that until recently, she had provided\n   the children's health insurance benefits, despite the prior order that Appellant do so. She testified that it was her belief that Appellant's current income was $240,000.00 and that he was capable of earning that much.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   After considering the testimony of the parties and reviewing tax returns, the trial court issued its decision finding Appellant to be voluntarily underemployed. The trial court reduced spousal support by $100.00 a month, from $2,000.00 per month to $1,900.00, but increased child support from $832.59 per month to $1,371.83 per month. The trial court noted in its entry, in connection with its finding that Appellant was voluntarily underemployed, that '[t]he net results cannot be precisely computed but the Court has made an effort to develop a reasonable child support calculation.' The trial court properly attached a child support computation worksheet to its decision, noting that it had calculated support based upon a $150,000.00 income limit as well as based upon the parties' actual combined annual income, which was $320,586.40, and had decided not to cap the support at the $150,000.00 limit. * * *\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On his first, direct appeal of the matter, Appellant argued that the trial court erred in extrapolating his child support obligation beyond the obligation for a combined income of $150,000, and that the trial court erred in calculating his income.\n   <em>\n    Cummin\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6. With regard to the income calculation contention, Appellant argued that the trial court erred in finding he was voluntarily underemployed and imputing income to him. Appellant also argued the evidence did not support the gross income calculation the trial court attributed to him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On appeal, this Court affirmed the trial court's decision to extrapolate Appellant's child support obligation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16. We also affirmed the trial court's calculation of Appellant's gross income, including its decision that Appellant was voluntarily underemployed and, as such, its decision to impute income to Appellant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25. However, we observed as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \"Here, although the record is clear on the reasons the trial court decided to impute income, we cannot ascertain from the trial court's journal entry the amount of potential income the trial court actually imputed to Appellant.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Because we found the record \"unclear as to how much income was imputed[,]\" we reversed the decision, in part, and remanded the matter to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with our opinion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The trial court held a remand hearing on May 18, 2016. In its remand decision the trial court noted that \"[w]hile the parties understood the Court was asked only to supply an income figure that was imputed to Defendant in a prior decision, they expressed a mutual desire to submit other current issues.\" As such, the trial court permitted the parties to put on additional evidence related to issues involving the medical, dental and optical insurance coverage for the children and the management of the children's 529 College Savings Plans. Appellant also made an oral motion to modify child support based upon changed circumstances which involved the emancipation of one of the parties' children as well as the birth of a child between Appellant and his new wife.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Following the hearing, the trial court issued a Remand Decision and Journal Entry on July 28, 2016. Appellant filed a timely appeal from that decision. The trial court issued another decision on August 18, 2016, entitled Decision on Child Support and Judgment Entry. Appellant also appealed that decision. This Court sua\n   sponte consolidated the appeals on September 1, 2016. Appellant now raises two assignments of error for our review, as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \"I. THE TRIAL ERRED IN CALCULATING DR. CUMMIN'S INCOME ON REMAND.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   II. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN COMPUTING DR. CUMMIN'S GROSS INCOME FOR PURPOSES OF THE MOTION TO MODIFY CHILD SUPPORT.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 7} In his first assignment of error, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in calculating his income on remand. Appellant also contends that the trial court failed to comply with this Court's remand mandate, and therefore abused its discretion. For the following reasons, we agree with Appellant's remand argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 8} We review child support matters under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Booth v.

We also affirmed the trial court's decision to impute income to Appellant as a result of his voluntary underemployment. As explained above, we ordered a limited remand solely for the purpose of determining how much of Appellant's annual income, as determined by the trial court to be $258,427.00, constituted imputed income. The trial court was not ordered, nor was it authorized, to completely recalculate Appellant's annual income, or to revisit its prior decision regarding Appellant's voluntarily underemployment and whether income should be imputed.

In fact, despite expressly acknowledging, both on the record during the remand hearing and in its remand decision, that the case has been remanded solely for a determination regarding the amount of income that had been imputed, the amount of imputed income was not even addressed by the trial court.

As such, Appellant's first assignment of error is sustained and the judgment of the trial court is reversed. Further, we again remand this matter for the limited purpose of determining how much of Appellant's income, as already determined by the trial court to be $258,427.00, constituted imputed income.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 16} In his second assignment of error, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in computing his gross income for purposes of the motion to modify child support. Appellant specifically argues that 1) the trial court relied upon inadmissible evidence when imputing $220,000.00 worth of gross income to Appellant; 2) the trial court failed to separately calculate his actual income and the amount of income it was imputing; 3) the trial court erred by including his income from his Coroner's position while also imputing the full salary of a private practice physician; 4) the trial court erred by failing to credit him with an adjustment for having a resident child; 5) the trial court erred in allocating credits for the provision of health insurance; and 6) the trial court failed to make findings of fact and conclusion of law, despite his timely request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Before we reach the merits of Appellant's arguments under this assignment of error, we must first determine whether the trial court's August 18, 2016 entry constitutes a final appealable order.

However, by agreement of the parties, several new issues were brought before the trial court, including Appellant's oral motion for a modification of child support based upon changed circumstances which included the emancipation of one of the parties' children, as well as the birth of a child between Appellant and his new wife. The other issues brought before the trial court involved the management of the parties' children's 529 College Savings Plans, and the provision of medical, dental and optical insurance for the children. Testimony was presented on all of these issues during the remand hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 19} At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court stated, on the record, that an agreed entry regarding the 529 College Savings Plans needed to be filed, and that an agreed entry regarding the provision of medical, dental and optical insurance coverage needed to be filed. Further, the trial court expressly stated in its August 18, 2016 entry that it was \"still awaiting the agreed entry from counsel resolving the allocation of medical/dental/optical insurance.\" Our review of the record indicates that at the time the trial court issued its judgment on August 19, 2016, the issues related to the 529 College Savings Plans and the insurance coverage for the children remained unresolved and pending. Thus, it appears that although the trial court resolved the issues related to Appellant's post-remand, oral motion to modify child support, and despite its language in the entry that the judgment was a final appealable order, the trial court did not resolve these other pending issues. Accordingly, because this case includes multiple claims and the trial court's judgment did not resolve all pending issues, the trial court's decision does not constitute a final, appealable order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Elliott,supra,\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18. Accordingly, we hereby dismiss this portion of Appellant's appeal. Further, this matter is again remanded for the limited purpose of determining how much of Appellant's income, as already determined by the trial court to be $258,427.00, constituted imputed income.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT REVERSED IN PART, REMANDED IN PART, AND DISMISSED IN PART.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Harsha, J.: Concurs in Judgment and Opinion as to Assignment of Error I; Concurs in Judgment Only as to Assignment of Error II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Hoover, J.: Concurs in Judgment Only.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
