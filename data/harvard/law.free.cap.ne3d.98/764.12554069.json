The issues before this court are whether the holding of an emergency meeting for the purpose of adjourning into executive session to discuss the termination of the chief of police's employment violates a contract provision that employment must be terminated at a duly authorized public meeting and in accordance with Ohio's Sunshine Law; whether crass sexual comments directed to the chief of police by a councilwoman, three to four times a month over a couple of years, creates a genuine issue of material fact sufficient to support a claim of hostile work environment sexual harassment; and whether an adverse, final judgment in federal court on a retaliation claim brought under 42 U.S.C. 2000e bars, under the principles of res judicata, a state-law retaliation claim under R.C. 4112.02(I) based on the same underlying facts. For the following reasons, the judgment of the lower court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On July 18, 2014, Kuivila filed a Complaint against the City of Newton Falls, its city council members (Johnson, Monteville, Hoffman, Beer, Luonuansuu, and Zamecnik), the city manager (Haney), and its former mayor (Pat Layshock). Kuivila raised claims of Retaliation under R.C. 4112.02 (Count One), Sexual Harassment/Gender Discrimination under R.C. 4112.02 (Count Two), Violation of Ohio Sunshine Laws (Count Three), and Wrongful Discharge-Breach of Contract (Count Four).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On September 19, 2014, the defendants filed their Answer collectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On September 9, 2015, the defendants filed a Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On September 16, 2015, Kuivila filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on Counts Three &amp; Four of Plaintiff's Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On November 12, 2015, Kuivila filed his Opposition to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On January 29, 2016, the trial court granted the defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment and denied Kuivila's Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On February 10, 2016, Kuivila filed a Notice of Appeal.

Such emergency ordinance shall require no public hearing and both the first and second reading may be passed at the same meeting. Such emergency ordinance shall be published as other ordinances after final passage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Kuivila argues the February 12, 2013 emergency session was not duly authorized \"because the City Council considered business outside of what was noticed in the agenda for the emergency meeting.\" Appellant's brief at 14. According to the Emergency Meeting Agenda, the purpose of the meeting was: \"1. Motion to adjourn into executive session for the purpose of personnel in reference to employment or dismissal of the Chief of Police.\" According to the minutes of the emergency session, Ordinance 2013-02 was added to the agenda on Hoffman's motion. Kuivila maintains that, since Ordinance 2013-02 was not included in the Emergency Meeting Agenda, it could not be considered by the Council at the emergency session. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 20} The Emergency Meeting Agenda fairly established that the subject under consideration was the continued \"employment or dismissal of the Chief of Police.\" According to the Charter, this was the only subject that could be considered. Kuivila would interpret the Charter provision as restricting Council's ability to act on the subject under consideration, i.e., that the only action that could be taken by Council was the adjournment into executive session. Such an interpretation is overly restrictive. The Charter requires notice of subjects to be considered, not possible actions that could be taken with respect to the subjects considered. The passage of Ordinance 2013-02 was added to the agenda during the session, but this Ordinance\n   did not exceed the scope of the subject under consideration which was the \"employment or dismissal of the Chief of Police.\" The passage of an ordinance terminating the police chief's Employment Agreement does not violate a City Charter provision restricting the business that may be considered at an emergency meeting when notice of the meeting advised that the Council would adjourn into executive session \"for the purpose of personnel in reference to employment or dismissal of the Chief of Police.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Kuivila argues the February 12, 2013 emergency session was not \"a true public meeting * * * because the sole business to be considered as noticed on the agenda for the emergency meeting was for the City's Council to adjourn into an executive session.\" Appellant's brief at 16. According to Kuivila, the emergency session could not be a public meeting if \"all substantive business was to be conducted in private.\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 22} There is no evidence that the February 12, 2013 emergency session was not open to the public as that term is commonly understood. Notice of the meeting was sent to numerous media outlets, including the Weekly Villager, the Tribune Chronicle, the Vindicator, and the Review Newspapers. Although discussion of whether to retain Kuivila as police chief was conducted in executive session, the motion to add Ordinance 2013-02 to the agenda and the passage of that Ordinance occurred during the open or public portion of the session. The Employment Agreement required that the vote to terminate Kuivila take place at a \"public meeting,\" not that the deliberations underlying the decision to terminate be made public.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stewart v.

Kuivila bases this claim on the fact that \"[t]he notice provided for the February 12, 2013 emergency meeting was prepared and then sent by the City's Clerk, Kathleen King-who was not the mayor, vice-president of council, or two members of the City's Council.\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 24} The inference that, because the City Clerk prepared the notice of the emergency session, the meeting was not called by a person authorized to do so is not a reasonable inference. King testified, by deposition, that as Clerk she usually sends out the notices for such meetings. The record is effectively silent as to who called the emergency meeting. We will not infer that it was someone other than \"the Mayor, the Vice-President of Council or any two members of the Council\" from such a record. The minutes of the emergency session indicate that the meeting was called to order by the Mayor and that all business was initiated by members of Council, including then Vice-President of Council, Hoffman.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Kuivila argues that Ordinance 2013-02: An Ordinance Terminating the Employment Agreement Between the City of Newton Falls and Police Chief John Kuivila and Declaring an Emergency was not a properly enacted emergency ordinance and, therefore, \"cannot be permitted to stand under Section 11A of his [employment] contract.\" Appellant's brief at 19. Kuivila contends that \"the need to adopt it was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   an emergency and, even if there was an emergency, that need was not specifically set forth in the ordinance as required by the City's Charter.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 26} The Charter mandates that an emergency ordinance may be adopted when necessary \"for the preservation for the public peace, health, welfare, or safety,\" and that the ordinance must \"set forth and define the specific facts designating the emergency.\" Ordinance 2013-02 states that it was Council's belief that Kuivila had \"undermined his ability to remain an effective leader\" as Police Chief and, therefore the emergency ordinance was \"necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, welfare, or safety of the City, for the reason that an immediate termination of the Employment Agreement is necessary.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Kuivila may not raise the lack of a legitimate emergency as a disputed issue of material fact precluding summary judgment. By formally complying with the Charter requirements for emergency legislation, Ordinance 2013-02 satisfies the Employment Agreement provision that his termination be voted at a duly authorized public meeting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 28} This court has previously recognized the case law holding that the underlying justification for the passage of emergency legislation is not subject to judicial review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   \"Where an ordinance, passed by the council of a municipality, is declared to be an emergency measure in accordance with that municipality's laws and sets forth the reasons for the immediate necessity thereof, the legislative determination of the existence of an emergency is not reviewable by a court.\"\n   <em>\n    Jurcisin v.

The Charter requires \"at least ten hours notice in writing of such emergency meeting served personally on each member of Council or at his usual place of residence.\" Kuivila maintains \"it is not known whether all of the notices were delivered within the required ten hours before the emergency meeting,\" relying on Johnson's deposition testimony that she was unaware at what time notice was left on the porch of her residence and former Newton Falls' Mayor, Lyle Waddell's, deposition testimony that he had no idea at what time his wife signed for the receipt of his written notice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 31} As with the issue of whether the emergency meeting was called by a person authorized to do so, it cannot be reasonably inferred that Johnson and Waddell did not receive timely written notice of the emergency meeting from the fact that they can no longer recall when they actually received notice. Moreover, any defect in the provision of notice would constitute an immaterial and inconsequential breach of the Employment Agreement. The mayor, all members of Council, the City Manager, the City Clerk, and the Law Director were all present at the February 12, 2013 emergency session. The passage of the Ordinance terminating the Employment Agreement was unanimous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 32} The first assignment of error is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 33} In his second assignment of error, Kuivila asserts that the February 12, 2013 emergency session violated section 121.22 of the Revised Code, commonly known as the Sunshine Law or Open Meetings Act, and thus was not a duly authorized meeting. Kuivila cites to R.C. 121.22(G), which provides \"the members of a public body may hold an executive session * * * only at a regular or special meeting * * *.\" Kuivila concludes that, \"because Appellees conducted an executive session in its emergency meeting on February 12, 2013, the meeting was in violation of R.C. 121.22(G). Appellant's brief at 22. To the contrary, we hold that the February 12, 2013 emergency session was not subject to the provisions of R.C. 121.22(G).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Newton Falls is a chartered municipality in possession of \"all powers of local self-government.\" Newton Falls Charter, Article I, Section 2. \"The general rule is that in matters of local self-government, if there is a conflict between a charter provision and a statute, the charter provision prevails.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

All regular and special meetings of Council shall be subject to the provisions of the Ohio Sunshine Law, codified in Section 121.22 of the Ohio Revised Code.\" The City's Charter distinguishes between special meetings (Article III, Section 7) and emergency meetings (Article III, Section 8), a fact acknowledged by Kuivila.

When he admonished her that her conduct was inappropriate, Johnson replied that he was jealous because he did not get to see her breasts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 42} On November 2, 2009, at a city council meeting, Johnson told a friend of hers that she wanted to feel Kuivila's \"balls\" to see how big they were. Johnson later told Kuivila, \"I bet you have a set,\" and pointed to his crotch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 43} On November 16, 2009, Johnson again made reference to Kuivila about his \"balls,\" expressing a desire to feel them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 44} On January 11, 2010, Johnson brushed past Kuivila while leaving a city council meeting. Kuivila apologized that his \"belly was in her way.\" Johnson pointed to Kuivila's crotch and commented, \"I think it was something else.\" On this occasion, Johnson \"actually put her fingers on [Kuivila's] penis through [his] pants when she pointed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 45} Between January and April 2010, Kuivila encountered Johnson \"at least three or four times a month,\" and on each occasion \"she made similar, unwelcome, sexual comments.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 46} Since April 2010, Kuivila \"encountered and had many incidents of similar conduct from Mary Ann Johnson, which were based on my gender, were sexually suggestive, offensive and unwelcome.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 47} In the summer of 2012, Kuivila's wife, Danielle, was watching her husband play a softball game. She heard Johnson say in reference to Kuivila that she would like to \"fuck his ass.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 48} Kuivila claimed that Johnson's conduct affected his ability to do his job and he was \"specifically concerned of how her comments and behavior affect [his] reputation and image as the Chief of the City's Police Department.\" The situation with Johnson was further aggravated by her appointment to the Council's Safety Committee, which \"further affected [his] ability to do [his] job.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 49} None of the alleged incidents with Johnson occurred at the police station, but, rather, at council meetings and public events.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 50} We conclude, upon independent review of the evidence, that Kuivila has failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Johnson's \"conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive to affect the 'terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.\" To satisfy this element of a claim for hostile-environment sexual harassment, \"the trier of fact, or the reviewing court, must view the work environment as a whole and consider the totality of all the facts and surrounding circumstances, including the cumulative effect of all episodes of sexual or other abusive treatment.\"\n   <em>\n    Hampel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1090796\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/89/169/\">\n    89 Ohio St.3d 169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=729%20N.E.2d%20726\">\n    729 N.E.2d 726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at paragraph five of the syllabus. \"These may include the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 180,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=729%20N.E.2d%20726\">\n    729 N.E.2d 726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , citing\n   <em>\n    Harris v.

The incidents from November 2009 occurred before Johnson had taken office as a councilwoman and cannot, therefore, be properly considered workplace harassment. The incident at the softball game in the summer of 2012 appears, at most, to have been a comment made to a friend of Johnson that Kuivila's wife overheard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 52} What remains are occasional crass sexual comments, made three to four times a month over a period of a couple of years, and an isolated incident of touching.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the circumstances of the present case, these are insufficient to establish a hostile work environment. We note that the comments were not made in the context of Kuivila's immediate work environment. There is no evidence that Johnson was ever present in the Newton Falls police station or made her comments in the presence of other police officers. Moreover, Johnson was not Kuivila's immediate supervisor. She did not work with Kuivila on a day-to-day basis and had no direct authority over how Kuivila performed his employment duties. As a member of City Council, Johnson had a vote in regards to Kuivila's continuing employment as well as over certain aspects of department policy. But this vote was not a majority vote-she was just one of five Council members-and there is no evidence that any other members of Council approved of or colluded in Johnson's alleged harassment. Johnson was not physically intimidating. She was described by Kuivila as an older lady who, in height, reached only to his chest. Finally, there is a lack of evidence that her conduct unreasonably interfered with his work performance. Kuivila testified that he was concerned how her comments could affect his reputation and image as the Chief of Police, but he provides no specific examples of how they did so. Such concerns, without more, do not create an issue as to whether the terms, conditions, or privileges of his employment had been altered.\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   at 21,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"232972\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/17/#p23\">\n    114 S.Ct. 367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a valid claim exists \"[w]hen the workplace is permeated with 'discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult,' * * * that is 'sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment' \") (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 53} The third assignment of error is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 54} Under the fourth and final assignment of error, Kuivila contends the trial court erred in granting summary judgment with respect to his claim of Retaliation.

The difference between a special and an emergency meeting is the amount of notice provided, i.e., at least 24 hours advance notice for a special meeting versus immediate notice for an emergency meeting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 121.22(F). The City's Charter, Article III, Section 8, requires 10 hours notice for emergency meetings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   {\u00b6 94} A key purpose of Ohio's Open Meeting Act, popularly known as the Sunshine Law, is to provide notice to the public and have open meetings. Citizens are entitled to due process and equal protection. Transparency is paramount to promoting justice and instilling public faith in our system of governance. In this case, this writer finds that proper notice was not provided to the public and an open meeting was not held. Furthermore, it is unclear how this action is an emergency under the code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   {\u00b6 95} The issue related to appellant's breach of contract claim is limited to whether the emergency meeting, i.e., private meeting, was lawfully held. As stated, appellant was terminated under Section 11(A) of the contract. Thus, issues of cause are not relevant here. City Council was able to terminate appellant through a majority vote. This could only be accomplished at a \"duly authorized public meeting\" under the provisions of appellant's contract, Section 11(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   {\u00b6 96} Appellant presents five separate grounds upon which the February 12, 2013 emergency meeting violated his employment contract and/or the City's Charter: (1) business was considered in the emergency meeting which went beyond what was noticed to be considered in the meeting; (2) the agenda noticed for the emergency meeting contained no business to be conducted or considered in public; (3) the emergency meeting was not called by officials authorized to call the meeting; (4) the ordinance, which was the action used to terminate appellant in the emergency meeting, was not enacted in accordance with the City's Charter; and (5) there was no true emergency for the meeting to allow for the meeting to be conducted with less notice to the public and those required to be notified under the City's Charter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   {\u00b6 97} Regarding appellant's third ground, he asserts the emergency meeting was not properly called as the notice was sent by the City's Clerk, Kathleen King, instead of \"the Mayor, the Vice-President of Council or any two members of Council\" in accordance with the City's Charter, Article III, Section 8. Although it is true that Ms. King prepared the notice, it is also true that the minutes reflect that the meeting was called to order by Mayor Waddell. (Exhibit U). In totality, I find the majority of the arguments contained in appellant's remaining grounds have merit to the extent indicated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   {\u00b6 98} Article III of the City's Charter reveals that when City Council conducts an emergency meeting, notice is required to be provided with the purpose of the meeting contained in the notice and no other business may be considered at that meeting. Notice for the February 12, 2013 emergency meeting was prepared on February 11, 2013 with an agenda indicating that the sole purpose of the meeting was to motion to adjourn into executive session, i.e., private, for the purpose of personnel in reference to appellant's employment or dismissal. Nothing other than the adjournment into executive session was provided in the notice and under the City's Charter, no other business could be considered at the February 12, 2013 meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   {\u00b6 99} The minutes reveal that business conducted went beyond the sole purpose as noticed for the February 12, 2013 meeting. At the meeting, Council added and passed emergency Ordinance 2013-02, which terminated appellant's contract. Again, the City's Charter, Article III, Section 21, provides that emergency ordinances are necessary \"for the preservation for the public peace, health, welfare, or safety[.]\" The Ordinance contained no specific designation as to why it needed to be adopted as an emergency. Also, based on the facts presented, this writer fails to see why appellant's contract had to be terminated immediately and without the proper notice and requisite transparency which is owed to the public. In essence, there was no indication in the record it was an emergency. The notice was deficient on its face.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   {\u00b6 100} The business conducted and considered outside of the executive session did not occur at a duly authorized public meeting, called for the purpose of passing an ordinance or taking a vote to terminate appellant. Thus, the action of appellees to terminate appellant in this meeting violated Section 11(A) of his contract and the City's Charter. As the supposed public meeting was noticed in order for all substantive business to be conducted in private, the meeting could not be and was not a public meeting as required under appellant's contract and its own charter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   {\u00b6 101} The record establishes that appellees did not comply with the Sunshine Law and the City's Charter in holding the public meeting and executive session. Council lacked authority at that meeting to act under their Charter. Therefore, the employment agreement was terminated at a meeting which was not a duly authorized public meeting, and there was a breach of contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   {\u00b6 102} This writer finds appellant's first and second assignments of error have merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   {\u00b6 103} In his third assignment of error, appellant maintains the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of appellees on his claim of sexual harassment based on a hostile work environment. Appellant's hostile environment sexual harassment/gender discrimination claim centers around the actions of City Council member Johnson beginning in November 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   {\u00b6 104} To survive summary judgment, appellant must point to some evidence to support each element of his sexual harassment claim, including: (1) that he was a member of a protected class; (2) he was subjected to unwelcomed sexual harassment in the form of the request for sexual favors; (3) the harassment complained of was based on sex; (4) his submission was an express or implied condition for receiving job benefits; and (5) the existence of respondeat superior liability.\n   <em>\n    Scarvelli v.

The first instance of alleged sexual harassment cited by appellant occurred on November 2, 2009, one day\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   Johnson was elected to City Council. The second and third instances occurred on November 11 and 16, 2009, after Johnson was elected to Council but\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   she took office on January 1, 2010. Johnson admits that she referred to appellant's genitalia in a comment that occurred during a November 2009 Council meeting. Although Johnson's comment was clearly inappropriate, respondeat superior liability cannot attach because the foregoing instance(s) occurred\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   she had taken office. Thus, the timeframe above does not support that Johnson committed any tort while acting within the course and scope of her employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   {\u00b6 107} Appellant also asserts that Johnson continued to sexually harass him\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   she took office. The trial court and appellees point to only a single occurrence on January 11, 2010, involving an instance where appellant claims Johnson pointed at and made a comment regarding his penis. Johnson denies making any such gesture or statement during the January 2010 Council meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   {\u00b6 108} This writer notes that the federal court referenced appellant's further position that he interacted with Johnson three or four times between January 11, 2010 and April 21, 2010 and that Johnson made similar unwelcome sexual comments to him during each of those interactions.\n   <em>\n    Kuivila v.

It is appellant's position that even after April 2010, he experienced \"many incidents\" of similar comments made by Johnson which were based on his gender and were sexually suggestive, offensive,\n   and unwelcome.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. Appellant asserts here that Johnson's comments continued through at least the summer of 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   {\u00b6 109} Appellant indicates he complained to City officials about the sexual harassment by Johnson and made written complaints. Appellant states that some of his complaints were sent by email, including emails sent after April 2010. However, the record reveals, and the federal court also indicated, that those emails have not been provided and appellant speculates that they may have been deleted.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   {\u00b6 110} In May 2010, appellant filed an EEOC charge of discrimination based on sex. The EEOC issued appellant a right to sue letter in which it stated it had reached no conclusion on the merits. Appellant did not file suit on the 2010 EEOC charge. Appellant alleges that Johnson continued to sexually harass him after he filed the 2010 EEOC charge, citing a sexually explicit comment allegedly made by Johnson about him in the summer of 2012. Appellant did not hear the comment but claims his wife and minor daughters did. He said he complained to City Manager Haney. Johnson denied making any comment and Haney did not recall any complaint by appellant regarding this alleged incident. The only evidence of Johnson's alleged 2012 comment that is based on personal knowledge is an affidavit by appellant's wife.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kuivila v.

However, as found by the federal court, \"[t]he statements in [appellant's] affidavit regarding his later complaints are conclusory in nature and fail to provide any detail regarding the alleged sexual harassment of which he complained.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *12. Likewise, the trial court below found \"the general allegations of a continued pattern are not reliable statements without additional instances of specific conduct.\" (January 29, 2016 judgment entry, p. 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   {\u00b6 112} For sexual harassment to be actionable, it must be, inter alia, sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive working environment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hale v.

Thus, appellant has failed to present sufficient evidence of sexual harassment to survive a motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   {\u00b6 114} I agree with the majority that appellant's third assignment of error is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   {\u00b6 115} In his fourth assignment of error, appellant alleges the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of appellees on his R.C.

The Northern District of Ohio thoroughly analyzed appellant's retaliation claim under Title VII in its 26 page opinion. Appellant stresses that the retaliation claim in the trial court was brought under R.C. 4112.02 while the claims in federal court were based on retaliation in violation of the First Amendment and Title VII. However, retaliation claims brought under the Ohio statute, R.C. Chapter 4112, are subject to the same analysis as claims brought under federal Title VII.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ulmer v. Dana Driveshaft Mfg.\n   </em>\n   , N.D.
