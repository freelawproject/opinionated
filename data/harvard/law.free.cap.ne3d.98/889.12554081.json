On appeal, Appellant contends that 1) the trial court erred in denying her motion to suppress; and 2) the trial court's decision to admit the audio recording of the conversation between Sergeant Heddleston and herself that was recorded at a Rite Aid Store was an abuse of discretion. Having found no merit to either of the assignments of error raised by Appellant, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed, as is the trial court's decision denying Appellant's motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Appellant was indicted on one count of aggravated possession of drugs, a fifth degree felony in violation of R.C. 2925.11 on July 31, 2015. The indictment stemmed from an encounter between Appellant and law enforcement that occurred on May 3, 2015, in which two pills, later determined to be a controlled substance for which Appellant did not have a prescription, were found after a search of Appellant's purse. Appellant pleaded not guilty to the charge and then filed a motion to suppress \"all evidence obtained as a result of the stop of Defendant by Sargent [sic] Heddleston * * *.\" The motion further stated that \"[s]aid suppression is warranted by the fact that the Defendant was detained and interviewed without the benefit\n   of Miranda Warnings.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   No memorandum in support of the motion was attached. A suppression hearing was held as a result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Sergeant Heddleston testified on behalf of the State at the suppression hearing. He testified that on the date in question, as he was beginning his patrol, he noted a car parked oddly and partially blocking the entrance to a local Rite Aid store. He testified that the windows in the car were down and that there was a child seat and an axe in the back seat of the car. As he was inquiring with store employees regarding the car, he was dispatched a few streets over to a report of a woman with a child looking into car windows. Sergeant Heddleston testified that he found Appellant and a child walking along a sidewalk a few streets away from the store and stopped to speak with her. He testified that he got out of his car and approached her on a public sidewalk and initially asked her is she was okay, to which she responded yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} He testified that she denied looking in car windows, and then said she was looking but had not taken anything. When asked if the car at Rite Aid was hers she said no, however, the child that was with her said \"Quit lying Mommy.\" Sergeant Heddleston testified he asked again and advised Appellant she could be arrested for lying to a police officer. He then asked her to step down to his cruiser to speak with him. According to Sergeant Heddleston, Appellant said no and that she was fine to stay on the sidewalk, which she did initially. Appellant then advised the sergeant that the car was not hers, but that it belonged to her ex-boyfriend and that she could call him. As she tried to access her purse for her phone, Sergeant Heddleston asked her to put her purse on his cruiser and asked her if there was anything illegal in her purse. She responded no. He testified that he then asked permission to search her purse, to which she responded \"Go ahead.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Sergeant Heddleston testified that upon searching her purse he found several prescriptions and also found two pills which were ultimately determined to be a controlled substance for which Appellant did not have a prescription. When he asked Appellant about the pills she stated she did not know anything about them. Sergeant Heddleston testified that Appellant was never placed under arrest, was never advised she was under arrest, was never handcuffed, and that no other officers were present. In fact, Sergeant Heddleston testified that he advised Appellant she was welcome to walk back to the Rite Aid store, where her ex-boyfriend was coming to pick up the car, and he would meet her there. At that point, Appellant left with the child and walked back to the store. She was not at any point put into the cruiser or driven there. The sergeant testified that he met her back at the store and then took a recorded statement from her, in which he advised that she was not under arrest, that she was free to leave and reaffirmed that she had provided consent to search her purse. According to Heddleston's testimony, Appellant advised him at that time that although she did have prescriptions for \"ADH\" (ADHD) drugs, she did not have a prescription for the two pills found in her purse, which were ultimately determined to be Ritalyn. At that point, Appellant went on her way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} During the hearing, the State sought to admit the audio recording for the trial court's review. Although defense counsel stipulated that the recording was in fact a recording between the sergeant and Appellant, he objected based upon relevancy,\n   explaining that the statements made on the recording occurred after the initial encounter and were not the subject of the suppression motion. The trial court allowed the recording to be submitted over the objection of Appellant. After considering post-hearing briefs, the trial court denied Appellant's motion to suppress. Appellant thereafter entered a plea of no contest to the charge. Appellant has now filed a timely appeal from the trial court's judgment, setting forth two assignments of error for our review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"I. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING APPELLANT'S MOTION TO SUPPRESS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II. THE TRIAL COURT'S DECISION TO ADMIT THE AUDIO RECORDING OF THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN SERGEANT HEDDLESTON AND APPELLANT, AT THE RITE AID STORE, WAS AN ABUSE OF DISCRETION.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 7} In her first assignment of error, Appellant contends the trial court erred in denying her motion to suppress. \"Appellate review of a motion to suppress presents a mixed question of law and fact. When considering a motion to suppress, the trial court assumes the role of trier of fact and is therefore in the best position to resolve factual questions and evaluate the credibility of witnesses.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Appellant further contends that she\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   in custody for purposes of\n   <em>\n    Miranda,\n   </em>\n   and thus argues that all evidence from the police encounter should have been suppressed, including the search of her purse, which she argues was \"derived from police questioning.\" Appellant argues that her incriminatory statements should be suppressed because she was not\n   <em>\n    Mirandized\n   </em>\n   , and that she was \"in custody\" because she did not feel free to walk away from the police encounter. Finally, with regard to the search of her purse, she argues that her consent to search was involuntary, citing in support the fact that \"there is no indication that [she] was aware of her right to refuse to consent to Heddleston's questioning, or to his demand that he be allowed to search her purse.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The State contends that Appellant argues, for the first time on appeal, that her consent to search was involuntary. The State points out that Appellant \"never alleged that the physical evidence should be suppressed because her consent to search was coerced or involuntary.\" The State further argues that law enforcement officers\n   are not constitutionally required to issue\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings before asking for consent to search, and that because the issue of voluntariness of consent has been waived, Appellant's first assignment of error should be overruled. The State further posits that the evidence found in Appellant's purse was found after she consented to a search of her purse, that\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings are not required for an officer to request consent to search, and therefore, the questions of whether Appellant was in custody, and whether she should have received\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings, are irrelevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 10} With regard to the State's waiver argument, this Court recently noted in\n   <em>\n    State v.

Importantly, the motion did not seek suppression of the evidence seized during the search of Appellant's purse on the basis that her consent to search was involuntarily given. Based upon the foregoing, Appellant's argument that the physical evidence found during a search of her purse should be suppressed has been waived to the extent that it is premised upon a contention that her consent to search was involuntarily given. As such, we will not address this argument for the first time on appeal.\n   <em>\n    State v. Davis\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 53 (where this Court refused to consider the appellant's argument that the warrantless search of her passengers and her purse exceeded the scope of her consent, where the issue was not raised before the trial court and was not fully developed during the trial court proceedings).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Additionally, Appellant contends that the physical evidence recovered from her purse should be suppressed because she was not provided with\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings during the police encounter, during which time Appellant contends she was in custody. Thus, Appellant urges this Court to find that she was, in fact, in custody for purposes of triggering a\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warning, and that the failure to provide her with\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings mandates that the physical evidence recovered as a result of a consent search of her purse must be suppressed. As set forth above, the State does not concede that Appellant was in custody or that she should have been provided with\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings. The State further contends that\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings are not required to validate a\n   consent to search. Based on the following reasons, we agree with the State and therefore reject Appellant's argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that no person \"shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\" To safeguard a suspect's Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, law enforcement officers seeking to perform a custodial interrogation must warn the suspect \"that he has the right to remain silent, that anything he says can be used against him in a court of law, that he has the right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for him prior to any questioning if he so desires.\"\n   <em>\n    Miranda v.

And, Appellant was approached by law enforcement during daylight hours, while she was on foot in a public place. There is no evidence in the record that suggests Appellant's interaction with law enforcement was anything but consensual and importantly, when the officer requested Appellant step down to his cruiser to speak with him she refused and stated she was fine to stay on the sidewalk, which she did. In fact, she did not step down to his cruiser until afterwards, when the officer asked if he could search her purse as she was reaching into it to obtain her identification and later her cell phone. When the officer requested to search her purse, Appellant stated \"Go ahead.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Further, and notably, after thoroughly reviewing the record, including the motion to suppress, post-hearing briefs, transcript from the suppression hearing and appellate briefs, this Court has been unable to identify any allegedly incriminatory statement made by Appellant during the encounter. At the time when Appellant was being questioned on the sidewalk and beside the cruiser, she simply denied having anything illegal in her purse, provided consent to search, and then stated she did not know anything about the pills that were found. There were no incriminatory statements made by Appellant at the time that even related to the drugs found in her purse. The trial court noted as much in its decision denying Appellant's motion to suppress, stating as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \"Taking the evidence in its entirety, the Court finds that the Defendant was not in custody, was free to leave at any time\n   and ultimately walked away;\n   <em>\n    that there are not statements being used by the State\n   </em>\n   , and finally, that the discovery of the illegal drugs was the result of a consensual search.\" (Emphasis added).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Thus, the illegal drugs recovered from Appellant's purse were not linked with any statement made by Appellant and thus were not \"derived\" from the questioning of Appellant by law enforcement. Also, of importance and as referenced by the State in its brief, this Court has previously held that \" '[t]he weight of authority holds that prior\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings are not required to validate consent searches, even when the consent is obtained after the defendant is effectively in custody.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Oles\n   </em>\n   does not focus on that particular question, but instead focuses on whether the situation exerted upon Appellant pressure sufficient to impair her free exercise of her privilege against self-incrimination to require that she be warned of her constitutional rights. We cannot conclude, based upon these facts, that such a situation existed. Additionally, with respect to Appellant's argument that law enforcement had a duty to affirmatively inform her that she was not under arrest and was free to leave, the Supreme Court of Ohio has stated in\n   <em>\n    State v. Robinette\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1132514\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/80/234/#p245\">\n    80 Ohio St.3d 234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 245,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=685%20N.E.2d%20762\">\n    685 N.E.2d 762\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997) that the \"Ohio Constitution does not require a police officer to inform an individual stopped for a traffic violation, that he or she is free to go before the officer may attempt to engage in a consensual interrogation.\" Admittedly, Appellant was not stopped for a traffic violation but the reasoning is nevertheless applicable. Finally, as this Court noted in\n   <em>\n    State v. Davis, supra,\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 41, \" 'an individual's knowledge of the right to refuse consent 'is not a prerequisite of a voluntary consent.' \" Quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.

Appellant specifically argues that the recording was not relevant under Evid.R. 401 and 402, and that it was more prejudicial than probative and should have been excluded under Evid.R. 403. The State contends that the Rules of Evidence are not applicable in suppression hearings and that Appellant's assignment of error should be overruled on that basis. The\n   State further argues that the audio tape was relevant to the trial court's totality of the circumstances analysis in determining whether Appellant was in custody during the earlier portion of the police encounter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 23} The admission or exclusion of evidence generally rests within the trial court's sound discretion.\n   <em>\n    State v.

At the suppression hearing, defense counsel stipulated that the audio recording was a recording between the officer and his client, but objected on relevance grounds, explaining that the suppression motion related to statements obtained prior to the recording being made. The court allowed the recording to be submitted and stated it would review it to determine if it was relevant. In its decision denying the motion to suppress, the trial court simply stated \"[a] tape of at least portions of the stop was provided to the Court.\" The trial court did not cite or quote any portion of the recording in its entry. Further, there is no indication that the audio recording was transcribed, and it was not transmitted to this Court with the rest of the record. Thus, it is not part of the record on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 25} We conclude, albeit after a limited review based upon the fact that we are not able to actually review the audio recording, that even if the recording was made after the initial encounter with police in which Appellant is complaining, that the recording was relevant to the totality of the circumstances analysis undertaken by the trial court. Thus, we find no error or abuse of discretion in its admission. Further, because we find it was relevant to the trial court's determinations below, the trial court correctly accepted it into evidence for review as to whether it would ultimately be admissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Additionally and importantly, as argued by the State, \" 'the Rules of Evidence do not apply to suppression hearings.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.
