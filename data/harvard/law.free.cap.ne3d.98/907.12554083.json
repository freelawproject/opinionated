His vehicle travelled left of center and struck a motor vehicle driven by Helen Lucille Meek. Kevin Meek and Jeremy Belt were passengers in Ms. Meek's vehicle at the time of the collision. Ms. Meek sustained massive injuries and died from those injuries. Kevin Meek and Jeremy Belt suffered multiple injuries, but survived the collision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 3} A jury convicted Geneva of aggravated vehicular homicide and aggravated vehicular assault on February 1, 1995. The trial court sentenced Geneva to eight to thirteen years in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    The Civil Proceedings, Part One\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In September 1996, Kevin Meek and Jeremy Belt filed complaints in the Tuscarawas County Court of Common Pleas requesting an award of compensatory and punitive damages against Geneva. Appellee, attorney Paul Mancino, Jr. represented Geneva in the tort action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On September 17, 1997, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Meek and Belt, finding Geneva liable for negligently and recklessly causing physical harm to Meek and Belt. The amount of damages was left to be determined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On February 11, 1999, Meek and Belt filed a motion to enjoin Geneva, or anyone acting on his behalf, from removing funds during the pendency of the tort action. The trial court issued an ex parte restraining order on February 12, 1999. The matter came on for a full hearing on February 18, 1999. At the hearing, the following facts were adduced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Geneva was the owner of a checking account held at the First National Bank of Dennison, Ohio. Geneva had given a power of attorney to Appellant, James Weaver, who maintained the checking account. On January 20, 1999, Geneva directed Weaver by typewritten correspondence to withdraw the balance of the checking account and forward it to Geneva's attorney, Mancino. In the letter directing the withdrawal of the balance of the account,\n   there was a handwritten request to Weaver that he forward the amount of $37,500 to Mancino \"or you will be removed from my account as my Power of Attorney.\" Weaver received a handwritten letter from Geneva, which indicated it was the intention of Geneva to hide his assets during the tort litigation. Weaver followed Geneva's instructions, withdrew $37,500 from the checking account, and sent a cashier's check to Mancino, payable to Mancino.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The trial court issued a judgment entry on February 24, 1999 that found Geneva's request for transfer of funds was intended to hinder or defraud the creditors. The trial court restrained Geneva and Weaver from moving, removing, spending, or otherwise disposing of funds in his possession, held in Geneva's or otherwise held on Geneva's behalf until further order of the trial court. The trial court ordered:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   It is further ORDERED that the funds transferred to Attorney Paul Mancino, Jr. in the amount of $37,500.00 be\n   <strong>\n    attached\n   </strong>\n   and that the Defendant, Samuel Geneva,\n   <strong>\n    return said funds to be deposited in Account No. 144696 of The First National Bank of Dennison on or before the 12th day of March, 1999\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   It is further ORDERED that\n   <strong>\n    the Defendant, Samuel Geneva, his agents and The First National Bank of Dennison may not remove or permit the removal of funds from any account held in the name of or for the benefit of Samuel Geneva until further order of this Court\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (Emphasis sic.) (Judgment Entry, Feb. 24, 1999).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Mancino filed a notice of appeal of the February 24, 1999 judgment entry with this court. We dismissed the appeal on July 22, 1999 for lack of a final appealable order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On April 20, 1999, the trial court held a hearing on the issue of damages. Mancino represented Geneva at the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On May 5, 1999, Geneva granted Mancino a power of attorney, making Mancino his attorney-in-fact. Geneva removed Weaver as his power of attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The trial court issued its judgment entry on May 28, 1999 awarding damages in favor of Meek and Belt. The trial court awarded $362,500 in compensatory damages to Meek, $257,500 in compensatory damages to Belt, $100,000 in punitive damages to Meek, and $100,000 in punitive damages to Belt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 13} In the May 28, 1999 judgment entry, the trial court specifically incorporated the February 24, 1999 judgment entry, which included the provision ordering Geneva to return the $37,500 transferred to Mancino to the First National Bank of Dennison. The trial court stated that \"[u]pon information received at trial, this Court FINDS that the funds in the amount of Thirty-seven Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($37,500.00) have not been returned as ordered to The First National Bank of Dennison. Attorney Paul Mancino, Jr., represented to the Court that the funds remain in his trust account in Cleveland, Ohio.\" (Judgment Entry, May 28, 1999). The trial court ordered that the February 24, 1999 judgment entry be incorporated by reference and the orders on the restraint of funds remained in full force and effect until further order of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Geneva did not appeal the May 28, 1999 judgment entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    The Probate Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Geneva died on December 7, 2014. An estate was opened for Geneva on February 4, 2015 and Weaver was appointed Executor of his estate. On August 26, 2015, Belt and Meek as judgment creditors\n   of Geneva filed claims against the estate totaling over $820,000.\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Geneva\n   </em>\n   , 5th Dist.

Weaver issued a subpoena to Mancino to appear and testify at a hearing on January 14, 2016. The subpoena also ordered Mancino to bring: all records relating to the $37,500 paid to him by Geneva/Weaver in 1998/1999; proof that the finds were returned to Geneva or a cashier's check made payable to the Estate of Geneva in the amount of $37,500; and all trust records, law firm deposits, account statements, disbursement receipts, transfer records to Mancino or his law firm, or any other person relating to these funds.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Mancino filed a motion to quash subpoena, which the probate court overruled. Mancino filed a second motion to quash subpoena. Weaver filed a motion on January 13, 2016 indicating Mancino's office may have been receiving approximately $2,000 per month from the State Teacher's Retirement System (\"STRS\") for Geneva that was sent to a bank in Virginia.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7. The probate court overruled Mancino's second motion to quash and denied a motion to set aside a magistrate's order.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 18} The hearing was held before the probate court magistrate on January 22, 2016. Mancino testified the checks he received for Geneva from 1999-2006 were sent to Geneva. Mancino stated he cashed the checks and mailed the money to Geneva in prison. Mancino then testified Geneva authorized him to keep some of the funds for his ongoing attorney fee bill and Geneva wanted some of the money sent to other people, which Mancino stated he did. Mancino did not return the $37,500 because he deemed the order telling him to do so void. Mancino did not have records or invoices to show the amount of his attorney fees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 19} On January 26, 2016, the magistrate issued an order for Mancino to turn over relevant client escrow records pertaining to his transactions with and for Geneva. The trial court overruled Mancino's motion to set aside the magistrate's order and adopted the order.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Mancino appealed the trial court's order to this Court in\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Geneva\n   </em>\n   , 5th Dist.

On August 15, 2016, we overruled Mancino's arguments and affirmed the judgment of the probate court. Mancino first argued the trial court abused its discretion when it denied his motions to quash the subpoena because he was not a party to the case and no action was pending other than Geneva's estate case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16. We disagreed and found that Civ.R. 45 allowed subpoenas to be issued to nonparties.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   We next overruled Mancino's argument that the subpoena was unduly burdensome.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17. We found the Estate of Geneva showed a substantial need for the testimony and production of documents. The trial court ordered the funds be returned to the First National Bank of Dennison and Mancino did not return the funds.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Because the executor was charged with collecting and distributing the estate assets to Geneva's creditors, Mancino's testimony and records were necessary to determine whether the assets were property of Geneva's estate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    The Civil Proceedings, Part Two\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 21} On May 6, 2016, Weaver filed a Motion for Order to Show Cause against\n   Mancino in the original civil proceedings, Case Nos. 1996 CT 09 0390 and 1996 CT 09 0391. Mancino filed a Motion to Dismiss and Objection to Motion to Show Cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Mancino also filed Petition for Writ of Prohibition requesting this Court issue a writ prohibiting the Tuscarawas County Court of Common Pleas, General Division, from holding a hearing on the contempt motion. Mancino argued the trial court lacked jurisdiction over him because he was not a party to the case and was not subject the subject of the February 24, 1999 or May 28, 1999 trial court orders.

Weaver and Mancino appeared at the hearing, represented by counsel. Also at the hearing was the attorney representing Belt and Meek in the underlying tort action. At the hearing, Weaver argued Mancino should be held in contempt for his failure to comply with the February 24, 1999 and May 28, 1999 trial court orders for (1) his failure to return the $37,500 to the First National Bank of Dennison and (2) his receipt of STRS funds on behalf of Geneva from 1999 to 2006. Counsel for Weaver testified that he opened the estate and attempted to recover funds on behalf of the estate. (T. 13, 21). When he opened the estate, he contacted counsel for Belt and Meek, the\n   judgment creditors. Counsel indicated to him that he should determine whether the $37,500 was returned to the First National Bank of Dennison. (T. 13). When Weaver's counsel contacted the First National Bank of Dennison to examine its records, counsel discovered Geneva was receiving payments from STRS. An examination of the bank records showed the direct deposit of the STRS funds to the First National Bank of Dennison had been cancelled. STRS records showed Geneva directed the payments to Mancino. (T. 13, 14). During the probate court proceedings, Mancino admitted to receiving the STRS funds. (T. 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Counsel for Belt and Meek testified at the hearing. He stated the February 1999 and May 1999 trial court orders indicated that the only amount of monies that plaintiffs were able to attach was interest from the Geneva's bank account with the First National Bank of Dennison. (T. 29). Counsel did not learn Geneva was receiving STRS funds until the probate proceedings in 2016. (T. 31, 33). Counsel did not take a creditor's deposition of Geneva while he was in prison. (T. 34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Mancino challenged the standing of Weaver as executor to bring the motion to show cause. He renewed his argument that the February 24, 1999 and May 28, 1999 trial court orders were not directed at him and the trial court had no jurisdiction over him as a non-party. Finally, Mancino argued the motion was barred by the equitable doctrines of laches and unclean hands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 26} On December 9, 2016, the trial court issued its findings of fact and conclusions of law. The trial court determined as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Mancino was undisputedly the agent of Samuel Geneva at the time the orders were issued.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Mancino as the holder of Power of Attorney for Samuel Geneva in May 1999, was subject to the Court's order for the return of funds, and he failed to return the funds in the amount of $37,500.00 as ordered by the Court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   It is apparent that there has been wrongdoing on the part of Mancino. Upon review of the entire Court file, however, the Court concludes that a delay of almost 17 years before attempting to enforce the Court's order against Mancino was unreasonable. Weaver has offered no explanation or excuse for his delay or the delay of the other parties in pursuing these funds. All of the parties involved were put on actual notice of the whereabouts of these funds in 1999 and had the opportunity to pursue this matter at that time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   The Court concludes that Mancino has been prejudiced by the delay of all the parties involved. Most of the records indicating what happened with these funds no longer exist. Additionally, Mancino is further prejudiced since Samuel Geneva is now deceased and unable to testify regarding this matter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   (Judgment Entry, Dec. 9, 2016).

The trial court's December 9, 2016 judgment entry establishes Mancino's unclean hands in equity. Based on the show cause hearing, the trial court found Mancino failed to comply with the trial court orders and engaged in wrongdoing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   Mancino was undisputedly the agent of Samuel Geneva at the time the orders were issued.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   Mancino as the holder of Power of Attorney for Samuel Geneva in May 1999, was subject to the Court's order for the return of funds, and he failed to return the funds in the amount of $37,500.00 as ordered by the Court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   It is apparent that there has been wrongdoing on the part of Mancino.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   (Judgment Entry, Dec. 9, 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   {\u00b6 51} A delay in enforcement does not presume the application of laches. While there was a delay of 17 years in the enforcement of the trial court's orders, enforcement would have been unnecessary if Mancino and Geneva had obeyed the trial court's orders in 1999. The failure of Mancino and Geneva to obey the trial court's orders was not discovered until Weaver became the executor of Geneva's estate in 2015 and his counsel examined Geneva's financial records. It was then that Weaver\n   and counsel for Belt and Meek realized that Geneva moved his assets from the First National Bank of Dennison and never returned the $37,500. There is no dispute that as Geneva's counsel of record and attorney-in-fact, Mancino worked with Geneva to move his assets and did not obey the trial court's order to return the assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   {\u00b6 52} \"The power of a court to enforce its own proper orders is fundamental and inherent, as well as constitutional; necessarily so, to give it standing and afford respect and obedience to its judgment.

Upon the facts of this case, we must find the trial court's application of the doctrine of laches was unreasonable based on its own finding that Mancino engaged in wrongdoing.
