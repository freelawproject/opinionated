In each, the court found that the agency improperly denied a dangerous wild animal permit to the appellee, Kenneth Hetrick.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Hetrick applied for two distinct types of permits under Ohio's Dangerous Wild Animals and Restricted Snakes Act, R.C. 935.01 et seq. : a rescue facility permit (case No. WD-16-061) and a wildlife shelter permit (case No. WD-16-062). Following administrative hearings, the director of the ODA denied both applications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Pursuant to R.C. 119.12, Hetrick appealed the administrative orders to the Wood County Court of Common Pleas. The court found that the ODA had improperly denied the permits and discriminated against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On appeal, the ODA argues that its respective orders, denying the applications, were based on reliable, probative and substantial evidence and were in accordance with law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} We agree with the ODA, in part. As set forth below, we reinstate the decisions of the director to deny Hetrick both the rescue facility and the wildlife shelter permits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Overview of the Dangerous Wild Animals and Restricted Snakes Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In 2011, an Ohio man released dozens of wild animals from his private preserve, before taking his own life. As the animals freely roamed the preserve and neighboring properties, law enforcement authorities were forced to shoot them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} In response, the Ohio General Assembly passed the Dangerous Wild Animals and Restricted Snakes Act, R.C. Chapter 935, which went into effect on September 5, 2012. \"The act tasks the ODA with implementing and enforcing a comprehensive statutory scheme regarding the registration and control of dangerous wild animals.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Dir., Ohio Dept. of Agriculture v. Forchione\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280532\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/148/105/\">\n    148 Ohio St.3d 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280532\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/148/105/\">\n    2016-Ohio-3049\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=69%20N.E.3d%20636\">\n    69 N.E.3d 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 4. The act also applies to restricted snakes, but this case involves, and our discussion of the statute is limited to, dangerous wild animals only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Generally, the act prohibits the possession of non-permitted dangerous wild animals (\"DWA\") after January 1, 2014. The ODA implemented the act in two phases. First, any person who possessed a DWA on September 5, 2012, had to register that animal by November 5, 2012. R.C. 935.04(A). The registration of DWA provided the agency with information regarding the number and kind of DWA in the state, the identity of those who possessed DWA, and the locations where the animals were confined.\n   <em>\n    Hetrick v. Ohio Dept. of Agriculture\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist. Franklin No. 15AP-944,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017-Ohio-303\">\n    2017-Ohio-303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20N.E.3d%20980\">\n    81 N.E.3d 980\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 3. Registrants had to permanently implant each animal with a microchip that could identify the animal. R.C. 935.04(D). Additionally, registrants had to comply with certain requirements for the care and housing of the animals.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20N.E.3d%20980\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   R.C. 935.04(C) ; Ohio Adm.Code Chapter 901:1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Phase two of the act began on January 1, 2014. Starting on that date, it became illegal to possess a DWA in Ohio. R.C. 935.02(A). The prohibition against possession of DWA does not apply to certain people and organizations, however, including \"[a] person whose possession of a [DWA] is authorized by an unexpired permit issued under this chapter.\" R.C. 935.03(A)(3).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 10} A person who possessed a DWA prior to January 1, 2014, could apply for one of three types of permits: a wildlife shelter permit ( R.C. 935.05 ), a wildlife propagation permit ( R.C. 935.07 ), or a rescue facility permit ( R.C. 935.101(A)(1) ).\n   <em>\n    Hetrick\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4. As an alternative to the permitting process, an owner could seek an exemption.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 935.03(B)(1). None of the exemptions is applicable to this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 11} According to the ODA, following the January 1, 2014 deadline, the director had 90 days to approve or reject permit applications. R.C. 935.06(A). The ODA treated this statutory, 90-day period (i.e. between January 1 and March 31, 2014) as a type of grace period. During this time, the ODA continued to reach out to individuals who had registered DWA but had not yet applied for a permit. It also reached out to those who had submitted incomplete applications.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the ODA, all DWA owners were given the benefit of the additional 90 days to submit and complete their permit application paperwork. The ODA received 64 DWA permits within the first quarter of 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 12} An owner who was not able to obtain a permit or qualify for an exemption was obligated to transfer, within 30 days, all DWA that the person possessed to an approved organization, such as the humane society or wildlife sanctuary. R.C. 935.06(F).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The act requires the director of the ODA to open an investigation if there is \"reason to believe\" that a DWA is possessed by an unauthorized person or if the director believes that a DWA is being treated or kept in a manner that violates the law. R.C. 935.20(A). The director may order the DWA to be quarantined on site or transferred to an eligible facility. R.C. 935.20(A). The act calls for civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance. R.C. 935.24(B)(1) and 935.99.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Finally, the director of the ODA \"has exclusive authority to implement and enforce R.C. Chapter 935.\"\n   <em>\n    Forchione\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    Hetrick's Possession and Registration of DWA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Kenneth Hetrick is a resident of Perrysburg, Ohio, in Wood County. Hetrick has possessed exotic animals since 1977 and operates an animal sanctuary on his property called Tiger Ridge Exotics. In all his years of housing and caring for DWA, there has never been an incident involving an animal escaping or injuring someone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Hetrick has a \"Class C Exhibitor\" license for his facility from the United States Department of Agriculture. Throughout the time Hetrick has possessed DWA, he has invited the public to his property to observe them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 17} In October of 2012, following passage of Ohio's law, Hetrick submitted registration paperwork, identifying 15 DWA:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   seven tigers, three lions, one \"liger,\" two grizzly bears, one black leopard and a bobcat.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 18} In November of 2013, Hetrick received a \"compliance packet\" with instructions and materials that explicitly notified him that a \"valid permit is required to maintain ownership of any dangerous wild animal beyond January 1, 2014.\" Hetrick did not apply for a permit by that date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 19} The ODA sent Hetrick follow-up letters on February 10 and March 10, 2014, reminding him of his obligation to apply for a permit if he wished to continue to possess DWA. In its March 10, 2014 letter, the ODA stated, \"we wish to work with you to obtain your DWA permit. Contact us for any further assistance you need to comply with Ohio law no later than 10 business days.\" It is undisputed that Hetrick received those letters. Hetrick did not apply for a permit by March 31, 2014, the last day of the 90-day grace period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 20} The record indicates that Hetrick did not apply for a permit because (1) he knew his facility was not in compliance with the act; (2) he found the permit requirements confusing; and (3) he was waiting for a decision in a federal lawsuit that would decide if the act would be upheld.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilkins v. Daniels\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4119713\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/744/409/\">\n    744 F.3d 409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir.2014). In\n   <em>\n    Wilkins\n   </em>\n   , the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected two constitutional challenges. It found that the act did not compel DWA owners to associate with organizations, such as the Zoological Association of America, in violation of the owners' First Amendment rights. It also found that the microchip requirement did not amount to a \"taking\" in violation of the Fifth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    Hetrick's Application for a Rescue Facility Permit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 21} On October 17, 2014, Hetrick applied for a rescue facility permit. The ODA responded that it was untimely and incomplete. It requested that \"an on-site visit occur to verify that the facility meets the care and caging standards that were adopted in OAC 901:1-4.\" Hetrick consented to the visit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 22} The visit occurred on November 7, 2014, during which the ODA claimed it found a number of violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 23} On January 13, 2015, the ODA proposed to deny Hetrick's application for a rescue facility permit because: (1) it was untimely pursuant to R.C. 935.101, specifically, 289 days after the January 1, 2014 statutory deadline, and 200 days after the end of the 90-day grace period; and (2) Hetrick failed to comply with the caging and care requirements under R.C. 935.12 and Ohio Adm.Code 901:1-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Two weeks after proposing to deny the permit, on January 28, 2015, the ODA served upon Hetrick a search warrant and a \"transfer order.\" R.C. 935.20. Pursuant to that transfer order, the ODA removed 11 DWA from his property. Hetrick challenged the transfer of his animals in a separate administrative appeal. The transfer was upheld by the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas and affirmed by the Tenth District Court of Appeals.\n   <em>\n    Hetrick v. Ohio Dept. of Agriculture\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist. Franklin No. 15AP944,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017-Ohio-303\">\n    2017-Ohio-303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20N.E.3d%20980\">\n    81 N.E.3d 980\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At the conclusion of the agency's investigation and exhaustion of administrative remedies, the director\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   pursue the permanent seizure of Hetrick's DWA. R.C. 935.20(H). The record in the instant case contains repeated references\n   to evidence offered with regard to the transfer of Hetrick's DWA. As noted by the ODA, however, the issue before this court is limited to the issuance of permits, not the custody of Hetrick's animals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Hetrick requested an administrative hearing as to the proposed denial of the rescue facility permit, which occurred over the course of four days and concluded on May 11, 2015. The hearing examiner made the following findings of fact:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Hetrick submitted his application for a rescue permit on October 17, 2014.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   During the on-site visit, ODA officials observed many deficiencies under R.C. 935 and OAC Chapter 901:1-4. Most of the deficiencies involve inadequate caging, primary and secondary fencing, and inadequate dig barriers, all of which posed escape risks for the animals and/or unauthorized access to the animals by humans. Other deficiencies noted by the hearing examiner posed risks to the animals, such as exposed metal edges, choking and ingestion hazards, and a lack of fresh drinking water.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Between January 1 and March 31, 2014, the ODA accepted permit applications and reached out to other registered owners who had not yet submitted applications. The ODA accepted one application on April 3, 2014, i.e. after the first quarter, from one applicant who had \"worked diligently with the ODA to get her DWA permit application completed.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Hetrick spent between $35,000 and $40,000 to bring his property into compliance with the act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 26} The hearing officer recommended that Hetrick's permit be denied based upon his \"systemic lack of compliance with R.C. Chapter 935.\" The ODA director adopted the hearing officer's report and recommendation. Pursuant\n   to R.C. 119.12, Hetrick filed a notice of appeal with the Wood County Court of Common Pleas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    Hetrick's Application of a Wildlife Shelter Permit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 27} After the administrative denial of his rescue permit, Hetrick applied for a wildlife shelter permit. According to the ODA, this type of permit allows legal possession of DWA after January 1, 2014, but prohibits acquiring any additional DWA. R.C. 935.05.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 28} The ODA proposed to deny the application for two reasons: it was untimely and not all of the DWA identified in the application had been implanted with a microchip.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Hetrick requested a hearing, held on May 26, 2015, just two weeks after his rescue permit hearing. The same hearing officer heard both matters. Specific to the wildlife permit, the hearing officer made the following findings of fact:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Hetrick submitted the application on March 9, 2015. His application identified 11 DWA: six tigers, one lion, one liger, a grizzly bear, a leopard, and a cougar. Of them, six DWA had not been microchipped.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   A microchip is \"a device the size of a grain of rice that contains identification information and is implanted under the skin.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Hetrick provided a letter with the application from his veterinarian, identifying six DWA that were too old for anesthetic.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   \"Hetrick had not worked with the ODA to obtain a wildlife shelter permit.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   \"The ODA has not issued a wildlife shelter permit to anyone who waited until after the first quarter of 2014 to initiate the application process.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 30} The ODA director adopted the hearing officer's report and recommendation to deny Hetrick's application. Pursuant to R.C. 119.12, Hetrick filed a notice of appeal with the Wood County Court of Common Pleas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    Proceedings before the Wood County Court of Common Pleas\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 31} At Hetrick's request and over the ODA's objection, the trial court received additional evidence and heard two days of testimony before it issued simultaneous decisions, on November 21, 2016. In short, the court found that there was no statutory authority to deny either application and that the ODA had discriminated against Hetrick by treating other applicants more favorably than Hetrick. The court then ordered the ODA to issue both permits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 32} The judgments were stayed pending appeal, and, as stated, we consolidated the cases sua sponte.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 33} The ODA brings two assignments of error for our review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    The ODA's Assignments of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   1. In both appeals, the trial court failed to review the Director's Order in accordance with mandatory guidelines set forth in R.C. 119.12 and relied upon the incorrect legal standard.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   2.

As a matter of law, however, it concluded that \"there [was] no statutory authority\" to deny either permit. As discussed below, we disagree with the lower court's legal conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 41} Effective January 1, 2014, it became illegal to possess DWA in Ohio. R.C. 935.02(A) (\"No person shall possess a dangerous wild animal on or after January 1, 2014.\") R.C. 935.02(B) provides for exceptions to that rule, including the issuance of a wildlife shelter permit ( R.C. 935.06 ) and a rescue facility permit ( R.C. 935.101 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Hetrick's rescue facility application was untimely\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 42} The rescue facility statute, set forth in R.C. 935.101, provides, in part,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   (A)(1) In lieu of obtaining any other permit under this chapter, a person that operates a rescue facility in this state prior to January 1, 2014, and that wishes to continue to operate a rescue facility on and after that date shall obtain a rescue facility permit under this section not later than January 1, 2014.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   (A)(2) A person that wishes to begin operation of a rescue facility in this state on or after January 1, 2014, shall obtain a rescue facility permit under this section not later than sixty days prior to beginning operation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 43} Thus, existing rescue facilities were required to obtain a permit by January 1, 2014, while new rescue facilities must obtain a new permit no later than 60 days prior to beginning operation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 44} Hetrick, as a person who had registered DWA in 2012, was aware of the January 1, 2014 permit deadline and received two reminders after he failed to apply by that date. Again, however, the ODA considered applications that were submitted within 90 days of that deadline, by March 31, 2014, to be timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 45} The hearing officer found, and it is unchallenged, that Hetrick waited until October 17, 2014, to apply for a rescue facility permit. Under the explicit language of the statute, Hetrick's application was 289 days late. By the DOA's more lenient deadline, it was 200 days late. The hearing officer's finding, that Hetrick's rescue facility permit was untimely, was based upon reliable, probative and substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b6 46} The common pleas court concluded, however, that \"[t]here is no evidence in the record or otherwise that Mr. Hetrick operated a rescue facility as defined in R.C. 935.01(K) at any time prior to January 1, 2014.\" Instead, the court concluded that Hetrick's application for a rescue permit was not as an existing facility under R.C. 935.101(A)(1) but rather as a new\n   facility under section (A)(2). That section is applicable to applicants who wish to \"\n   <em>\n    begin\n   </em>\n   operation of a rescue facility in this state\n   <em>\n    on or after January 1, 2014\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) The court also determined that Hetrick's application was not untimely because \"there is absolutely no requirement that a person desiring to operate a rescue facility at any time after January 1, 2014, has to file that person's application prior to January 1, 2014.\" The court acknowledged that even under section (A)(2), however, Hetrick would have been in violation of the deadline set forth therein. That is, as a person who possessed DWA for years, Hetrick failed to pursue a permit within 60 days of beginning operation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b6 47} Also, the court did not explain how Hetrick's operation failed to meet the definition of \"rescue facility.\" R.C. 935.01(K) defines a \"Rescue facility\" as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   a nonprofit organization as described in section 170 of the \"Internal Revenue Code of 1986,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20Stat.%202085\">\n    100 Stat. 2085\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 26 U.S.C. 170, as amended, that operates a place of refuge where abused, neglected, unwanted, impounded, abandoned, orphaned, or displaced dangerous wild animals are provided care for their lifetime or released back to their natural habitat, and, with respect to an animal possessed by the organization, that does not do any of the following: (1) Sell, trade, or barter the animal or the animal's body parts; (2) Use the animal in any manner for profit; (3) Breed the animal; (4) Allow the public the opportunity to come into contact with the animal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   {\u00b6 48} Both types of permits under R.C. 935.101 pertain to a \"rescue facility,\" as defined above. The lower court did not address how Hetrick's application would qualify for a permit under section (A)(2) if it did not qualify for one under section (A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   {\u00b6 49} For his part, Hetrick argues that he was \"unequivocally\" not operating a rescue facility prior to January 1, 2014, because he was not operating as a non-profit organization. We rejects Hetrick's argument that his failure to seek non-profit status acts as a shield from the January 1, 2014 deadline. While the ODA did not cite Hetrick's omission as a basis to deny the rescue facility permit, it could have. Either way, it is not determinative of whether section (A)(1) or (A)(2) applies in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   {\u00b6 50} We also reject Hetrick's argument that he did not \"[hold] himself out as a rescue facility\" prior to January 1, 2014. First, to state the obvious, Hetrick has possessed DWA for 40 years, and he concedes that he \"accepted animals from others.\" Also, the \"Application for Rescue Facility Permit\" submitted by Hetrick contains a box marked \"New Applicant.\" Hetrick did not mark that box; instead, he left it blank. If Hetrick intended to apply as someone who \"wish[ed] to begin operation of a rescue facility,\" under section (A)(2) of the statute, it stands to reason that he would have checked the \"New Applicant\" box. Third, despite his argument to the contrary, Hetrick did hold himself out as a rescue facility. Metal signage at Tiger Ridge reads \"animal sanctuary.\" Likewise, at least two of the animals identified in the application, \"Bobby,\" the bobcat and \"Cyndi,\" a cougar, were identified as having been rescued from previous owners who could no longer care for them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   {\u00b6 51} In sum, Hetrick engaged in activity that qualified his property as a rescue facility. That is, he operated a place of refuge for unwanted DWA, and he did so prior to January 1, 2014. We find, as a matter of law, that the trial court erred when it found that section (A)(1), and its corresponding deadline, did not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   {\u00b6 52} Moreover, it bears repeating that under either option, Hetrick's application for a rescue facility permit was months late. As an existing rescue facility, Hetrick's application was untimely because R.C. 935.101(A)(1) required that the permit be obtained prior to January 1, 2014. Alternatively, under section (A)(2), Hetrick failed to file an application for a new rescue facility permit \"at least sixty days prior to beginning operation\" since he was in possession of 11 dangerous wild animals well over 60 days prior to submitting any application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   {\u00b6 53} The rescue facility permit was denied for a second reason, namely Hetrick's failure to comply with the caging and care requirements under R.C. 935.12 and the accompanying regulations set forth under Ohio Adm.Code 901:1-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   {\u00b6 54} R.C. 935.12, entitled \"Care and housing of dangerous wild animals-requirements,\" provides, in part,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   (A) Except as provided in division (B) of this section,\n   <em>\n    a person that has been issued a permit under this chapter\n   </em>\n   for a dangerous wild animal or animals\n   <em>\n    shall comply\n   </em>\n   with the requirements regarding the care and housing of dangerous wild animals established in rules.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   (B)\n   <em>\n    A person that has been issued a\n   </em>\n   * * *\n   <em>\n    rescue facility permit\n   </em>\n   under this chapter for a dangerous wild animal or animals specified in division (C)(20) of section 935.01 of the Revised Code\n   <em>\n    shall comply\n   </em>\n   with both of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   (1) The requirements regarding the care of those animals established in regulations adopted under the federal animal welfare act;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   (2) The requirements regarding the housing of those animals established in rules. (Emphasis added.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   {\u00b6 55} Likewise, Chapter 901:1-4 of the Ohio Administrative Code governing DWA sets forth a series of rules governing, for example, enclosures of DWA (Rule 901:1-4-01.1); food and water for DWA (Rule 901:1-4-01.2) and health of DWA (Rule 901:1-4-01.3). These rules apply to DWA that are \"possessed by the holder of a * * * rescue facility permit issued under Chapter 935 of the Revised Code.\" Ohio Adm.Code 901:1-4-01(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   {\u00b6 56} In finding that Hetrick's alleged caging and care violations could\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   create a basis to deny the permit, the lower court cited R.C. 935.101(D). It, too, provides that \"[a] person that\n   <em>\n    has been issued\n   </em>\n   a rescue facility permit under this section\n   <em>\n    shall comply\n   </em>\n   with the requirements regarding the care and housing of [DWA] established in rules adopted under division (G) of section 935.17 of the Revised Code.\" (Emphasis added.) The common pleas court concluded that the \"statute clearly contemplates the issuance of a rescue facility permit followed by inspections * * *.\" In other words, the court determined that because Hetrick had not been issued a permit, the regulations did not apply to him and could not support the denial of the permit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   {\u00b6 57} The ODA counters that the regulations did apply to Hetrick by virtue of an affidavit he signed that was part of the application. Hetrick certified \"that the facility [is] in compliance with standards of Ohio Revised Code Section 935.01, et seq., and the Ohio Administrative Code Section 901:1-4-01 et seq.\" The ODA asserts that, after submitting an application and attesting that an applicant is in compliance, \"successful applicants are then subjected to a post-permitting inspection to confirm compliance, and they are given time to address any deficiencies.\" The ODA argues that this process is a \"reasonable and efficient way to administer the legal requirements without delaying every application until a formal inspection takes place.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   {\u00b6 58} The parties argue over whether the ODA's \"on-site visit\" in November of 2014 constituted a formal inspection or not. Hetrick claims that the ODA essentially inspected the facility out-of-order. That is, it inspected the facility as a means of gathering information that it then used to deny the permit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   {\u00b6 59} The issue before us is not whether the ODA has the authority to conduct a post-permitting inspection; clearly, it does. On the other hand, Hetrick's situation was different, in that he was not a \"successful applicant\" who was subject to a \"post-permitting inspection.\" Irrespective of the on-site visit, the issue is whether the ODA had the statutory authority to deny Hetrick's rescue facility permit for failing to comply with the caging and care regulations set forth in Ohio Adm.Code 901:1-4:01 et seq.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   {\u00b6 60} We find that it did not. Based upon the explicit language of the statutes cited above, we agree with the lower court that \"there is nothing in R.C. Chapter 935 permitting the ODA to deny a rescue facility permit for failing, initially, to meet proper caging and care requirements.\"\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hetrick v.

(Emphasis added). We conclude that the lower court did not err, as a matter of law, in finding that the ODA could not deny Hetrick's permit based upon his alleged failure to comply with those regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   {\u00b6 61} In conclusion, the trial court abused its discretion in finding that the ODA lacked a statutory basis to deny the application on timeliness grounds but did not err in so finding on caging and care grounds. We reverse the judgment of the lower court on the former basis alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Hetrick's wildlife shelter application was untimely and legally deficient on its face\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   {\u00b6 62} R.C. 935.05(A) provides that a \"person that possesses a registered dangerous wild animal in this state on October 1, 2013, that wishes to continue to possess the dangerous wild animal on and after January 1, 2014 * * * shall apply for a wildlife shelter permit under this section.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   {\u00b6 63} Hetrick's wildlife application was subject to the same deadline as was his rescue facility application, i.e. January 1, 2014. After that date, Hetrick was in violation of the act by possessing DWA without a permit. Notwithstanding that deadline, the ODA contacted Hetrick and other registered DWA owners to encourage them to apply for a permit, and it accepted applications through March 31, 2014. According to the hearing officer, however, Hetrick did not work with the ODA to obtain a wildlife shelter permit. When he did finally apply, on March 9, 2015, he was 15 months late, or 434 days after the January 1, 2014 deadline. The hearing officer's finding, that Hetrick's rescue facility permit was untimely, was based upon reliable, probative and substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   {\u00b6 64} Nonetheless, the trial court analyzed the wildlife shelter permit issue as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   Yes, Mr. Hetrick possessed registered DWA in Ohio on October 1, 2013. Yes, Mr. Hetrick wishes to continue to possess the DWA on and after January 1, 2014. And yes, Mr. Hetrick applied for a wildlife shelter permit. * * * At any time from January 1, 2014 to March 23, 2015, Director Daniels could have sought to enjoin Mr. Hetrick from possessing\n   his DWA without a permit [pursuant to R.C. 935.24(A).] This section also provides for the assessment of civil penalties against the violator. Director Daniels did not opt for this course of action. * * *\n   <em>\n    The court finds there is no statutory authority for the proposition that a person who possessed registered DWA in Ohio on October 13, 2013, and who failed to apply for a wildlife shelter permit before January 1, 2014, is barred from applying for and receiving a wildlife shelter permit\n   </em>\n   . (Emphasis added.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   {\u00b6 65} As a matter of fact, the court's statement is inaccurate because, as repeatedly discussed, the DOA permitted applications through March 31, 2014. More importantly, the lower court did not address the untimeliness of Hetrick's application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   {\u00b6 66} The lower court may not ignore the statutory deadline, simply because it finds that the ODA's motives were \"disingenuous.\" By all accounts, Hetrick's application was late, by over a year. It was error to ignore the plain and unambiguous language of the statute under the guise of statutory interpretation.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Nonetheless, the court found the ODA's denial of the permit on this basis was \"unlawful.\" Notwithstanding the statutory directive, the court opined that the ODA should have consulted with Hetrick's veterinarian and/or investigated the medical hazards of microchipping. The lower court found that the ODA violated its commitment of \"working with Ohio's dangerous wild animal owners.\" This language comes from a letter the ODA sent to Hetrick on October 17, 2014, five months before he applied for a wildlife shelter permit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   {\u00b6 70} First, the lower court credited Hetrick's veterinarian as having opined that \"the process of microchipping several of Mr. Hetrick's animals could be dangerous to their health.\" The record lacks any such opinion by Hetrick's veterinarian.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   {\u00b6 71} We similarly reject the lower court's legal conclusion that there is no statutory authority to deny the permits based upon Hetrick's failure to microchip. In fact, the opposite is true. The statute explicitly compels microchipping as a precondition to obtaining a permit. The lower court's imposition of a duty upon the ODA, to \"work with\" DWA owners, cannot supplant the clear directive from the legislature on this point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   {\u00b6 72} A reviewing court must give deference to an administrative agency's interpretation of its own rules and regulations where such interpretation is consistent with the statutory law and the plain language of the rules.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Thus, even if P.W. were considered to be similarly situated as Hetrick, \"the conscious exercise of some selectivity in enforcing a statute fair on its face does not in and of itself amount to a constitutional violation.\" (Citations omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Whitehall v.

We find\n   no evidence of purposeful and intentional discrimination in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   {\u00b6 86} For example, the lower court cited \"material misrepresentations\" by the ODA as evidence of discriminatory animus. According to the court, the misrepresentations were made during a hearing to decide the ODA's request for a search warrant. That hearing occurred on January 28, 2015, before the Wood County Court of Common Pleas, albeit before a different judge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   {\u00b6 87} In the instant matter, the court, acting sua sponte, filed the transcript from the warrant hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   We have reviewed the transcript from the search warrant hearing. We find that it is not evidence of discrimination by the agency toward Hetrick.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   {\u00b6 88} The transcript is 18 pages in length. Two witnesses spoke in favor of the search warrant: the lawyer representing the ODA and the ODA enforcement agent. The lawyer repeated throughout the hearing that the statutory basis for the warrant was Hetrick's \"non-permitted possession of [DWA].\" More than once, the lawyer told the court that it was Hetrick's failure to obtain a permit that was the basis for the search warrant and not any regulatory violations regarding caging and care of the DWA. The court responded that it was \"ignoring the caging and animal care concerns then.\" As to the lower court's concern that the enforcement officer described Hetrick as \"uncooperative\" and that his facility lacked adequate fencing, we find that those off-hand comments, in a hearing on a different matter, before a different judge, and said by a person who had no authority to decide the permit issue, are not evidence of invidious motives or bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   {\u00b6 89} Similarly, we reject the lower court's characterization of the ODA's November 2014 on-site visit as a \"scouting expedition\" to justify \"confiscating\" Hetrick's DWA and/or that the ODA \"materially distorted\" its findings from that inspection. We reiterate our decision that the alleged caging and care violations may not serve as a basis to deny Hetrick's rescue facility permit. More importantly, however, the ODA did not need to gain entry to Hetrick's facility to justify the denial of the application or the transfer of his DWA. It had cause to do so, based upon Hetrick's illegal possession of non-permitted DWA, months after the deadline. We reject points three and four by the lower court as evidence of discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   {\u00b6 90} \" '[A] defendant must demonstrate actual discrimination due to invidious motives or bad faith.' \"\n   <em>\n    Cleveland v.
