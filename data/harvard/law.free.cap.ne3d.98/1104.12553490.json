TO THE EXTENT THE TRIAL COURT'S DECISION APPROVED MR.

Appellee was \"sentenced to a fine of $200.00, restitution of $90.00, and court costs of $55.00.\" The judgment entry also notified appellee that his hunting license would be \"suspended from February 23, 2011, to February 23, 2012[,]\" and that he \"shall pay fine and costs within 60 days.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On April 7, 2011, appellant (or \"ODNR\") through acting chief, Vicki Mountz, sent a letter informing appellee that because he pled guilty to violating R.C. 1533.17, and because the deer taken had a \"gross antler score of 228 6/8 inches[,]\" \"[t]he Revised Code and Administrative Code place[d] a restitution value on the [deer] at $27,851.33.\" The letter also informed appellee that pursuant to R.C. 1531.201(D), he would not be afforded an administrative hearing under R.C. 119.06.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Until appellee paid the $27,851.33 restitution value, his hunting license was to stay suspended, even beyond February 23, 2012. After this date, appellee sought to\n   reinstate his license to no avail. The record reveals appellant stated appellee must pay the restitution first.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Appellee filed a complaint for declaratory judgment in the Huron County Court of Common Pleas (\"trial court\"), in which he attacked the additional restitution imposed in an effort to regain his hunting license. He argued that R.C. 1531.201 was unconstitutional on its face and as applied because \"it denies Plaintiffs their particular rights secured by the United States and Ohio Constitutions including but not limited to Plaintiffs' right to * * * due process of law[.]\" Appellee also asserted that the deer and antlers were repossessed by appellant and, therefore, any further attempts to seek additional restitution for the deer should have been precluded under the plain language of R.C. 1531.201.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Based on this restitution preclusion argument, the trial court granted appellee summary judgment on April 9, 2013. The trial court found it unnecessary to consider the constitutional arguments asserted by appellee because the matter was decided on statutory interpretation grounds. Appellee's license was ordered to be reinstated, and appellant subsequently appealed the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 8} We reversed the judgment on appeal, holding that the plain language of R.C. 1531.201 allowed repossession of the deer and antlers in addition to the restitution value.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Risner v.

Chapter 1531 or 1533 or division rule. We further hold that R.C. 1531.201(B) permits ODNR to file a civil action to recover the civil restitution value even though it had seized the deer meat and antlers as evidence in the criminal investigation and was awarded possession of those items as a result of a conviction for a violation of R.C.

Violations of wildlife laws in the past could frequently be attributed to attempts to put food on the table, but today's violations are often the result of a very different motivation. Today we routinely see cases of commercialization of the state's wildlife. The end result of this theft of Ohio's wildlife robs the state's law-abiding sportsmen and women of opportunity and robs the state's economy of valuable resources. An example of the type of poaching we see today is the criminal who targets a particular trophy white tailed deer. One ring of poachers in central Ohio made a habit of driving around until they located a true trophy deer, then worked together to sneak on to land where they had no permission to be, kill the buck and stealthily get the animal, or just its head, off the property. Sometimes poachers shoot the animal and take the antlers, leaving the meat to rot. Sale of really big antlers on the black market can easily net up to twenty-plus thousand dollars. Legal hunters can go a lifetime hoping for the opportunity to take the trophy buck.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   Wildlife restitution values have not been updated in about 20 years. House Bill 238 paves the way for total reform which would allow restitution values to become equitable with current conditions. The Division of Wildlife's current authority is in ORC 1531.201 where restitution value for a whitetail deer is $400. Having researched common prices for taking a trophy buck in a hunting preserve we found that a 190-class buck costs about $15,000. If a poacher takes an animal in this class currently it is a-third degree misdemeanor on the first offense, advancing to a first degree misdemeanor on a second offense. Depending on the degree of misdemeanor, fines between $0 and $1000 and up to 6 months jail could be imposed, along with $400 restitution for the deer, all at the judge's discretion. It is not uncommon in some jurisdictions for fines to be $100 or less, jail time nonexistent restitution negligible. The bottom line is that current\n   penalties and restitution values are not a deterrent to poaching.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wild Animals-Restitution Value: Hearing on 2007 Am.H.B.

Accordingly, we find this sixth factor weighs against double jeopardy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   {\u00b6 52} The seventh and final factor is \"whether [the sanction] appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned.\" Here, we find the restitution value imposed under R.C.1531.201(C) is justifiable by ODNR, although we do note that the amount imposed on appellee is extraordinarily high.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   {\u00b6 53} R.C. 1531.201(C)(1) states that the additional restitution \"is calculated using the following formula: Additional restitution value = ((gross score-100) 2 x $1.65).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   {\u00b6 54} R.C. 1531.201(C)(2) also provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   The gross score of an antlered white-tailed deer shall be determined by taking and adding together all of the following measurements, which shall be made to the nearest one-eighth of an inch using a one-quarter-inch wide flexible steel tape:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   (a) Inside spread of the main antler beams, not to exceed the length of the longest main antler beam;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   (b) Length of the right main antler beam;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   (c) Length of the left main antler beam;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   (d) Total length of all abnormal points;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   (e) Total length of all normal points as measured from the nearest edge of the main antler beam over the outer curve to the tip.

This totaled in a \"final score\" of 228.75 inches and, based on that final score and a minimum restitution value of $500, the final restitution value imposed was $27,851.33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   {\u00b6 56} Hence based on the calculation process of R.C. 1531.201(C)(2)(a)-(m), the restitution amount imposed on appellee is reasonable, because it was solely due to appellee killing a white-tail deer with a final antler measurement score of 228.75 inches. Accordingly, this factor weighs against double jeopardy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   {\u00b6 57} After considering the\n   <em>\n    Kennedy\n   </em>\n   factors listed above, we find the record does not provide the clearest proof that the civil remedy under R.C. 1531.201 has transformed into a criminal punishment.\n   <em>\n    Martello\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Hudson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .

Specifically, the record reveals appellee was neither informed of the $27,851.33 restitution value prior to entering his plea, nor granted a hearing subsequent to being informed of the antler measurement score and sought value. The imposed sentence was a year license suspension, a $200 fine, $90 in restitution, and court costs of $55. There is no evidence in the record appellee had any notice of the $27,851.33 value during sentencing and ODNR concedes such notice was not provided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   {\u00b6 64} In addressing the issue, the Huron County Court of Common Pleas stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   Thus, both facially and as applied in this matter, Mr. Risner was not provided meaningful notice of the penalties he faced at the time of his plea, nor was he provided access to a hearing to challenge the findings of ODNR prior to the imposition of the indefinite license suspension and the requirement to pay the $27,851.33 civil restitution value. Mr. Risner's argument that the unilateral determination of the amount of restitution also violates his right to a jury trial dovetails with this Court's finding that at minimum he has a right to notice and an opportunity for a hearing, whether before a jury or not, before these penalties can be imposed. It is important to note that the Municipal Court did not make any findings with regard to the size or score of the deer and the statute provides no mechanism for Mr. Risner\n   to challenge the ODNR finding at any hearing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   * * * There seems to be no just reason why Mr. Risner would not be entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard in this matter. Perhaps, if the Municipal Court had made findings regarding the score of the deer and had informed Mr. Risner of the $27,851.33 of civil restitution to be automatically imposed based on that finding and further, if Mr. Risner then entered a plea recognizing those consequences and either admitted guilt or plead no contest to facts set forth to justify those penalties, then he could be seen to have had adequate notice and opportunity to be heard. However, there is nothing in the Court record to suggest that was the case and the records of the Municipal Court clearly indicate otherwise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Risner v. Ohio Dept. of Natural Resources\n   </em>\n   , Huron C.P. No. CVH-2012-0385, *5-6 (Oct. 20, 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   {\u00b6 65} Appellant asserts that, because R.C. 1531.201(D) states that an administrative hearing would not be afforded, appellee was not to be given proper notice or an opportunity to be heard on the matter of the final restitution value. We disagree. First, ODNR could have raised the issue in, and called for a subsequent restitution hearing by, the municipal court. Further, ODNR could have initiated a civil action after appellee's prosecution to address the restitution issue rather than sending appellee a letter requesting the $27,851.33 without due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   {\u00b6 66} As an example we point to\n   <em>\n    State v. Eller\n   </em>\n   , where the Twelfth District Court of Appeals held the issue was properly addressed at a subsequent restitution hearing because ODNR proved the antler measurement score and process in deriving the restitution value were accurate.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The\n   <em>\n    Eller\n   </em>\n   court referred to the \"minimum\" and \"additional restitution\" imposed under R.C. 1531.201 as \"financial sanctions for a misdemeanor,\" which were stated to be governed pursuant to R.C. 2929.28(A)(1).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   {\u00b6 67} In that regard, the\n   <em>\n    Eller\n   </em>\n   court stated, \"[i]f the court decides to impose restitution, the court\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim, or survivor disputes the amount of restitution.\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14. The court then stated, \"[i]f the court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of restitution sought from the offender.\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   , citing R.C. 2929.28 and 1531.02.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   {\u00b6 68} Consistent with the procedural process and underlying rationale offered in\n   <em>\n    Eller\n   </em>\n   , we find that due process principles require that appellee and similarly situated offenders be afforded notice and an opportunity to be heard to protect rights and present objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   {\u00b6 69} Furthermore, we note that R.C. 1531.201(B) provides that ODNR may initiate a \"civil action to recover * * * the restitution value[.]\" Such civil \"action\" would involve \"process, pleadings, and en[d] in a judgment or decree [.]\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2307.01 (defining \"action\"); Civ.R. 3 (stating that a \"civil action is commenced by filing a complaint\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   {\u00b6 70} Based on review of the April 7, 2011 letter sent by ODNR, and the record beyond the date of the letter, there was no complaint, process, pleading, judgment or decree regarding the final restitution value.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2307.01,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . Particularly, ODNR never initiated a civil action prior to or after sending its letter and, as noted, ODNR failed to notify appellee of the restitution\n   value while prosecuting him in municipal court. We find sending the letter was not akin to initiating a civil action in accordance with R.C. 1531.201(B) and, thus, appellee should have been afforded proper procedural process to challenge findings and be heard on the final restitution matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   {\u00b6 71} Accordingly, the third assignment of error is not well-taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <strong>\n    Assignment of Error No. 4\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   {\u00b6 72} Appellant lastly challenges appellee's equal protection of law argument that R.C. 1531.201 violates a right to a jury trial. Appellant contends \"there is no class distinction in R.C. 1531.20 that provides some individuals with the right to a jury trial and denying others the same right.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   {\u00b6 73} Based on our review, neither the trial court judgment nor any citation to the record in appellant's brief reveals that the issue of a right to jury trial was dispositive or ever at issue in the case. Essentially, appellant has not identified in the record where the issue was addressed in error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tretola v. Tretola\n   </em>\n   , 3d Dist. Logan No. 8-14-12,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014-Ohio-5484\">\n    2014-Ohio-5484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%207014740\">\n    2014 WL 7014740\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 37 (\"An appellate court is not a performing bear, required to dance to each and every tune played on an appeal.\"). Thus, because appellant has failed to \"identify in the record the error on which the assignment of error is based[,]\" we decline to address ODNR's fourth assignment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   App.R. 12(A)(2). Further, we note there is a sufficient ground to dispose of the fourth assigned error because finding merit to support the grant of summary judgment in the third assigned error renders the fourth moot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   App.R. 12(A)(1)(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   {\u00b6 74} Accordingly, we decline to address the fourth assigned error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   {\u00b6 75} The judgment of the Huron County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed, in part, and reversed, in part. Appellant is to vacate appellee's license suspension, remove from its record any reference to the suspension based on unpaid restitution and, if otherwise valid and necessary, return to appellee a right to receive and maintain his hunting license in accordance with applicable law. Appellant is ordered to pay costs of this appeal pursuant to App.R. 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Judgment affirmed, in part, and reversed, in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   James D.
