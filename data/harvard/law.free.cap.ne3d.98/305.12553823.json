For the following reasons, we affirm in part and reverse in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} This matter arises out of an incident that occurred on July 12, 2011. Prior to 2011, Cameron was recruited and offered a full athletic scholarship in his sophomore year of high school to play football for the University. After he was recruited, Cameron began weight training at the University under the direction of Rudy Wade, head strength and conditioning coach for the University's football team. In summer 2011, Cameron, as an incoming freshman, began training with the University's football team and took summer courses offered by the University.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Beginning in June 2011, prior to the start of the academic year, all the University's football players, including incoming freshmen and upperclassmen, began a conditioning and training program at the University's football stadium and athletic facilities. The training program included weight training in the morning that was supervised by Wade, followed in the afternoon by a conditioning program referred to as \"metabolics,\" which was supervised by upperclassmen. (Nov. 1, 2016 Decision at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} After the metabolics, all players departed for the day except for the offensive line players, who remained for what was referred to as \"freshman Olympics\" or the \"O-line challenges.\" (Nov. 1, 2016 Decision at 2.) During the freshman Olympics, the freshman offensive line players would have to complete a series of activities as directed by the upperclassmen, who did not participate in the activities in anything other than a supervisory role. Some of the activities included a wheelbarrow race, dance contests, bear crawl, worm crawl, kicking or tackling a bag, and dunking a football above the crossbar of the goalposts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On July 12, 2011, following metabolics, the upperclassmen directed the freshman offensive line players to participate in the freshman Olympics. Cameron, who was a freshman offensive lineman but did not have an assigned spot on the team, participated. On that date, the upperclassmen instructed the freshmen to dunk a football above the crossbar of the goalposts. Following other players' attempts to dunk the football, Cameron jumped off a teammate's back, dunked the football, and then fell backward, landing on his head or neck. Cameron immediately began convulsing or seizing. Wade, who was present at the time of the incident, sent for John Walters, the football team's head athletic trainer. Walters found Cameron unconscious on the football field and instructed\n   Billy Saul, a graduate assistant athletic trainer, to call 911. Cameron was taken by ambulance to the hospital. Allegedly, Cameron later learned he suffered brain damage, was no longer able to play football, and ultimately lost his scholarship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In 2013, Cameron filed a complaint in the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas alleging hazing, in violation of R.C. 2307.44, and negligence. That court dismissed the complaint, finding it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction. The judgment was affirmed on appeal by the Sixth District Court of Appeals.\n   <em>\n    Cameron v. Univ. of Toledo\n   </em>\n   , 6th Dist. No. L-13-1284,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014-Ohio-5587\">\n    2014-Ohio-5587\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%207225544\">\n    2014 WL 7225544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In 2013, Cameron filed a complaint against the University only in the Court of Claims, which he voluntarily dismissed in 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On June 16, 2015, Cameron refiled a complaint against the University only in the Court of Claims alleging hazing, in violation of R.C. 2307.44, and negligence. On July 15, 2015, the University filed an answer. On December 14, 2015, the University filed a motion for leave to file amended answer. In its amended answer filed on the same date, the University asserted a statutory affirmative defense to Cameron's claim for hazing under R.C. 2307.44. The University asserted assumption of a known risk as an affirmative defense to Cameron's claim for negligence. On December 24, 2015, Cameron filed a memorandum in opposition to the University's motion for leave to file an amended answer. On February 4, 2016, the Court of Claims granted the University's motion for leave to file an amended answer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On March 21, 2016, the University filed a motion for partial summary judgment on the second cause of action. On March 25, 2016, Cameron filed a motion for summary judgment. On March 28, 2016, the University filed a motion for partial summary judgment on the first cause of action. Memoranda in opposition were filed as well as responses to the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On June 7, 2016, the Court of Claims filed a decision finding that genuine issues of material fact remained on both of Cameron's claims and, therefore, denied Cameron's motion for summary judgment and the University's motions for partial summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Trial commenced on June 27, and ended June 29, 2016. On July 27, 2016, both Cameron and the University filed post-trial briefs. On November 1, 2016, the Court of Claims filed a decision rendering judgment in favor of the University.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Assignments of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Cameron appeals and assigns the following four assignments of error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [I.] The trial court erred in holding that the affirmative defense of \"actively enforcing a policy against hazing at the time the cause of action arose\" applied in the instant case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [II.] The trial court erred in holding that Cameron had failed to establish the required elements of hazing as set forth in the anti-hazing statute.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [III.] The trial court erred in holding that Cameron had failed to establish the required elements of his claim for negligence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [IV.] The trial court erred in holding that Cameron's action was barred by the doctrine of primary assumption of the risk.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   For ease of discussion, we consider Cameron's first and second assignments of error together and his third and fourth assignments of error together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Cameron's assignments of error involve both issues of law and fact.

Applicable Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 16} R.C. 2307.44 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Any person who is subjected to hazing, as defined in division (A) of section 2903.31 of the Revised Code, may commence a civil action for injury or damages, including mental and physical pain and suffering, that result from the hazing. The action may be brought against any participants in the hazing, any organization whose local or national directors, trustees, or officers authorized, requested, commanded, or tolerated the hazing, and any local or national director, trustee, or officer of the organization who authorized, requested, commanded, or tolerated the hazing. If the hazing involves students in a primary, secondary, or post-secondary school, university, college, or any other educational institution, an action may also be brought against any administrator, employee, or faculty member of the school, university, college, or other educational institution who knew or reasonably should have known of the hazing and who did not make reasonable attempts to prevent it and against the school, university, college, or other educational institution. If an administrator, employee, or faculty member is found liable in a civil action for hazing, then notwithstanding Chapter 2743. of the Revised Code, the school, university, college, or other educational institution that employed the administrator, employee, or faculty member may also be held liable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   The negligence or consent of the plaintiff or any assumption of the risk by the plaintiff is not a defense to an action brought pursuant to this section.

However, the court also found that \"[n]one of the freshman participants were aware of the school's anti-hazing policy at the time of [Cameron's] injury\" and that \"[t]his testimony is consistent with the fact that they did not receive the student handbook until after the injury.\" (Nov. 1, 2016 Decision at 4.) Furthermore, the court found that based on the testimony of Brian Lutz, the associate athletic director for compliance, \"the specific anti-hazing policy with an effective date of February 2011 was not communicated to students until the beginning of the school year in August 2011, after [Cameron's] injury.\" (Nov. 1, 2016 Decision at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Nevertheless, the Court of Claims found \"the upperclassmen involved in the 'Olympics,' * * * should have been aware of the existence of the school's hazing policy * * * as evidenced by their signatures\" acknowledging receipt of the 2009-2010 Student-Athlete Handbook, which \"contained the same anti-hazing policy as the 2010-2011 edition.\" (Nov. 1, 2016 Decision at 4-5.) Finally, the court based its ultimate finding that the anti-hazing policy was actually being enforced on the testimony of Michelle Martinez-Solis, the dean of students at the time of the incident, regarding the measures taken by the University to enforce its policy against hazing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 21} These findings are supported by competent, credible evidence as the record reflects that at the time of the incident, the University had a \"Policy on hazing,\" which had an effective date of February 11, 2011. (Deft.'s Ex. I.) The policy provided in pertinent part as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   The University of Toledo supports the autonomy of its student organizations within the established rules and regulations as outlined in the student handbook and other official University publications. Initiation into University organizations is permissible excluding any activities that may be construed as hazing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   When a student organization is found to be involved in hazing activity, the University shall have the authority to initiate disciplinary action regardless of the location of the activity. Such action shall be conducted in compliance with normal student organization conduct proceedings. Student organizations found in violation of the University hazing policy shall be subject to the range of sanctions available to the University as outlined in the student handbook.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In addition to the University's policy on hazing, the Student Code of Conduct in effect at the time of the incident prohibited \"[h]azing or the commission of any act that causes or creates a substantial risk of causing physical or mental harm to another.\" (Deft.'s Ex. H.) Similarly, the Student Athlete handbook contained a statement in its \"Code of Ethics\" that \"HAZING will not be tolerated,\" along with a definition of hazing. (Emphasis sic.) (Deft.'s Ex. F, Art. IV(B)(14).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Martinez-Solis testified she had indirect responsibility regarding enforcement of the policy on hazing as the office of student conduct was responsible for enforcing the policy, and the office of student conduct reported to her. Martinez-Solis testified that the University took steps to enforce the policy including sending an e-mail to every student at the beginning of the school year explaining hazing and holding an anti-hazing week with education for all students. Martinez-Solis addressed the students on the football team during the academic year, although she did not speak specifically about hazing. Martinez-Solis also testified regarding investigations of hazing undertaken during her time at the University.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 23} However, Martinez-Solis stated the athletic department did not report to her. Specifically, with regard to the policy on hazing, Martinez-Solis testified that \"[t]he student football team is not [a] student organization.\" (Tr. Vol. III at 672.) This is notable given that the University's policy on hazing described disciplinary action only in the context of \"a student organization * * * found to be involved in hazing activity.\" (Deft.'s Ex. I.) Thus, although the University had a policy against hazing at the time of the incident, such policy could be construed as only applicable to student organizations. Additionally, even if such policy did apply to the football team, according to Lutz, such policy was not communicated to the students until August 2011, after the incident in question occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Furthermore, although the University had an anti-hazing compliance form that was distributed to student organizations, the athletic teams were again not considered student organizations. Martinez-Solis was unaware as to whether the football team had a hazing compliance form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Importantly, the record reflects that none of the freshmen who performed in the freshmen Olympics were aware of the policy on hazing or the statements prohibiting hazing in the Student Code of Conduct and Student Athlete Handbook, as such materials were not distributed until August 2011. Wade, a university agent who was present at the incident in question, testified he was not familiar with the University's policy on hazing. Furthermore, A.J. Lindeman, one of the upperclassmen on the football team at the time of the incident, stated he was unaware of the University's policy on hazing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nevertheless, although evidence was presented which could support a finding that the University's anti-hazing policy was not actively enforced against the football team, the evidence discussed below supports the Court of Claims' finding that the anti-hazing policy was actively enforced, even with the football team.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Lutz testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Q. Do you recognize what's at tab B?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   Q. What's that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   A. That's a copy of our Student Athlete Handbook.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   Q. Who prepares the Student Athlete Handbook?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   A. I do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Q. Can you tell me about that? Is that an annual process?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   Q. Can you tell us about that process, please?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   A. The process typically involves other members of our athletics department staff, depending upon their area of expertise, where we subsection the handbook and ask for those offices to edit the handbook. And then once those edits are turned back into me, then I submit that to the publisher who then publishes the handbook. Ordinarily we ask for a deadline of August 1st to sort of align itself with report date for football and some of our other sports in the summer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   Q. Okay. And on the stand, under the T-shirt in front of you, you've seen that before, right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   A.

That appears to be Exhibit 9.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Q. And what is that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   A. This is the Rocket handbook.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   Q. What is the difference between the Rocket book and the Student Athlete Handbook that you've identified at tab B?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   A. The Rocket Manual, that's a document that's created by the football staff and issued to football student athletes specifically.

The general process for distribution?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   Q. Yes, please.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   A. For most of our sports, we distribute the Student Athlete Handbook when we meet with them to start the academic year. And in that case, along with all the other documents that our student athletes are signing and submitting to us, we provide the handbook to them at that point and ask that they sign a document indicating that they received the handbook and that they understand the contents of the handbook, that they've listened to our rules education program. And if they've had the opportunity to ask questions, they've done so at that point.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   Q. And who handles that distribution in getting the signatures?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   A. I do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   Q. And who maintains those records once you have a signature on a record?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   A. I do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   Q. Okay. If you would, please, turn to-one moment, please-in that same Student Athlete Handbook, Defendant's Exhibit B, if you'd turn to the page stamped 94, please, a few pages in.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   Q. Can you identify whether there's anything on that page addressing hazing?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   A. Yes. Under the Code of Ethics, point 5.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   Q. What is the title under that section?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   A.

And what year does it list for the handbook version?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   A. This document says 2009-10.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   Q. And approximately when would you have had the students sign for that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   A. For this particular document, that would have been does after we had provided the handbooks to the football staff. And again, that would be when we meet with the team. It would have been early August. We normally meet with football the day or the night before they begin practice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   Q. Well, this-if you're looking at the page marked 133, that doesn't have a date on it, does it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   A. It does not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   Q. Then how would you know that these guys got this handbook in August?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   A.

The version that we've just identified at tab B?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   A.

That's the 2007-08 handbook.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   Q.

Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   Q. Turning to the next tab, E, it seems we've gotten two documents here, my apologies because we were only trying to get the second one. And it starts at what's marked page 209, and that should be Exhibit E. My apologies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   Starting with what's marked page 209, could you identify those pages, please?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   A. Yes. Those are the student athlete signature pages for the Student Athlete Handbook in 2010-11 for the football program.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   Q. Okay. And was that through the-were those signatures on that document gained through the same process you've described?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   Q. And the next tab, please, would you identify what is at tab F for us?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   A. Yes. This is the 2011-12 Student Athlete Handbook.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   MR. BARONE: I'm sorry, which tab is that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   MR.

Turning to the page stamped 218 in Exhibit F, can you identify what that has to say about hazing, if anything?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   A. Yes. Again, under the Code of Ethics, item 5, hazing will not be tolerated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   Q. And then turning to tab G, if you would identify for us, please, those pages there.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   A.

Were those through the same mechanism we've described?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   Q. So around when would those students have signed for that version of the Student Athlete Handbook at the university?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   A. That would have occurred in August.

No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   Q. They were still subject to that code?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   A.

As noted above, however, actively enforcing a University policy against hazing is an affirmative defense against a civil hazing claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   {\u00b6 32} The affirmative defense having been established in this case, we find it is not necessary for us to review the Court of Claims' finding that the elements of a civil hazing claim had not been met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Cameron filed the complaint against the University only. Although he named individuals in the complaint filed in the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas, he did not name individuals as defendants in the complaint before us.

Furthermore, the court found that \"[e]ven if [Cameron] had established that he had enforceable rights in the contracts, a breach of those contract[s] does not inherently give rise to a negligence claim.\" (Nov. 1, 2016 Decision at 17.) The Court of Claims also concluded that the bylaws of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (\"NCAA\") did not establish a duty of care, and that \"[e]ven if NCAA bylaws did create a legal duty, such duty would only exist during the official, scheduled portions of the training, i.e. the weight training/conditioning and 'metabolics.' \" (Nov. 1, 2016 Decision at 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   {\u00b6 54} On appeal, Cameron argues that the very terms of the employment contracts between the University, Wade, and Walter \"were entered into with the protection of student athletes explicitly\n   in mind.\" (Cameron's Reply Brief at 17.) Cameron urges the court to find that the employment contracts \"explicitly place upon Wade and Walters, the duty of ensuring the safety of student athletes.\" (Cameron's Reply Brief at 17-18.) We agree with Cameron that the student athletes were the intended beneficiaries of Walter's and Wade's contractual duties to ensure the safety of student athletes and protect them from injury and illness. We also agree, however, as Cameron acknowledges, that the employment contracts, standing alone, do not give rise to a duty for purposes of a negligence claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   {\u00b6 55} With this in mind, Cameron urges the court to consider that a duty of care arises from the particular circumstances of this case. He urges us to consider not only Walter's and Wade's contractual duties, but also the relationship between the University and Cameron, its scholarship athlete, and/or between the University's agents as coaches and Cameron as athlete, as well as the foreseeability of harm resulting from the goal post dunk and from failing to stop such activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   {\u00b6 56} The Court of Claims observed that \"there is very little case law establishing a common law duty of care for coaches to their respective players.\" (Nov. 1, 2016 Decision at 18.)

In considering whether a common-law duty of care exists, we are mindful that \"[t]he common-law duty of due care is that degree of care which an ordinarily reasonable and prudent person exercises, or is accustomed to exercising, under the same or similar circumstances.

Given the circumstances here, as outlined in this discussion of duty, this court finds that Walters and Wade had a common-law duty of care to Cameron consistent with due care a coach under same or similar circumstances would have.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   {\u00b6 57} More significant in this case than any common-law duty is the presence of foreseeability. The Court of Claims acknowledges that \"the specific facts of the case may give rise to a duty of care.\" (Nov. 1, 2016 Decision at 18.) This court further observes that Wade, Walters, and Lutz testified the goal post dunk was a dangerous activity. (Nov. 1, 2016 Decision at 14-15, 18.) Such testimony supports a finding of foreseeability of harm for purposes of the existence of a duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-257\">\n   {\u00b6 58} Under the particular circumstances of this case, on this question of law, we find that Walters and Wade owed Cameron a duty of care. We make this determination based on: (1) Walters' and Wade's contractual duties to protect and keep safe student athletes, (2) a common-law\n   duty between a coach and student athletes under same or similar circumstances, and (3) the foreseeability of the harm suffered by Cameron.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   {\u00b6 59} Accordingly, we conclude the Court of Claims erred in finding a duty did not exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-259\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2.

The court concluded that \"the goal post dunk was only dangerous in the manner performed by [Cameron]\" and, therefore, \"even if a duty arose momentarily\" between the time that \"the dangerous condition arose and the injury occurred,\" it was \"not unreasonable\" for Wade to have failed to stop the activity and prevent the injury. (Nov. 1, 2016 Decision at 18-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   {\u00b6 61} The University argues this conclusion was supported by the record and in so doing states \"[Cite to Trans [sic] ],\" but does not refer this court to any specific transcript pages or places in the record to support this argument.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (University's Brief at 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-262\">\n   {\u00b6 62} As this court has now determined that a duty of care existed, beyond \"momentarily,\" we remand to the Court of Claims to consider and determine the scope of the duty and whether a breach of the same occurred based on the facts of the case. \"Whether the defendant breached a duty is normally a question of fact for the trier of fact to decide.\"\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

The court found that \"even if [Cameron] were wearing a helmet, it would not have prevented his injuries.\" (Nov. 1, 2016 Decision at 19-20.) Additionally, the court concluded \"[Cameron] has failed to establish that the lack of a trainer on the field at the time of the injury was a proximate cause of said injury or that his injuries would have been mitigated had an athletic trainer been present.\" (Nov. 1, 2016 Decision at 20.) Instead, the court found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-267\">\n   [T]he proximate cause of [Cameron's] injuries was his decision to jump off of the back of another player, something which according to [the University's] expert substantially increased the forces acting on his body when he fell and struck the playing surface. It was ultimately the height [Cameron] achieved by using another player's back as a springboard, coupled with the angle at which he grasped the goal post crossbar, that caused his injuries.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   (Nov. 1, 2016 Decision at 20.) Finally, the court found that \"no player or coach told Mr. Cameron that he needed to jump off of another player's back to perform the goal post dunk, nor did any agent of the university tell him he had to participate in the 'Olympics.' \" (Nov. 1, 2016 Decision at 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-269\">\n   {\u00b6 65} Here, the Court of Claims limited its discussion of whether proximate cause was established based on whether the University was required to provide helmets or have a trainer present on the field.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   On remand, however, the issue for the court to consider is whether Cameron's injury is the natural and probable consequence of the negligence alleged, namely the failure of the University to stop the activity in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-270\">\n   {\u00b6 66} Cameron, in his post-trial brief, argued that \"[a]s Rudy Wade's deposition demonstrates, he was present during the 'Olympics,' the dunk contest of July 12, 2011 and did nothing to stop it. * * * Rudy Wade failed to adequately supervise the conduct of the players as he was required.\" (Cameron's Post-Trial Brief at 25-26.) Cameron also argued that Walters and the head football coach knew or should have been aware of the freshman Olympics and were under an obligation to stop them. Thus, the issue of whether the University's failure to stop the activity was the proximate cause of Cameron's injury was properly before the Court of Claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-271\">\n   {\u00b6 67} Therefore, we conclude the Court of Claims fell short in its analysis of proximate cause. Accordingly, on remand, the court must determine whether the evidence in this case establishes that Cameron's injuries were the natural and probable consequence of the University's failure to stop the activity in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-272\">\n   {\u00b6 68} Accordingly, we sustain Cameron's fourth assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-273\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.

However, the affirmative defense under R.C. 2307.44 does not require the University to demonstrate that students should have been aware of the policy on hazing. Rather, the University must carry the burden of demonstrating that it was actively enforcing the policy at the time of the incident. A student or university agent's lack of knowledge of the policy, while not determinative, is evidence tending to demonstrate that the policy was not being actively enforced.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-288\">\n    We note that Cameron also alleged that the coaches and staff were \"willful, wanton and reckless.\" (Comp. at \u00b6 15, 27.)
