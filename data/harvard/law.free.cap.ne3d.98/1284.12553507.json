We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On July 12, 2012, Leon was involved in a motorcycle accident where he claimed that an unidentified driver swerved in his lane, causing him to collide with a guardrail and sustain bodily injuries. The motorcycle was owned and insured by May under a State Farm policy. Leon was not a named insured on May's policy. In late 2012, Leon asserted a claim for uninsured motorist coverage under May's policy. The policy contains a three-year contractual limitations clause that states that legal action cannot be brought against State Farm after three years of the date of the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Through his attorney, Leon filed a claim in late 2012. On December 21, 2012, State Farm drafted a letter to Leon's attorney stating that State Farm may not have a duty to pay out Leon's claims because Leon may not have had a state-mandated motorcycle endorsement on his Ohio driver's license. In April 2013, Leon's attorney wrote to State Farm that he was gathering bills and medical records to forward to State Farm in order to discuss a settlement. On June 4, 2014, almost two years after the motorcycle accident, Leon's attorney corresponded with State Farm, seeking direction, and asked if there was anything they could do to protect the statute of limitations given that the unidentified driver was unknown. Leon's attorney also stated that he and Leon were in the process of gathering Leon's medical bills and records, and would submit them to\n   State Farm shortly. State Farm responded on June 6, 2014, stating that since the driver was unknown, Leon had three years to file a claim against State Farm directly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} A little more than a year later, and more than three years after the accident, Leon's attorney contacted State Farm on August 3, 2015, and enclosed itemized billing, the traffic crash report, medical records, and photographs. State Farm responded on August 14, 2015, explained that the statute of limitations for uninsured bodily injury claims is three years, and after July 12, 2015, Leon could not file a claim against State Farm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On August 1, 2016, Leon filed a motion for summary judgment seeking a declaratory judgment on the bases that the provisions of the May's car policy 983B were ambiguous and susceptible to more than one interpretation; that it was impossible to comply with the provisions of the policy; that the enforcement of the three-year limitations provision of the policy was unlawful and unconstitutional under Ohio law; and the statute of limitations for Leon to file an action against State Farm regarding uninsured motor vehicle coverage is 15 years under Ohio law. State Farm also filed a motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On November 30, 2016, the trial court denied Leon's motion for summary judgment and granted State Farm's motion for summary judgment. Leon filed this appeal assigning three errors for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   I. The trial court erred in overruling the impossibility argument that was raised by appellants in their motion for summary judgment and in granting summary judgment in favor of State Farm, because the trial court failed to analyze the policy language and instead relied upon State Farm's interpretation of the policy;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   II. The trial court erred in overruling the ambiguity argument that was raised by appellants in their motion for summary judgment and in granting summary judgment in favor of State Farm; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   III. The trial court erred in failing to find ambiguity in the policy language that contemplates an agreement between State Farm and the insured concerning the amount of compensatory damages that the insured is legally entitled to recover from the uninsured motorist.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Leon contends that the language in paragraph 1 of the General Terms, entitled Deciding Fault and Amount, is ambiguous because it is unclear on how State Farm and the parties will reach an agreement concerning the amount of compensatory damages that the insured is legally entitled to recover from the uninsured motorist. Here, Leon is attempting to create ambiguity where there is none. \"[I]t is clear that where common words appear in a written instrument, they will be given their ordinary meaning unless manifest absurdity results or unless some other meaning is clearly evidenced from the face or overall contents of the instrument.\" (Citation Omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Felton\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 20} The language from the policy is clear that if the insured and State Farm do not come to an agreement about compensatory damages, then the insured can file a lawsuit against State Farm and the uninsured motorist.
