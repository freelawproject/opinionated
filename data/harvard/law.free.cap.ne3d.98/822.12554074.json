Brink appeals from the grant of summary judgment to Giant Eagle by the Trumbull County Court of Common Pleas in her tort action against the store. Ms. Brink passed a bad check at the store, which she ultimately paid off. She asserts that Giant Eagle voluntarily undertook a duty to her to inform the Girard Municipal Court she had paid her debt, after a criminal complaint issued against her from that court, and breached that duty, resulting in her arrest. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 2} March 21, 2015, Ms. Brink purchased $211.88 of groceries at the Giant Eagle in Liberty Township, Trumbull County, Ohio. She paid by check, getting $30 \"cash back,\" as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The check bounced. Giant Eagle telephoned Ms. Brink March 26, 2015 to tell her this: she promised to come in and pay the amount owed, along with a $6 fee, but failed to do so. Scott Renzenbrink, the co-manager of the Giant Eagle, who is in charge of loss prevention, testified at deposition he sent Ms. Brink a letter requesting payment April 8, 2015. In her deposition, Ms. Brink denied receiving the letter. When Ms. Brink did not come to the store to pay, Mr. Renzenbrink went to the Girard Municipal Court, and filed an affidavit accusing her of passing a bad check. A criminal complaint issued against Ms. Brink, which she received May 15, 2015. The complaint informed her she had to appear in court June 2, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 4} At her deposition, Ms. Brink testified she called the Girard Municipal Clerk of Courts, and spoke with a clerk to find out how to proceed. The following testimony from her deposition is relevant:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Counsel for Giant Eagle: \"What did they tell you?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Ms. Brink: \"That I needed to pay that fine within seven to ten days to Giant Eagle-seven to ten days prior to me having to appear in court, and that Scott Renzenbrink would then notify them of my payment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 7} \"* * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Counsel for Giant Eagle: \"The clerk told you that if you made payment in seven to ten days * * *\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Ms. Brink: \"Prior to the court date.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Counsel for Giant Eagle: \"Prior to the court date, that Scott would then let them know?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Ms. Brink: \"Yes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Counsel for Giant Eagle: \"Then what? I'm sorry.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Ms. Brink: \"That I would not have to appear on the 2nd of June.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Ms. Brink further testified she went to Giant Eagle May 22, 2015, and paid a young man in customer service the money owed. At her deposition, she testified:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Ms. Brink: \"They had my check. I just informed the person working behind the counter, which is this young man's signature there, that I was there to pay on a returned check. He said, 'What's your name?' I gave him my name as Rebecca Brink. He came back out with my check. He requested that I give him $247.88. That is what I paid him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 16} \"I asked for the receipt, and then he said, 'Yeah, let me handwrite that.' He gave me this receipt and my check back.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 17} \"* * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Counsel for Giant Eagle: \"When he gave you the receipt, what specifically did the gentleman tell you?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Ms. Brink: \"I specifically asked the gentleman if this matter would be notified to the Girard Court, if it would be taken care of with the Girard Court. And he informed me that Mr. Renzenbrink will handle Girard Court as he always does. He actually called him Scott.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Counsel for Giant Eagle: \"The man said that Scott would handle it?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Ms. Brink: \"Scott will handle it; he will do what he does with them all the time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 22} \"* * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Counsel for Giant Eagle: \"You asked * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Ms. Brink: \"* * * would the matter be taken care of with Girard Court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Counsel for Giant Eagle: \"I'd like you to be verbatim as you can. If you can give me word for word what you said and what he said.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Ms. Brink: \"Will this matter be given to Mr. Renzenbrink to handle with Girard Court?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Counsel for Giant Eagle: \"Okay. That's what you said.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Ms. Brink: \"The gentleman said, 'He will be notified in the morning that this matter has been made, and he will handle it however he handles this matter.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 29} In her affidavit in opposition to Giant Eagle's motion for summary judgment, Ms Brink testified as follows regarding her payment of the money owed on the bad check:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 30} \"Then and there, she further inquired into whether Scott would then 'take care of it' with the Court before her scheduled court date, to which the young man replied, 'Yes, Scott will take care of it like he always does,' or words of similar import.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Mr. Renzenbrink was also deposed. He testified that the procedure when someone comes into pay off a bad check is to give the person a receipt, and tell them to take it to the municipal court's clerk. Mr. Renzenbrink goes to the Girard Municipal Court Clerk's office every Wednesday. If a person who passed a bad\n   check has been in to give the clerk a receipt showing payment to Giant Eagle, the clerk gives him a form to sign. The criminal complaint is then dismissed by the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 32} In this case, Ms. Brink never took the receipt to the clerk's office. She did not attend her hearing date June 2, 2015, and was thereafter arrested and briefly detained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Ms. Brink filed this action July 31, 2015. Giant Eagle answered August 28, 2015, and filed for summary judgment October 11, 2016. Ms. Brink opposed the motion October 21, 2016. The trial court granted summary judgment November 3, 2016. Ms. Brink timely noticed appeal, assigning a single error: \"The trial court erred in entering summary judgment in Defendant's favor below.\" She presents the following issue for review: \"Whether one has a tort duty to perform a gratuitous undertaking with ordinary care where another reasonably relies on that undertaking and is injured as a proximate result of its breach.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 34} \"Summary judgment is a procedural tool that terminates litigation and thus should be entered with circumspection.\n   <em>\n    Davis v.
