Smith, died June 27th 1862, twenty-six years of age, intestate, leaving a husband James M. Smith, but no children. Mary Pyle, the widow, died November 3rd 1872. In 1873, by the advice of counsel, the estate, both real and personal, was divided as follows : The real estate was appraised according to the terms of tbe will, and taken by the two sons, one parcel by Friend at $5,000; the other by Atwood at $5,300. These amounts, together with the value of the personalty, were divided into four equal shares, and distributed among the four children then living. James M. Smith was not notified of this settlement, and made no claim for any part of the estate at this time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-8\">Six years afterwards, Smith took out letters of administration on his wife\u2019s estate, and presented a petition to the Orphans\u2019 Court, setting out the foregoing facts, and averring that he was entitled, in right of his wife, to one-fifth of testator\u2019s estate. The Auditor to whom this claim was referred reported in favor of the petitioner, and awarded him one-fifth of the personal property, on the ground that, under the will, his wife\u2019s interest in her father\u2019s estate, vested in her absolutely upon her arriving at the,age of twenty-one years,\u2019 and was not contingent on her surviving her mother ; and also one fifth of the proceeds of the real estate, holding that the will worked an equitable conversion thereof into personalty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-9\">Exceptions filed to this report were dismissed by the corn t; Clayton, P. J., delivering the opinion, and a decree was entered accordingly, whereupon Friend Pyle as executor took this appeal assigning for error the decree of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b337-10\">H. <em>C. Howard </em>and <em>J. M. </em>Broomall, for appellant</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A71\">\u2014 The court below, by its construction, in effect makes a new will. The testator used the word <em>\u201c </em>payable,\u201d not \u201c vested and he indicated the time when the shares should be paid by directing them to be raised after the widow\u2019s death or marriage. The will contemplated the vesting of the shares at the widow\u2019s death subject to the further contingency of being defeated by the child dying under age without issue, or perhaps they were absolutely vested at the widow\u2019s death : Williams <em>v. </em>Tartt, 33 E. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>C.

He directs that after the death, or marriage, of his \u25a0 wife, Mary, his executors shall sell and dispose of all liis real and personal estate, giving to his sons, Friend Pyle and Atwood Pyle, or either of them, the Option of taking the realty at the appraisement, for which he particularly provides; in other words, they are to be preferred as purchasers. That this provision worked a conversion of the real estate into personalty, is, as we have above .shown, decided, hence, we need pursue this branch of . the case no further.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Were it not for the devise over, in ease any of the devisees died before reaching the age of twenty-one years and without lawful issue, the legacies must be taken as vested, and that payment of them was deferred to the time mentioned, and until the marriage, or death, of the widow, would make no difference: McClure\u2019s Appeal, 22 P. F. S. 414. These legacies, therefore, depended solely upon the contingencies mentioned and none other, that is, the dying of the donee or donees, befor\u00e9 twenty-one and without issue. As, however, Mrs. Anna M. Smith lived beyond the period indicated, the bequest to her, at the time of her death, had become absolute, and so was properly awarded to her administrator, James M. Smith: Scott <em>v. </em>Price, 2 S. &amp; R. 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">The appeal is dismissed at the costs of the appellant, and the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
