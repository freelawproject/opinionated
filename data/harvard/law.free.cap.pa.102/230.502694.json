Parke, to whom said Pollock was in the habit of selling brushes. That the said Parke, who keeps a general country store, also buys from the small distillers in the neighborhood the essential oils of birch and wintergreen. That while the said Pollock was in the store and engaged in showing his samples to the proprietor, a distiller by the name of John' S. Keiper came in with a can of \u00a3 birch oil \u2019 to sell to Parke. Parke left Pollock, and taking the can ef oil from Keiper to examine the same, poured a tumbler about two-thirds full, held it up to the light and then set it down upon the counter.

Then Keiper said,\u00a3 Young man, you have killed yourself!\u2019 Pollock laughed and said that \u2018 he had often drank it on the Pocono Mountain, where they made it,\u2019 and with this remark drank the balance of the oil.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-6\">\u201cThat during the previous summer, to wit, the summer of 1881, the said Henry Pollock, together with one Robert Martin, a brush manufactui\u2019er of New York city, and Allen Carpenter, a dry goods merchant of Easton, Pa., and the families of the three named, had boarded on the Pocono Mountains in Monroe county, at a public house kept by a man named Peter Mervine ; that in close proximity to the hotel where the party was staying there was a distillery, operated by a son of the proprietor named above, where the essential oil of birch was manufactured; that the said Pollock and the other members of the party, including ladies and children, frequently drank at this distillery \u00a3 the milk of birch,\u2019 or \u2018lighten,\u2019 which is the water through which the oil passes in the process of distilling, and which in' color, smell and general appearance can hardly be distinguished from the genuine \u00a3 oil of birch.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-7\">\u201c That after the said Pollock had drank the <em>\u2018 </em>birch oil,\u2019 as hereinbefore described, he remained in the store of the said Parke for from one hour to two hours, and after selling some goods, left the store, having remarked to.

The case falls within the rule that <em>\u201c </em>where an exception in a policy of insurance is capable of two interpretations, equally reasonable, that must be adopted which is most favorable to the insured, for the language is that of the insurer\u201d: Western Ins.

The losses are paid by assessment on its members. The object of the company is to .insure .against, bodily injuries produced in a certain manner specified, that is, caused by external violent and accidental means. Not injuries caused by any one of these means, but by all of them combined. Hence the certificate of membership expressly declares the benefits shall not be held to extend to any case of death or personal injury unless the claimant shall establish by direct and. positive proof that the death or personal injury \u201c was caused by external violence and accidental means.\u201d To remove all doubt as to the liability of the association to the plaintiff in this ease the certificate further declares the benefits under it shall not-extend to any death or disability which may have been caused \u201c by the taking of poison.\u201d It is not necessary that the poison be taken with an intent to produce death, in order to defeat a claim flowing from the right of membership. If the poison be innocently taken, and without any knowledge of the injurious effect which it was likely to produce, and did produce, so far- as the person taking it is concerned, the effect may be said to be accidental. If we go a step' further and admit in such case, that the \u201c means \u201d are accidental; yet it is one of the accidental means expressly excepted from the protective power of the certificate. The liability for injuries caused by external violence is still further limited and restricted. Thus the benefits do not extend to cases where the injury was -\u201c the result of design either on the part of the member or of any other person.\u201d To hold the association liable for a death caused by taking poison would not only be in conflict with the letter of the agreemen t, but contrary to the whole purpose for which the association appears to have been formed.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
