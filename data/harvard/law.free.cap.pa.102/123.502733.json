A supplement to the charter of a passenger railway company provided that it should have the exclusive right to use and occupy the streets named in the charter for railroad purposes. Said railway company by virtue of its charter used and occupied a single square of a cross street so as to make the connection between the tracks on the two main streets upon which the cars ran :</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b141-13\"><em>Held, </em>that the exclusive grant must have a reasonable construction, and that its object was to protect the company from competition, nothing more.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b141-14\"><em>Held, </em>therefore, that there was nothing in the terms of the supplement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>to prevent another railroad company from laying down a track on said single square of the cross street and running its cars thereon in an opposite direction to those of the company first named.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b142-5\">5.

In order to avoid an obstruction at a certain point in \u00a1said street, said company was authorized to \u2018\u2018 use such portions of adjacent streets as may be necessary.\u201d The company accordingly laid its track on a portion of an adjacent street and continued for several years to run its cars .on such track. Subsequently, the obstruction being removed, it undertook to construct its track wholly on the first named street.

That by a supplement to said Act of Incorporation, passed March 31st 1859 (P. L. 325), it was enacted that the \u201c said company-shall have the exclusive right to use and occupy the streets named in the Act to which this is a supplement, for railway purposes; that by reason of said supplement the construction of their railway, etc., complainants were vested with the exclusive right to use and occupy Twenty-second street, between Chestnut and Walnut streets; that the Phila<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>delphia and Gray\u2019s Ferry Passenger Railway Company beeame a body corporate, pursuant to the Act of April 9th 1858 (P.

L. 934), with power \u201c to lay out and construct a railway in the city of Philadelphia from, a point near the basin of the Fairmount Waterworks, along Tweuty:fifth and Callowhill streets to Twenty-third; thence.along said Twenty-third southwardly to Gray\u2019s Ferry Road, and thence by South .and Twenty-second streets \u2022 northwardly to Hamilton street, and from thence to' the place of beginning; with the right to use such portions or any of the adjacent streets as may be necessary for the purpose of avoiding the obstruction at Twenty second and Market streets, and to complete their circuit; with the right also to use and occupy the tracks on Gray\u2019s Ferry Road, now owned by the Philadelphia and Gray\u2019s Ferry Passenger Railway Company, and such other tracks that may be laid upon their proposed circuit, upon such terms and condition's as the parties may agree upon.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-6\">. That a railway was constructed under the authority of the Act of April 16th 1866, to accomplish the circuit named therein without any use or occupation of Twenty-second street from Chestnut to Walnut streets, that the defendant claims to have acquired the franchises of the defendant lastly named, or to be possessed with the lawful authority to operate said railway, and threatens to proceed to lay out and construct a railway to be used for passenger purposes on and along Twenty-second street from Chestnut to Walnut streets.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-7\">The bill, therefore, prayed that defendants be enjoined from so doing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-8\">The answer of the defendants admitted the incorporation of complainants as set forth, also the grant of the exclusive right to use and occupy Twenty-second* street, from Chestnut street to Walnut street, inter alia, but averred that no new duty from the railway company, nor any compensation whatever were required as provided for by said supplement; and denied that said exclusive right vested in complainants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-9\">They further admitted that a railway was constructed'by the Schuylkill River Passenger Railway Company under authority of the Act of April 16th 1866, and that on account of the existence of the obstruction at Twenty-second and Market streets, at the time of the construction of said railway, the said Schuylki'l River Passenger Railway Company, in accordance with the terms of their charter, used the. adjacent streets, viz-., Filbert, Twenty-third, and Walnut, for the purpose of avoiding said obstruction, their tracks having been laid on Twenty-second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>\u2022street, south of Walnut, and on the same street north of Filbert, as provided by their charter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-5\">They denied that complainants\u2019 consent is. required before the said Schuylkill Passenger Railway Company can use or occupy for railway.purposes the street in question, but averred that as the obstruction at Twenty-s'econd and Market streets has been removed within the last two months, it was their right and duty- to use and occupy Twenty-second street between South and. Hamilton streets.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-6\">\u25a0 They averred that the city of Philadelphia through its law officer, the city solicitor, has declared that upon the removal of the obstruction theretofore existing at Twenty-second and Market streets, it. was not only the right, but the duty of said defendants to lay a single track on Twenty-second street, and abandon the route now used, for the-purpose of. avoiding said obstruction, the consent of the councils of the city having been heretofore given to said Schuylkill River Passenger Railway Company to use. and.occupy .the streets named, as provided for in their Act of incorporation (Ordinances of 1866, 'p. 223). That, by adopting the proposed route, defendants would not use complainants! rails or. road-bed, but merely cross the same at the intersection of Twenty-second and'Chestnut streets ; that their cars run in an opposite direction, and cannot, therefore, interfere nor compete with complainants\u2019business; that the proposed change would be of benefit to themselves in shortening their route and avoiding curves, and lessening the expense of running their cars. That the clear meaning of the grant in the supplement to complainants\u2019 charter was to protect complainants from loss by competition, which would not occur here; that the construction maintained by complainants would close Chestnut and Walnut streets to roads running north and south, and all other roads which run for a short distance on either street, and which have been \u2022 so doing for years past without objection, , ..

Appellants\u2019 use of Twenty second street is not the same use of that street as that of appellees: Lake Shore R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>Chi. <em>&amp; </em>West. R. R. Co., 97 Ill. 506. No question as to want of authority by nonuser or misuser can arise in this cause: Slee <em>v. </em>Bloom, 5 Johns. Ch. Cases 366; Hestonville, Mantua, etc., R.

If the obstruction had been removed after the date of our charter, and before we built our road we would not only have had the right, but would have been obliged to construct it along Twenty-second street, without using the adjacent streets. The obstruction being removed now, we can adopt our straight course.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b145-7\"><em>David W. Sellers </em>and <em>Wm. Henry Rawle, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APu\">\u2014 Where, at the same session of the legislature, a charter is granted by several Acts, and there is no acceptance nor subscription to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>stock until after the last Act is passed, such charter should be considered as a unit, for it is the acceptance which creates the inviolable contract. No corporation was, in fact,' created by the first Act. The corporate entity came into existence under both Acts, and the grant of letters patent: Lejee <em>v. </em>Railway, 10 Phila. 362. The right in this case is exclusive by the terms of the charter, and has been judicially so construed : N. Branch R. Co. <em>v. </em>Railway Co., 2 Wr. 367; Passenger R. R. <em>v. </em>Railway Co., 3 Phil. 430. The use of the appellees\u2019 tracks by other companies heretofore has been the result either of agreement or of a prior occupation, to which appellee\u2019s right was subject. It requires express words to take an existing franchise for the benefit of another, and to take an existing railway longitudinally : Springfield <em>v. </em>R. R. Co., 4 Cushing 63 ; In re Boston &amp; Alb. R. R., 53 N. Y. 574; Cake <em>v. </em>R. R. Co., 6 N. 307; note to Duncan <em>v. </em>Penna. R. R., 7 Am. <em>&amp; </em>Eng. R. R. Cases 1. The appellant\u2019s chartered powers are exhausted by their location and use of their present road : Moorhead <em>v. </em>Little Miami R. R. Co., 17 Ohio 340; Morris &amp; Essex R. R. <em>v. </em>Central R.

An. 541.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b146-6\">The subsequent removal of the obstruction is clearly immaterial upon the question of construction of the grant. By no legal intendment can we deduce from the words of grant that the right to use \u201c any of the adjacent streets \u201d was merely temporary, and that when the obstruction should be removed (which no one ever dreamed of), the line of the road should bo changed, and this in derogation of a previous charter to another company.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b146-7\">Mr. Justice Paxson</author>\n<p id=\"ADO\">delivered the opinion of the court, March 19th 1883.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">The right of the appellants to lay their track on Twenty-second street, from Walnut to Chestnut street, is resisted by the appellees on two grounds, viz: 1st. That the appellees have the exclusive use of said street by the express terms of their charter, and, 2d. That the appellants, having elected under their charter to occupy certain streets with their tracks to avoid the obstruction at Twenty-second and Market, cannot, now that said obstruction has been removed, relocate their tracks so as to occupy Twenty-second street from Walnut to Chestnut. I will consider these objections in their order.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">The charter of the appellees (The Philadelphia City Pass<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>enger Railway Company) gives them no exclusive use of the streets which they are authorized to use. But by the second section of an Act entitled <em>\u201c </em>supplement to an Act to incorporate the Philadelphia City Passenger Railway Company, passed the 26th day of March, a. d. 1859,\u201d which said supplement was approved the 31st day of March 1859, it was enacted that \u2022 \u201c The said company shall have the exclusive right to and occupy the streets named in the Act to which this is a supplement,\u201d &amp;c. It was .argued, that this created, a contract with the state which was beyond the interference of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">There is reason and authority for holding that a supplement to a charter of incorporation which merely confers upon it a new right or enlarges an old one, without imposing any new or additional burden upon it, is a mere license or promise by the state and may be revoked at pleasure. It is without consideration to support it and cannot bind a subsequent legislature: Johnson <em>v. </em>Crow, 6 Norris 184; Christ Church <em>v. </em>Philadelphia, 24 Howard 300. In the present age of corporate greed it would be dangerous to hold the contrary doctrine. Were we to do so, corporations instead of .-.being the creatures of the state might become its masters.. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">But it is said that the appellee\u2019s charter and the supplement thereto were passed at the same session of the legislature, with only a few days intervening, and that the organization of the company took place after the passage of the supplement, and upon the faith thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">We are not called upon in this case to decide upon the legal effect of a supplement passed under such circumstances. There are other questions of controlling importance in the case. The grant of exclusive privileges must have a reasonable construction. The object was to protect the appellees from competition, nothing more. It is difficult to see how the laying down of a track and its use by the appellants for a single square by cars running in an opposite direction from those of the appellees can produce competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">Even if we are wrong in this, the principle is well settled that a franchise is property, and like any other species of property may be taken by the Commonwealth by virtue of the right of eminent domain upon making compensation. This principle was decided at the present term in the matter of the opening of Twenty-second street, and it v^ould be an affectation of learning to cite the authorities which establish this principle. It is equally clear that any one to whom the Commonwealth has delegated its power of eminent domain is clothed with the same power. It follows that when the legislature by the Act of April 16th 1866 (P. L. 934), incorporated the Schuylkill River Passenger Railway Company (appellants), and authorized them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>to use Twenty-second street, the most the appellees can claim is compensation for the use of this one square. The question of compensation, however, is not before us and is not decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The second objection has even less merit. There was no election within the meaning of the cases cited by the appellees. A discussion of them is therefore unnecessary. The right to occupy Twenty-second street was expressly given by the terms of the appellant\u2019s charter. But at Twenty-second and Market streets there was an.impassable obstruction. In order to avoid this, their charter authorized them \u201c to use such portions of any of the adjacent streets as may be necessary.\u201d The only option which the appellants had, and the only election which they made, was as to what streets they would occupy in order to avoid the obstruction. That election, once made, could not, in my opinion, be changed, and to this extent the doctrine of election applies and no further.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">I am unable to see what standing the appelle\u00e9s have, to raise this question. The Commonwealth might do so, but she is silent. . The city of.Philadelphia might do sq,. but her councils have expressly authorized the appellants to do what they pro-, pose to do, while the solicitor for the city in a well considered opinion addressed to the chief engineer and surveyor has instructed that officer that it is not only the right of the appellants to lay their track on Twenty-second street from Walnut to Chestnut, but that in view of the. fact that the obstruction at Twenty-second and Market streets has been removed, it is their plain duty to do so, and to take up their tracks on the streets which have been heretofore used to avoid said obstruction. The appellees are not in any sense the guardians of the rights of the city or of the people, arid may not interfere with the use of the street beyond the privileges conferred by their charter. Their right to be heard upon such a question is more than doubtful.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">The decree is reversed, the injunction is dissolved, and the bill dismissed at the costs of the appellees.</p>\n<judges id=\"b148-8\">Mercur, C.
