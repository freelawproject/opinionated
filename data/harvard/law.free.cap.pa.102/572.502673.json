This judgment note was never entered of record as a lien.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b591-8\">Alexander Rodenbach, having taken out letters of administration upon the estate of Jesse Rodenbach, deceased, took pssession of said note, with other assets; he presented it to the appraisers, and it was entered in the inventory thus: \u201c Judgment and interest to date of inventory against Alexander Rodenbach, $2,768.04.\u201d The administrator charged himself in his account, filed September 5th 1881, with the full amount of the inventory, to wit: $5,460.68, which sum included the principal and interest of his own note, as inventoried. His account showed that in the course of the administration he paid out all the assets of the estate, except a balance of $431.88, which he held for distribution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b591-9\">Before the Auditor appointed to audit, settle and adjust said account (H. T. Buckley, Esq.), Emma Lauderbach, a distributee, asked that the accountant be surcharged witli interest on his said judgment note from the date of inventory up to the time that he actually paid it into the estate, such interest amounting to $339.72.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b591-10\">The Auditor reported, as matter of law, that the accountant was not chargeable with interest on his note after the date of the grant to him of letters of administration, \u201c as upon that date the law presumes the debt paid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b591-11\">Mrs. Lauderbach filed an exception to this finding of the Auditor which the court, after argument, sustained, holding, in an opinion by Schuyler, J., \u201c that the accountant\u2019s relation of debtor to the estate was not affected by the accident of his appointment as administrator \u201d and that \u201c to establish payment, all he need show is that he has had the money actually in his possession, or under his control, <em>as </em>administrator, since the date it is claimed to have been paid.\u201d The court therefore, in the decree filed, surcharged the accountant with said additional interest on his note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b591-12\">The accountant took this appeal, assigning for error, the action of the court sustaining the above exception to the Auditor\u2019s report.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b592-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number><em>Q.

F. Fackenthall, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0P\">\u2014 The Auditor\u2019s report showed that interest was allowed- on claims against the estate, which the administrator would have been in funds to pay if his own debt had been actually paid. It would be inequitable in such case to exempt him, as an individual debtor to the es - tate, from payment of interest on his debt upon a theory that as administrator he could not sue himself as an individual.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b592-6\">The opinion of the court was delivered March 16th 1883.</p>\n<author id=\"b592-7\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"Axl1\">This complaint is to the action of the court in charging the appellant with interest on his own note which he owed the estate. The mere fact that he became the administrator of the estate did not stop the running of interest. He was justly held chargeable therewith until the note was paid. The note was not paid by operation of law by virtue of his appointment. So long as it remained unpaid, so long it drew interest. We discover no error in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the- costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
