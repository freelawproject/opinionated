The articles contained the usual partnership stipulations, and further this proviso : \u201cProvided, nevertheless, that the said L. S. Filbert [the established practitioner] shall be at liberty during the said term to carry on and attend to any business other than that of practicing medicine and surgery, and may at any time absent himself from attendance in said profession as he may and shall see fit and proper.\u201d After two years Filbert engaged in other business and left the city permanently, without his partner\u2019s consent. He subsequently brought suit on the note for $500, to which the defendant set up as a defense breach of the agreement and failure of consideration. The court charged, in effect, that under the terms of this proviso, he had a right todo as he did. Held, not to be error.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b91-11\">January 9, 1883.</otherdate>\n<judges data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"AAu\">Before Mercur, C.

J., the following facts appeared : \u2014 The plaintiff and defendant were physicians, the former having, in 1869-70, an established practice.in the city of Philadelphia worth $5,000 a year. About the end of 1869, the defendant, who resided in the State of Delaware, came to Philadelphia and advertised for a partner ; Dr. Filbert answered the advertisement, and after some negotiations they entered into the following copartnership agreement, dated June 22nd 1870 : \u2014 \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-7\">Articles of agreement made, &amp;c., between, &amp;c. \u201c Whereas the said Filbert is now established in the practice of medicine and surgery in said city, and whereas the said Joseph A.

The said Joseph A. McFerran shall and will pay to the said L. S. Filbert the sum of $1,500, lawful money ox the United States, for one equal moiety of the said established practice of the said L. S. Filbert. And it is hereby further agreed between the said parties, each for himself respectively as follows, that is to say : That they shall and will not at any time during the said term exercise or follow the said occupation, art, and profession, to their private benefit and advantage, but shall and will from time to time, and at all times during the said term, do their best endeavors to tho utmost of their skill and ability for their mutual advantage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-11\">\u201c And also that they shall and will during the said\" term discharge equally between them all expenses strictly belonging to the management of the said art or profession aforesaid, \"and that all such profit, gain, and increase as shall arise by reason of the said joint business and profession shall be equally and proportionately divided between them, share and share alike.

After this Dr. McFerran practiced alone.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>On December 14th 1876, Dr. Filbert called on Dr. McFerran and said he had found the $500 note in an old pocket-book, that it had nearly run out. McFerran replied that he owed Filbert no money, that he had quit the partnership. Filbert replied that he did not want anything on the note, but wanted an endorsement on it \u201c for the purpose of getting a settlement of the book account.\u201d McFerran then wrote the endorsement, as above.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-5\">No points for charge were submitted. The court charged, inter alia:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-6\"><em>\u201c </em>I observe in the agreement no ambiguity or any doubt about the intentions of the parties. ... It appears that Dr. Filbert desired to leave his medical practice. That was understood at the time. It was the motive on his part for making the arrangement, and it accounts for the proviso in the agreement which enabled Dr. Filbert to carry out his original design of going into some other business. [By the very terms of the agreement he was at liberty to go into any other business, and could give as little time to the practice of medicine as he pleased. . . . It is perfectly plain, that under this agreement, if Dr. Filbert chose to embark in any other business on his own account, he was altogether, at liberty to do so without incurring any responsibility to the defendant. It is no answer to the plaintiff\u2019s demand for the defendant to say to the plaintiff that he gave up the practice of medicine. That is what he intended to do.] Something was said by Dr. McFerran to the effect that Dr. Filbert abandoned the practice of medicine. [He had a right to abandon the practice of medicine. It is one thing to abandon the partnership agreement, which he could not do, and quite another thing to abandon active practice, which he had thought to do. For doing that, he could not be held responsible by the agreement. He was free by the terms of that agreement to embark in any business he chose.] \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-7\">Verdict for the plaintiff, for $830.71, and judgment thereon. The defendant took this writ of error, assigning for error the portions of the charge above quoted within brackets.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b94-8\"><em>Joseph L. Tull, </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIu\">\u2014 The clause of the agreement under which the learned judge virtually directed a verdict for the plaintiff, must be construed with reference to the main intent of the parties, as set forth in the entire agreement. - They 4\u00a3 associated, tliemsel ves as partners in .the .art and occupation of the practice of medicine and surgery, for and during the full end and term of five years, unless the copartnership should be sooner mutually dissolved by the consent of both parties.\u201d They shall <em>\u201c </em>at all times during the said term do their best endeavors to the utmost of their skill and ability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>for their mutual advantage.\u201d The cash and note of Dr. McFerran were expressed to be the consideration for one equal moiety of the said established practice of the said L. S. Filbert. Now the proviso permitting Dr. Filbert to carry on other business, and to absent himself at any time from attendance in said profession as he may and shall see fit and proper, is capable of two constructions; one consistent with and the other repugnant to the main intent of the agreement. By the former, he was permitted to carry on other business at the same time he practiced medicine with his partner, and to absent himself from attendance temporarily as he might see fit. By the latter he could, two weeks or two years after taking Dr. McFerran\u2019s money, desert him, a stranger in a strange city, thereby preventing him from securing the practice, the consideration for his money. In such case, that construction by which the whole agreement may be harmonized, should be adopted, but the court below adopted the other construction. If that be the right and only construction of which the proviso is capable, tl\u00eden the proviso, being repugnant to the grant, is void. Associa-! tion is a necessary incident to the agreement, in order that the \u201c good will \u201d may continue, and the plaintiff by his breach of contract, having willfully failed to assure to the defendant that which he agreed to sell and the defendant purchased and paid for, the latter is entitled to set up failure of consideration as an equitable defence to the note in suit under the plea of nonassumpsit. The authorities in similar eases of partnership agreements fortify our position : Featherstonhaugh <em>v. </em>Turner, 23 Beav. 382; Freeland <em>v. </em>Stansfeld, 2 Sm. <em>&amp; </em>Gif. 479.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b95-6\"><em>W. Henry Smithy </em>for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b95-7\">Mr. Justice Paxson</author>\n<p id=\"Aqd\">delivered the opinion of the court, March 5th 1883.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">The single assignment in this case alleges error in the charge of the court. 'There is but slight room for criticism in the portion selected, still less when read in connection with the remainder of the charge. When the learned judge instructed the jury that under the agreement between the parties the plaintiff below \u201c was at liberty to go into any other business, and could give as little time to the practice of medicine as he pleased,\u201d he but repeated what was substaniially set forth in said agreement. This is too plain for argument. But it was alleged there- was error in that portion of the charge wherein the court said : \u201c It is no answer to the plaintiff\u2019s demand, for the defendant to say to the plaintiff that ho gave up the practice of medicine \u2014 that is what he intended to do. He had a right to abandon the practice of medicine. It is one thing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>abandon tbe partnership agreement, which he could not do, and quite another thing to abandon the active practice, which he had a right to do. For doing that, he could not be held responsible by the agreement. He was free to embark in any other business he chose.\u2019\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">The learned judge, in his charge, further instructed the jury that if the plaintiff practiced medicine on hi\u00e9own account after he gave up active practice under the agreement, it would be a defence to the note, and the plaintiff could not recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">We see no error in this. If the defendant desired more specific instruction, he should have asked for it. The distinction between abandoning the partnership agreement, and engaging in active practice under it, was clearly stated by the learned judge below. The question of the abandonment of the partnership agreement was in effect left to the jury. The defendant, having submitted no point, nor asked for any instruction, cannot now convict the court below of error for omitting to charge more fully upon this branch of the case. This rule is too familiar to need the citation of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
