Fox, Administratrix d. b. n. c. t. a. of Elizabeth Seyfert, deceased, from a decree of said court dismissing their exceptions to and confirming the report of an Auditor appointed to audit and restate the second account of Hon. Tlios. K. Elcocfe, executor of Henry A. Seyfert, deceased, and make distribution of the balance in the bands of the accountant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-12\">The facts, as they appeared before the Auditor, were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-13\">The decedent, Henry A. Seyfert, and bis brother William M. Seyfert, were appointed executors of their mother\u2019s will and took out letter testamentary thereon. This testatrix (Elizabeth Seyfert) left five other children, and the issue of a deceased child, the exceptants, Mary Jane Weldy and Catharine M. Fox being among the former. She divided her estate between her children. It was farther provided in her will that \u201cthe share of my sqti Joseph Seyfert, my daughter Catharine Fox, Caroline McManus, Jane Stevenson, and my son Simon Seyfert, shall remain in the bands of my executors, and by them put out at interest; and I order and direct that my executors shall pay to each of them tlie interest yearly and every year during their lives, and after the death of any of my said children their share shall be divided among their heirs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-14\">The account of the estate was filed by Henry A. Seyfert in 1860 and the shares of the several legatees ascertained to be $1,254.49 each.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-15\">By an agreement in writing of the same year, to which tbe legatees were not parties, the executors divided the trust funds between them. Henry became trustee for the shares of Joseph, Catharine and Simon, and William for those of Caroline, Jane <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>(now Weldy) and Charles Minor (the son of testatrix\u2019s daughter). No security was given by either executor for his share of the estate. The interest on said shares were paid for many years by the executors to their respective beneficiaries.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-4\">Henry A. Seyfert died December 23, 1875 and William M. the surviving executor became insolvent and his letters testamentary were vacated in 1880 and administration d. b. n. c. t. a. on Elizabeth Seyfert\u2019s estate were granted to Catharine Fox.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-5\">Upon the audit of Henry Seyfert\u2019s estate and seven years after his death, Mary Jane Weldy claimed that the interest due to her from her mother\u2019s estate should be paid to her from the estate of Henry A. Seyfert and that the corpus of her legacy should be paid by his executors to Catharine Fox, administratrix d. b. n. c. t. a. of Elizabeth Seyfert. Counsel for the executors objected to the allowance of this claim on the ground that the agreement between Elizabeth Seyfert\u2019s executors as to the division of the trust estates was binding upon the legatees, and thnt therefore Mary Jane Weldy could only look to the insolvent estate of William M. Seyfert for payment. It was also contended that she had been already paid by Henry A. Seyfert.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-6\">As to the latter reason, there was some evidence, that her claim was amicably settled by an arrangement with Henry M. Seyfert. The principal witness in this connection was the Hon. T. R. Elcock, who testified as follows :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-7\">\u201c I have had repeated conversations with Mrs. Weldy about the whole indebtedness of William Seyfert to her. See has told me what she received from him in payment of the indebtedness. It was either two or throe houses and lots in Philadelphia, and a mortgage for about five thousand dollars on some land down near Point Freeze, which she collected, I think, afterwards. xllso a mortgage on some ore property in Hartford county, Maryland. I think it is nine or ten thousand dollars. Some of this she regarded as worthless, but William Seyfert regarded it as of so much importance that he was exceedingly anxious to get an agreement from her that she would pay back whatever was realized over and above her indebtedness. That w.as one of the contests about which she consulted me. She wanted to hold on. During the whole time of my administration she never made any claim on me for principal or interest of the alleged fund here; never even intimated that she had ,a claim against Henry Seyfert\u2019s estate for it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-8\">On cross-examination he further testified :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-9\">\u201c In all the conversations I had with her nothing was said about this particular claim. I gained the impression that William Seyfert owed her a considerable amount of money. She never told me the amount. The account was never stated be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>tween them ; in fact, I don't think either of them knew exactly what it was.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-6\">William M. Seyfert testified :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-7\">\u201cMrs. Weldy was not paid by me. I think she was not paid by Henry. She still holds me. Mrs.\u2019 McManus was not paid by me. Joseph was not paid, nor Mrs. Fox. The reason the principal sums were not paid was because the sums were to be held in trust under the will.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-8\">There was other testimony tending to negative the supposition of a settlement between Mary Jane Weldy and William M. Seyfert.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-9\">The Auditor reported as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-10\">\u201c The share in which Mrs. Jane Weldy was interested remained in the hands of William M. Seyfert, she receiving interest from him, and it does not appear that she ever claimed interest upon the fund from Henry A. Seyfert in his lifetime. She seems to have acquiesced in the division of the trust funds made by the executors, and it is only after nearly seven years have passed since the death of Henry A. Seyfert, the co-executor, that she asserts a claim against his estate. It does not appear from the auditor\u2019s report upon the first account that she then made a claim against this estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-11\">\u201c Mr. Livingood has argued that the liability of the executors in this case was a joint liability, cast by the will of Elizabeth Seyfert upon both executors, to secure the principal and interest of this trust; therefore, William M. Seyfert being insolvent, the estate of Henry A. Seyfert is liable, although the trust fund may have been wasted in the hands of the insolvent surviving co-executor ; and cited Weigand\u2019s Appeal, 4 Casey 471 ; Perry on Trusts, sections 417 and 418. The bearing of the decision in Weigand\u2019s Appeal might well be worthy of consideration, and perhaps very pertinent to this present claim, but the evidence is that her claim was settled in an arrangement made with William M. Seyfert about the time of his insolvency, or thereafter. The claim, therefore, of Mrs. Jane Weldy is rejected and not allowed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-12\">Exceptions filed to this report by Mary Jane Weldy and Catharine M. Fox, administratrix, were dismissed by the court (Sassaman, J.), and the report confirmed. The exceptants thereupon took this appeal, assigning for error this action of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b475-13\"><em>James Otterson </em>(with whom was <em>William H. </em>Livingood), for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATu\">\u2014 The agreement of the executors to divide the funds between themselves was for their private convenience, and in no way affected the rights of legatees, who were not par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>tiesto it, nor their own liability. The evidence was insufficient to warrant the Auditor in finding that Mrs. Weldy had been already paid. No receipt or release was produced and no oral testimony adduced to show payment. On the contrary, there was direct evidence that it, was not paid. But we also contend that there could be no legal payment made to Mrs. Weldy, even if it had been attempted. Mrs. Weldy was covert, and could, therefore, make no such contract. The only valid payment under the directions of the will was that of the animal interest.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b476-5\"><em>Jeff. Snyder </em>(with him <em>H.

Seyfert was guilty of negligence so as to charge him with the money held by his brother William. The testatrix trusted them both and equally; Henry could no more ask the custody of the whole amount than could William. It was not necessary to insist upon an investment of the fund, because the testatrix had not. asked this and had trusted these brothers to take the money themselves. Creditors might have asked this, but legatees ought to he satisfied with the disposition made for them by their testator.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b476-6\">It has been repeatedly said that it is the harshest demand that can be made in equity, to compel trustees to make up a deficiency not owing to their willful default: Eyster\u2019s Appeal, 4 Harris 376.

Not only are wrong conclusions drawn from the facts presented, but in one important particular the facts do not support the finding. It may be, and doubtless is true, that Mrs. Weldy did not claim the interest due her, on the fund created by her mother\u2019s will from Henry A. Seyfert, during his life, and it may also be taken for true, that she presented no claim against his estate therefor for nearly seven years after his death. But neither of these things have any special significance. That she did not make such claim upon Hemy, during his lifetime, is explained by the fact that the interest was regularly paid to her by his co-executor and trustee, William M. Seyfert, and that she did not so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>continue to receive it is accounted for by the insolvency of the latter in 1880. It is altogether probable that she knew of the disposition which Henry and William had made of the trust fund as between themselves, but as long as she continued to receive from the latter what the will gave her, she was not dispose to interfere with their arrangements. And why should she, so long as she got what belonged to her ? It was understood all around that she had but a life estate in the corpus of the trust, and as long as she got her share of its product it was of no consequence by whose hands she received it. So as long as she had any expectation of a continuation of its receipt from William, she was not inclined to claim it from Henry\u2019s estate. But when by William\u2019s insolvency iu 1880, and the vacation of his letters testamentary, all hope of payment from that source was cut off, she must, per force of circumstances, either turn to the estate of the co-trustee, or abandon her legacy altogether. But as Mrs. Weldy was no party to the arrangement by which the trust fund was divided between the executors ; as her con-' sent to that arrangement was never so much as asked for, we cannot see how she could be estopped by her mere acquiescence in a matter which belonged exclusively to the trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Her neglect in this particular could certainly involve her in a consequence no more serious th. n the risk of the possible insolvency of both the executors.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">But the Auditor finds that Mrs. Weldy\u2019s claim was settled in an arrangement made with William M. Seyfert, about the time of his insolvency. Tire testimony, however, supports no such finding. Were there any evidence to support such a conclusion, we would hesitate to disturb it, for the rule is to treat the findings of an Auditor as prima facie correct, but there is here, in fact, no such evidence. It is true, Judge Eloock says, he had repeated conversations with Mrs. Weldy about the whole indebtedness of William Seyfert to her, and that she told him what she had received in payment thereof. Thatit was two or three houses and lots in Philadelphia, a mortgage of \u00a75,000 on some land near Point Breeze, which he thought, she had afterwards collected, and a nine or ten thousand dollar mortgage on some ore property in Hartford county, Maryland. Part of this, he says, she regarded as worthless, \u201cbut that William Seyfert regarded it as of so much importance that he was exceedingly anxious to get an agreement from her that she would pay back whatever was realized over and above her indebtedness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">But there can be no pretence that a transaction of this magnitude involved but the settlement of the interest on $1,254 for four or five years. This sum might have been included in it, but it certainly could not have been confined to it. The same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>witness, however, says that he was impressed with the fact that William Seyfert owed her a considerable amount of money, but that in all the conversations he had with her, she said nothing about the claim now in controversy. Where, then, is the evidence that this claim was so settled <em>% </em>There not only is no such evidence, but, on the contrary, William M. Seyfert swears that Mrs. Weldy was not paid by him. We therefore, necessarily conclude that the Auditor\u2019s finding, in this particular, is wholly without that foundation of testimony which is requisite for its support.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">But it is urged that Henry A. Seyfert was not responsible for the mismanagement and loss of the trust fund by his co-executor. We, however, think the authorities do not support the position thus assumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">The testatrix, by her will, directed that the share, inter alia, of Jane Stevenson (now Weldy), should remain in the hands of her executors, and be by them put out at interest, and that that interest should be paid yearly to the said Jane for and during the period of her natural life.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">But instead of complying with this testamentary direction to properly invest the fund thus committed to their charge, the executors, by an agreement in writing, resolved to divide the whole fund between themselves, so that Henry should retain thereof $3,763.48, the shares of Simon and Joseph Seyfert, and Catharine Fox, and that William should retain a like sum, the shares of Caroline McManus, Mary Jane Stevenson (Weldy) and Charles Minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">Now, whilst there may have been no very serious impropriety in this conclusion of these trustees to retain and use the trust fund, yet we think a little reflection will make it obvious to any one, that having thus determined to invest it, it was then-duty to see that it was properly secured, and that, not having so done, they ought to be held as sureties for one another.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">It may be admitted, as ruled in Verner\u2019s Estate, 6 Watts 250, on the authority of Brown\u2019s Appeal, 1 Dall. 311, and McNair\u2019s Appeal, 4 Rawle 148, that an executor, who has received money of the estate and has paid it over to his co-executor, is not answerable to legatees for the loss of it in consequence of his insolvency. For this rule some color of reason may be found in that as the testator entrusted the whole of his estate to his executors without security, so they, in turn, may trust each other. It is, however, somewhat difficult to understand why this rule should apply in the case of legatees only, and not to creditors. Nevertheless, such is the decision in Brown\u2019s Appeal, and the reason for it, as there given, is, that as the legatees as well as the executors are appointed by the will, therefore the former cannot impose upon the latter the same responsibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>as that existing in favor of creditors. This may be a very good reason for this rule, though we confess our inability to see it. Nor, in this, are we singular, for Mr. Justice Huston, in Sterrett\u2019s Appeal, 2 P. &amp; W. 4.19, utterly refuses to subscribe to a doctrine of this kind. But we are not disposed to attempt to reconcile the differences of the decisions upon a subject of which Chief Justice Gibson says there has been more inconsistencies among English authorities on this head than any other, and on which, as Justice Woodward has intimated, in Irwin\u2019s Appeal, 11 Ca. 294, our Pennsylvania cases are by no means harmonious. The case in hand stands upon a footing essentially different from that occupied by those cases which have given rise to the conflict among the authorities cited. For, however it may be as to the responsibility of one executor who has passed the money of the estate over to his co-executor, there is now, and never has been, any difference of opinion as to their joint responsibility for a loss resulting from their joint negligence. As to this, Weigand\u2019s Appeal, 4 Ca. 471, is full in point, and the same doctrine is recognized in Hall <em>v. </em>Boyd, 6 Barr 270, and in Irwin\u2019s Appeal, 11 Ca. 294. We can, therefore, without hesitation, say, that as the executors, in this case,- disobeyed the injunction of the will which required them to invest the fund committed to their charge, so that the cestuis que trust might have the benefit of the interest thereof during their several lives, and instead thereof, and without security, divided that fund between themselves, there was such a neglect of a joint duty as rendered them liable, the one for the other, for any loss or misapplication of that fund, or any part of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">It follows, that the court below should have ordered the payment, to Mrs. Jane Weldy, of the interest due and unpaid to her on the sum of $1,254.49, from the estate of Henry A. Seyfert, and also the payment to Catharine Fox, administratrix de bonis non cum testamento annexo of the estate of Mrs. Elizabeth Seyfert, of the said principal sum, to be by her invested for the uses and purposes mentioned and directed in and by the will of said decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">The decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court, as to the items indicated, is now reversed and set aside at the costs of the appellees, and it is ordered that distribution be made according to the directions contained in the foregoing opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
