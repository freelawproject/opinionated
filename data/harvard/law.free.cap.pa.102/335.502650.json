A clause in an application for a policy of fire insurance provided that all statements made therein should be warranties on the part of the insured. One of the questions was, \u201c What incumbrances on the property ? \u201d The answer as written was \u201c none.\u201d In an action on the policy issued in pursuance of the application, brought by the insured, the company defended on the ground that at the time of the application a judgment against the plainliff was a lien on the property. The court permitted the plaintiff to show that at'the time of signing the application he told the company\u2019s agent that he had given a note, but he did not know whether it was entered up or not; that the understanding was, it was not to be entered; that the agent then asked, \u201cWell, shall I put it down incumbrance or no incumbrance ?\u201d to which plaintiff replied, \u201cYou can put it as you please.\u201d The agent said, \u201cI will put it down no incumbrance,\u201d to which plaintiff made no answer. \u25a0 The court instructed the jury that if the plaintiff stated the truth to the agent, and the agent wrote no incumbrance, the company could not set up the act of their own agent to defeat the policy ;</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b353-11\">Held, to be error. The statement being written by the plaintiff\u2019s assent without his knowing whether it was true or not, and being a warranty, the plaintiff took the risk of its being true, and it turning out to be untrue in fact, there was a clear breach of warranty, and the plaintiff was not entitled to recover on the policy.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b353-12\">2. The fact that the agent, in above case, was also a director in the company, was immaterial.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b353-13\">February 12th 1883.</otherdate>\n<judges data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"AF7\">Before Mercur, C.

The dwelling house insured was totally destroyed by fire. The company set up a breach of warranty \u00e1s a defence.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-14\">The application contained among a number of other questions which were answered by the assured, the following: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>\u201c What incumbrances on the property' ?\u201d which was answered, so written down, and signed by the assured, \u201cNoiie.\u201d The application contained this provision : \u201c This application shall form a part of the policy of insurance, and all the statements herein made shall constitute warranties on the part of the insured.\u201d At the time the application was made and signed by the assured there was a judgment of $1,000 entered against him in the Court of Common Pleas of Lycoming county which was a lien upon the insured premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Upon this state of facts there was a clear breach of the warranty against incumbrances and the plaintiff below could not recover upon his policy. To meet this difficulty he introduced evidence, under objection from the defendant below, to prove that at the time the application was filled up, the assured told the agent that he had given a note to his father and his aunt; that he did not know whether the same was entered or not; that his father had agreed that it should not be entered. After the assured had made this explanation to the agent, the following is what occurred according to the testimony of the assured himself: \u201c He (the agent) says : \u2018 Well, shall 1 put it down incumbrance orno incumbrance <em>V </em>I says : \u2018You can put it as you please.\u2019 He says: \u2018 I will put it down no incumbrance.\u2019 I made no remark.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">It will thus be seen that the assured, without knowing whether the judgment note, which he had given, was entered or not, acquiesced in the agent putting \u201c it down as no incumbrance.\u201d If the assured did not know, the agent could not know'; hence there is no room for any allegation of fraud practiced upon the assured, or that the agent had placed his own construction upon the language of the assured, and had thus inserted in the application an answer he did not make. For this reason the cases of Smith <em>v. </em>Mutual Insurance Company, 8 Norris 287, and Eilenberger <em>v. </em>Protective Mutual Fire Ins. Co., Id. 464, do not apply. We think the case comes directly within the ruling of Commonwealth Mutual Fire Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Huntzinger, 2 Outerbridge 41. The facts are almost identical. There the warranty' was as to additional insurance. The assured told the agent he thought it was $1,500 or $2,000, he did not know which. The agent said he would put it down at $1,500, to wdiich the assured assented and signed the application. There was no fraud or intentional misrepresentation ; there was a mistake. But where a man warrants a statement to be true he must be held to its absolute truth. \u201c The purpose in requiring a warranty' is to dispense with inquiry and cast upon the assured the obligation that, the facts shall be as represented Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Huntzinger, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">If George Bedfoot, the ageut who received this application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>was, as was claimed by the defendant in error, also a director of the company, and clothed by its by-laws with full power to act in the premises, we do not see how it materially affects the case. If the company had knowledge of all that occurred at the time the application was signed, there is still a breach of warranty. Neither the assured nor the agent knew the judgment had been entered ; both were perhaps aware that it might be ; the assured with this knowledge took upon himself the responsibility of warranting against incumbrances. He assumed the risk, and must be held to his warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">\"We need not refer to the assignments in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">The judgment is reversed and a venire facias de novo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
