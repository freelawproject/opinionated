F. Smith 325, before us, emphasized by the later case of Page\u2019s Estate, 25 P. F. Smith 87, and Roland <em>v. </em>Miller, 39 Leg. Intel. 356, in which the principles of that decision were accepted as operative, we are forced to the conclusion that the will of the testator worked a conversion of his real estate. Among the reasons which give the earliest of these cases a. controlling application to the present, are the gift of the residuary estate, real and personal, to the executors, in trust, to invest the same in such securities as they should select, coupled with a power of sale and a direction, after a final settlement of their accounts, to pay over the balance in their hands, and to convey such real estate as may remain unsold, to the trustees, who were to \u201c succeed to all the powers of the said trust.\u201d The gift to the life tenant' may also be specified, which carefully enumerates the income, issues and profits, but omits mention of rents ; and the gift of $25,000 to each son, as he should attain eighteen years of age, which was to be paid out of either the principal or income. In these provisions of the will an intent to create from the blended realty and personalty, a fund in money for the purposes of distribution, is at least as diseernable as in Dundas\u2019s Appeal and Roland *. Miller, and this circumstance, in all of the cases cited, was recognized as equivalent to an express direction to sell. Excluding the trust for the children, which failed because the testator died childless, we find, immediately following, the special power of sale for the purposes of that trust, a general and unlimited power to sell, which was designed to meet the event which has actually happened. No analogy is presented between this and the last reported case in which the question was fully argued (Peterson\u2019s Appeal, 7 Nor. 397), because in that case the children were expressly privileged to take the land itself at a valuation, a provision which effectually negatived the theory of a conversion by the testator. The intent is the solo test of conversion, and a devise, as here, to the executors for the purpose of sale, manifests an intent to convert; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>Chew <em>v. </em>Nicklin, 9 Wr. 84. The objection that the distribution was ordered among heirs as well as next of kin, and that the executors were to pay the taxes and repairs, does not, we think, conflict with our view of the testator\u2019s intention. His use of the phrase \u201c next of kin or heirs at law,\u201d shows that he regarded those expressions as convertible terms, and we cannot, in^the face of his intention elsewhere to the contrary, substitute \u201cand \u201d for the disjunctive which he has employed. So the executors might properly be enjoined in the will to provide for the taxes and repairs of the real estate, when the direction to convey to the trustees what remained unsold, indicated the testator\u2019s belief that all' of the property would not be disposed of within the year.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-4\">\u201c More doubt, perhaps, attaches to the remaining question. In the event of his death without issue, the testator declared his will to be that his whole estate, after his wife\u2019s death, should be divided among his heirs or next of kin, as though he had died intestate and unmarried. The auditing judge found these words to be descriptive of so literal a dying without a will, as to obliterate all the provisions for a sale and investment of the real estate; and he therefore awarded a part of the proceeds, representing the real estate which had descended <em>ex parte materna </em>to the heirs on the mother\u2019s side. In opposition to this rendering it is to be observed that immediately after this proviso for a distribution under the intestate laws, the testator confers the power to sell, and directs the payment oyer of the proceeds. May we not reasonably infer that the estate as thus proposed to be converted was in the mind of the testator when lie designated the parties who were to take? If we hold that, as to those parties, the will was to be treated as if it had never been written, we at once ignore all which precedes and follows the intestate clause, descriptive of the estate which was the subject of the gift. We must also ignore the appointment of the trustees, because the intestate clause expressly declares that the whole of the estate sliall vest in and be divided among the next of kin or heirs at law, as though the decedent had died intestate. The difficulty disappears with the statement that when the testator penned the clause in question he had already stamped his property with the character of personalty, and it was therefore of personal estate alone that his direction as to intestacy was predicated. We are told that, in doubtful cases, that construction is to be preferred which most nearly conforms to the statutes of distribution : Smith\u2019s Estate, 11 liar. 9. But there is no disposition in what has been said to evade those statutes; the inquiry simply concerns the fund upon which the statutes are to operate. On the whole, we conclude that the testator, having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>\u2022worked a conversion by his will, intended his estate to go as personalty to his next of kin, under the intestate laws.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-6\">This determination renders it unnecessary to consider the objections which were raised by the children of Joseph Perot, inasmuch as the parties through whom they claim could take only as heirs on the part of the mother, and have no interest in the personal estate of the decedent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-7\">The other exceptions to the adjudication are therefore sustained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-8\">Penrose, J., filed the following dissenting opinion :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-9\">That a conversion of his real estate was not contemplated by the testator as a result of his direction to invest and keep invested is plain from the provision for the payment of <em>\u201c </em>taxes and repairs \u201d out of the income; and that an express order to sell, or its equivalent, is necessary to make realty pass as personal estate has been so often decided that the question is no longer an open one. See Patterson\u2019s Appeal, 7 Norris 397. But, as if to guard against any possibility of mistake, the testator, who had created the trust and- made all the provisions with regard to sale and conveyance solely in the interest of his' wife and issue, declared in express terms that, should she die without issue (an event which occurred in his lifetime), his estate should go <em>\u201c </em>the same as though \u201d he had \u201c died intestate and unmarried,\u201d to his heirs at law or next of kin.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-10\">Where there is no ambiguity in the words used, there is no room for interpretation. This principle was applied in the very recent case of Biddle\u2019s Appeal, 39 Leg. Intell. 420, though the effect of a literal adherence to the language of the testator was to lead to a confessedly purposeless accumulation. Certainly astuteness seems out of place where, as here, its exercise is so directed as to take an estats from the natural heirs and give it to strangers to the blood of the purchaser.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-11\">Had the testator died intestate, it could not, of course, have been pretended that there -was a conversion, and his real estate would, under the intestate laws, have passed to his \u201c heirs.\u201d Why, then, in the face of his express declaration, should it be supposed that he meant anything other or less than what he has said; and that, for the purpose of conversion and change of descent, he must, in spite of himself, be regarded as testate? What he has said is, \u201c it being my will that in the event of my dying without issue, that after the death of my wife the whole of my estate shall vest in, and be divided among, my next of kin or heirs at law, the. same as though I had died intestate and unmarried.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-12\">Why does he use the word \u201c heirs \u201d if the lands were to pass as personalty ?

There was no conversion. There was no positive direction to sell. There were two powers to sell vested in the executors : one for the purpose of a trust for children, which he never had, and for a wife, who died before he did ; the other, in the discretion of the executors generally. Such powers, which need not and might not ever be exercised, did not per se effect' conversion \u2014 the land remained land after testator\u2019s death ; it vested in the heir or devisee, who is entitled to rents, until the power of sale is exercised. When exercised, the estate sold is that of the heir or devisee, not that of the testator, for if it was, the lien of debts would be discharged, which is not the case unless that be the express object of the power: Boshart <em>v. </em>Evans, 5 Whart. 562; Blight <em>v. </em>The Bank, 10 Barr 131; Anewalt\u2019s Appeal, 6 Wright 414; Wells <em>v. </em>Sloyer, 3 Clark 203; Chew <em>v. </em>Nicklin, 9 Wright 84 ; Blight <em>v. </em>Wright, 1 Pliila. 549; Adams\u2019 Eq. 296, note 1, 297, note 1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-7\">The trust to \u201cinvest\u201d failed for want of cestuisque trustent in existence. Nor did it indicate an intention to \u201c convert,\u201d for the trustees were to apply income to <em>\u201c </em>paying taxes, expenses, repairs,\u201d and one can\u2019t \u201crepair\u201d investments. And by the codicil, testator directs his executors \u201c to convey all real estate which may not have been sold by them \u201d to trustees for the purposes designated in his will. The rational construction of the powers of sale is that testator authorized a sale, for the more convenient distribution to the persons who would have taken had there been no sale or power of sale. The authority to sell can have no effect upon the question who is to take. This case is different from the class of cases cited by the appellees, such as Evans <em>v. </em>Chew, 21 P. F. S. 47, and Roland <em>v. </em>Miller, 4 Out. 47, in which, unless there was conversion, there was nothing in the will which indicated to whom the property should go. If, under existing circumstances, this were a case of actual intestacy, the duty of administrators would be just what is the duty of the executoi' \u2014 no more, no less \u2014 yet it is argued that because there is vested in the executor a power of sale for a contingency which has not, and cannot happen, a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>version is effected, and parties become' entitled to take who would not otherwise take under the will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-6\">2. Assuming there was no conversion, who are the parties entitled <em>% </em>They are not named in the will, but are described in these words: \u201c Such persons, and in such proportions as is provided for by the intestate laws of Pennsylvania, it being my will that . . . [in the contingency which has happened] . . . the whole of my estate shall vest in and be divided among my next of kin or heirs at law, the same as though I had died intestate and unmarried.\u201d There is nothing illegal or irrational in a testator adopting the provisions -of the intestate laws as a designatio personarum. \u201c Next of kin \u201d or \u201cheirs at law \u201d is as certain as if the persons to whom those descriptions apply at the testator\u2019s death were named individually. Those persons .take, immediately on testator\u2019s death, \u201c the same as though he had died intestate and unmarried.\u201d The court below strike out one class named \u2014 \u201c heirs at law \u201d \u2014 and recognize alone the other class named \u2014 \" next of kin.\u201d But to disinherit an heir, requires not merely an express exclusion, but an actual devise to some one else, for lapsed devises go to the heir. Uncertainty of meaning determines the construction in favor of descent by law: Lipman\u2019s Appeal, 6 Cas. <em>184; </em>Rupp <em>v. </em>Eberly, 29 P. F. S. 141. The court, misled by their theory of conversion, thought that warranted their finding an intention in the will to override the expressed intention in favor of the heir. But if a testator clearly expresses his intention to die \u201c the same as if intestate,\u201d how can another and repugnant intention be found in the will <em>%</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-7\">3. The argument drawn from the intent to blend real and personal estate is a fallacy. The only legal effect of \u201c blending \u201d is that legacies may be paid from land if the personalty be deficient. But here, the only blending is in the devise to the executors for the trust which never took effect. And any supposable intent to blend the proceeds in distribution is expressly negatived by the words \u201c next of kin <em>or </em>heirs at law,\u201d where the property is not blended but divided.</p>\n<p data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-8\">4.

Henry </em>Rawle, for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ay1\">\u2014 In construing a will, in order to reach the testator\u2019s intention, it is proper to consider his circumstances when writing it. This testator owned realty and personalty. LLis legal adviser doubtless informed him that if he died intestate without widow or issue, his real estate would descend according to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>most complicated rules of inheritance, dependent upon whether he derived title <em>ex parte paterna </em>or <em>ex parte materna; </em>but as to his personalty, the devolution would be perfectly simple, to his next of kin. He would naturally say, why cannot it all go as if I had myself purchased the realty <em>% </em>and on receiving the reply, so it can, if you convert it, he, as we contend, adopted that plan and gave his executors full power of sale of all his real estate, directing them to \u201cinvest and re-in vest\u201d the proceeds, and on settlement of their accounts, pay over the balance in their hands and convey any real estate remaining unsold to trustees to \u201c dispose thereof in accordance with the powers and directions hereinbefore given to my <em>executors\u201d </em>\u2014 i.e., inter alia, to convert the unsold real estate. The word \u201c convey \u201d is used here in a formal or physical sense, viz., to execute deeds from one set of fiduciaries to another set. His <em>general intent </em>was conversion, sooner or later. With the exception of providing for temporary care-taking of the real estate until sold, all the words of the will relate to personalty and not realty. He directs all his residuary estate, real and personal, to be invested in \u201c securities,\u201d the \u201c income, issues and profits \u201d to be paid over quarterly, and the \u201cprincipalof my said residuary estate\u201d to be divided, &amp;c. Page\u2019s Estate does decide that a devise of \u201c all one\u2019s estate, real and personal, to be invested in securities \u201d works conversion. Eoland <em>v. </em>Miller is to the same effect. It is sought to avoid the effect of Dundas\u2019s appeal, by the fact that an actual sale had been made. The fund for distribution here was, likewise, the proceeds of actual sales, so that case is directly applicable ; but this is immaterial, as the doctrine of conversion applies independently of actual sale. More discretion as to time and mode of sale does not affect the question of conversion: Leiper <em>v. </em>Thomson, 10 P. F. S. 177; Tazewell <em>v. </em>Smith, 1 Randolph 320; Stagg <em>v. </em>Jackson, 1 Comstock 212. The conversion was not merely for administration of the trust, which failed, but a principal object was for the \u201c division \u201d of the residuary estate. The argument, deduced from ancient English law, in favor of the heir at law, has no application under our intestate system, in which, beginning with Penn\u2019s agreement and charter, and running through our several intestate acts (the earliest of which were repealed by the crown and as often re-enacted here) down to the Act of 1833, the heir at law is never preferred to the next of kin: Purd. Dig. 809. The only survival with us of ancient doctrines of inheritance is that when the heir at law is entitled, real estate descends according to the blood of the first purchaser. This case illustrates its absurdity, for according to that canon, we must, in order to find the testator\u2019s heirs as to real estate <em>ex parte materna, </em>ignore his near relatives, on his father\u2019s side, and go <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>back to the testators maternal great-great-grandfather to establish collateral relationship in the appellants, <em>ex parte materna. </em>The testator expressly ignores blood-relationship as to three of these appellants, by describing them, in pecuniary-bequests, as \u201c my friend,\u201d thus illustrating the remark of Chancellor Kent (4 Com. 411), \u201c the stream of-the natural affections, so remote from the object, must flow cool and languid.\u201d In the bequests to his paternal uncles, the testator mentions the relationship.</p>\n<p data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-6\">Assuming conversion, the words <em>\u201c </em>heirs \u201d and \u201c next of kin \u201d are convertible terms, representing one and the same class, viz., next of kin only : Lowndes <em>v. </em>Stone, 4 Ves. 649; Thompson\u2019s Trusts, Law Rep. 9 Ch. Div. 607; Roland <em>v. </em>Miller, 4 Out. 47; Lord <em>v. </em>Bourne, 63 Me. 368. A Pennsylvania court will not at this day disturb a conversion worked by a testator, because the words \u201c heirs at law \u201d are used disjunctively after the words <em>\u201c </em>next of kin.\u201d The reasoning of the judge in the opinion of the court below, as to the construction of the words \u201c as though I had died intestate,\u201d is incontrovertible. In order to reach the result contended for by the appellants,' it is necessary to interpolate the words \u201c as though I had not converted my estate into personalty,\u201d which would destroy the testator\u2019s primary intent, to wit, conversion into personalty, and distribution as such, according to the intestate law.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b269-7\"><em>John G. </em>Johnson, for William S.

If there is any intention apparent from the testator\u2019s will, it is that, for the purpose of ascertaining to whom his estate shall go, in the contingency which has happened, the will shall be considered as never having been made. His positive direction is that those shall take who would have taken if he had died intestate, yet the award is to the appellees because of his testacy! Powers of sale and other provisions for contingencies which did not happen are out-of the case. According to- the status of personalty or realty the distribution must be to next of kin or heirs at law. If a motive is sought for, it is found in the fact that that the testator never himself earned a dollar ; he inherited enormous wealth from the Perots, and he justly wanted that, in case of his death without widow or issue, his Perot real estate at least, should revert, under the law, to those of the blood of the ancestor from whom it came.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b269-8\"><em>Harry G.

As to the realty in which we claim an interest, Ellis-ton Perot was the perqnisitor, to whom we must go back to trace relationship: Lewis <em>v. </em>Gorman, 5 Barr 164; Maffit <em>v. </em>Clark, 6 W. &amp; S. 261. While I do not admit that we would be excluded from representation under the Act of 1833, yet, granting for argument\u2019s sake that we would, we are clearly entitled by virtue of the Act of April 27th 1855, \u00a7 2, extending representation one generation beyond that provided by the former law. This Act provides: \u201c Among collaterals, when by existing laws entitled to inherit, the real and personal estate shall descend and be distributed among the grandchildren of brothers and sisters, and the children of uncles and aunts, by representation, such descendants taking equally among them such share as their parent would have taken if living.\u201d The result of this legislation is \u201c to introduce a new class of collateral heirs, those who were one generation too remote to take under the Act of 1833,\u201d and to substitute the <em>per stirpes </em>for the <em>per capita </em>rule of inheritance in such cases: Lane\u2019s Appeal, 4 Casey 488; Brenneman\u2019s Appeal, 4 Wr. 116. The Act is an enabling one and should be liberally construed : Miller\u2019s Appeal, 4 Wr. 57. The Act does not say whose grandchildren, or whose brothers and sisters, or whose uncles and aunts. It is contended by Mr. Johnson that the words \u201c of the intestate \u201d must be read into the Act; but this would not give due meaning to the expression \u201c among collaterals, -when by existing laws entitled to inherit.\u201d We contend that the words \u201cgrandchildren of brothers and sisters\u201d refer to the grandchildren (and <em>a fortiori </em>the children) of such brothers- and sisters which as a class if all living -would have, taken. That is to say, any brothers and sisters, of the same generation, who would have inherited if living; and if dead, are represented by children or grandchildren. Now Joseph Perot and Hannah Morris, deceased, the parents of these appellants Joseph S. Perot efc ah, were the brothers aud sisters of the appellants William S. and Francis Perot, who are living; and if they are entitled, we are also entitled by representation under t\u00edre Act of 1855, to the shares their deceased brother and sister, our parents, would have taken, if living.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b270-5\">Johnson, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"At2\">\u2014 If the Act of 1855 does not relate to brothers and sisters or uncles and aunts of the intestate, it relates to anybody\u2019s brothers and sisters\u201d, &amp;c., tracing back the pedigree indefinitely,which is absurd. \u201c Brothers \u201d and \u201c sisters,\u201d \u201c uncles \u201d and \u201c aunts,\u201d are relative words. Ah only child can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>heave no brothers or sisters, and there can be no uncle without a nephew. The grandchildren of a brother, or the children of an uncle, may take by representation. Brother, or uncle, of whom 2 There must be a pivot upon which the relation of brother, or uncle, can turn. As no one can be his own father, so no uncle can exist without a nephew, and no brother without some'other being, male or female, who traces his, or her, existence, to the same parent. The nullius fllius is known to the law, but not so the nullius frater. '</p>\n<p data-order=\"123\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-6\">In the present case, the appellants are neither the grandchildren of a brother or sister of Perot Lardner, nor children of his uncle or aunt. They are not grandchildren of a brother or sister of the common ancestor, Elliston Perot, nor children of an uncle or aunt of the latter. Ilow then can they take by representation, by virtue of an Act which only entities grandchildren of brothers and sisters, and children of uncles and aunts 2 If this Act does not confer upon them the right, they are without it, because they are one degree further removed than the appellees, who are <em>\u201c </em>next of kin \u201d and by all prior legislation, representation amongst collaterals was denied, after brothers\u2019 and sisters\u2019 children.</p>\n<p data-order=\"124\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-7\">If appellants are right in their view, then they did not need the saving grace of the Act of 1855, for they are the children of a father or mother of whom the appellees were brothers\u2014 all \u201c on the same plane.\u201d Their 'contention leads to this: There may be children of such brothers and sisters as are also .uncles and aunts of an intestate. If the children of any persons who happen to be brothers and sisters of one another, were meant to inherit, then, under the old law, such children of brothers and sisters who were also uncles and aunts, would have taken. If so, why was it necessary, by the Act of 1855, to enact that \u201c children of uncles and aunts \u201d might take \u201c by representation,\u201d and how did this court decide in Good <em>v. </em>Herr, <em>7 </em>W. <em>&amp; </em>S. 255, and Parr <em>v. </em>Bankhart, 22 Penn. 291, anterior to this later statute, that \u201cthe children of a deceased undo are excluded when there are uncles or aunts surviving 2\u201d There is no possible question, under our .intestate law, as to the person to whom relationship is to be traced for the purpose of determining whether or not there can be representation.. The Act of 1833 says: \u201c If such intestate shall leave neither brother nor sister.\u201d Then follows the proviso : That there shall be</p>\n<p data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-8\">no representation admitted amongst collaterals after brothers\u2019 and sisters\u2019 children.\u201d Is it open to doubt that the \u201c brother and sister \u201d referred to in the proviso are the brother and sister described in the xAct, viz., those of the intestate 2 When the Act of 1355 allowed representation in one degree more remote, viz., amongst \u2022grandchildren of brothers' and sisters, can we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>possibly doubt that the same brother and sister were intended, viz., of the intestate ?</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b254-16\"> The following is an extract from the adjudication : \u201cA doubt was suggested as to the right of the executor, to collect rents, and as to the jurisdiction of the Orphans\u2019 Court to make distribution of the rents so collected.

Appeal of T. Downing Lindley et al.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">Perot Lardner, whose will forms the subject of this contention, died April 29th 1881, seised of a large real estate and also personal property estimated at one million dollars. The testator derived a portion of his real estate by descent from his father, which was awarded to the Lardners, and is not the subject of dispute. Another portion of the real estate descended to the testator from his mother, and was claimed by the appellants, who are admittedly the testator\u2019s next of kin on the mother\u2019s side. The auditing judge awarded the funds arising from the sales of certain realty purchased by testator\u2019s mother, and the rents of other property bought by her, to the appellants. The court below set aside the adjudication and awarded the fund to the appellees, who are the heirs at law <em>ex parte </em>paterna, upon the ground that the will of Perot Lardner worked a conversion of his real estate, and that the same must be distributed as money. It is conceded that if there was a conversion the appellees are entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">We see no serious difficulty in the case beyond the fact that a large fortune is at stake. The will of Perot Lardner provides' for two distinct contingencies. The first is the event of his dying without leaving a child or children or the descendant of a child or children living at the time of his death. After giving a number of pecuniary legacies to relatives, friends and public institutions, the testator bequeaths a legacy of two hundred thousand dollars to his wife, and the rest, residue and remainder of hi's estate to his executors in trust: 1st. To invest the same and keep the same invested ; 2d. To collect the income, issues and profits thereof ; 3d. To pay all taxes, expenses and repairs; 4th. To pay the remaining income to his wife, Ellen M. Lardner, for life; and, 5th. Upon the death of his said wife \u201c to divide the principal of my residuary estate among such persons and in such proportions as is provided for by the intestate laws of Pennsylvania, it being my will that in the event of my dying without issue that after the death of my wife the whole of my estate shall vest in and be divided among my next of kin or heirs at law the same as though I had died intestate and unmarried.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">The testator survived his wife and left no lineal descendants of any\u2019 degree. This portion of his will therefore took effect. That his residuary estate must go to his \u201c next'of kin or heirs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>at law\u201d precisely as if he had died intestate, is too plain for argument, unless we find something-else in the will which controls it. I will not stop to discuss the proposition that the direction to invest the residue and keep the same invested indicated an intention on the part of the testator to convert his real estate. It is sufficient to say in passing that the direction to invest was applicable to the personal estate, just as the word \u201c repairs \u201d applies to and was evidently intended for his real estate. In other words, the testator directed that his personal estate should be kept invested and that his real estate should be kept in repair.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">But it is said the remainder of paragraph 14 of his will shows that the testator intended a conversion. This portion of paragraph 14- refers to the second contingency above referred te. It provides for the event of the testator leaving his wife and a child or children or the descendants of a child or children living at the time of his death. The contingency did not happen, and this portion of the will never took effect. It drops out of the case. It is vain to explore this alternate section of the will to ascertain what the testator intended in case of his death without leaving a wife and a child or children surviving. That he had already expressed, as clearly as language can make it.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">The power of sale with which the 14th paragraph of the will concludes is as follows: \u201c I further authorize and empower my said executors to make sale, in their discretion, of any real estate for the purposes of this trust and to make deeds to the purchaser or purchasers thereof without any liability on the part of the purchasers to see to the application of the purchase money.\u201d This is a mere discretionary power, and under the authorities does not work a conversion: Peterson\u2019s Appeal, 7 Norris 397; Jones <em>v. </em>Caldwell, 1 Outerbridge 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">\u2022The learned court below was of opinion, however, that there was such a blending of the r\u00e9al and personal estate to create a fund for the purposes of distribution as to bring the case within the rulings of Dundas\u2019s Appeal, 14 P. F. S. 325; Page\u2019s Estate, 25 Ibid. 87, and Roland <em>v. </em>Miller, 4 Outerbridge 47. Some significance was also attached to the fact of the gift of $25,000 to each son as he should attain the age of eighteen years, which said legacy was to be paid out of either the principal or income; and to the further fact that the gift to the life tenant \u201c which carefully enumerates the income, issues and profits but omits mention of rents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">The gift of $25,000 to each son occurs in that portion of the will which never took effect, by reason of the death of all of testator\u2019s lineal descendants during his own life. The omission of the word \u201c rents \u201d in the gift to the life tenant has no especial significance, for the reason that <em>\u201c </em>income, issues and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>profits \u201d include the rents of the real estate. The word \u201c issues\u201d is an apt term to indicate the rents and profits derived from realty.</p>\n<p id=\"A2aR\">N or are we able to see the applicability of the cases referred to. In Dundas\u2019s Appeal there was a conversion in fact. No question of the effect of an unexecuted power was before the court. On the contrary, the power had been fully executed, and the main contention was whether the executors should be surchai\u2019ged for the actual value of a house alleged to have been sold at an under-price. The most that can be predicated of that case is that a trust for sale, with a power of sale, and an execution of the power, works a conversion. Anything beyond this is dictum. We are wholly unable to extract anything from Page\u2019s estate which favors a conversion of Perot Lardner\u2019s real estate. If authority at all upon this question its weight would seem to be on the other side. In the recent case of Roland <em>v. </em>Miller, there was a discretionary power given, which, after a time, became imperative, and it was held that it must be regarded as a trust, for unless it'was executed no legatee could be paid. The legatees were given the proceeds only, not the estate or property itself. The execution- of the power was therefore compulsory in order that the object of the testator might not be defeated, and it was held there was a conversion. This distinction has been frequently recognized: Chew <em>v. </em>Chew, 4 Casey 17; Evans <em>v. </em>Chew, 21 P. F. S. 47; and see 2 Sudgen on Powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The blending of real and personal estate by a testator in his will is not of much significance unless it clearly appears that he intended thereby to create a fund raised out of both real and personal estate, and to bequeath said fund as money. Where such a purpose is expressed and a power of sale given to carry it into effect, there is some room for holding that a conversion was intended. Nothing of the kind exists in this case. As before stated, the testator owned both real and personal estate at the time of his death. The manifest intent of his will is that his personal estate shall be kept invested, the real estate shall be kept in repair; the income, issues and profits be paid to his widow during her life, and at her death the whole of the residue of his estate \u201c shall vest in and be divided among my next of kin or heirs at law the same as though I had died intestate and unmarried.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">We cannot find within the four corners of Perot Lardner\u2019s will any satisfactory evidence of an intention to convert his real estate and to distribute it as money. On the contrary, the intention is manifest and emphatically expressed that in the contingency which has happened his property, both real and personal, shall go as if he had died intestate. This gives to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>heirs <em>ex parta materna </em>the real estate and the rents thereof, which descended to Perot Lardner through his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">II. Appeal oe William S. Perot et al.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">This appeal has been practically disposed of by what has been said in Lindley\u2019s appeal. In the court below the executor accounted for the rents of certain real 'estate belonging to the testator, of which he had taken possession and charge, which had descended under the intestate laws from the testator\u2019s mother. The appellants are heirs <em>ex parte materna </em>and the auditing judge awarded them the rents. Upon exceptions by the appellees, who were the next of kin on the side of the father, this adjudication was reversed, and the rents awarded to them. This was a logical result of the ruling of the court below upon the question of a conversion. Under our view of the law, it is manifest the rents must follow the real estate out of which it issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">This appeal is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">III. Appeal oe Joseph S. Perot et al.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">This appeal presents a different question. It having been settled by the preceding appeals that the will of Perot Lardner did not work a conversion of his real estate, and that the proceeds of the real estate, which descended <em>ex parte materna </em>must be distributed to such of the heirs of said Perot Lardner as are of the blood of the first purchaser, the question now to be decided is whether Francis Perot and William S. Perot, who were the only children of Elliston Perot (a deceased great-great uncle of the testator) take exclusively, or in conjunction with the appellants who are the children of the deceased brothers and sisters of Francis and William S. Perot. The latter were living at the death of the testator, and claim in their own right; the appellants claim by representation through their deceased parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">The precise question is whether the appellants can take by representation. .</p>\n<p id=\"b275-12\">It' is manifest they could not take under the Act of 1833, which provides: \u201c That there shall be no representation admitted amongst collaterals after brothers\u2019 and sisters\u2019 children.\u201d We regard it as too plain for argument that the brothers and sisters referred to.in the Act are the brothers and sisters of the intestate. This construction, would exclude the appellants as they are not children of a brother or sister of the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-13\">The appellants contend, however, that even if not within the Act of 1833, they are entitled to take under the 2d section of the Act, of 27th April 1855, P. L. 368,, which provides, \u201c That among collaterals where by existing laws entitled to inherit, the real and personal estate shall descend, and be distributed among the grandchildren of brothers and sisters, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>the children of uncles and aunts by representation, such descendants taking equally among them such share as their parent would have taken if living.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The effect of this Act is to introduce a new class of collateral heirs \u2014 those who were one generation too remote to take under the Act of 1833 : Lane\u2019s Appeal, 4 Casey 487. Under the Act of 1833, the children of brothers and sisters can take under the Act of 1855, the grandchildren of brothers and sisters, and the children of uncles and aunts, can take by representation. But here again, the brothers and sisters must be the brothers and sisters of the intestate. The appellants do not come within the description of the Act of 1855. They are neither the grandchildren of a brother or sister of Perot Lardner, nor children of his uncle or aunt. They are not grandchildren of a brother or sister of the common ancestor, Eliiston Perot, nor children of an uncle or aunt of the latter. We need not elaborate this point. We are of opinion that the appellants are not entitled to take either under the Act of 1833 or that of 1855, and their appeal must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The appeals of T. Downing Bindley et al., No. 149, of January Term 1883, and of William S. Perot et ah, No. 142, of January Term 1883, are sustained, and as to them the decree is reversed at the costs of the respective appellees. The appeal of Joseph S. Perot et ah, No. 150, January Term 1883, is dismissed, and as to them the decree is affirmed at the costs of the appellants. The adjudication of the auditing judge is affirmed, and it is ordered that distribution be made in accordance therewith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
