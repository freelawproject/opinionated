E. Holman, Esq.), a claim was presented by the Allentown National Bank, on a promissory note dated June 28th 1878, for $1,900, drawn by one Shimer to the order of David Danner Sr., and by him endorsed due September 28th 1878, protested, &amp;e. Payment was resisted on the ground, inter alia, that the bank had on September 30th 1878 taken a new note for the same debt, in the same amount, drawn by said Shimer to the order of one William Salade, and by him endorsed ; that suit had afterwards been brought against Salade on said note, or on a renewal thereof, and judgment obtained, which judgment had been marked satisfied by the attorneys of the Allentown National Bank, the entry of record stating: \u201c this not to release other parties to the note.\u201d It was claimed that by the acceptance of a new note with a' new endorser, thereby extending the time of payment of the original note, and by the satisfaction of said judgment, the decedent David Danner, Sr., was released as endorser on the original note now claimed to be recovered against his estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-6\">(Payment was also resisted on other grounds, but as these were not considered in the opinion of this court, it is not essential to set them forth.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-7\">In answer to the above objection to the claim, the bank presented the following paper, dated September 30th 1878.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-8\"><em>\u201c </em>Whereas, the Allentown National Bank is the holder of the following promissory notes, to wit: A note for sixteen hundred dollars, dated Macungie, Pa., June 28th 1878, drawn by David Danner, Sr., now deceased, to the order of F. S. Shimer, ninety days after date, and endorsed by the said F. S. Shimer and F. S. Shimer, cashier; also another promissory note bearing date June 28th 1878, drawn by F. S. Shimer to the order of David Danner, Sr., now deceased, and endorsed by David Danner Sr. and F. S. Shimer, cashier, for the payment of nineteen hundred dollars, ninety days after the date thereof, which notes were both duly presented on maturity, for non-payment and protested. -And whereas, the Allentown National Bank has agreed to discount other notes for the said F. S. Shimer and the Millerstown Savings Bank, of which he is the cashier, aggregating the same amount as the two notes above referred to, and, representing the same debt, and renewed by other names' as makers or endorsers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-9\">\u201c Now, therefore, it is hereby admitted and agreed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>such other notes, and any and all renewals and substitutions of the same, or other notes in their stead and place, shall not be considered or construed as a payment in whole or in part of either of tlie two notes first above referred, but that such other notes, renewals aud substitutions are simply as additional and collateral security for the debt represented by the two notes first above mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-4\">\u201c And it is further admitted and agreed that the transaction above mentioned, .and the discount of such new notes, and the entries, charges and credits upon the books of the Allentown National Bank, in relation thereto, shall not operate nor be construed as a release of any of the makers or indorsers upon the two notes first above mentioned, nor as any extension or agreement to extend the time for the payment of either of the two notes first above mentioned, but the said Allentown National bank, its successors and assigns, shall be at liberty at any time to proceed to the collection of the moneys due upon the two notes first above mentioned, as fully and effectually as though the aforesaid additional notes, renewals and substitutions had not been given, made or accepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-5\">\u201c Witness our hands this 30th day of September\u2019, A. D. 1878. F. S. Shimer, Cashier,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-6\">\u201c In presence of F. S. Shimer.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-7\">II. S. Shimer.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-8\">The Auditor imported that <em>there beingno </em>evidence that the parties intended the new note should be taken as payment of the original note, but the contrary expressly appearing by the above agreement, the new note was but a collateral security, and the endorser on the original note was not disclxai\u2019ged, citing: Hagey <em>v. </em>Hill, 25 P. F. S. 108. He thei\u2019efore allowed the claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-9\">Exceptions filed to said report by Charles Kemmei\u2019er and wife and Mary Ann Danner, lxeirs and representatives of the decedent, were dismissed by the court, whereupon the exceptants took this appeal, assigning for error the dismissal of their exceptions and tlxe confirmation of the Auditor\u2019s r.eport.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b578-10\"><em>Edward Harvey (Morris L. Kauffman </em>with him), for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AE6j\">\u2014 If the new note was taken by the creditor from the maker as collateral security for the original, the debtor was bound to hold it in ease of his surety, the indorser on the original note; and when he satisfied the judgment against the indorser on the new note, he released his claim against tlxe indorser on the original note. Tlxe bank alleges it got nothing on account of this debt from the indorser on the collateral note ; but it is not denied that he paid $3,000 to have the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>satisfied, which the bank appropriated or permitted to be appropriated to other accounts. This, nevertheless, discharged the original indorser: Baker <em>v. </em>Briggs, 8 Pick. 122; Brandt on Suretyship, 393, \u00a7 291; Pearl <em>v. </em>Deacon, 1 DeG. &amp; J. 461; Ramsey <em>v. </em>Bank, 2 Penna. 303. When the bank seeks to recover the debt from Danner\u2019s estate, it should be ready to assign to it the collateral, which it cannot do, having satisfied the judgment thereon: Bender <em>v. </em>George, 11 Nor. 36.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b579-4\"><em>R. E. Wright &amp; Son, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Asp\">\u2014 If Sallade, who was the surety for the Danner note, had been compelled to pay the debt, he could have had recourse to Danner, but in no event could Danner, who as regards Sallade was principal, have had recourse to Sallade, and Danner\u2019s estate was therefore in no way injured by the release of Sallade.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The opinion of the court was delivered March 19th 1883.</p>\n<author id=\"b579-6\">Pee Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AoFV\">\u2014 It is well settled law that the acceptance of a new security for an existing debt does not operate as a payment, unless so intended by the parties, and this is a question for the jury: Hart <em>v. </em>Boiler, 15 S. &amp; R. 132; Brown <em>v. </em>Scott, 1 P. F. Smith 357; Seltzer <em>v. </em>Coleman, 8 Casey 493. In the present case there was an express agreement that the acceptance of the new notes should not be considered a payment in whole or in part, of the old notes, but should be deemed simply as collateral security, nor should the new notes operate as an extension of time so as to prevent the bank from proceeding on the old note at any time it saw proper. Such an agreement may be enforced and it justifies this decree. The other questions are without merit: Hagey <em>v. </em>Hill, 25 P. F. Smith 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
