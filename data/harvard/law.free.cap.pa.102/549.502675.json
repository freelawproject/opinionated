After making several demands on Stiles for a further settlement, which was refused, Saeger brought suit. The case was called for trial in November 1879, but, owing to the sickness of Saeger, was continued; and on April 16th and May 10th 1880, his depositions were taken as an aged and infirm witness, but were not filed until August 15th following.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b569-6\">On June 12th Saeger died, and subsequently his administrator, Stephen Shoemaker, was substituted as plaintiff.

I replied to him, that as he was the senior counsel, I thought he should do so, but that if I fixed them under the agreement we had when he and Mr. Saeger were in my office, that I ought to have $500 ; that what he should have he was the best judge himself. That is the substance of what I wrote him. I afterwards received a letter from him, and he told me that Saeger would not and could not pay that, because he had a contract with him at ten per cent. I said : <em>\u201c </em>Very well; if that is so, there is no fixing of fees about it, and it is customary to divide the fees, but you pay me whai you think is right.\u201d That is about the substance. That, however, was my understanding between Stiles and Saeger at the time I was in consultation with them at my office.....I was to get $500; the fee was contingent upon success; I was to get nothing except we gained it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b569-9\">Certain letters from Stiles to James were also put in evidence, directing the latter to draw the costs and keep them, and tending to show Saeger\u2019s dissatisfaction with his settlement with Stiles.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b569-10\">The plaintiff submitted the following points: 1. \u201c If the defendant made an unfair demand for fees, or sought to take an unfair and inequitable advantage of the plaintiff by the retention of more fees than justly due, he has forfeited his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>right to any compensation whatever.\u201d Refused.

There is no evidence that he received any money, other than that which is set forth in that receipt. ......In examining the testimony of the witnesses, and the letters which have been received in evidence, I fail to find anything which will warrant the jury in saying there was not good faith practiced by Mr. Stiles when he made this settlement with Mr. Saeger. For these reasons [the court will submit to you the single question as to whether or not it is proved that 'William Saeger signed this receipt. If you find from the evidence that the name of William Seager to the receipt is his signature, then I direct you to find a verdict in favor of the defendant.] If you do not find it was signed by him, your verdict will be in favor of the plaintiff for the amount of money received by Mr. Stiles.\u201d (First assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b570-9\">Verdict for the defendant, and judgment thereon, whereupon the plaintiff took this writ assigning for error, the rejection ot the depositions, as above; the refusal of Iris points, and that part of the general charge quoted in brackets.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b570-10\"><em>A.

The rules of court, No. 87 and 88, under which Saeger\u2019s depositions were excluded, are in conflict with the Acts <em>of </em>March 28th 1814, and March 26th 1827, 6 Sm. Laws 208 and 9 Id. 207, and with the practice established under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>said Acts: Riegel <em>v. </em>Wilson, 10 P. F.

St. 412; Ankrim <em>v. </em>Sturges, 9 Barr 275; Dailey <em>v. </em>Green, 3 Harris 118; Haupt <em>v. </em>Henninger, 1 Wr. 140. Two sufficient causes were shown for filing the depositions nunc pro tunc; the death of the witness, and the omission of the commissioner to file them.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b571-6\"><em>Evan Holben </em>(with whom was <em>R. E. </em>Wright, <em>Jr.), </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A99\">\u2014 The receipt was \u201c in full as above,\u201d and there was nothing between the parties, except the matters set forth in the statement above the receipt; no frfiud, accident or mistake was alleged in regard to it, and certainly none was proved. The depositions were not filed within the time designated by the rule of court. Under section 21, Act of June 16th 1836, the court was authorized to make such a rule, which is not in conflict with the Constitution, or any Act of Assembly: Gannon <em>v. </em>Fritz, 29 P. F. S. 303. No sufficient cause was shown for filing the depositions munc pro tunc, the result of which would have been, to allow the plaintiff the advantage of the testimony contained therein, while the defendant must have remained silent owing to the death of Saeger.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b571-7\">Mr. Justice Trunkey</author>\n<p id=\"AAR\">delivered the opinion of the court, April 16th 1883.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">By itself the receipt is prima facie evidence that Saeger consented to the deduction of $1,000 by the defendant for his services; but it is by no means conclusive. A receipt is like any other parol admission of the party, and is open to explanation or correction ; and he may show that it was made by mistake, or does not exhibit the real state of facts : Rusell <em>v. </em>Church, 65 Pa. St. 9; Wharton on Contracts, \u00a7 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">The parties were attorney and client. That relation gives l\u2019ise to great confidence and the attorney is presumed to have the power to strongly influence his client, and to gain by his good nature and credulity, and to obtain undue advantages and gratuities. Hence, the law often declares transactions between them void, which between other persons would be unobjectionable. Unless the transaction is fair and conscionable it is deemed a constructive fraud. This long established rule applies to this case, even if the receipt is taken as evidence of a settlement of the amount of fees for the services in the judgment therein recited. More than eighteen per centum was deducted for fees, and the jflaintiff in the first place must show that the sum retained is larger than the services of the defendant were reasonably worth, or larger than agreed upon if there was an express contract. If he does, then the burden is cast upon the defendant to prove to the 'satisfaction of the jury that the sum was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>retained by his client\u2019s agreement under circumstances that made it fair and conscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Where there is a dispute respecting the amount of fees and the attorney acted in good faith, his right to compensation is not forfeited, should the jury find that he is entitled to a less sum than he claimed. But if he fraudulently claimed the right to retain out of the money of his client a larger sum than the jury find to be just, he forfeits all claim to any compensation whatever: Balsbaugh v. Fraser, 19 Pa. St. 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">The testimony of Mr. James was sufficient to warrant a finding by the jury, that the defendant contracted with Saeger to conduct the suit against the Lehigh Yalley Railroad Company for ten per centum of the amount recovered : also that James contracted for a contingent fee for services in the same case of $500. After the date of the receipt the defendant wrote an order in favor of James, which Saeger signed, for the costs, amounting to $160.40. James received the costs ; but nothing from the defendant except letters containing, among other things, urgent directions to draw the costs and not pay a cent to the witnesses or Saeger. These letters tend to show the manner of dealing between the parties, and Saeger\u2019s dissatisfaction. The evidence ought to have been submitted to the jury and considered in connection with the fact that the parties held the confidential relationship of attorney and client. It is now immaterial whether the defendant could rightfully have paid out of money in his hands, James\u2019 fee; he did not. The first and sixth specifications of error must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Courts have power to make rules respecting the filing of depositions and cannot be reversed for enforcing them. Rule No. 87 is reasonable, and not inconsistent with any statute. There are good reasons for requiring promptness in the filing of depositions, and it is incumbent on the party at whose instance they are taken to see that they are filed in time. If it be conceded that the court below could properly have directed the deposition to be filed nunc pro tunc, there is not ground shown for reversing the order refusing the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">Judgment reversed and venire facias de novo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
