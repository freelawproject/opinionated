As soon as convenient hereafter each of the parties hereto shall choose an arbitrator, they to choose a third, which three arbitrators, upon a hearing of the respective claims of each of the parties, shall decide whether the Minnesota Lumber Company is entitled to its coal at the prices named in the within alleged contract of August 4th. In case of an affirmative decision of this question the Whitebreast Coal Company shall rebate to said Minnesota Lumber Company the difference between said contract prices and the amended prices mentioned herein. In case of a negative decision, the said amended prices shall be in final settlement of the coal. It is agreed that the coal shall be settled for in sixty days paper as before mentioned, and it shall also be decided by said arbitrators whether the paper shall be with or without interest.

The defendant stood by the pleas, a jury was waived and the cause was tried by the court upon the declaration and general issue. The court found for the plaintiff and rendered judgment for $9,254.36, from which the defendant'appealed, and claims that the court erred in sustaining a demurrer to the special pleas of set-off, and also in rendering judgment for the value of the coal shipped and delivered to the defendant.</p><attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b247-12\" pgmap=\"247\">Appellant\u2019s Brief, Carnes &amp; Dunton, Attorneys; John P.

Thrall v. Newell, 19 Vt. 202; 47 Am.

Crittenden et al. v. French, 21 Ill. 598.</p><p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-5\" pgmap=\"248\">As an executory contract may be altogether discharged by mutual agreement, so it may be changed. The undertaking of each party to do something different from that which he first agreed to do furnishes a consideration for the promise of the other. A subsequent agreement to vary the performance of a contract in a way that would make it unlawful is merely inoperative, and leaves the original contract in force. Eng. and Am.

City of Memphis v. Brown, 20 Wall. (U. S.) 289.</p><p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-7\" pgmap=\"248\">By the law merchant an oral promissory note is impossible; it must-be in writing; consequently an oral agreement varying such a note is repugnant to the whole transaction, and it will be rejected as void. Bishop on Contracts, section 770.</p><p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-8\" pgmap=\"248\">After the executory contract has been made, it may be converted into a complete bargain and sale by the appropriation of specific goods to the contract. The sole element deficient in a perfect sale is thus supplied. The contract has been made in two successive stages instead of being completed at one time, but it is none the less one contract, namely, a bargain and sale of goods. 1 Benj. on Sales, 4th Am. Ed., Sec. 488.</p><p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-3\" pgmap=\"249\">An executory sale is a contract for the transfer of property.

But the new contract must be in no sense a continuation or modification of the old. The old contract must be utterly abandoned, so that neither its terms, nor any claim of right springing out of it, shall enter into the new. Webster v.

This uncertainty is a patent ambiguity, and can not be affected by extraneous evidence. A.writing may be ambiguous because the writer intends it to be so. 2 Wharton, Ev., Sec. 957. And when so it can not be helped by parol evidence. 2 Wharton, Ev., Sec. 957.</p><p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-10\" pgmap=\"249(9) 250(14)\">Extrinsic evidence is not admissible to remove a patent ambiguity, and the instrument is inoperative and void. 1 Am. &amp; Eng.

B., 578.</p><p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-7\" pgmap=\"250\">The contract set up in the third plea is in violation of section 130, chapter 38 of the Revised Statutes of this State, and the demurrer was correctly sustained to it for that reason.

Justice Harker</author> <p id=\"ANz\" pgmap=\"252\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p> <p id=\"b252-5\" pgmap=\"252\">The action of the court in sustaining a demurrer to the special pleas of set-off ivas not erroneous. The alleged contract of August 4th set out in the first plea, is void for uncertainty. By it \u201cMinnesota Lumber Company agrees to buy its requirements of anthracite coal for the season of 1886-1887, of the Whitebreast Coal Co., to be furnished as ordered.\u201d What its requirements were to be is nowhere defined. The contract furnishes no data from which the coal company could approximate the probable demands which might be made on it; whether one ton or one hundred thousand tons can not be ascertained from the agreement. This uncertainty is not removed by any allegation in the plea. Whether the \u201c requirements \u201d were for consumption in operating a factory or for furnishing the retail trade of a particular town, county, State, or country, or whether for -speculation, can not be learned from the contract or any allegation in the plea. Furthermore the agreement does not bind the lumber company to require any anthracite coal. It is, therefore, void for want of mutuality. The general rule is that a promise is not a good consideration for a promise, unless there is mutuality of engagement.</p> <p id=\"b252-6\" pgmap=\"252\">The contract set up in the second special plea, violates section 130, chapter 38 of the Revised Statutes, and is therefore void as being malum prohibitum.</p> <p id=\"b252-7\" pgmap=\"252(78) 253(43)\">\u201c Whoever contracts to have or give to himself or another, the option to sell or buy, at a future time, any grain, or other commodity, stock of any railroad, or other company, or gold, or forestalls the market by spreading false rumors to influence the price of commodities therein, or corners the market, or attempts to do so in relation to any such commodities, shall be fined not less than ten dollars, nor more than one thousand dollars, or confined in the county jail not exceeding one year, or both, and all contracts made in violation of this section shall be considered gambling contracts, and shall be void.\u201d Starr and Curtis\u2019 Statutes, Yol. 1, page 721.</p> <p id=\"b253-5\" pgmap=\"253\">That the \u201c privilege of ordering any quantity of coal not in excess of 12,000 tons,\u201d is only an option, is so clearly established by the reasoning employed by the learned judge who wrote the opinion of our Supreme Court, in Schneider v. Turner et al., 130 Ill. 28, that we do not care to more than refer to that case in support of our holding.</p> <p id=\"b253-6\" pgmap=\"253\">To make out its case appellee introduced the written orders of appellant, made proof of shipments of coal on the orders and proved the value of the coal. It showed shipments in August, September, October, \u00a1November and December, 1886, amounting to 4,176 tons, valued at $19,739.97, credits amounting to $10,485.61 and a balance of $9,254.36, for which last mentioned sum the Circuit Court rendered judgment. There was no dispute as to the quality of the coal delivered, but appellant contended upon the trial that the coal was ordered, shipped and accepted under the terms of the agreements of August 21,1886, and that inasmuch as such agreement was in violation of that section of the criminal code quoted above, there could be ho recovery for the unpaid balance. Such contention is most earnestly argued in this court for a reversal of the judgment. It should be borne in mind that the alleged contract is not declared upon, nor is the suit to enforce it, or to recover damages for a breach of it.</p> <p id=\"b253-7\" pgmap=\"253\">Appellee did not call to its aid the illegal contract to make out its case. It was not necessary to do so. It was only necessary to show that the coal was ordered and delivered and what was the reasonable value of it.</p> <p id=\"b253-8\" pgmap=\"253(54) 254(97)\">The claim which forms the basis of the suit is perfectly legitimate. The sale and delivery of coal is not illegal. It is only option contracts to buy or sell coal that are prohibited by statute. Although there may be some illegal feature indirectly connected with a transaction involved in a suit, yet the plaintiff may recover if his cause of action is otherwise legitimate, and he can make out his case without calling tc his aid the illegal agreement. The test of whether the demand can be enforced at law is whether the plaintiff requires the aid of the illegal contract to establish his case. Armstrong v. American Exchange Bank, 183 U. S. 434; Thomas v. Brady, 10 Pa. 164; Holt v. Green, 73 Pa. 198; Congress Co. v. Knowlton, 103 U. S. 49; Welch v. Wisson, 6 Gray 506; Mosher v.
