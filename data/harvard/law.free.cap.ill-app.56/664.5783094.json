D., A. W. and H. H. Peasley, partners as Peasley &amp; Co., upon which an execution was on that day issued and placed in the hands of the sheriff. Afterward, on the same day, he obtained another judgment against the same parties and Hannah Peasley, for $1,549.40, and execution was also issued upon it and delivered to the sheriff. Afterward, in same court and at the same term, but two days later, on March 20th, the Third National Bank of Bloomington, Ill., the appellee, obtained a judgment for $3,280.62 against the same parties and also against Hannah Peasley, and an execution upon it was on that day issued and placed in the hands of the sheriff. All these executions were levied on the personal property of the firm of Peasley &amp; Co., but were not levied on any land of the firm, of the individuals, or of Hannah Peasley.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b661-6\" pgmap=\"661\">On March 23, 1893, Peasley &amp; Co., who had been engaged in manufacturing machinery in Bloomington, Ill., filed a bill for the appointment of a receiver, making the appellee and the appellant defendants, and by agreement an order was made appointing a receiver to take charge of, sell, and dispose of the property of the firm of Peasley &amp; Oo. The goods levied on by the sheriff were turned over to the receiver and the rights of the execution creditors thereon preserved by agreement of the parties and the order of the court.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b661-9\" pgmap=\"661(104) 662(70)\">There was no receiver appointed for the property of the individual members of the firm. \u2019 On August 30,1893, all of the property of the firm had been sold, and enough to pay appellant\u2019s first judgment had not been realized. The execution on appellant\u2019s second judgment was then returned and a new one issued on the first day of September, 18113, by virtue whereof the sheriff levied on the real estate of the individual members of the firm and of Hannah Peasley, the proceeds of which are in controve\"sy in this suit. The sheriff, after duly advertising, sold the land on November 28,1893, appellant becoming the purchaser for the amount of his judgment, interest and costs, $1,653.52, and a certificate of purchase was issued to him. At the time of the sale there was no other execution in the sheriff\u2019s hands except the one dated March 18, 1893, issued on the first judgment rendered in favor of appellant, and one dated March 20,1893, which was issued upon the judgment in favor of appellee.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b662-4\" pgmap=\"662\">The appellee filed a petition in the case in which the receiver was appointed, claiming a priority over appellant\u2019s judgment on all the property of the firm and of the individuals. A demurrer was sustained to the petition, except in so far as it related to the adjustment of priorities on the property of the individuals. Exceptions to this ruling were not taken and preserved, nor has the appellant filed cross-errors in this court so that no question as to the correctness of the action of the court in this respect is presented here. Appellant was ruled to answer the petition so far as the demurrer did not apply, which he did by setting up the facts as herein above set out, and claiming that by the sale under his execution on \u00a1November 28,1893, he had gained a priority over the bank.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b662-6\" pgmap=\"662\">A stipulation of facts was then entered into and the cause submitted to the court thereon. The court held that all three of the judgments were equal liens on the land sold and should share pro rata in the proceeds, and ordered appellant to pay the sheriff $690 as the pro rata share of the appellee in twenty days, and setting the sale aside in case of default. From this decree Weaver appealed to'this court.</p><attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b662-7\" pgmap=\"662\">Appellant\u2019s Brief, Edward Barry, Attorney.</attorneys><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b662-8\" pgmap=\"662(89) 663(17)\">The doctrine regarding individual and partnership debts, and payment of same out of individual and partnership funds respectively, only relates to the rights of creditors after dissolution, and to property undisposed of and to which prior liens have not attached. After a creditor of a firm obtains judgment, it can not be insisted that individual creditors shall be first paid out of the individual property. Reeves, S. &amp; Co. v.

At common law, or perhaps more properly Statute of Westminster 2, when the liens of judgments were equal, he who first had execution issued and levied, obtained a priority. Every court which has been called to pass upon the question has so held. Smith v. Lind, 29 Ill. 24; Elston v. Castor, 101 Ind. 436; Rockhill v. Hanner, 15 How. (U. S.) 189; Lowry v.

This rule is founded, not upon the equities of the creditors, but upon the equities of the partners. Each partner has the equitable right to have partnership debts paid out of the partnership estate, in the first instance, so that bis individual property may be retained. In like manner, the members of the firm have each an equitable right to have the individual property of each partner first. exhausted, in payment of the individual debt, in order to exempt the joint estate, as far as possible, from seizure for individual debts.

It recognizes, however, that the members of the partnership have a superior lien on the partnership property for the payment of the firm debts, and allows the creditors to avail themselves of this lien to the exclusion of individual creditors, when it has not been surrendered by the partners.

The individual creditors take the separate and private estate in preference to the partnership creditors. Hanford v. Prouty, 133 Ill. 339; Moline Water Works v. Webster, 26 Ill. 233; Pohlman v.

Eq. 490.</p><p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b665-4\" pgmap=\"665\">So when the Third National Bank, by virtue of its judgment and execution, acquired a lien upon the separate estate of the partners, it obtained a legal advantage of which it can not be deprived by other partnership creditors. It has the prior statutory lien, the legal validity of which can not be questioned. Straus v. Kerngood, 21 Gratt.

Justice Boggs</author> <p id=\"ADVf\" pgmap=\"666\">delivebed the opinion of the Court.</p> <p id=\"b666-7\" pgmap=\"666\">The lien of judgments rendered at the same term of court is, under our statute, concurrent; neither lias priority; Sec. 1, Chap. 77, R. S., Judgments, etc. At common law where judgments were equal the judgment creditor who first had execution issued and levied, as a reward for his diligence obtained a priority in the proceeds of the sale of the property levied upon. Smith v. Lend, 29 Ill. 24; Freeman on Executions, Sec. 203. The common law right to thus secure priority was to some extent abridged by the enactment of the 13th section of said chapter 77 of R. S., which is as follows :</p> <p id=\"b666-8\" pgmap=\"666(44) 667(56)\">\u201c 13. When the lien of several judgments is concurrent by reason of the same having been rendered at the same term of court or on the same day in vacation, and execution issued upon any one of such judgments is levied upon property subject to such, lien, the property so levied upon shall be sold for the benefit of all executions issued upon such judgments, and delivered to the same officer or any of his deputies before sale; and the proceeds of such rate shall be divided upon the several executions pro rata, according to their several amounts.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b667-4\" pgmap=\"667\">This section was enacted to enable the other judgment creditors or such of them as would comply with its provisions to secure equal priority with the creditor who by reason of his diligence was more favored than they by the existing rule of the common law. In order to secure this equality it is, however, incumbent upon them to comply with the requirements of the statute, that is, to lodge in the hands of the sheriff executions upon their judgments before sale was made under the executions issued by the more vigilant creditor. Otherwise the proceeds of the sale would be first applied to the discharge of the more favored judgment according to the course of the common law. The trial court held that the appellee complied with this statute and became entitled to share pro rata in the proceeds of the sale of the land. In this we think the court erred. The sale was made November 28, 1893. The sheriff then had in his hands only one valid execution, the one issued September 1, 1893, upon the judgment rendered in favor of the appellant. He still held possession of the execution that the appellee had caused to be issued on its judgment on the 20th day of March, 1893, but it vr&amp;s functus officio, E\u2018 An execution,\u201d it was said in Corbin v. Pearce, 81 Ill. 461, \u201c has no legal effect as such after its return day; the writ, whether returned by the officer or held in his hands, has no vitality whatever.\u201d The 13th section before quoted provided a way by which the appellee might have become entitled to share pro rata with the appellant in the proceeds of the sale of the land but it failed to avail itself of it. The appellant was entitled to the advantage awarded by the law to the diligent and it was error to deprive him of it. No other question is presented by the record. The order and judgment of the Circuit Court is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceeding in conformity with the views expressed herein.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
