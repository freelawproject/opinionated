The note contained an agreement binding the makers thereof to pay a reasonable attorney fee if the note should be collected by suit. This clause was so framed that the .fee for the plaintiff\u2019s attorney could not be included in the judgment entered upon the note. Execution was issued upon the judgment and delivered to the sheriff. The attorney for the plaintiff in the action which resulted in the judgment (who is also one of the attorneys for the appellant company in this court), prepared and delivered to the sheriff a letter addressed to the defendants in the judgment advising them that a clause in the note provided for the payment by them of a reasonable attorney fee which was not included in the judgment, and unless they would pay the fee to the sheriff when he called upon them with the execution, that suit to recover it would at once be instituted, and further that the sum of $200 would be accepted in full of such attorney\u2019s fees.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b584-6\" pgmap=\"584\">The appellee paid to the sheriff the sum of $258.70 which was one seventeenth part of the judgment and also one seventeenth part'of the sum of $200 demanded as the fee of an attorney, provided for by the note but not included in the judgment. The suit at bar was an action of assumpsit \u2022brought by the appellee against the appellant company to recover the said sum so paid as its surety.

An account was attached to and filed with the declaration in ampi\u00f3 time, but it was not such a detailed and itemized statement of the plaintiff\u2019s claim as we think the appellant was entitled to demand. We regard it, however, as so far an attempt, in good faith, to comply with the requirement of the \u201c Practice Act \u201d as to furnish the basis for amendment whereby a continuance might be avoided. A cross-motion for leave to amend was entered but subsequently withdrawn, whereupon the appellant, instead of abiding by the exception to the action of the court in overruling its motion for a continuance, moved the court to require the appellee to file a bill of particulars. The court granted this motion and the appellee filed a detailed statement of his claim. The appellant then renewed its motion to continue the case on the ground that the bill of particulars or account had not been filed ten days before the beginning of the term. This the court overruled and the appellant saved the exception thereto. The purpose of the requirement of the \u201c Practice Act \u201d was fully subserved by the bill of particulars, which the court at the request of the appellant company required the appellee to place on file, unless it was taken by surprise by the demand as set forth in detail. It made no complaint of that character, but on the contrary, filed a plea of the general issue and proceeded to the trial upon its merits.</p> <p id=\"b585-7\" pgmap=\"585(55) 586(155)\">The action of the appellant company in asking the aid of the court to force the appellee to file a proper account and in thereafter pleading to the merits and entering upon the trial of the case is consistent only with the view that it had abandoned its motion for a continuance of the cause and its exception to the action of the court thereon and elected to submit the case for determination at that term. It can not be allowed in this court to shift its position. It is next complained that the evidence was insufficient to support the judgment in this, that it was not proven that the amount paid for the fees of the attorney was reasonable. The proof upon the point was that the appellee paid a sum charged and demanded by the attorney and counselor at law who rendered the service. When it is necessary to establish the value of the services of an attorney a proper inquiry is what sum is usually charged by members of the bar for like services. Reynolds v. McMillan, 63 Ill. 46. The evidence produced was pertinent to this inquiry. It tended, however slightly, to show that, the amount paid was such as attorneys charged for such services.</p> <p id=\"A9W\" pgmap=\"586\">No specific objection to its admissibility was preferred and no proof was offered tending to overcome it. A general objection was entered, but it does not appear from the record that the precise point sought to be urged in this court was disclosed in the lower court or ruled upon by the judge thereof either when passing upon the objection or the motion for a new trial. Had proper objection been made so that the court and counsel could have known the ground thereof, no doubt such action would have been taken as to have removed all just cause of complaint. It is not permissible to so frame an objection that it will serve to save an exception for the action of a court of review and yet conceal the real complaint from the trial court. It is not contended and was not in the trial court that the amount was unreasonable. The judgment is right upon the merits and there is no error in the record demanding its reversal. It is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
