L. c. 211, \u00a7 3 (1988 ed.), and for relief in the nature of certiorari. G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4 (1988 ed.). The father had requested that the single justice invoke the general superintendence powers of this court to set aside an order of the Malden Division of the District Court Department which granted temporary custody of six of the father\u2019s children to the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">In August, 1988, the department received a report pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51 A,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which alleged that the eight children, who were living with their father at that time, were being neglected. The report alleged unsanitary living and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>housing conditions at the father\u2019s home. In response to the report, the department undertook an investigation of the allegation of neglect. A department social worker determined that the father\u2019s house was not clean and that there was a shortage of sufficient sleeping quarters for the children. The department began working with the father to improve the children\u2019s living conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Shortly thereafter, the department received a new \u00a7 51A report regarding the children. This report contained allegations that the children lacked adequate supervision and that some of the children had ingested alcohol. The department also received a report which alleged that the oldest child had engaged in sexual misconduct with one of the younger children.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">On December 22, 1988, DSS filed a petition pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 24 (1988 ed.), with the Malden District Court, alleging that the eight children were in need of care and protection.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 24, a judge of the District Court held an emergency hearing on the \u00a7 24 petition that same day. The judge determined that, based on the factual allegations contained in the \u00a7 51A reports described above, \u201cthere is reasonable cause to believe that the children are in immediate danger of serious harm by neglect, and that immediate removal of the children from the parents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>at this time for 72 hours [is] necessary.\u201d The judge\u2019s conclusion did not apply to the oldest child, who was sixteen years old at the time of the hearing. The judge awarded the department temporary custody of the seven younger children. This custody was to continue until further hearings would be held on December 27, 1988, to determine whether custody of the seven children should remain with the department.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">The second hearing, commonly referred to as a \u201cseventy-two hour hearing,\u201d was held on December 27, 1988, and January 3, 1989. Another judge of the District Court allowed the introduction of fifteen exhibits and heard the testimony of seven witnesses. On the basis of this presentation, the judge made the following findings. The father\u2019s house was not kept clean and lacked sufficient sleeping quarters for the children. Seven of the children were sleeping in two bunk beds. Three of the children had been found asleep on one level of one bunk bed, while another had been found sleeping on a living room chair. There was no privacy barrier between the female children and the sixteen year old male child, as to whom there had been allegations of sexual misconduct with a younger female child. Supervision of the younger children was left to the other children for the majority of the time. All of the children had serious tardiness and absenteeism problems at school, and one child had emotional problems and was in need of counseling and inpatient evaluation. This same child had claimed that she was forced to drink alcohol, and suffered an injury whose cause was unknown but whose existence had been corroborated by her school teacher. The father had a drinking problem and admitted that he was \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by having to care for eight children. The judge determined that these findings demonstrated \u201creasonable cause to believe that the children are in immediate danger of serious neglect and that immediate removal of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>children is necessary to protect them from such neglect.\u201d The judge ordered the department to retain custody of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">On February 3, 1989, the father filed his complaint with the single justice seeking relief from the judge\u2019s order. In his complaint, the father claimed that the judge\u2019s findings did not provide \u201creasonable cause\u201d to believe that the children were in \u201cimmediate danger of serious neglect.\u201d The father also claimed that the judge\u2019s application of a \u201creasonable cause\u201d standard of proof to the seventy-two hour hearing was erroneous because both the Federal, and State Constitutions require the application of a \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard to a proceeding which can result in a parent\u2019s loss of custody of a child. Finally, the father claimed that the custody decision should be reversed because the judge failed to make certain findings required by G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 29C (1988 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">On February 14, 1989, the single justice denied the father relief. On March 2, 1989, the father filed a notice of appeal to the full court from the decision of the single justice.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">1. <em>The standard of proof. </em>The father claims that the due process protections of the Constitutions of both the United States and the Commonwealth require the application of a \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard of proof to a seventy-two hour hearing. Therefore, he argues, the judge\u2019s application of a \u201creasonable cause\u201d standard of proof to the seventy-two hour hearing in this case was error and requires reversal of the judge\u2019s decision to maintain custody of the children with the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>We begin our discussion with an examination of the language of G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 24, to determine which standard of proof, if any, the Legislature intended to be applied to a seventy-two hour hearing. General Laws c. 119, \u00a7 24, provides a three-part process by which a court may transfer custody of a child from that child\u2019s parent to DSS. Section 24 states that on the petition of any person alleging that a child is without: \u201c(a) necessary and proper physical or educational care and discipline; or (6) is growing up under conditions or circumstances damaging to the child\u2019s sound character development; or (c) who lacks proper attention of parent, guardian with care and custody, or custodian; or <em>(d) </em>whose parents, guardian or custodian are unwilling, incompetent or unavailable to provide any such care,\u201d the court shall issue a notice to the department and summonses to the child\u2019s parents, and hold a hearing allowing for a presentation of facts as to the condition of the child. Due to the need for expedition in this type of proceeding, the emergency hearing, much like a hearing for a temporary restraining order, may be held ex parte. See, e.g., G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 4 (1988 ed.). If, after this hearing, the court determines that there is \u201creasonable cause to believe that the child is suffering from serious abuse or neglect, or is in immediate danger of serious abuse or neglect, and that immediate removal of the child is necessary to protect the child from serious abuse or neglect, the court may issue an emergency order transferring custody of a child under this section to the department or to a licensed child care agency or individual described in clause (2) of section twenty-six.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Prior to the expiration of seventy-two hours from the time of the transfer of custody, the court must hold a second hearing, the \u201cseventy-two hour hearing,\u201d to \u201cdetermine whether such temporary custody should continue until a hearing on the merits of the petition for care and protection [the third hearing] is concluded before [the] court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Prior to the care and protection hearing, the court must order a qualified person to investigate the child\u2019s situation. G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 24. The Commentary to Standard 4:02 of the Standards of Judicial Practice of the District Court Depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>ment of the Trial Court: Care and Protection Proceedings (1980), identifies four to six weeks as an appropriate amount of time in which to complete such an investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Section 24 is explicit in its provision of a \u201creasonable cause\u201d standard of proof for the initial emergency hearing. The father does not challenge the adequacy of a \u201creasonable cause\u201d standard at this stage of the proceedings. Furthermore, while \u00a7 24 is silent as to the standard of proof to be applied to the hearing on the merits of the petition for care and protection (the third part of the process), it has been held by this court that any decision in this third phase must be based on clear and convincing evidence. See <em>Care &amp; Protection of </em>Stephen, 401 Mass. 144, 150 (1987); <em>Custody of a Minor (No. 2), </em>392 Mass. 719, 725 (1984); <em>Custody of a Minor, </em>389 Mass. 755, 766-767 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Neither \u00a7 24 nor our previous decisions shed any light on the standard of proof which is to be applied to the seventy-two hour hearing. This court has held that where no standard of proof is provided for a proceeding which is required by statute, due process demands application of a standard appropriate to the \u201cparticular situation\u201d which is presented. <em>Andrews, petitioner, </em>368 Mass. 468, 486 (1975). \u201c\u2018The rights to conceive and to raise one\u2019s children\u2019 are \u2018essential . . . basic civil rights of man ... far more precious . . . than property rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>Department of Pub. Welfare </em>v. <em>J.K.B., </em>379 Mass. 1, 3 (1979), quoting <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>405 U.S. 645, 651 (1972). \u201c[The] loss of a child may be as onerous a penalty [to the parents] as the deprivation of the parents\u2019 freedom.\u201d <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, supra, </em>quoting <em>Custody of a Minor (No. 1), </em>377 Mass. 876, 884 (1979). Accordingly, before the State may deprive a parent of the custody of a child, \u201cthe requirements of due process must be met.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cMinimum due process varies with context.\u201d <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Gormley, </em>387 Mass. 258, 274 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">When making the determination as to what standard of proof is appropriate in a particular context, both this court and the United States Supreme Court have utilized the due process analysis contained in <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>319 (1976). See <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Gormley, supra </em>at 274-277; <em>Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745, 759-768 (1982). Mathews v. <em>Eldridge, supra </em>at 335, identified three distinct factors whose consideration was required by \u201cthe specific dictates of due process\u201d: (1) \u201cthe private interest that will be affected by the official action\u201d; (2) \u201cthe risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards\u201d; and (3) \u201cthe Government\u2019s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barboza, </em>387 Mass. 105, 112, cert, denied, 459 U.S. 1020 (1982) (\u201cIn determining what process is due [under the State Constitution] we have stated that this court \u2018must balance the interests of the individual affected, the risk of erroneous deprivation of those interests and the government\u2019s interest in the efficient and economic administration of its affairs\u2019 \u201d), quoting <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>386 Mass. 811, 817 (1982). We examine each of these three factors to determine whether the judge\u2019s decision to apply a \u201creasonable cause\u201d standard of proof to the seventy-two hour hearing met the requirements of due process, and if not, what standard of proof should be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">a. <em>The private interests. </em>A seventy-two hour hearing implicates at least three significant private interests. Most obviously, the hearing implicates the interest of parents in their relationship with their children. And, as a necessary corollary to the parents\u2019 interest in their relationship with their child, a child\u2019s interest in the relationship with his or her family is also implicated in a seventy-two hour hearing. See <em>Petition of the Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>383 Mass. 573, 588 (1981) (\u201cthere exists a \u2018substantial and impressive consensus\u2019 among experts in the field of child development that \u2018disruption of the parent child relationship carries significant risks\u2019 for the child\u201d). Finally, because a seventy-two hour hearing occurs only after \u201creasonable cause\u201d has been found to believe that immediate re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>moval of a child from his or her parents is necessary to protect the child from \u201cserious abuse or neglect,\u201d a seventy-two hour hearing implicates the child\u2019s right to be free from abusive or neglectful behavior. We must consider the significance of each of these three interests in relation to the appropriate standard of proof to apply to a seventy-two hour hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">\u201cThe interest of parents in their relationship with their children has been deemed fundamental, and is constitutionally protected.\u201d <em>Department of Pub. Welfare </em>v. <em>J.K.B., supra </em>at 3, and cases cited. See <em>Custody of Two Minors, </em>396 Mass. 610, 617 (1986). However, notwithstanding the precious character of a parent\u2019s relationship with his or her children, the parent\u2019s interest is not immune from State intervention. \u201c[T]he right of parents to be free from intrusion by the State in matters of childrearing is not absolute.\u201d <em>Petition of the Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, supra </em>at 587. If a person is found to be an unfit parent, the State need not suffer custody of a neglected or abused child to remain with that person. \u201cThe State as parens patriae may act to protect minor children from serious physical or emotional harm. In some instances this may require a partial or complete severance of the parent-child relationship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 587-588.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">A seventy-two hour hearing may, at most, deprive a parent of the custody of his or her child only temporarily. By this statement, we do not intend to belittle the anguish which can accompany even the shortest removal of a child from a parent\u2019s custody. Nevertheless, for purposes of due process analysis, a significant consideration is \u201cthe permanency of the threatened loss.\u201d <em>Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer, supra </em>at 758. A decision to continue the removal of a child, pursuant to a seventy-two hour hearing, is reversible; parental custody is not irretrievably lost. Compare <em>id. </em>at 759. The fact that a parent has a less significant interest in a reversible, temporary deprivation of a child\u2019s custody than where a permanent deprivation of custody is at issue indicates that a standard of proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>less demanding than the \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard proposed by the father may be appropriate.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">The other interests involved in a seventy-two hour hearing are the child\u2019s interests in the integrity of the family and in freedom from abusive or neglectful behavior on the part of the child\u2019s parents. In the context of a seventy-two hour hearing, these two interests become so intertwined as to be almost inseparable; the extent of a child\u2019s interest in the integrity of the family will fluctuate extensively according to the risk of abuse offered the child by his or her parents. \u201c \u2018At common law it was presumed that a child\u2019s welfare is best served in the care and custody of its parents\u2019, . . . but that is not the case if the parents \u2018have grievous shortcomings or handicaps that would put the child\u2019s welfare in the family milieu much at hazard\u2019 . . . .\u201d <em>Custody of a Minor, </em>389 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>Mass. 755, 766 (1983), quoting <em>Petition of the Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, supra </em>at 590. See G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 1 (1988 ed.) (\u201cIt is hereby declared to be the policy of this commonwealth to direct its efforts, first, to the strengthening and encouragement of family life for the protection and care of children .... The purpose of this chapter is to insure that the children of the commonwealth are protected against the harmful effects resulting from the absence, inability, inadequacy or destructive behavior of parents . . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">A child\u2019s interest in the integrity of his or her family, much like the equivalent interest of the parent, is not absolute. The strength of this interest must be weighed in light of the ability or willingness of the parent to further the best interests of the child, or at least to refrain from engaging in behavior which is detrimental to the child\u2019s welfare. The child\u2019s interest in freedom from abusive or neglectful behavior, however, is absolute. In no situation may a child be legitimately subjected to abusive or neglectful conditions. Accordingly, in the context of a seventy-two hour hearing, where no permanent separation of a child from his or her parents is threatened, the child\u2019s interest in freedom from abuse and neglect takes precedence over the child\u2019s interest in family integrity. Because a seventy-two hour hearing is predicated on a determination that \u201creasonable cause\u201d exists to believe a child is suffering, or is in danger of suffering, \u201cserious abuse or neglect,\u201d and because the child\u2019s interest in freedom from neglect or abuse is absolute, a standard of proof which is less demanding than \u201cclear and convincing evidence,\u201d and thereby affords more protection to the child\u2019s safety interest, appears warranted in a seventy-two hour hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">b. <em>Risk of error. </em>The second factor we must consider is the risk of an erroneous deprivation of the private interests involved in the proceedings and the probable value of additional procedural safeguards. <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 335 (1976). If the risk of an erroneous deprivation is high, and additional procedural safeguards such as a more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>demanding standard of proof would be effective in lessening that risk, then the due process balance becomes weighted toward the adoption of a more stringent standard of proof. See <em>Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer, supra </em>at 764-766.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The judge below concluded that G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 24, required the application of a \u201creasonable cause\u201d standard of proof to the seventy-two hour hearing. Unfortunately, c. 119 does not provide any definition of \u201creasonable cause\u201d or any guidelines for its application. However, \u201creasonable cause\u201d is utilized as a standard in other parts of c. 119. From the context of these other uses, it appears that the Legislature intended \u201creasonable cause\u201d to serve a threshold function, thereby implying a relatively low degree of accuracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">For example, in \u00a7 51A of c. 119, medical workers, teachers and child care personnel are required to file a report with DSS if they \u201chave reasonable cause to believe that a child under the age of eighteen years is suffering serious physical or emotional injury resulting from abuse . . . or . . . neglect.\u201d See <em>Parents of Two Minors </em>v. <em>Bristol Div. of the Juvenile Court Dep\u2019t, </em>397 Mass. 846, 851 (1986). This \u201creasonable cause\u201d standard must be applied even though no courts or agencies of the Commonwealth are involved in the examination and analysis of the relevant facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">In the context of \u00a7 51 A, \u201c \u2018reasonable cause to believe\u2019 has been interpreted to mean \u2018known or suspected instances of child abuse and neglect.\u2019 \u201d <em>April K. </em>v. <em>Boston Children's Serv. Ass\u2019n, </em>581 F. Supp. 711, 713 (D. Mass. 1984), quoting Rep. A.G. Pub. Doc. No. 12, at 157 (June 16, 1975). See <em>Mattingly </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 452, 456 (1987). Therefore, a presentation of facts which create a suspicion of child abuse is sufficient to trigger the requirements of \u00a7 51 A. On the receipt of a report pursuant to \u00a7 51 A, DSS must undertake its own investigation of the situation to determine whether further action is warranted. G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51B (1988 ed.). \u201cReasonable cause,\u201d as it is used in \u00a7 51A, clearly serves a threshold function.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">A \u201creasonable cause\u201d standard is also utilized in a preliminary fashion in G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 5IB. Ordinarily, under \u00a7 5IB, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>the department must commence an investigation within two working days of its receipt of a \u00a7 51A report and complete the investigation within ten calendar days. G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 5IB (1). However, \u201cif the department has reasonable cause to believe the child\u2019s health or safety is in immediate danger from further abuse and neglect,\u201d the department must begin its investigation within two hours of the receipt of the report and must complete the investigation within twenty-four hours. <em>Id. </em>Clearly, the Legislature\u2019s allowance of two hours from the time of receipt of a \u00a7 51A report, within which the department must determine whether \u201creasonable cause\u201d exists, exemplifies an intention on the part of the Legislature that \u201creasonable cause\u201d not be understood in an overly technical fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">\u201c[I]n the absence of a plain contrary indication, a word used in one part of a statute in a definite sense should be given the same meaning in another part of the same statute.\u201d <em>Plymouth County Nuclear Information Comm. </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Council, </em>374 Mass. 236, 240 (1978). In line with this rule of statutory construction, we must assume that the Legislature intended the phrase \u201creasonable cause\u201d to be used throughout c. 119 in the same manner as it is used in \u00a7\u00a7 51A and 5IB; that is, as a threshold determination. Our conclusion on this point finds support in the fact that the only other explicit mandate of a \u201creasonable cause\u201d standard in c. 119 is for the initial emergency hearing authorized by \u00a7 24. The emergency hearing cannot long stand of its own accord; the determination made at the emergency hearing must be accepted or rejected within three days at the seventy-two hour hearing. G. L. 119, \u00a7 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">A threshold determination such as that presented by the initial emergency hearing under \u00a7 24 necessarily anticipates that further proceedings regarding the particular situation will be held. Any errors which arise in the initial hearing can be discovered and corrected in subsequent proceedings, such as the seventy-two hour hearing and the hearing on the merits of the care and protection petition. The initial hearing, in the interest of expediency, need not and most likely cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>be so exhaustive in its examination of the facts as are subsequent proceedings. Therefore, it is inevitable that a threshold determination is more likely to be erroneous than an intermediate or final determination which utilizes a more rigorous review process.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">The judge below, by applying the threshold standard of \u201creasonable cause\u201d to the seventy-two hour hearing, created a greater risk of an erroneous deprivation of custody than would have been present in the face of the \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard which applies to a proceeding on the merits of a care and protection petition. Accordingly, in line with the second factor of the <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge </em>due process analysis, we must conclude that a \u201creasonable cause\u201d standard creates a not insubstantial risk of an erroneous deprivation of the private interests involved in a seventy-two hour hearing, and that the application of a more demanding standard would serve to lessen the risk of error.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">c. <em>State interest. </em>Finally, we must examine the additional factor of the Commonwealth\u2019s interest in a seventy-two hour hearing, including the burdens that a more demanding standard of proof would create for the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth, as parens patriae, has a strong interest in the welfare of the children of the Commonwealth. See <em>Lassiter </em>v. <em>Department of Social Servs. of Durham County, N.C., </em>452 U.S. 18, 27 (1981) (\u201cthe State has an urgent interest in the welfare of [a] child\u201d); <em>Petition of the Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>383 Mass. 573, 587 (1981) (\u201cThe State as parens patriae may act to protect minor children from serious physical or emotional harm\u201d). \u201cBecause the interest of [a] child is thought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>to be best served in the stable, continuous environment of his own family, . . . State intervention in the parent-child relationship is justified only when parents appear unable to provide for their children\u2019s care and protection.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Custody of a Minor (No. 1), </em>377 Mass. 876, 882 (1979). The Commonwealth\u2019s interest, therefore, extends initially to the maintenance of a stable family environment and, if this is not present, to the provision of adequate care and protection for the child. We note that these interests of the Commonwealth are in direct alignment with the interests of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">The administrative burden presented to the Commonwealth by a requirement of a more stringent standard of proof in a seventy-two hour hearing would not be unreasonable. We trust that in the three days preceding a seventy-two hour hearing, the department would exert equal effort to discover relevant facts regarding a child\u2019s condition regardless of the standard by which the relevant facts will be evaluated by the court. However, the Commonwealth\u2019s interest in the welfare of the child might suffer unnecessarily if too high a standard of proof were required. For example, in <em>Custody of a Minor (No. 1), supra </em>at 885, we stated that, \u201cif we were, for the sake of simplicity, to adopt a \u2018[beyond a] reasonable doubt\u2019 test in cases involving parental neglect, we fear that we might overly jeopardize the welfare of the child.\u201d Therefore, consideration of the Commonwealth\u2019s interests shows that the adoption of a very rigorous standard of proof in a seventy-two hour hearing might put at serious risk the Commonwealth\u2019s and the child\u2019s interests in protecting children from abusive or neglectful parents. In light of this fact, an intermediate standard of review appears more appropriate to the circumstances of a seventy-two hour hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">d. <em>Standard of proof required by due process. </em>\u201c[A] standard of proof represents an attempt to instruct the factfinder concerning the degree of confidence our society thinks he should have in the correctness of factual conclusions for a particular type of adjudication. Although the phrases [used to describe a standard of proof] are quantitatively imprecise, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>they do communicate to the finder of fact different notions concerning the degree of confidence he is expected to have in the correctness of his factual conclusions.\u201d <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 370 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nassar, </em>380 Mass. 908, 916 n.11 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">As we have noted, all the parties involved in a seventy-two hour hearing, including the parent, the child and the State, have a strong interest in maintaining the constitutionally protected interest of familial integrity. Seventy-two hour hearings can often result in the removal of custody from parents for periods exceeding one year. See note 5, <em>supra. </em>The impact of such a separation between a parent and child, while theoretically a temporary separation pending a care and protection proceeding on the merits, cannot be dismissed lightly. In the circumstances of this case, the judge\u2019s determination that \u201creasonable cause\u201d existed to believe that a child was in danger of abuse or neglect leaves it unclear whether the judge had a sufficient degree of certainty in his decision to warrant such a potentially devastating interference in a family\u2019s existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">A requirement that a \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard of proof be applied to a seventy-two hour hearing, however, would fail to recognize the abbreviated nature of a seventy-two hour hearing, and would provide insufficient protection to the child\u2019s interest in freedom from abuse or neglect. That a child\u2019s interest in safety might conflict with the interest in remaining under the care of his or her parents is indeed a tragedy, but it is a fact we may not choose to ignore. To require the presentation of \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d of child abuse or neglect in a seventy-two hour hearing held only three days after the decision to transfer custody is made would be to put a child at significant risk of being erroneously returned to abusive or neglectful parents. Such a standard of proof would be inconsistent with the Legislature\u2019s intention that a determination reached at a seventy-two hour hearing would serve an intermediary function between an emergency determination and the more permanent decision reached at a care and protection proceeding, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>which must meet the \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard. See <em>Care &amp; Protection of Stephen, </em>401 Mass. 144, 150 (1987). A less demanding standard of proof is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Accordingly, we hold today that a decision to maintain a removal from parental custody reached at a seventy-two hour hearing held pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 24, must meet the intermediate standard of a \u201cfair preponderance of the evidence.\u201d See <em>In re Juvenile Appeal, </em>189 Conn. 276, 300 (1983). It is our view that this standard of proof provides sufficient consideration for the interests of all those involved in a seventy-two hour hearing, and protects those interests from erroneous deprivation to a degree consistent with the abbreviated nature of such a hearing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>id. </em>The judge\u2019s decision to apply a \u201creasonable cause\u201d standard of proof to the seventy-two hour hearing in this case was improper. A new seventy-two hour hearing determination must be made in the District Court, based on a \u201cfair preponderance of the evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">2. <em>Conclusion. </em>Our decision makes unnecessary at this stage of the proceedings any consideration of the father\u2019s other claims.

In this case the seventy-two hour limit was exceeded, apparently due to scheduling conflicts between the parties. The father does not challenge the failure to meet the seventy-two hour requirement of G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 24.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b70-8\">We granted the motion of the District Court to be designated a nominal party in this case. We also accepted separate briefs from: (1) the Attorney General\u2019s office on behalf of the Department of Social Services; (2) counsel for the third oldest child and the five youngest children, and; (3) counsel for the two oldest children. We acknowledge with appreciation the amicus briefs submitted by the Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, the Committee for Public Counsel Services and the Massachusetts Child Welfare League of America.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b75-6\">The father and several amici point to statistics gathered by amicus Committee for Public Counsel Services which suggest that it often takes over one year to adjudicate the merits of a care and protection case in which custody has been taken from the parents. Committee for Public Counsel Services Family Law Advocacy Project Annual Report, August 1, 1988 - July 31, 1989, at 17. Furthermore, they direct our attention to cases in which this court has examined care and protection proceedings which resulted in a grant of temporary, rather than permanent, custody to the department. See <em>Care &amp; Protection of Stephen, </em>401 Mass. 144, 145, 154 (1987) (pursuant to a care and protection proceeding judge grants the department permanent custody of two children and temporary custody of two other children).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">They argue that, because a seventy-two hour hearing can result in the deprivation of custody of a child for over one year, and because care and protection proceedings may result in a grant of only temporary custody, the impact of a seventy-two hour hearing and a care and protection proceeding may not be materially different. Therefore, they suggest, this court should apply the same \u201cclear and convincing evidence\" standard of proof to seventy-two hour hearings as is required for care and protection proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">While we are aware of the lengthy delays that often occur in care and protection proceedings, the fact that a parent may be deprived of the custody of his or her child for over one year due to a seventy-two hour hearing does not negate the fact that a permanent deprivation of custody can never occur as the result of a seventy-two hour hearing. In the third phase of a care and protection proceeding, however, the possibility of a permanent deprivation of custody cannot be ruled out. We find this distinction to be significant in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b79-7\">The department argues that application of a less demanding standard of proof such as \u201creasonable cause\u201d serves to lessen the risk of an erroneous deprivation of the child\u2019s interest in freedom from abuse or neglect because any risk of error will tend to lead to the temporary award of custody to the department, where the child\u2019s safety will be protected. This argument ignores the fact that, given the same set of facts, a more rigorous standard of proof is more likely to produce an accurate conclusion than a less rigorous standard. This argument also ignores completely the child\u2019s interest in the integrity of his or her family.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b82-7\">We consider a seventy-two hour hearing to be analogous to the hearing accorded a request for a preliminary injunction. In both cases, parties are seeking a temporary, but significant, stabilization of the factual situation at issue. At a preliminary injunction hearing, \u201cthe task for the motion judge is to balance the risk of irreparable harm to the plaintiff and the defendant \u2018in light of [each] party\u2019s chance of success on the merits.\u2019 \u201d <em>Planned Parenthood League of Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Operation Rescue, </em>406 Mass. 701, 710 (1990), quoting <em>Packaging Indus. Group </em>v. <em>Cheney, </em>380 Mass. 609, 617 (1980). The standard of proof we require today at seventy-two hour hearings serves essentially the same function as the standard applied at a hearing for a preliminary injunction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b82-14\">The judge need only consider the evidence presented at the previous seventy-two hour hearing in light of a \u201cfair preponderance of the evidence\u201d standard of proof. He need not accept new evidence except in his sound discretion. If a final hearing has occurred and has resulted in a determination by clear and convincing evidence that the custody of the children should be given to the department (or another) the need for another hearing may be moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
