We affirmed the convictions after plenary review under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGrath, </em>358 Mass. 314 (1970).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 1980, the defendant filed a pro se motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>a new trial, see Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (b), 378 Mass. 900 (1979), and a motion for appointment of counsel. After the appointment of counsel, the defendant filed an amended motion for a new trial in November, 1980. A judge of the Superior Court denied the motion and, in 1982, a single justice of this court denied the defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal the denial of the motion. In 1986, the defendant, pro se, filed a second motion for a new trial, which was denied. In 1988, the defendant, again pro se, filed a third motion for a new trial, which was denied. Counsel was appointed for the defendant. Counsel filed a memorandum of law in support of the petition for leave to appeal the denial of the third motion for a new trial. On June 19, 1989, a single justice of this court granted the defendant leave to appeal the denial of the third motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">The facts of the case are contained in this court\u2019s opinion in <em>McGrath, supra. </em>On appeal of the denial of the motion for a new trial, the defendant argues that several aspects of the trial judge\u2019s instructions to the jury were in error. We affirm the denial of the defendant\u2019s third motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The defendant\u2019s principal argument is that the trial judge erred in failing to instruct the jury that they could consider evidence of the defendant\u2019s intoxication at the time of the crime in deciding whether the defendant had the necessary specific intent to commit armed assault with intent to rob, the felony underlying the felony-murder conviction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Henson, </em>394 Mass. 584, 592-594 (1985). In <em>Henson, </em>we announced the rule that \u201cwhere proof of a crime requires proof of a specific criminal intent and there is evidence tending to show that the defendant was under the influence of alcohol or some other drug at the time of the crime, the judge should instruct the jury, if requested, that they may consider evidence of the defendant\u2019s intoxication at the time of the crime in deciding whether the Commonwealth has proved that specific intent beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 593. The defendant argues that this rule in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number><em>Henson </em>should be applied to his case retroactively on collateral review. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bray, </em>407 Mass. 296 (1990), we determined that, on collateral review, we would give a new rule such as the one announced in Henson<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> retroactive application only in limited circumstances: (1) if the new rule places \u201ccertain kinds of primary, private individual conduct beyond the power of the criminal law ... to proscribe\u201d or (2) if failure to follow the new rule would \u201cundermine the fundamental fairness that must underlie a conviction or seriously diminish the likelihood of obtaining an accurate conviction.\u201d <em>Bray, supra </em>at 300, 303, quoting <em>Teague </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 311 (1989). Clearly, the first circumstance is not present in this case. As far as the second is concerned, \u201cthe new rule, whether constitutionally based or not, must be \u2018central to an accurate determination of innocence or guilt. . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>Bray, supra </em>at 303, quoting <em>Teague, supra </em>at 313. In <em>Bray, supra, </em>we held that we would not give retroactive application to the rule that a jury may consider a defendant\u2019s mental impairment as one factor bearing on the element of malice in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>crime of murder, because that rule was not central to an accurate determination of the defendant\u2019s innocence or guilt. The <em>Henson </em>rule on voluntary intoxication is no more' \u201ccentral to an accurate determination\u201d than was the closely related rule under consideration in <em>Bray. </em>Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant is not entitled to the benefit of retroactive application of the <em>Henson </em>rule concerning voluntary intoxication.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b259-15\">The codefendant McGrath is not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b261-6\"><em>Henson </em>announced two rules: (1) that the crime of assault with intent to murder is a specific intent crime, i.e., one that requires proof of a specific intent to kill and (2) that voluntary intoxication may be taken into account in determining whether the Commonwealth has proved the requisite specific intent. See <em>id. </em>at 590-592 and 592-594. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ennis, </em>398 Mass. 170, 175 (1986), we determined that the first rule concerning assault with intent to murder was not a new rule; rather, it was \u201csimply the cumulative result of the common law concerning the offense [of assault with intent to kill].\u2019\u2019 Thus, we concluded that <em>Henson </em>was, in that respect, \u201cfully retroactive.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">The second rule announced in <em>Henson, </em>the one at issue in this case, clearly was a new rule. For purposes of retroactivity analysis, \u201ca case announces a new rule if the result was not <em>dictated </em>by precedent existing <em>at the time the defendant\u2019s conviction became final.'\u201d </em>(Latter portion of emphasis supplied.) <em>Teague </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 301 (1989), quoted in part in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bray, </em>407 Mass. 296, 303 (1990). Although in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shine, </em>398 Mass. 641, 655 (1986), we held that <em>Henson </em>was foreshadowed by earlier decisions beginning in the late 1970\u2019s, none of these decisions was in effect at the time of the defendant\u2019s trial. Certainly none of our decisions in effect at the time of the defendant\u2019s trial <em>dictated </em>the result in <em>Henson.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b262-6\">In 1980, after appointment of counsel, the defendant filed an amended motion for new trial based on the trial judge\u2019s use in the charge of analogies to important decisions in the jurors\u2019 daily lives. This motion was denied on the ground that the judge\u2019s use of examples was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Grace, 381 Mass. 753, 760 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>379 Mass. 422 (1980). A single justice denied leave to appeal. Denials of leave to appeal are final and unreviewable. See <em>Leaster </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>385 Mass. 547 (1982). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeChristoforo, </em>371 Mass. 26, 33 (1976). Because the law on this issue already was settled by the time the defendant filed his amended motion for new trial, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferreira, </em>373 Mass. 116, 129-130 (1977), the denial of leave to appeal precludes review of those issues again. Last, in his 1980 motion, the defendant failed to raise the issue of the judge\u2019s use of \u201cfinding\u201d language in the jury instructions, although we had ruled on that issue prior to the filing of the defendant\u2019s motion and amended motion. See <em>Connolly </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>377 Mass. 527 (1979). Thus, the defendant failed to \u201craise all known and available claims of error at the earliest possible time,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lowe, </em>405 Mass. 1104, 1104-1105 (1989), and therefore that issue is not properly before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
