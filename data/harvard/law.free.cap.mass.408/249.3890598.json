Tart, appeals from his conviction by a jury for landing raw fish in the Commonwealth for the purpose of sale without a State commercial fisherman permit. G. L. c. 130, \u00a7 80 (1988 ed.) The defendant asserts various claims of error, each of which we address below. We affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">The jury would have been warranted in finding the following facts. On November 18, 1986, Michael Arena, a member of the law enforcement division (environmental police) of the Department of Fisheries, Wildlife, and Environmental Law Enforcement (department), was on patrol on the waterfront in Gloucester with Special Agent Rapolios of the National Fishery Service. Arena\u2019s patrol responsibilities included determining whether commercial fishing vessels were licensed properly, that a vessel\u2019s catch was within legal size limits, and that a vessel\u2019s nets were of the proper size. Arena observed a commercial fishing vessel, the \u201cJeromi,\u201d unloading fish at the dock of the J.B. Wright Fish Company; he approached the vessel to conduct a fishing permit check and asked to speak with the captain. The defendant identified himself as the captain, whereupon Arena and Rapolios identified themselves, explained the purpose of their visit, and requested permission to come aboard. The defendant invited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>them on the Jeromi. Rapolios asked to see the defendant\u2019s Federal fishing permit, which the defendant produced. Arena then asked the defendant to produce his State fishing permit. The defendant replied that he \u201cdidn\u2019t have one and that he didn\u2019t need one\u201d; he added that he \u201cknew the law.\u201d Arena then advised the defendant that State law required him to have a State permit to land raw fish, and informed the defendant that he would \u201chave to take a Complaint out with the Court.\u201d Arena then seized the approximately 5,000 pounds of fish held on the Jeromi.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Five days later, on November 23, 1986, Arena was again patrolling the Gloucester docks, this time accompanied by Officer Ramsey of the environmental police and Officer Carracho of the Gloucester police department, when he saw fish being unloaded from the Jeromi at the J.B. Wright Fish Company. Arena approached to determine whether the defendant had obtained a State fishing permit since the previous encounter. In response to Arena\u2019s request, the defendant told Arena that he did not have a State fishing permit. Arena arrested the defendant and seized the fish on the Jeromi. The defendant\u2019s case was set for a jury trial in Salem District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Prior to trial, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the complaint against him and a motion to suppress the statements made by him. In support of his motions, the defendant filed memoranda of law claiming that the requirement of a State fishing permit under G. L. c. 130, \u00a7 80, is preempted by Federal law, and that the defendant\u2019s statements to Officer Arena on November 23, 1986, were obtained in violation of rights guaranteed under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States and art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. Both of the defendant\u2019s motions were denied. The case proceeded to trial on January 19 and 20, 1988. The jury found the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>guilty of violating G. L. c. 130, \u00a7 80, and he was sentenced to thirty days in a house of correction with seven days to be served and the balance suspended for one year, and a fine of $50.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">The defendant filed a notice of appeal on January 20, 1988. A single justice of the Appeals Court granted the defendant a stay of the execution of the sentence pending the resolution of the defendant\u2019s appeal. We took the case on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The defendant claims that the motion judge erred in denying his motion to suppress because the evidence obtained from the November 23, 1986, encounter between the defendant and Officer Arena was obtained as the result of an unjustified warrantless search conducted on November 18, 1986. The defendant also argues that the defendant\u2019s statements to Officer Arena on November 23, 1986, should have been suppressed because Arena did not inform the defendant of his rights under <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 477-478 (1966), prior to asking the defendant whether he had obtained a State fishing permit. The defendant contends further that his- motion to dismiss should have been granted because the requirement of a State fishing permit under G. L. c. 130, \u00a7 80, is preempted by Federal law. The defendant claims that his motion for a required finding of not guilty was denied erroneously because the evidence presented was insufficient to demonstrate a violation of G. L. c. 130, \u00a7 80. The defendant also argues that various errors in the trial judge\u2019s instructions to the jury require a reversal of his conviction. Finally, the defendant argues that, in the circumstances of this case, his sentence should be vacated as improper and as cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">1. <em>Motion to suppress, </em>a. <em>Warrantless search. </em>The defendant claims that Arena\u2019s visit to the Jeromi and his inquiry of the defendant on November 18, 1986, constituted an impermissible warrantless search in violation of the Fourth Amendment and art. 14. He argues that Officer Arena had no right to conduct a search of the Jeromi on that date be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>cause Arena had no reasonable cause to believe that any illegal activity was occurring or had occurred, and lacked any statutory authority to conduct a search in such circumstances. The Commonwealth responds, in part, that no Fourth Amendment or art. 14 concerns were implicated by Arena\u2019s visit on November 18, 1986, because Arena came aboard the Jeromi with the defendant\u2019s consent. The motion judge made no finding on the issue of consent. Thus, without deciding whether the defendant\u2019s acquiescence to Arena\u2019s request to come aboard the Jeromi on November 18, 1986, constituted consent sufficient to alleviate any Fourth Amendment or art. 14 concerns, we conclude that Arena\u2019s visit to the Jeromi was a permissible administrative search for which no warrant was required. As such, Arena\u2019s inquiry of the defendant on November 18, 1986, did not violate the defendant\u2019s rights under either the Fourth Amendment or art. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eagleton, </em>402 Mass. 199 (1988), this court examined the requirements of the Fourth Amendment in the context of a warrantless administrative inspection of an automobile body shop. In that case, the defendant owner of the body shop refused to allow police officers to inspect his shop despite G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 67 (1986 ed.), which made it unlawful to hinder an inspection of an automobile body shop or to fail to produce on demand \u201call such motor vehicles, parts thereof, and books, papers and inventories relating [to the shop].\u201d The defendant was convicted of violating G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 67, and for storing inflammable fluids without a license in violation of G. L. c. 148, \u00a7 13 (1988 ed.). <em>Id. </em>at 200-201. Eagleton challenged his convictions on the ground that the police officers\u2019 attempt to conduct a warrantless inspection of his auto shop was a violation of the Fourth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 201-202. In response, this court applied the analysis of the United States Supreme Court in <em>New York </em>v. <em>Burger, </em>482 U.S. 691 (1987), and affirmed the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">In <em>New York </em>v. <em>Burger, supra </em>at 700, the United States Supreme Court stated that an individual\u2019s expectation of privacy in commercial premises was \u201cparticularly attenuated\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>when the premises were utilized in the context of a \u201cclosely regulated\u201d industry. Therefore, the Court reasoned, \u201cthe warrant and probable-cause requirements, which fulfill the traditional Fourth Amendment standard of reasonableness for a government search . . . have lessened application in [the context of such premises]\u201d (citation omitted). <em>Id. </em>at 702. A warrantless administrative search of the commercial premises of a \u201cclosely regulated\u201d industry would be considered reasonable, and therefore permissible, under the Fourth Amendment so long as three criteria are met. First, the State must have a \u201csubstantial\u201d interest in the regulatory scheme pursuant to which the administrative search is made. \u201cSecond, the warrantless inspections must be \u2018necessary to further [the] regulatory scheme.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Donovan </em>v. <em>Dewey, </em>452 U.S. 594, 600 (1981). \u201cFinally, \u2018the statute\u2019s inspection program, in terms of the certainty and regularity of its application, [must] provid [e] a constitutionally adequate substitute for a warrant.\u2019 \u201d <em>New York </em>v. <em>Burger, supra </em>at 703, quoting <em>Donovan </em>v. <em>Dewey, supra </em>at 603. See <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Railway Labor Executives\u2019 Ass\u2019n, </em>489 U.S. 602, 627, 633-634 (1989); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blinn, </em>399 Mass. 126, 128 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">During oral argument before this court, the defendant conceded that the fishing industry in the Commonwealth is \u201cclosely regulated.\u201d Therefore, for the purposes of our Fourth Amendment analysis in the present case, we assume that the fishing industry in Massachusetts is sufficiently \u201cclosely regulated\u201d to trigger an examination of the three criteria for a permissible warrantless administrative inspection outlined in <em>New York </em>v. <em>Burger, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">It is undisputed that the Commonwealth has a \u201csubstantial\u201d interest in the fishing industry. \u201cThe States hold [fisher<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>ies] in trust for the public; but they exercise not only the rights of sovereignty . . . but also the right of property as to everything which remains in common for all the people.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hilton, </em>174 Mass. 29, 31 (1899). General Laws c. 130, with its focus on the regulation of fishing, including the determination of size limits, appropriate fishing methods, and fishing seasons, serves to protect the Commonwealth\u2019s substantial interest in maintaining the vitality of the fishing industry in the Commonwealth. We stated in <em>Barlow </em>v. <em>Wareham, </em>401 Mass. 408, 413 (1988), that \u201cthe [G. L. c. 130,] \u00a7 80 permitting process is primarily intended to safeguard public health and ensure the acceptability of Massachusetts fish and shellfish in interstate commerce.\u201d We conclude that the first criterion of <em>Burger </em>has been met in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Additionally, we conclude that a warrantless administrative search to determine the permit status of a fishing vessel which is landing raw fish in the Commonwealth is \u201cnecessary to further [the] regulatory scheme [of c. 130] .\u201d <em>New York </em>v. <em>Burger, supra </em>at 702, quoting <em>Donovan </em>v. <em>Dewey, supra </em>at 600. A permit for landing raw fish in the Commonwealth is required of a person who lands raw fish, or is in the process of landing raw fish, in the Commonwealth. Due to the mobile nature of fishing vessels and the fact that a fishing vessel might unload its catch in a relatively short period of time, the opportunity to determine the permit status of a vessel necessarily is limited, and the fishing vessel may well have left the docks and the Commonwealth\u2019s waters by the time an officer was able to obtain a warrant. Indeed, those fishing vessels which lacked the proper permit would have the greatest incentive to dock, unload their catch, and return to sea as quickly as possible in order to escape the possibility of a search pursuant to a warrant. \u201c[I]f inspection is to be effective and serve as a credible deterrent, unannounced, even frequent, inspections are essential. In this context, the prerequisite of a warrant could easily frustrate inspection.\u201d <em>Donovan </em>v. <em>Dewey, supra </em>at 603, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Biswell, </em>406 U.S. 311, 316 (1972). See <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Railway Labor </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number><em>Executives\u2019 Ass\u2019rt, supra </em>at 629-630. Therefore, the option to conduct a warrantless administrative inspection of a vessel landing raw fish in the Commonwealth is crucial to the enforcement of the Commonwealth\u2019s regulatory scheme regarding the fishing industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">We consider whether G. L. c. 130, \u00a7 80, provides a \u201cconstitutionally adequate substitute for a warrant.\u201d <em>New York </em>v. <em>Burger, supra </em>at 711, quoting <em>Donovan </em>v. <em>Dewey, supra </em>at 603. We conclude that it does. General Laws c. 130, \u00a7 80, informs any individual who lands raw fish in the Commonwealth that he may have demanded of him a State permit. \u201cThus, the [individual] knows that the inspections to which he is subject do not constitute discretionary acts by a government official but are conducted pursuant to statute.\u201d <em>New York </em>v. <em>Burger, supra. </em>Additionally, G. L. c. 130, \u00a7 80, puts a fisherman on notice as to how to comply with the statute. A State permit must be obtained prior to landing raw fish in the Commonwealth and must be surrendered on the demand of an authorized person.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Finally, the time, place, and scope of the warrantless inspection are limited sufficiently to \u201crestrain the discretion of the inspectors\u201d in their exercise of warrantless inspections. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eagleton, supra </em>at 205. See <em>New York </em>v. <em>Burger, supra </em>at 711. An environmental police officer may not ask to see a vessel\u2019s permit to land raw fish in the Commonwealth until that officer knows, or has reason to know, that the vessel has landed, or is about to land, raw fish. The place of the inspection usually will be the vessel when it is docked. The scope of the inspection is clear and narrowly defined; its sole purpose is to determine whether the vessel has a proper State permit. Therefore, the discretion of the inspector is limited. See <em>Donovan </em>v. <em>Dewey, supra </em>at 600. The warrantless administrative search in the present case did not violate the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">This court has not yet been squarely presented with the constitutionality of a warrantless administrative inspection under art. 14. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eagleton, supra </em>at 202 n.5. However, we stated in a different context that \u201c[a] war<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>rantless search conducted without consent, without probable cause, and without exigent circumstances justifying the intrusion . . but conducted pursuant to standard procedures, will have a greater chance of meeting constitutional requirements than an ad hoc practice .... A search pursuant to standard procedures will eliminate any element of discretion in the decision to conduct [a] . . . search.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>394 Mass. 421, 427 (1985). We note that the unique characteristics and mobility of the commercial vessel, the Jeromi, present the possibility that a warrant requirement could frustrate the Commonwealth\u2019s ability to enforce its regulation of the fishing industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The defendant here had clear notice that he was required to have a State permit and that his vessel would be subject to inspections to determine his permit status. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blinn, supra </em>at 128. See also <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Railway Labor Executives\u2019 Ass\u2019n, supra </em>at 620-621. A fisherman\u2019s expectation of privacy is- not unduly impinged upon by an environmental police officer\u2019s request to produce a permit which by State law the fisherman is required to have. In these circumstances, we see no reason why our analysis regarding the constitutionality of the warrantless inspection in this case under art. 14 should differ from that under the Fourth Amendment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Article 14 does not prohibit a warrant-less administrative search to determine whether a fishing vessel has a State permit to land raw fish in the Commonwealth. Officer Arena\u2019s November 18, 1986, and November 23, 1986, inquiries of the defendant were not prohibited by either the Fourth Amendment or art. 14. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence obtained as a result of these visits appropriately was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">b. <em>Miranda warnings. </em>The defendant alleges a separate error in the denial of his motion to suppress evidence of his statements to Officer Arena on November 23, 1986. The de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>fendant claims that Arena\u2019s inquiry of the defendant on that date was a \u201ccustodial interrogation,\u201d and required Arena to inform the defendant of his Miranda rights before asking the defendant whether he had obtained a State fishing permit. The defendant argues that Arena\u2019s failure to do so required the judge to suppress any subsequent statements made by the defendant to Arena.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">\u201cMiranda warnings are only necessary for \u2018custodial interrogations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>390 Mass. 729, 736 (1984). The defendant places particular emphasis on the fact that Officer Arena testified that, as he approached the Jeromi, he intended to arrest the defendant if he did not produce a State fishing permit. \u201cThe [United States] Supreme Court has never endorsed a subjective standard of \u2018custody,\u2019 and other courts have explicitly rejected such a test. \u2018Although the officer may have an intent to make an arrest, either formed prior to, or during the questioning, this is not a factor in determining whether there is present \u201cin-custody\u201d questioning. It is the officer\u2019s statements and acts, the attending circumstances, gauged by a \u201creasonable man\u201d test, which are determinative.\u2019 <em>Lowe </em>v. <em>United States, </em>407 F.2d 1391, 1397 (9th Cir. 1969). <em>United States </em>v. <em>Booth, </em>669 F.2d 1231, 1235 (9th Cir. 1981). We likewise adhere to an objective standard.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shine, </em>398 Mass. 641, 648 (1986), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bryant, supra </em>at 739 n.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">An important factor to be considered in the determination whether the defendant reasonably could have been considered to be in custody is the place of the interrogation. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bryant, supra </em>at 737. In the present case, the defendant was questioned on board his own fishing vessel, surrounded by his employees. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Accaputo, </em>380 Mass. 435, 452 (1980). \u201cQuestioning in such an environment is far removed from the \u2018incommunicado interrogation of individuals in a police dominated atmosphere\u2019 for which the Miranda protections were tailored.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bryant, supra </em>at 737. Furthermore, the questioning of the defendant was extremely brief; only one question was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>asked. There is no testimony to suggest that the questioning was conducted in an aggressive manner. See <em>id. </em>at 737-738. While it is true that the defendant was clearly the focus of Officer Arena\u2019s inquiry whether unlicensed activity was taking place, \u201c \u2018[f]ocus\u2019 alone does not trigger the need for <em>Miranda </em>warnings.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Valliere, </em>366 Mass. 479, 486 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Based on a consideration of the facts of this case and the factors we have just described, we will not say that the trial judge erred in concluding that Officer Arena\u2019s questioning of the defendant on November 23, 1986, did not constitute \u201ccustodial interrogation.\u201d Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress his statements for a failure to give Miranda warnings was denied appropriately.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">2. <em>Federal preemption. </em>Prior to his trial, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the complaint against him, arguing that the permit requirement of G. L. c. 130, \u00a7 80, was preempted by 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 122 (1982).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The judge denied the motion. The defendant claims error. In support of his argument the defendant directs our attention to: (1) the fact that the defendant held a valid Federal fishing permit at the time of his arrest; (2) the undisputed testimony that the fish which the defendant held in his boat on November 23, 1986, were caught in Federal waters, and; (3) the defendant\u2019s testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>and the testimony of the vice president of the J.B. Wright Fish Company that the defendant had requested that his catch be sold outside Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Section 122 of 46 U.S.C. states that \u201c[n]o vessel belonging to any citizen of the United States, trading from one port within the United States to another port within the United States, or employed in the bank, whale, or other fisheries, shall be subject to tonnage tax or duty, if such vessel be licensed, registered, or enrolled.\u201d A \u201ctonnage tax or duty\u201d is defined as a \u201ccharge for the privilege of entering, or trading or lying in, a port or harbor.\u201d <em>Transportation Co. </em>v. <em>Parkersburg, </em>107 U.S. 691, 696 (1882). The defendant argues that, because the fish he caught were taken outside the Commonwealth\u2019s waters and were to be sold outside the Commonwealth\u2019s boundaries, the State permit requirement is akin to a tax or duty for the privilege of passing his catch through the Commonwealth. As such, he argues, the permit requirement is prohibited. See <em>Toomer </em>v. <em>Witsell, </em>334 U.S. 385, 403-406 (1948) (South Carolina statute requiring that shrimp boats fishing off the coast of South Carolina dock in South Carolina and pay \u201cstamp tax\u201d before shipping shrimp to. another State held to be impermissible burden of interstate commerce in violation of art. I, \u00a7 8, of United States Constitution).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">We are of the opinion that the State permit requirement in this case was directed at protecting the State\u2019s interest in its fisheries and did not operate as either a tonnage duty or tax. Therefore, the bar of 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 122 does not apply to the State permit requirement involved in this case. The permit requirement serves to promote the enforcement of the State\u2019s regulation of the fishing industry. This requirement serves the State\u2019s substantial interests in conserving its fisheries, safeguarding public health, and ensuring the acceptability of Massachusetts fish and shellfish in interstate commerce. The parties do not dispute that the State\u2019s police power extends to these interests. See, e.g., <em>Bayside Fish Flour Co. </em>v. <em>Gentry, </em>297 U.S. 422, 426 (1936) (State statute limiting manufacture of flour from sardines in State regardless of origin of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>sardines is \u201cwell within\u201d police power of State to conserve its sardine fishery). The fact that the permit requirement may have some marginal effect on interstate commerce through the imposition of a fee to obtain a State fishing permit does not require its invalidation in the face of the legitimate exercise of the State\u2019s police power. \u201cIf the enforcement of the act affects interstate or foreign commerce, that result is purely incidental, indirect, and beyond the purposes of the legislation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Even if we accept the defendant\u2019s contention that he caught the fish at issue in this case in Federal waters and that he intended to have the fish sold outside the Commonwealth, these facts do not require us to conclude that the State\u2019s exercise of its police power over the landing of fish is precluded.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Officer Arena was not in a position to determine whether the fish had been caught in the waters of the Commonwealth or in Federal waters, or in both. While the defendant testified that all the fish were caught in Federal waters, the enforcement of the permit program and its concomitant effect on the enforcement of the State\u2019s fishing regulations would be weakened dramatically if fishermen could avoid the permit requirement on the basis of their affirmation that their catch had not been taken in State waters. The State\u2019s permitting scheme would be rendered virtually ineffective in such a situation. \u201c[T]o the extent that the act deals with the use or treatment of fish brought into the state from the outside, its legal justification rests upon the ground that it operates as a shield against the covert depletion of the local supply, and thus tends to effectuate the policy of the law by rendering evasion of it less easy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 426. The requirement that the defendant obtain a State fishing permit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>to land raw fish in the Commonwealth is not prohibited by 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 122.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">3. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case against him, the defendant moved for a required finding of not guilty. This motion was denied. The defendant claims error. In reviewing the denial of a motion for a required finding of not guilty, \u201cthe question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Merola, </em>405 Mass. 529, 533 (1989), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979). In the present case, the Commonwealth had to present evidence sufficient to allow the jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that: (1) the defendant landed raw fish in the Commonwealth; (2) for the purpose of sale; (3) without a valid State permit. See G. L. c. 130, \u00a7 80. The defendant does not dispute that he lacked a proper State permit. He does claim, however, that the Commonwealth failed to establish that he landed raw fish in the Commonwealth or, in the alternative, that the landing of any fish was for the purpose of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">In the context of the regulations of the division of marine fisheries, to \u201c[ljand\u201d is defined as \u201cto transfer the catch of fish or shellfish from any vessel to any other vessel or onto any land, pier, wharf, dock or other artificial structure.\u201d 322 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 7.01 (1) (1989). Officer Arena testified that on November 23, 1986, he observed a large bucket loaded with raw fish being hoisted from the Jeromi onto the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>dock of the J.B. Wright Fish Company. Officer Arena estimated that the bucket contained approximately one hundred pounds of fish. This testimony allowed the jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had \u201clanded\u201d raw fish in the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Regarding the issue whether the fish had been landed in the Commonwealth \u201cfor the purpose of sale,\u201d the Commonwealth presented the testimony of Brian Wright, the vice president of the J.B. Wright Fish Company, that the defendant previously had discussed with Wright the possibility of selling the catch of November 23, 1986, through the J.B. Wright Fish Company. This testimony, coupled with testimony that the defendant earned his living through fishing and that on November 23, 1986, the defendant began to unload his catch on the dock of a wholesale fish company, entitled the jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant landed his catch for the purpose of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The defendant argues that a violation of G. L. c. 130, \u00a7 80, cannot be found unless a sale of the raw fish is <em>completed </em>at the time the fish are landed. We see no reason to adopt such an interpretation of G. L. c. 130, \u00a7 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">\u201c[Statutory language, when clear and unambiguous, must be given its ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Bronstein </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co., </em>390 Mass. 701, 704 (1984). See <em>Hashimi </em>v. <em>Kalil, </em>388 Mass. 607, 610 (1983). General Laws c. 130, \u00a7 80, refers to the landing of raw fish in the Commonwealth for \u201cthe purpose of sale.\u201d Webster\u2019s New Int\u2019l Dictionary 2018 (2d ed. 1959), defines \u201cpurpose\u201d as \u201c[t]hat which one sets before himself as an object to be attained; <em>the end or aim to be kept in view in any plan, measure, exertion or operation\u2019' </em>(emphasis added). By using the phrase \u201cfor the purpose of sale,\u201d the Legislature intended that G. L. c. 130, \u00a7 80, apply not only to situations in which the sale of landed fish had been completed, but also to situations in which fish not yet sold had been landed as part of a process whereby the fish eventually would be sold by the person who had landed them. To adopt the interpretation of G. L. c. 130, \u00a7 80, suggested by the defendant would be to allow unlicensed fishermen to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>evade the penalties of G. L. c. 130, \u00a7 80, merely by postponing the sale of their catch. Such an approach clearly would be inconsistent with the Legislature\u2019s interest in seeing the regulatory scheme of c. 130 enforced. The defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty appropriately was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">4. <em>Jury instructions. </em>The defendant claims that the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury were erroneous in several respects. First, the defendant argues that the judge erred in failing to instruct the jury that the Commonwealth must prove that the defendant intended to violate G. L. c. 130, \u00a7 80. The defendant also claims that the judge\u2019s instructions improperly placed the burden of proof on the defendant to prove that he had a permit, thereby relieving the Commonwealth of its burden to prove every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">\u201c [Legislatures generally have broad power to define and limit the mens rea element of criminal offenses.\u201d <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Solomon, </em>385 Mass. 91, 103 (1982). \u201c[T]he Legislature may make criminal an act or omission even where the person responsible has no \u2018blameworthy condition of the mind.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>354 Mass. 508, 511 (1968). These types of offenses have been described as \u201cpublic welfare offenses.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>342 Mass. 393, 397 (1961). \u201c[Public welfare offenses] are often offences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>where the punishment is by \u2018penalties commonly . . . relatively small\u2019 and where \u2018conviction does no grave damage to an offender\u2019s reputation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Buckley, supra </em>at 511, quoting <em>Morissette </em>v. <em>United States, </em>342 U.S. 246, 256-258 (1952). It is our opinion that a violation of G. L. c. 130, \u00a7 80, is defined properly as a \u201cpublic welfare offense,\u201d and therefore may be punished without proof of an intention to violate.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">General Laws c. 130, \u00a7 80, is \u201cprimarily intended to safeguard public health.\u201d <em>Barlow </em>v. <em>Wareham, </em>401 Mass. 408, 413 (1988). The maximum penalties for a violation of G. L. c. 130, \u00a7 80, imprisonment for thirty days and a $50 fine, are \u201crelatively small.\u201d Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>369 Mass. 904, 917 (1976) (one-year sentence for \u201cpublic welfare offense\u201d of failure to obtain firearm license upheld despite \u201cabsence of knowledge as to the existence of a license\u201d). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Buckley, supra </em>at 511-512 (imposition of five-year prison sentence described as \u201csevere penalty\u201d). Finally, we are of the opinion that a conviction for a failure to obtain a State fishing permit is not likely to do \u201cgrave damage to [the defendant\u2019s] reputation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Buckley, supra </em>at 511. Based on our consideration of the <em>Buckley </em>factors, we conclude that the Legislature was entitled to allow for a conviction under G. L. c. 130, \u00a7 80, without proof that the defendant intended to violate the statute. Therefore, the judge\u2019s failure to instruct the jury regarding the defendant\u2019s intent was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The defendant claims that the judge improperly shifted the burden of proof as to the existence of a State fishing permit from the Commonwealth to the defendant by instructing the jury that, \u201cuntil it is proven, you can draw an inference that the license or permit does not exist.\u201d We note that the defendant raised no objection to this instruction at the time it was given. See Mass. R. Crim. P. 24 (b), 378 Mass. 895 (1979). Therefore, we review the charge as a whole to determine whether it created a \u201csubstantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pickles, </em>393 Mass. 775, 776 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>Prior to the challenged instruction, the judge properly instructed the jury regarding the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof: \u201cUnder our law a Defendant is presumed by law to be innocent. Under our law it doesn\u2019t require a Defendant to prove his innocence, nor does it require him to produce any evidence at all. It\u2019s the Commonwealth\u2019s responsibility to prove him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of each and every element of the crime in which he\u2019s charged, otherwise you have to acquit him.\u201d In addition, immediately after the judge issued the instruction to which the defendant now objects, the judge told the jury that \u201cit has to be proved to you beyond a reasonable doubt that that person did not have a commercial license to fish.\u201d Therefore, the judge bracketed the challenged instruction with proper statements of the law regarding the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Furthermore, there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could have concluded that the Commonwealth met its burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not have a State permit on the day he was arrested. Officer Arena testified that, when asked, the defendant failed to produce a State permit. Arena also testified that the defendant told Arena that he did not have a State permit. The defendant made no attempt to rebut these aspects of Arena\u2019s testimony. In the circumstances of this case, we perceive no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice due to the challenged instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">5. <em>Sentencing. </em>The defendant claims that the sentence imposed on him by the judge was \u201cparticularly harsh\u201d and was motivated by a desire on the part of the judge to punish the defendant for exercising his right to a trial. We note that there is nothing in the record to indicate that the defendant objected to the sentence or that he filed a motion to revise or revoke the sentence imposed. See Mass. R. Crim. P. 29 (a), 378 Mass. 899 (1979). Aside from his bald assertion that the judge acted improperly, the defendant presents nothing to support his allegation. Based on our review of the record in this case, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s claim in this regard is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>The defendant also claims that the sentence imposed on him constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">\u201cThis court has recognized that it is possible that imprisonment for a long term of years might be so disproportionate to the offense as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>405 Mass. 369, 379 (1989), quoting <em>Cepulonis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>384 Mass. 495, 496 &amp; n.2 (1981), appeal dismissed, 455 U.S. 931 (1982). To constitute cruel and unusual punishment, a sentence must be \u201cso disproportionate to the crime that \u2018it shocks the conscience and offends fundamental notions of human dignity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>369 Mass. 904, 910 (1976), quoting <em>In re Lynch, </em>8 Cal. 3d 410, 424 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">The defendant appears to rest his argument in this regard on the theory that, \u201c[a]bsent a showing of repeated and deliberate violations of [G. L. c. 130, \u00a7 80], imposition of a jail sentence is cruel and unusual punishment.\u201d This argument must fail. The notion that <em>no </em>jail sentence can be imposed in the absence of multiple violations of G. L. c. 130, \u00a7 80, suggests that the interests protected by the enforcement of G. L. c. 130, \u00a7 80, are so trivial that we should allow each member of the fishing industry one \u201cfree\u201d violation. Our earlier discussion of the Commonwealth\u2019s \u201csubstantial\u201d interests in regulating its fisheries makes it clear that this is not the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">The imposition of a thirty-day jail sentence, of which twenty-three days were suspended, is not so disproportionate to the offense charged in this case that it \u201cshocks the conscience.\u201d This is particularly so when, five days prior to his arrest for the violation of G. L. c. 130, \u00a7 80, the defendant had been instructed by an environmental police officer that he was required to have a State fishing permit. The sentence in this case does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>6. <em>Conclusion. </em>We perceive no error requiring a new trial or the reversal of the defendant\u2019s conviction.

VI of the Constitution provides Congress with the power to pre-empt state law. Pre-emption occurs when Congress, in enacting a federal statute, expresses a clear intent to pre-empt state law, <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Rath Packing Co., </em>430 U.S. 519 (1977), when there is outright or actual conflict between federal and state law, <em>e.g., Free </em>v. <em>Bland, </em>369 U.S. 663 (1962), where compliance with both federal and state law is in effect physically impossible, <em>Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Paul, </em>378 U.S. 132 (1963), where there is implicit in federal law a barrier to state regulation, <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>463 U.S. 85 (1983), where Congress has legislated comprehensively, thus occupying an entire field of regulation and leaving no room for the States to supplement federal law, <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Santa Fe Elevator Corp., </em>331 U.S. 218 (1947), or where the state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full objectives of Congress. <em>Hines </em>v. <em>Davidowitz, </em>312 U.S. 52 (1941).\u201d <em>Louisiana Pub.

Therefore, at the time Officer Arena arrived at the Jeromi on November 23, 1986, he would not have been able to determine conclusively that the fish would not be sold in the Commonwealth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b276-7\">In his brief to this court, the defendant appears to argue that other Federal laws in addition to 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 122 preempt the permit requirement of G. L. c. 130, \u00a7 80. See, e.g., <em>Bateman </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>716 F. Supp. 595 (S.D. Fla. 1989) (State enforcement of shrimp fishing regulations preempted by 50 C.F.R. \u00a7 658); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lauriat, </em>561 A.2d 496 (Me. 1989) (State enforcement of lobster fishing regulation preempted by 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1801-1882). However, in his motion to dismiss, the defendant raised only the issue of the preemptive force of 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 122. We will not address the preemptive effect of those Federal laws raised by the defendant for the first time on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b278-7\">The defendant also challenges two other aspects of the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury. The defendant claims that the judge erred in instructing the jury that the \u201cpurpose of sale\u201d element of G. L. c. 130, \u00a7 80, could be proven by a showing that the sale process had merely begun rather than been completed. Our discussion in part 3 of this opinion, <em>supra, </em>makes unnecessary any further elaboration on this issue. The judge\u2019s instruction was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">The defendant also claims that the judge erred by instructing the jury that either the defendant or his employees could have \u201clanded\u201d the fish without also instructing the jury that the Commonwealth was required to prove that the defendant authorized his employees\u2019 actions. The defendant, however, cites no authority for his argument, which is presented in one sentence. The defendant\u2019s brief statement regarding this issue does not rise to the level of appellate argument and will not be considered in this opinion. See Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
