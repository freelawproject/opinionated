R. Civ. P. 64, 365 Mass. 831 (1974), a judge of the Superior Court has reported to us, without decision, eight questions (see Appendix) concerning whether certain insurance policies provide coverage for damage claims arising from sexual abuse allegedly perpetrated at the Fells Acres Day School (school). Two of the eleven consolidated cases before us are declaratory judgment actions brought by insurance companies<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> seeking a judgment that the injuries sustained by the tort plaintiffs in the nine underlying tort actions are not covered by various policies of insurance. The other nine cases are the underlying tort actions, brought by parents individually and as next friends of their children, against one or more of the tort defendants, seeking damages incurred as a result of sexual abuse that the children are alleged to have suffered while they were attending the school. We allowed the insurance companies\u2019 joint application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">The parties\u2019 stipulation of agreed facts is substantially as follows. Fells Acres Day School, Inc. (Fells Acres), is a duly organized, for-profit Massachusetts corporation that operated the school, a group day care facility. The school enrolled as many as 48 children, ranging in age from fifteen months to five years. At all relevant times, the directors, officers, and shareholders of Fells Acres were Violet Amirault (Violet), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Gerald Amirault (Gerald), and Cheryl Amirault LeFave (Cheryl). Fells Acres employed up to seven staff members in addition to Violet, Gerald, and Cheryl. It maintained books and accounts as a corporation, paid Federal and State taxes and F.I.C.A. contributions as a corporation, maintained a corporate checking account from which expenses were paid, and filed annual reports of condition with the Office of the State Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Violet was the holder of a license to operate the school, issued by the Office for Children of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Operation of the school was subject to regulations promulgated by the Office for Children, 102 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 7.00 (1987). At all relevant times, Violet was a salaried employee of Fells Acres, holding the title of \u201cdirector\u201d of the school. As such, pursuant to Office for Children regul\u00e1tions, Violet was responsible for staff supervision and training. Gerald, Violet\u2019s son, was a salaried employee of Fells Acres, employed as the school\u2019s \u201cprogram coordinator.\u201d For at least one year before the revocation of Violet\u2019s license to operate the school and the school\u2019s closing in 1984, Gerald also held the title \u201cassistant director.\u201d Gerald was responsible for setting up and monitoring programs at the school and for assisting Violet in the administration of the school\u2019s programs. Cheryl, Violet\u2019s daughter, also was a salaried employee of Fells Acres, employed as an \u201cassistant director\u201d and a teacher. Cheryl was responsible for assisting Violet in the administration of the school\u2019s programs. Cheryl\u2019s husband, Albert LeFave (Albert), was not employed by Fells Acres.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">In 1980, the Worcester Insurance Company (Worcester) issued to Fells Acres<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a \u201cSpecial Multi-Peril\u201d (SMP) policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>of insurance, containing both property and liability coverages, for the period from October, 1980, to October, 1983. In 1983, Worcester issued another SMP policy for the period from October, 1983, to October, 1986. Worcester also issued to Violet a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy for her residence in Malden, for the period from June, 1979, to June, 1982. In September, 1983, Merrimack Mutual Fire Insurance Company (Merrimack) issued to Cheryl and Albert a homeowner\u2019s policy for their residence in Melrose, for the period from September, 1983, to September, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The nine underlying tort actions seek damages from one or more of the following tort defendants: Fells Acres, Violet, Gerald, Cheryl, and Albert. The claims of the plaintiffs in the underlying tort actions are set forth in a Uniform Complaint and individual complaints that adopt parts of the Uniform Complaint. The Uniform Complaint alleges claims of assault and battery by the individual tort defendants; vicarious liability of Fells Acres; negligence of Violet, Gerald, Cheryl, and Fells Acres; and breach of warranty by Fells Acres. The facts underlying the tort complaints are the acts of sexual abuse that are alleged to have occurred while the child tort plaintiffs were attending and in the care of the school.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Some of these alleged acts of abuse formed the basis for criminal prosecutions against some of the tort defendants. Gerald was tried and convicted of rape and indecent assault and battery on six of the child tort plaintiffs. He also was convicted of indecent assault and battery on another of the child tort plaintiffs.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We affirmed those convictions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>404 Mass. 221 (1989). Violet was convicted of rape and indecent assault and battery on two of the child tort plaintiffs and convicted of indecent assault and battery on another child tort plaintiff. Cheryl was convicted of rape and indecent assault and battery on three of the child tort plaintiffs and convicted of indecent assault <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>and battery on another of the child tort plaintiffs. We affirmed those convictions. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeFave, </em>407 Mass. 927 (1990). Some of the child tort plaintiffs allege acts of abuse for which the tort defendants were not tried. The tort defendants deny that they abused the children and deny that the children were sexually abused by anyone while the children were in attendance at or in the care of the school.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">1. <em>Assault and battery. </em>The Uniform Complaint alleges that each of the four tort defendants \u201cdid assault the minor plaintiffs with great force, raped and sexually molested the minor plaintiffs.\u201d The insurance companies contend that, under the terms of any of the policies, there can be no coverage<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for assault and battery of the child tort plaintiffs because the injuries were \u201cexpected or intended from the standpoint of the insured.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The tort plaintiffs contend that there is insufficient information in the record to permit any conclusion concerning the intent of the tort defendants and that the issue is a factual one to be determined at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">The parties\u2019 stipulation of facts includes an assertion that, at the trial of the declaratory judgment actions, the tort plaintiffs would seek to offer the opinion of a psychiatrist, Dr. Bernard Yudowitz, on the intent issue.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Dr. Yudowitz would testify that it is impossible to draw conclusions about the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>tent of a child abuser without extensive evaluation and testing and that child abusers act from a variety of motives. Dr. Yudowitz\u2019s research yields examples of the variety of sex abuse offenders, including \u201chighly sociopathic individual [s],\u201d \u201cmentally deranged individual[s],\u201d \u201csadistic individual[s],\u201d individuals \u201cwho [have] never socially matured and can only have sexual intimacy with children,\u201d and several other types. Moreover, it is stipulated, Dr. Yudowitz\u2019s review of the Uniform Complaint convinces him that \u201cit is impossible to state . . . that the perpetrators in this case intended harm or injury.\u201d Dr. Yudowitz has not examined the tort defendants. The stipulation also states that \u201cthe tort defendants do not consent to be psychiatrically tested, evaluated, or diagnosed, nor do they consent to the release of any medical or other confidential records in connection with this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">All of the insurance policies provide coverage for \u201coccurrences,\u201d defined to include \u201caccidents.\u201d Generally, an injury \u201cwhich ensues from the volitional act of an insured is still an \u2018accident\u2019 within the meaning of an insurance policy if the insured does not specifically intend to cause the resulting harm or is not substantially certain that such harm will occur.\u201d <em>Quincy Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. Abernathy, 393 Mass. 81, 84 (1984). In <em>Quincy Mut. Fire, </em>we applied this standard to a situation in which an insured intentionally threw a large piece of \u201cblacktop\u201d at an automobile, injuring its occupants. In concluding that the insurer was not entitled to summary judgment on the question whether the injuries to the automobile\u2019s occupants were accidental, we concluded that the injuries would be covered unless \u201cthe insured knew to a substantial certainty that the bodily injury would result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 86. The tort plaintiffs contend that, although the alleged acts of sexual abuse are intentional in nature, there is no basis to conclude that the tort defendants \u201cknew to a substantial certainty\u201d that injuries would result. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Forceful sexual molestation and rape are unlike the defendant\u2019s actions in <em>Quincy Mut. Fire. </em>There, it was possible that the injuries resulting from the insured\u2019s intentional act were accidental. This case more closely resembles <em>Newton </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number><em>Krasnigor, </em>404 Mass. 682 (1989), in which we determined that the actions of an insured who intentionally started a fire in a building necessitated the inference that, \u201cas matter of law, [the insured] intended to cause some property damage . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687. In this case, as in <em>Krasnigor, </em>the nature of the acts alleged is such that we must conclude, as a matter of law, that the insureds intended to cause at least some injury to the tort plaintiffs. \u201cChild molestation and the injury caused by it are so closely tied as to be virtually inseparable. Except in the strongest of factual situations, intent to commit this act carries with it the intent to inflict the injury.\u201d <em>Roe </em>v. <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co., </em>259 Ga. 42, 42 (1989). Accord <em>Harpy </em>v. <em>Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>76 Md. App. 474, 484 (1988); <em>K.A.G. </em>v. <em>Stanford, </em>148 Wis. 2d 158, 164-165 (Ct. App. 1988). Sexual assault and rape are, in this respect, indistinguishable from any other deliberate assault and battery. \u201c[T]he act of striking another in the face is one which we recognize as an act so certain to cause a particular kind of harm that we can say a person who performed the act intended the resulting harm, and his statement to the contrary does nothing to refute that rule of law.\u201d <em>CNA Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>McGinnis, </em>282 Ark. 90, 93 (1984), quoting <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>22 Ariz. App. 601, 602 (1975). See <em>Bowen </em>v. <em>Lloyds Underwriters, </em>339 Mass. 627, 629 (1959); <em>Terrio </em>v. <em>McDonough, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 163, 169 (1983); <em>Lipson </em>v. <em>Queen Ins. Co., </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 901 (1974). Rape and sexual assault, too, because of their direct and forcible nature, are acts of the same inherently injurious kind. \u201c[R]eason mandates that from the very nature of the act, harm to the injured party must have been intended.\u201d <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co. </em>v. <em>American Employer\u2019s Ins. Co., </em>159 Cal. App. 3d 277, 291 n.9 (1984), quoted in <em>Krasnigor, supra </em>at 686 n.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">The proffered testimony of Dr. Yudowitz does not alter our conclusion, particularly because the tort defendants deny the abuse and refuse to submit to any medical examination. The mere fact that, as a group, child abusers have a variety of <em>motives </em>does <em>not </em>render their harmful actions <em>uninten</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number><em>tional. </em>Nowhere in the record is there a jot of evidence suggesting that the tort defendants were suffering from a mental disease or defect that would render them incapable of forming an intent to harm the child plaintiffs.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>382 Mass. 347 (1981), cited by the tort plaintiffs, is inapposite. <em>Baker </em>stands only for the \u201cwell-established rule that \u2018[i]f the insured was insane at the time that he wilfully or intentionally caused the [damage or injury], the insurer remains liable on the policy\u2019 . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 350. Cf. <em>Clemmer </em>v. <em>Hartford Ins. Co., </em>22 Cal. 3d 865 (1978). Nothing in the stipulation of facts, including the proffered testimony of Dr. Yudowitz, who has not examined the tort defendants, suggests any possibility that the tort plaintiffs will be able to demonstrate that the tort defendants were not criminally responsible at the time of the alleged sexual abuse.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">In concluding that an intent to injure may be inferred as a matter of law from acts of child molestation and rape, we join the overwhelming majority of the jurisdictions that have considered the issue.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Foremost Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Weetman, </em>726 F. Supp. 618 (W.D. Pa. 1989) (Pennsylvania law); <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Roelfs, </em>698 F. Supp. 815 (D. Alaska 1987) (Alaska law); <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>684 F. Supp. 1056 (W.D. Okla. 1988) (Oklahoma law); <em>Twin City Fire </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number><em>Ins.

Co. </em>v. <em>Malcolm, </em>128 N.H. 521 (1986) (overruling sub silentio <em>MacKinnon </em>v. <em>Hanover Ins. Co., </em>124 N.H. 456 [1984]); <em>Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>107 Wash. 2d 381 (1986) (en banc); <em>Horace Mann Ins. Co. </em>v. Leeber, 376 S.E.2d 581 (W. Va. 1988); <em>N.N. </em>v. <em>Moraine Mut. Ins. Co., </em>153 Wis. 2d 84 (1990).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Only three cases lend any support to the proposition that inquiry into the sexual abuser\u2019s motivations is necessary. See State <em>Auto Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>McIntyre, </em>652 F. Supp. 1177, 1219 (N.D. Ala. 1987) (\u201cwhether a bodily injury is expected or intended by an insured is a question of fact for the jury or judge and a purely subjective standard governs such factual determination\u201d). Cf. <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Jack S, </em>709 F. Supp. 963 (D. Nev. 1989) (court would not infer intent to injure when perpetrator of sexual abuse was only fourteen years old); <em>Public Serv. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Goldfarb, </em>53 N.Y.2d 392 (1981) (holding that insurance company had duty to defend dentist, who allegedly sexually molested his patients, under policy covering liability for injury resulting from \u201cundue familiarity\u201d). We are unconvinced by these authorities and consider it the better rule that intent to injure may be inferred from the intentional commission of an inherently injurious act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>such as forcible sexual abuse. These policies provide no coverage for such acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">2. <em>Claims against Fells Acres. </em>Apparently because of the confusion concerning the identity of the insured under the SMP policies, see note 3, <em>supra, </em>the Uniform Complaint makes identical allegations of vicarious liability, negligence, and breach of warranty against both \u201cFells Acres Day School, Inc.\u201d and \u201cFells Acres Day School, Inc. and/or Violet Amirault d/b/a Fells Acres Day School.\u201d The parties\u2019 stipulation states that \u201c[i]t was intended by Worcester, Fells Acres and Violet that the policies . . . would provide liability insurance for Fells Acres .... Worcester, Fells Acres and Violet have therefore agreed that coverage will be provided to \u2018Fells Acres Day School, Inc.\u2019 to the same extent as if it had been identified as the named insured.\u201d On the basis of this agreement, Worcester argues that the claims against \u201cFells Acres Day School, Inc. and/or Violet Amirault d/b/a Fells Acres Day School\u201d are neither actionable nor covered under Worcester\u2019s SMP policies. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">According to the parties\u2019 stipulation of facts, Fells Acres (the corporation) operated the school at all times relevant to the cases before us. The school had ceased operation as a sole proprietorship by Violet in 1975. Thus, there is no factual foundation for claims against \u201cViolet Amirault d/b/a Fells Acres Day School.\u201d Under the terms of the SMP policies, there also is no coverage for any sole proprietorship. The policies provide that \u201cif the named insured is designated in the Declarations as an individual, the person so designated [is an insured] <em>but only with respect to the conduct of a business of which he is the sole </em>proprietor\u201d (emphasis supplied). Because the school was operated by Fells Acres beginning in 1975, there can be no coverage under the policy terms for the sole proprietorship of \u201cViolet d/b/a Fells Acres Day School.\u201d Certainly the facts as stipulated indicate no factual basis from which to conclude that there is coverage for (or any basis for tort claims against) the purported joint venture of Violet and Fells Acres. The parties have agreed that Fells <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>Acres is the insured, and there is no reason to disturb their agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">3. <em>Vicarious liability. </em>The Uniform Complaint alleges that the assaults and batteries \u201cwere performed by one or more agents, servants, and/or employees of the defendant school while they were acting within the course and scope of their employment.\u201d On this issue, the parties have directed their arguments not at the question of insurance coverage, but at the question whether there can be any vicarious liability claim or claims under the stipulated facts. In their arguments, the parties divide the question into two parts: (a) whether, under traditional concepts of vicarious liability, the assaults and batteries were outside the scope of employment; and (b) whether the facts alleged are sufficient to support an extension of vicarious liability under the theory that Fells Acres assumed a nondelegable duty akin to that imposed on common carriers to protect the children in its care.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">a. <em>\u201cTraditional\u201d vicarious liability. </em>An employer may be held vicariously liable for the intentional tort of an agent if the tortious act or acts were committed within the scope of employment. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Federated Dep\u2019t Stores, Inc., </em>364 Mass. 340 (1973). \u201c[C]onduct of an agent is within the scope of employment if it is of the kind he is employed to perform . . . ; if it occurs substantially within the authorized time and space limits . . . ; and if it is motivated, at least in part, by a purpose to serve the employer ...\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Wang Laboratories, Inc. </em>v. <em>Business Incentives, Inc., </em>398 Mass. 854, 859 (1986). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>L.A.L. Corp., </em>400 Mass. 737, 742 (1987). The essential element that must be shown \u201cis that the employee\u2019s assault was in response to the plaintiffs conduct which was presently interfering with the employee\u2019s ability to perform his duties successfully. This interference may be in the form of an affirmative attempt to prevent an employee from carrying out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>his assignments ... in the failure to do acts necessary to enable the employee to begin or continue his assignments . . . . Assaults arising in either of these contexts constitute acts committed within the scope of employment, in that they stem from and directly relate to the frustration of the ability to perform on the assignments for which the employee is presently responsible.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Miller, supra </em>at 350. Under this standard, the conduct alleged here does not trigger vicarious liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The only factor even arguably supporting the tort plaintiffs\u2019 claims under this theory is that some of the abuse is alleged to have occurred \u201cwithin the authorized time and space limits.\u201d <em>Wang Laboratories, Inc., supra </em>at 859, i.e., at the school during school hours. Because some of the abuse is alleged to have been committed off the school grounds, even this factor does not support the plaintiffs. Moreover, these acts obviously were not \u201cof the kind [the employees were] employed to perform,\u201d nor were they \u201cmotivated, at least in part, by a purpose to serve the employer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Certainly the individual tortfeasors\u2019 assaults could not have been in response to any conduct by the child tort plaintiffs that was in any way \u201cinterfering with [the tort defendants\u2019] ability to perform\u201d their duties. <em>Miller, supra </em>at 350. On the basis of the stipulated facts, then, Fells Acres is not vicariously liable for the assaults and batteries.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">b. <em>Extension of \u2018\u2018common carrier\u201d liability. </em>Common carriers, innkeepers, and the like are held liable for the negligence or the wilful wrongs of their employees, under the rule that \u201c[a] carrier is under an obligation \u2018to use a very high <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>degree of care to prevent injuries that might be caused by the . . . wilful misconduct of others. ... In the application of the rule to injuries caused by servants of the carrier while engaged in the performance of his contract of carriage, it is held that he is liable absolutely for their misconduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gilmore </em>v. <em>Acme Taxi Co., </em>349 Mass. 651, 653 (1965), quoting <em>Hayne </em>v. <em>Union St. Ry., </em>189 Mass. 551, 552 (1905). Accord <em>Carey </em>v. <em>New Yorker of Worcester, Inc., </em>355 Mass. 450, 452 (1969). Liability is imposed regardless of negligence. <em>Gilmore, supra </em>at 652. Accord <em>Bryant </em>v. <em>Rich, </em>106 Mass. 180, 188 (1870). Indeed, a common carrier is liable not only for the misconduct of its employees, whether or not within the scope of employment, but also for the wrongs of strangers, if they are inflicted on a person in its care. <em>Quigley </em>v. <em>Wilson Line of Mass., Inc., </em>338 Mass. 125, 128 (1958). The tort plaintiffs in this case argue that we should hold Fells Acres to the standard of care to which common carriers are held. This we decline to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Although our law recognizes a variety of special relationships that impose affirmative duties of care, see generally <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Ware, </em>392 Mass. 745 (1984), the standard to which common carriers are held is the very highest, approaching that of an insurer. See <em>O'Malley </em>v. <em>Putnam Safe Deposit Vaults, Inc., </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 332, 340 (1983). Although in some jurisdictions, hospitals have been held to this standard, see <em>Stropes </em>v. <em>Heritage House Childrens Center of Shelbyville, Inc., </em>547 N.E.2d 244, 253 (Ind. 1989),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> we are aware of no cases imposing common carrier-type liability on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>an enterprise such as a group day care center.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Moreover, the tort plaintiffs have not pleaded this theory in the Uniform Complaint, nor have they argued the issue fully and completely in their briefs. In these circumstances, and because the imposition of common carrier liability on group day care centers would constitute a significant extension of current Massachusetts law, we decline to adopt such a rule in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">4. <em>Negligence and breach of warranty claims against Fells Acres. </em>The Uniform Complaint contains counts of negligence and breach of warranty against Fells Acres. The tort plaintiffs argue that Fells Acres may be liable in negligence and breach of warranty under a variety of theories. See, e.g., <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Blandford, </em>402 Mass. 831 (1988) (negligent hiring and retention of employee who assaulted plaintiff); <em>Mullins </em>v. <em>Pine Manor </em>College, 389 Mass. 47 (1983) (negligent failure to provide adequate security to protect students at residential college); <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Knight, </em>362 Mass. 350 (1972) (negligent supervision of children by day camp operator); <em>Vannah </em>v. <em>Hart Private Hosp., </em>228 Mass. 132 (1917) (breach of contract for failure of hospital to protect patient). Worcester asserts that there is no coverage for these claims, because \u201cthe children\u2019s injuries were not accidental from the standpoint of Fells Acres\u201d and the corporation \u201cexpected or intended\u201d the injuries resulting from the assaults and batteries on the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Worcester grounds this argument in part on the contention that we should disregard the corporate form and impute to the corporation the intentions of its corporate officers and stockholders, Violet, Gerald, and Cheryl. Generally, we have been reluctant to disregard the corporate fiction. We disregard the corporate fiction and impute to the corporation the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>intentions of its principals only in \u201crare particular situations in order to prevent gross inequity.\u201d <em>Gurry </em>v. <em>Cumberland Farms, Inc., </em>406 Mass. 615, 626 (1990), quoting <em>My Bread Breaking Co. </em>v. <em>Cumberland Farms, Inc., </em>353 Mass. 614, 620 (1968). See <em>Gordon Chem. Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Sur. Co., </em>358 Mass. 632, 638 (1971). See also <em>Osvaldo Varane, Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>362 Mass. 864 (1972). The stipulation of facts includes little to persuade us that under traditional principles the corporate form should be disregarded, although further factual inquiry might yield facts that would convince us otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Our discussion whether we should disregard the corporate fiction does not exhaust the question, however. In some circumstances, there may be reason to impute to a corporation the wrongful intent of officers, directors, or stockholders even without disregarding the corporate form. We have considered this issue in the context of criminal prosecutions of corporations, where the critical question is how the Commonwealth may establish the requisite criminal intent on the part of a corporation. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beneficial Fin. Co., </em>360 Mass. 188 (1971), cert, denied sub nom. <em>Farrell </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>407 U.S. 910, and sub nom. <em>Beneficial Fin. Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>407 U.S. 914 (1972), we approved instructions to the effect that when \u201cthe conduct for which the corporation is being held accountable [is] performed <em>on behalf of the </em>corporation,\u201d <em>\u201cthe acts and the intent of the individuals [are] the acts and intent of the </em>corporation\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Id. </em>at 258, 273, 255. Accord <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>L.A.L. Corp., </em>400 Mass. 737, 742 and 744 (1987) (same principles apply to close corporations).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">This theory of when the intentions of corporate principals may be attributed to the corporation has been applied in the insurance context as well. See <em>Cora Pub, Inc. </em>v. <em>Contentinal Casualty Co., </em>619 F.2d 482, 486 (5th Cir. 1980) (where arson is \u201ccommitted for the benefit of the corporation by an officer . . . courts have often imputed the arson of the individual to the corporation\u201d). Accord <em>Osvaldo Varane, Inc., supra. </em>Thus, if the alleged acts of abuse were in any way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>performed on behalf of the corporation, the abuse would be attributable to the corporation. For example, if it were shown that the individual defendants were engaged in the sale of child pornography and that the corporation was financially implicated in such activity, the intentions of the wrongdoers properly could be imputed to Fells Acres.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Similarly, if it could be shown that abuse at the school was so routine as to constitute a general practice or policy, the abuse could be imputed to Fells Acres, even if the abuse was not committed for the benefit of the corporation. Considerations of this kind led a court to conclude that, although a corporate insured was covered for negligent supervision claims when its principals had sexually harassed employees, the insurance company had no responsibility \u201cfor the corporation\u2019s intentional or discriminatory acts.\u201d <em>Seminole Point Hosp. Corp. </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Sur. Co., </em>675 F. Supp. 44, 47 (D.N.H. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Other considerations as well might persuade us to impute the wrongful intent of Violet, Gerald, or Cheryl to Fells Acres. We cannot reach a precise determination on this issue in the absence of a more fully developed factual record. The inquiry is factually based, and may have to be conducted as to each injury. We do not have sufficient uncontroverted evidence in the record to determine whether Fells Acres expected or intended the injuries. The fact alone that the corporation\u2019s officers and shareholders committed intentional torts would not be sufficient to warrant imputing their expectations or intentions to Fells Acres. See <em>Lawler Mach. &amp; Foundry Co. </em>v. <em>Pacific Indem. Ins. Co., </em>383 So. 2d 156 (Ala. 1980); <em>Rivers </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>168 So. 2d 400 (La. Ct. App. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">5. <em>Negligence claims against Violet, Gerald, and Cheryl. </em>The plaintiffs have alleged that Violet, Gerald, and Cheryl were negligent in the performance of their duties at the school. The insurance companies argue that there can be no coverage for these claims, because (a) the individual tort defendants \u201cexpected or intended\u201d injury to the tort plaintiffs (see section 1), and any claims in negligence must fail for that reason; and (b) as far as claims against Violet and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>Cheryl are concerned, their respective homeowner\u2019s policies exclude coverage for business-related liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">a. <em>Expected or intended injury. </em>Under the terms of the SMP policies issued by Worcester, Violet, Gerald, and Cheryl are all insureds under a clause providing that, \u201cif the named insured is designated ... as other than an individual, partnership or joint venture, [persons insured include] the organization so designated and any executive officer, director or stockholder thereof while acting within the scope of his duties as such.\u201d Worcester argues, however, that there is no insurance coverage under the SMP policy for the negligence claims against Violet, Gerald, and Cheryl, because \u201ceach of these individuals knew and expected that the others routinely committed abusive acts of the sort that they often perpetrated together \u2014 indeed, that it was their common goal to facilitate such abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">We agree with Worcester\u2019s argument that, \u201cto the extent that the plaintiffs seek to recover in negligence from the same individuals whom they have sued for assault and battery, <em>for the same acts which are contended to be the basis of those assault and battery </em>claims, the negligence claims are legally unsupportable\u201d (emphasis supplied). See <em>Sabatinelli </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>363 Mass. 565, 567 (1973) (\u201c[i]f conduct is negligent it cannot also be intentional\u201d). Accord <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Troelstrup, </em>789 P.2d 415, 418 n.7 (Colo. 1990) (en banc) (denying coverage for \u201cnegligent\u201d sexual abuse claim); <em>Linebaugh </em>v. <em>Berdish, </em>144 Mich. App. 750 (1985) (same). The tort plaintiffs, however, apparently proceed on a conventional negligence theory; the Uniform Complaint alleges that Violet, Gerald, and Cheryl each \u201cknew or should have known of the assault, rape and sexual molestation of the minor plaintiffs and failed to exercise care to prevent\u201d these acts. We do not agree with Worcester\u2019s argument that a tort defendant\u2019s knowledge (if any) of the abusive acts committed by others nullifies coverage for a negligence claim.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>The knowledge of one of the tort defendants concerning the abusive activities of the others, coupled with the failure to protect the children, renders that tort defendant\u2019s conduct reckless. Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 500 (1965), states: \u201cThe actor\u2019s conduct is in reckless disregard of the safety of another if he . . . intentionally fails to do an act which it is his duty to the other to do, knowing or having reason to know . . . not only that his [omission] creates an unreasonable risk of physical harm to another, but also that such risk is substantially greater than that which is necessary to make his conduct negligent.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Pridgen </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Auth., </em>364 Mass. 696, 705 (1974); <em>Baines </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>310 Mass. 523, 526 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Generally, injuries resulting from reckless conduct do not fall into the category of \u201cexpected or intended\u201d injuries, but are considered \u201caccidental\u201d and thus are covered under insurance policies. \u201cOur cases have concluded that an injury is nonaccidental only where the result was actually, not constructively, intended, i.e., <em>more than </em>recklessness\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Quincy Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Abernathy, </em>393 Mass. 81, 86 (1984) (reversing summary judgment for insurer on coverage issue when insured intentionally threw a large piece of \u201cblacktop\u201d at a car, injuring occupants). Accord <em>Sheehan </em>v. <em>Goriansky, </em>321 Mass. 200, 205 (1947). See <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Western Casualty &amp; Sur. Co., </em>5 Wis. 2d 535 (1958) (affirming liability of insurance company for injuries sustained when insured\u2019s automobile struck plaintiff while insured was attempting to use the automobile to evade arrest). The omissions alleged in the negligence counts amount to reckless, not wilful conduct. Thus, the SMP policies cover the claims of negligence by Violet, Gerald, and Cheryl, to the extent that the claims do not seek recovery for the same acts that are the basis of the assault and battery claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>b. <em>Business-related exclusions in the homeowner\u2019s policies. </em>The insurance companies argue that the negligence<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> claims against Violet and Cheryl fall within the \u201cbusiness pursuits\u201d exclusions of their respective homeowner\u2019s policies.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We agree. The negligence claims plainly allege negligent failure to perform responsibilities incident to the insureds\u2019 business pursuits as directors of the school. The insureds\u2019 responsibilities \u201cto prevent the assault, rape and sexual molestation of the minor plaintiffs\u201d derive from the school\u2019s contractual agreement to provide care for the child tort plaintiffs. The negligence claims would have no factual basis were Violet and Cheryl not in positions of responsibility in the school, the operation of which was a business pursuit the insureds owned and engaged in for profit. See <em>Newell-Blais Post #443, Veterans of Foreign Wars of the U.S., Inc. </em>v. <em>Shelby Mut. Ins. Co., </em>396 Mass. 633, 636 (1986); <em>Ratner </em>v. <em>Canadian Universal Ins. Co., </em>359 Mass. 375, 379 (1971). \u201c[T]he manifest design of homeowners\u2019 insurance is to protect homeowners from risks associated with the home and activities related to the home.\u201d <em>Worcester Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Marnell, </em>398 Mass. 240, 245 (1986). The alleged negligence of Violet and Cheryl is in no way \u201cassociated with\u201d or \u201crelated to\u201d the home. These claims are not covered by the homeowner\u2019s policies.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">6. <em>Consortium claims. </em>The Uniform Complaint prays for consortium damages but does not include a separate claim by the adult tort plaintiffs for loss of consortium. Thus, the issue whether any consortium claims are covered by the insurance policies is only arguably within the purview of the first re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>ported question. See Appendix. Nevertheless, because the parties have argued the issue, and because the plaintiffs are free to amend their complaints (see Mass. R. Civ. P. 15 [b]), we discuss it.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">a. <em>The homeowner\u2019s policies. </em>Worcester\u2019s homeowner\u2019s policy defines \u201cbodily injury\u201d as \u201cbodily injury, sickness or disease, including care, loss of services and death resulting therefrom.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The policy provides coverage for \u201call sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury [i.e., bodily injury, <em>including </em>care and loss of services resulting therefrom] or property damage, to which this insurance applies, caused by an occurrence.\u201d The exclusion for expected or intended injury compels the exclusion from coverage of the bodily injuries themselves. See section 1, <em>supra. </em>The injuries to the adult tort plaintiffs in the form of \u201ccare and loss of services,\u201d however, remain within the scope of coverage, unless trial of the issues demonstrates that the insured intended to injure the adult tort plaintiffs.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Nevertheless, Worcester argues that the phrase \u201cresulting therefrom\u201d \u201cmakes clear that care and loss of services are a subset of bodily injury, sickness or disease and that, therefore, coverage for a claim for loss of consortium cannot exist unless there is coverage for the bodily injury . . . from which it resulted.\u201d Worcester\u2019s argument appears to be that only \u201ccare [and] loss of services\u201d resulting from a <em>covered </em>bodily injury are covered. Nothing in the policy language compels such a result. The policy provides coverage for bodily injury and for care and loss of services resulting therefrom, subject to the <em>later </em>limiting phrase \u2014 which triggers the exclusion \u2014 \u201cto which this insurance applies.\u201d Only the initial bodily injury (assault and battery) is excluded by this limitation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>See <em>Interstate Fire &amp; Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Stuntman Inc., </em>861 F.2d 203 (9th Cir. 1988) (clause providing coverage for damages \u201cbecause of personal injury\u201d includes coverage for emotional injuries arising out of physical injuries not covered under the terms of an unrelated exclusion).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Worcester argues that \u201ccoverage for loss of consortium is derivative of coverage for the underlying bodily injury.\u201d This argument also fails. We have rejected the argument that consortium claims are essentially derivative on a number of previous occasions. See <em>Pinheiro </em>v. <em>Medical Malpractice Joint Underwriting Ass\u2019n of Mass., </em>406 Mass. 288, 291 (1989); <em>Bilodeau </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mut. Casualty Co., </em>392 Mass. 537, 539 (1984); <em>Feltch </em>v. <em>General Rental Co., </em>383 Mass. 603, 607 (1981). Although it is clear that a consortium claim bears a \u201csymbiotic\u201d relation to the initial claim of injury to a spouse or other family member, <em>Corrigan </em>v. <em>General Elec. Co., </em>406 Mass. 478, 480 (1990), it is an independent injury, explicitly included in the policy coverage through the policy\u2019s definition of bodily injury. Cf. <em>Pinheiro, supra </em>at 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Moreover, we would apply the exclusion to the consortium injuries only if such injuries were <em>unambiguously </em>excluded by the policy language. Worcester\u2019s argument convinces us merely that the policy may be ambiguous. \u201cIt is well established that, where an insurer drafts the policy ... all ambiguities are resolved against the insurer.\u201d <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Tabor, </em>407 Mass. 354, 362 (1990), quoting <em>Transamerica Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Norfolk &amp; Dedham Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>361 Mass. 144, 147 (1972). See <em>Quincy Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Abernathy, </em>393 Mass. 81, 83 (1984). Thus, the homeowner\u2019s policy covers any consortium injury that is not itself subject to an exclusion.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>b. <em>SMP policies. </em>Worcester\u2019s SMP policies provide coverage for \u201call sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury ... to which this insurance applies, caused by an occurrence.\u201d Bodily injury is defined as \u201cbodily injury, sickness or disease sustained by any person which occurs during the policy period, including death at any time resulting therefrom.\u201d Unlike the definition of bodily injury in the homeowner\u2019s policies, this definition of bodily injury does not appear to include consortium injuries. Consortium injuries are covered, however, as \u201cdamages <em>because of </em>bodily injury,\u201d as long as the bodily injuries are ones \u201cto which this insurance applies, caused by an occurrence.\u201d This \u201coccurrence\u201d qualification excludes consortium injuries arising out of the assaults and batteries. See section 1, <em>supra. </em>It does not, however, exclude consortium injuries relating to bodily injuries suffered by the minor tort plaintiffs as a result of negligence or breach of warranty. See sections 4 and 5a, <em>supra. </em>Cf. <em>Hazen Paper Co. </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., </em>407 Mass. 869 (1990) (clause providing coverage for \u201cdamages because of . . . property damage\u201d covers costs of reimbursing government agencies for toxic waste clean-up).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Worcester argues that we should not construe consortium claims as \u201cdamages because of bodily injury,\u201d because nothing in the policy indicates that there is coverage for suits brought by third parties (such as consortium claimants) for losses occasioned by a covered bodily injury. We note, however, that nothing in the policy language excludes such coverage. Indeed, the simplest and most direct interpretation of \u201cdamages because of bodily injury\u201d includes any damages, including loss of consortium, arising from a bodily injury. Because any ambiguity is resolved against Worcester, see <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Tabor, supra; Quincy Mut. Fire Ins. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number><em>Co. </em>v. <em>Abernathy, supra, </em>Worcester\u2019s argument on this point is without merit.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">7. <em>Multiple occurrences. </em>The eighth reported question asks us whether it can be determined as a matter of law \u201cthat the claims of the underlying tort plaintiffs arise from no more than one occurrence, thereby limiting each insurer\u2019s<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> liability, if any, to the applicable \u2018per occurrence\u2019 policy limit?\u201d The SMP policies define \u201coccurrence\u201d as \u201can accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions, which results in bodily injury.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The term \u201coccurrence\u201d that appears in the policies was used by the insurance industry instead of the term \u201caccident\u201d beginning in the 1960\u2019s. The term \u201coccurrence\u201d was adopted \u201cto dispel any existing notion that [coverage] was limited to sudden happenings,\u201d Rosow &amp; Liederman, An Overview to the Interpretive Problems of \u201cOccurrence\u201d in Comprehensive General Liability Insurance, 16 Forum 1148, 1149 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">The question, in essence, asks us to determine whether the facts alleged are susceptible to the interpretation, advanced by Worcester, that the \u201csingle, ongoing cause of the children\u2019s injuries was their continuous and repeated exposure to abusive conditions at the School.\u201d Relying on <em>Appalachian Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>676 F.2d 56 (3d Cir. 1982), and <em>Transport Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Lee Way Motor Freight, </em>487 F. Supp. 1325, 1330 (N.D. Tex. 1980), Worcester argues that the abuse of the children in this case must be interpreted as a single \u201coccurrence.\u201d The cases relied on by Worcester hold that in circumstances where many corporate employees suffered from a discriminatory corporate employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>ment policy, there was but one \u201coccurrence\u201d: the adoption of the discriminatory policy. We need not decide if we would follow those cases if faced with similar facts, because those cases are fundamentally different from the facts before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">The tort plaintiffs allege numerous discrete acts of abuse, negligence, and breach of duty by several different defendants, some individual and one corporate, at different locations. These allegations preclude the possibility that there was but a \u201csingle, ongoing cause\u201d of the injuries alleged. Further, we have rejected attempts by insurers to characterize seemingly discrete events as emanating from a single, ongoing cause. See, e.g., <em>Continental Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Gilbane Bldg. Co., </em>391 Mass. 143, 151 (1984) (rejecting insurer\u2019s interpretation that a second episode of structural damage to a building was an extension of an earlier incident of breakage); <em>Slater </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., </em>379 Mass. 801, 809 (1980) (refusing to interpret employee scheme to execute numerous small thefts as a single occurrence). We do so here as well.

The stipulation of facts notes that the insurance comanies reserve their right to object to the admission of Dr. Yudowitz\u2019s testimony and to offer their own expert or experts. Because the question is not before us, we express no opinion concerning the admissibility of Dr. Yudowitz\u2019s testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The complete absence from the record of any evidence of mental disease or defect renders irrelevant the tort plaintiffs\u2019 argument concerning the burden of proof, in light of the parties\u2019 agreement that \u201call of the material facts to determine the issues\u201d are contained in the stipulation of facts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b415-7\"><em>Massachusetts Property Ins.

That case concerns the question whether the criminal conviction of the insured precludes the relitigation of issues determined in the criminal trial. Although, under <em>Norrington, </em>the tort plaintiffs are not <em>precluded </em>from relitigating the tort defendants\u2019 ability to form an intent to injure, nothing in the record before us permits the inference that the tort defendants were unable to form such an intent. Moreover, the parties have agreed that \u201call of the material facts to determine the issues ... are contained in the Stipulation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b415-8\">Our conclusion on this point makes it unnecessary for us to answer the second reported question. See Appendix.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b416-5\">In California, the Courts of Appeal have disagreed on the issue, and the California Supreme Court is now considering it.

We need not reach this issue, because we conclude that the acts alleged would not trigger vicarious liability even under the broader standard cited by the tort plaintiffs. None of the acts of forcible sexual molestation or rape can be interpreted as \u201coriginating in\u201d any legitimate activities \u201cclosely associated with the employment relationship.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The Indiana Supreme Court cited <em>Vannah </em>v. <em>Hart Private Hosp., </em>228 Mass. 132 (1917), in support of its extension of common carrier liability to hospitals.
