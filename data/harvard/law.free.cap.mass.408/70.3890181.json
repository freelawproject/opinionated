On May 11, 1985, Gregory A. Santos, II, the four year old son of Gregory A. Santos and Renee Santos, while riding a three wheel \u201cbig-wheel\u201d bike, was struck and killed by a 1977 Ford Granada automobile owned and operated by Anna A. Durling. Durling\u2019s insurance policy, issued by Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company (Fireman\u2019s), provided mandatory coverage for bodily injury to others in the amounts of $10,000 per person and $20,000 per accident. The plaintiffs negotiated a settlement with Fireman\u2019s, assented to by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>defendant Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Company (Lumbermens), in which the plaintiffs received $20,000. That sum is insufficient to cover the amount of damages sustained by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Gregory Santos\u2019 1983 Ford Ranger automobile was covered at the time of the accident by a Massachusetts automobile insurance policy issued by the defendant Lumbermens. The policy, effective October 1, 1984, provided coverage of up to $100,000 per person and up to $300,000 per accident for injury to Gregory Santos or to any member of his household caused by an uninsured or underinsured automobile. Gregory Santos paid an annual premium of $36 for this underinsurance coverage. Renee Santos had a separate insurance policy with Lumbermens at the time of the accident (effective January 1, 1985), covering her 1979 Oldsmobile Cutlass automobile, and also providing uninsured or underinsured coverage of $100,000 maximum per person and $300,000 maximum per accident, for which she paid an annual premium of $40.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Gregory Santos and Renee Santos demanded $300,000 under each insurance policy issued by Lumbermens. After Lumbermens refused to tender the $600,000, the plaintiffs made proper demand for arbitration, asserting claims for the conscious pain and suffering of their son; for consortium-like damages of the next of kin under the wrongful death statute; for punitive damages due to the gross negligence of Anna A. Durling; and for funeral and burial expenses. See G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2 (1988 ed.). After certain coverage issues, which form the basis of this case, arose during the arbitration proceeding, the plaintiffs commenced this action in the Superior Court for Plymouth County under the Declaratory. Judgment Act, G. L. c. 231A (1988 ed.). The judge reported this case to the Appeals Court. We granted the parties\u2019 joint application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>The following are the reported questions:</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">1. Whether and to what extent the $100,000 \u201cper person,\u201d $300,000 \u201cper accident,\u201d underinsurance coverage provided under the automobile insurance policy issued by Lumbermens to Renee Santos effective January 1, 1985, upon her 1979 Oldsmobile motor vehicle may be \u201cstacked\u201d with or upon the $100,000 \u201cper person,\u201d $300,000 \u201cper accident,\u201d underinsurance coverage provided under the automobile insurance policy issued by Lumbermens to Gregory A. Santos effective October 1, 1984, upon his 1983 Ford motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">2. In an action for wrongful death arising out of a motor vehicle accident commenced by the administrator of the decedent\u2019s estate under G. L. c. 229 (1988 ed.), for purposes of determining the amounts of underinsurance coverage available under the applicable standard 1984 and 1985 Massachusetts Automobile Insurance policies (with the mandatory endorsements), when and to what extent is the administrator considered to be a separate \u201cperson\u201d in his presentation and prosecution of:</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">(a) the claim of decedent\u2019s estate under G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2 (2), for funeral and burial expenses;</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">(b) the claim of decedent\u2019s estate under G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2 (3), for punitive damages in such case where a decedent\u2019s death was caused by the reckless conduct or gross negligence of the underinsured tortfeasor;</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">(c) the claim of decedent\u2019s estate under G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 6, for decedent\u2019s conscious pain and suffering prior to his death; and</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">(d) the claim of decedent\u2019s next of kin under G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2 (1), for consortium-like damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-11\">3. Whether the underinsurance provisions of the two automobile insurance policies applicable here provide coverage for an award of punitive damages made under G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2 (3), as a result of the recklessness or gross negligence of the underinsured tortfeasor, Anna A. Durling.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>4. Whether the defendant Lumbermens is subrogated under the policies to any sums that the plaintiffs may recover from third-party nonmotorist tortfeasors due to underinsurance coverage payments that Lumbermens may make to the plaintiffs under the policies in excess of the $10,000 compulsory underinsurance coverage of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L (1988 ed.), and the $15,000 mandatorily-offered optional additional underinsurance coverage of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113C (1988 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">1. <em>Stacking. </em>Lumbermens rightly concedes that the plaintiffs are entitled to \u201cstack\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the combined underinsurance coverages per person under each policy at least up to $125,000.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Lumbermens contends, however, that the plaintiffs may not stack the $100,000 per person benefits of Gregory Santos\u2019 policy with the $100,000 per person benefits of Renee Santos\u2019 policy, or Gregory Santos\u2019 $300,000 per accident benefits with Renee Santos\u2019 $300,000 per accident benefits. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Lumbermens argues that the \u201canti-stacking\u201d exclusion in the policy prohibits the plaintiffs from recovering more than $125,000 per injured person. The exclusion provides: \u201cYou may have two or more auto policies with us covering the same claim. In that case, the most we will pay is the highest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>amount payable under the applicable coverage in any one of those policies.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">\u201c[W]hen there is no ambiguity, we will construe the words of an insurance policy according to their ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Cardin </em>v. <em>Royal Ins. Co., </em>394 Mass. 450, 453 (1985). The anti-stacking exclusion is unambiguous. In the \u201cIntroduction\u201d portion of each policy, the word \u201cyou\u201d is defined as follows: \u201cThis insurance policy is a legal contract between the policy-owner (you) and the company (we or us).\u201d The \u201cDefinitions\u201d portion of each policy provides: \u201cYou or Your refers to the person named on the Coverage Selections Page.\u201d Each policy contained a name on the coverage selections page, just after the phrase \u201cthis policy is issued to.\u201d \u201cYou,\u201d then, refers to the owner of each policy. See <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Am. Ins. Cos., </em>397 Mass. 38, 41 &amp; n.2 (1986). The word \u201chave\u201d connotes ownership. <em>Busteed </em>v. <em>Cambridge Savs. Bank, </em>306 Mass. 9, 14 (1940). \u201cYou may have two or more auto policies with us\u201d thus refers to a situation where one policy owner holds two or more policies with Lumbermens. Such is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">The policy covering the Ford automobile listed Gregory A. Santos on the Coverage Selections Page, and the policy covering the Oldsmobile automobile listed Renee Santos. Each policy provided $100,000 maximum per person underinsurance coverage, for which each named insured paid a separate premium. Each policy is a separate obligation by Lumbermens to pay up to the stated coverage amounts in the event of an accident to a covered person.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">At the time of the accident, G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L, did not prohibit stacking the underinsurance benefits of two separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>policies.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The coverage at issue here was \u201cpurely optional and thus entirely a matter of contract.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Hanover Ins. Co., </em>400 Mass. 259, 266 (1987). <em>Woodman </em>v. <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co., </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 1120, 1122 (1989). The Santoses each contracted with Lumbermens for $100,000 maximum per person underinsurance coverage, and nothing prohibits them from stacking their benefits under each policy.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">2. <em>\u2019\u2019Per person\u201d limitation. </em>We now consider, under the terms of each policy, when and to what extent the administrator in the wrongful death action may be considered a separate \u201cperson\u201d with respect to the various claims in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">We first examine the policy of Gregory A. Santos, issued in 1984. We recite the relevant language from the policy: \u201cThe most we will pay for injury to any one person as a result of any one accident is [$100,000]. The most we will pay for injuries to two or more people as a result of a single accident is [$300,000] ,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Lumbermens contends that, in a wrongful death action, there is only one \u201cperson\u201d to whom it must pay for injuries \u2014 namely, the administrator. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">Under the wrongful death statute, G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2, a \u201cpersonal representative\u201d may bring an action \u201con behalf of the designated categories of beneficiaries.\u201d <em>Gaudette </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>362 Mass. 60, 71 (1972). General Laws c. 229, \u00a7 2, states in pertinent part: \u201cA person who (1) by his negligence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>causes the death of a person, or (2) by willful, wanton or reckless act causes the death of a person . . . shall be liable in damages in the amount of: (1) the fair monetary value of the decedent to the persons entitled to receive the damages recovered, as provided in section one, including but not limited to compensation for the loss of the reasonably expected net income, services, protection, care, assistance, society, companionship, comfort, guidance, counsel, and advice of the decedent to the persons entitled to the damages recovered; (2) the reasonable funeral and burial expenses of the decedent; (3) punitive damages in an amount of not less than five thousand dollars in such case as the decedent\u2019s death was caused by the malicious, willful, wanton or reckless conduct of the defendant or by the gross negligence of the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ae6\">General Laws c. 229, \u00a7 1, referred to in the above quoted sentence, lists the persons entitled to receive damages, if the decedent has no spouse or issue, as the \u201cnext of kin.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> These individuals are thus allowed to pursue, through the administrator, their consortium-like damages. The reasonable burial expenses and any punitive damages are recoverable by the estate regardless of the existence or identities of beneficiaries. <em>Burt </em>v. Meyer, 400 Mass. 185, 189 (1987). In addition, damages recovered for conscious pain and suffering are considered to be \u201cassets of the estate of the deceased.\u201d G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 6. <em>Pobieglo </em>v. <em>Monsanto Co., </em>402 Mass. 112, 118 (1988). \u201cAlthough G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 6 . . . permits the joinder of separate counts for death and for conscious suffering in a single action, they are separate causes of action.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Gaudette </em>v. <em>Webb, supra </em>at 62. In this case we conclude that there are three separate injured persons: (1) Gregory A. Santos, who utilizes the administrator as a \u201cconduit\u201d to recover his consortium-like claims, <em>Gaudette </em>v. <em>Webb, supra </em>at 72; (2) Renee Santos, for her consortium-like claims; (3) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>estate, for the claims of punitive damages,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> funeral and burial expenses, and conscious pain and suffering of the deceased.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We disagree with Lumbermens\u2019 contention that because one administrator brings an action under the wrongful death statute, only one \u201cperson\u201d can be considered \u201cinjured\u201d under the insurance policy. In <em>Bilodeau </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mut. Casualty Co., </em>392 Mass. 537 (1984), we held that a loss of consortium claimant is a separate \u201cinjured person\u201d under a policy identical in all relevant respects to that in this case. We do not think that the procedural framework of the wrongful death statute, through which an administrator brings an action on behalf of the next of kin, makes each person who has suffered consortium-like damages any less injured. Cf. <em>Norman </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>403 Mass. 303, 308 (1988). To hold otherwise would elevate form over substance, looking less at the question, \u201cwho is injured,\u201d and more at the question, \u201cwho is technically bringing the suit.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">We realize that our decision today differs in part from the conclusion reached by the Appeals Court in <em>Doyon </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemn. Co., 22 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 336 (1986).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Appeals Court in that case placed undue stress on the word \u201camount\u201d in G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2. As <em>Burt </em>v. <em>Meyer, supra </em>at 186, 191, shows, the amount recovered in a wrongful death action is not a \u201csingle indivisible amount\u201d as the Appeals Court suggested <em>(Doyon </em>v. <em>Travelers Indem. Co., supra </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>339), but an amount which is intended to be distributed to the various beneficiaries and the estate. We decline to follow the result or reasoning of <em>Doyon.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">We turn now to Renee Santos\u2019 automobile policy, which contains different operative language pertinent to this question. Her policy, which was effective January 1, 1985, contains a 1985 mandatory endorsement promulgated by the Commissioner of Insurance intended to eliminate the effect of our decision in <em>Bilodeau </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mut. Casualty Co., supra. </em>See <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>395 Mass. 765 (1985). In relevant part, Renee Santos\u2019 amended policy provided: \u201cThe most we will pay for injuries to one or more persons as a result of bodily injury to any one person in any one accident is shown on the Coverage Selections Page as the \u2018per person\u2019 limit. Subject to this limit, the most we will pay for injuries to two or more people as the result of bodily injury to two or more people in any one accident is shown on the Coverages Selections Page as the \u2018per accident\u2019 limit.\u201d This language is clear and unambiguous. It explicitly applies the \u201cper person\u201d limitation to injuries to one or more persons, which result from bodily injury to any one person in any one accident. As such, it does not allow for separate \u201cper person\u201d treatment of the consortium-like claims in this case, for they arose as a result of bodily injury to \u201cany one person,\u201d in this case, Renee Santos\u2019 son. As we stated recently, \u201c[t]he Commissioner effectively changed the <em>Bilodeau </em>result by modifying the \u2018per person\u2019 liability language.\u201d <em>Pinheiro </em>v. <em>Medical Malpractice Joint Underwriting Ass\u2019n of Mass., </em>406 Mass. 288, 295-296 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Renee Santos, under her policy, then, is limited to the $100,000 per person maximum recovery with respect to all of the claims arising from the injury to and death of her son.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>3. <em>Punitive damages. </em>We consider next whether punitive damages<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> are recoverable under the underinsurance provisions of each automobile insurance policy.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">We begin our analysis by considering what is required under G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L, the statute which mandates compulsory uninsured and underinsured coverage. That statute provides, in relevant part: \u201cNo policy shall be issued or delivered in the commonwealth with respect to a motor vehicle . . . unless such policy provides coverage <em>in amounts or limits prescribed for bodily injury or death </em>for a liability policy under this chapter ... for the protection of persons insured thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of uninsured motor vehicles . . . and hit- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>and-run motor vehicles <em>because of bodily injury, sickness or disease, including death resulting therefrom, </em>and coverage for the protection of persons insured thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of insured motor vehicles . . . whose policies or bonds are insufficient in limits of liability to satisfy said damages\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The statute does not state explicitly whether punitive damages may be recovered under a compulsory underinsurance policy. We think there is some ambiguity as to whether recovery of punitive damages is encompassed within the phrases \u201ccoverage . . . for bodily injury or death\u201d and \u201clegally entitled to recover damages . . . because of bodily injury . . . including death.\u201d Compare <em>Braley </em>v. <em>Berkshire Mut. Ins. Co., </em>440 A.2d 359, 361 (Me. 1982) (\u201cfor bodily injury\u201d refers to compensatory, not punitive, damages); <em>Mullins </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>683 S.W.2d 669, 673 (Tenn. 1984) (Drowota, J., dissenting) (\u201cbecause of bodily injury\u201d properly describes compensatory, not punitive, damages) with <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., </em>104 N.M. 744, 746 (1986) (\u201cbecause of bodily injury\u201d includes punitive damages, which are predicated on actual damages).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">We may resolve this ambiguity by examining \u201cthe cause of [the statute\u2019s] enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished.\u201d <em>Lynn Teachers Union, Local 1037 </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>406 Mass. 515, 524 (1990), quoting <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>393 Mass. 482, 488 (1984). See <em>Cardin </em>v. <em>Royal Ins. Co., </em>394 Mass. 450, 454 (1985). We have stated that \u201cthe purpose of the uninsured motor vehicle statute [is] to provide the availability of compensation for bodily injury or death caused by a tortfeasor who is uninsured.\u201d <em>Surrey </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mut. Casualty Co., </em>384 Mass. 171, 173 (1981). \u201c[T]he aim of the uninsured motorist statute is to minimize the catastrophic financial loss for victims of automobile accidents caused by the negligence of uninsured tortfeasors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 177. See <em>Cardin </em>v. <em>Royal Ins. Co., supra </em>at 454. General Laws c. 175, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>\u00a7 113L, mandates coverage \u201cfor the protection of persons insured,\u201d which also suggests a compensatory purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Punitive damages under the wrongful death statute, G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2, serve different purposes. \u201c \u2018[T]he purposes underlying the allowance of punitive damages . . . are punishment of the defendant and deterrence of future wrongdoing.\u2019 <em>Schulhof </em>v. <em>Northeast Cellulose, Inc., </em>[545 F. Supp. 1200, 1206 (D. Mass. 1982)], quoting <em>In re Air Crash Disaster near Chicago, III., on May 25, 1979, </em>644 F.2d 594, 613 (7th Cir.), cert, denied, 454 U.S. 878 (1981). <em>Valcourt </em>v. <em>Hyland, </em>503 F. Supp. 630, 639 (D. Mass. 1980). Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 908 (1979). \u2018Such damages are not awarded to compensate the plaintiff.\u2019 <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>World Airways, Inc., </em>596 F. Supp. 841, 846 (D. Mass. 1984).\u201d <em>Burt </em>v. <em>Meyer, </em>400 Mass. 185, 189 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">We do not think that the Legislature, in devising a statutory scheme by which the victim of an underinsured motorist may be compensated for his or her losses, obligated the insurer to provide coverage for punitive damages. Allowing recovery of punitive damages would not serve the purpose of compensating the injured party. See <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>162 Ariz. 251 (1989); <em>Braley </em>v. <em>Berkshire Mut. Ins. Co., supra </em>at 362; <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Mendenhall, </em>164 Ill. App. 3d 58, 62 (1987). The wrongful death statute allows for compensation in a subsection distinct from that providing for punitive damages. See G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2. Nor would allowance of punitive damages under the underinsurance statute further the purposes of punitive damages. Requiring an insurance company to pay punitive damages to the insured would not serve to deter wrongdoing or punish the wrongdoer; rather it would result in payment of punitive damages by a party who was not a wrongdoer. See <em>California State Auto. Ass\u2019n Inter-Ins. Bureau </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>164 Cal. App. 3d 257, 261-262 (1985); <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Daughdrill, </em>474 So. 2d 1048, 1052 (Miss. 1985); <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Milwaukee Mut. Ins. Co., </em>121 Wis. 2d 574, 580 (Wis. Ct. App. 1984). In the underinsurance context, where the wrongdoer is not in a contractual relationship with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>the insurance company, there is not even the possible deterrent effect of higher premium rates. See <em>Braley </em>v. <em>Berkshire Mut. Ins. Co., supra </em>at 363. It is not enough .to say that the insurance company may sue the tortfeasor to recover the punitive damages. Cf. <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., supra </em>at 747. In the case of hit-and-run drivers, there may be no tortfeasor to sue, and the probability of recovering from other underinsured tortfeasors, who often are judgment-proof, is not great. See <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra; Braley </em>v. <em>Berkshire Mut. Ins. Co., supra </em>at 363; <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Milwaukee Mut. Ins. Co., supra </em>at 580; <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Mendenhall, supra </em>at 62. See also Note, Uninsured Motorist Insurance Now Covers Punitive Award \u2014 <em>Hutchinson </em>v. <em>J.C. Penney Casualty Ins. Co., </em>19 Akron L. Rev. 325, 328 n.27 (1985). In sum, neither the purposes of the underinsurance statute nor the wrongful death statute will be served by requiring that punitive damages shall be considered as part of the \u201cdamages\u201d allowable under G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The insurance policies in this case essentially track the language of the statute. They provide: \u201cSometimes an owner or operator of an auto legally responsible for an accident is uninsured or underinsured. . . . Under this Part, we will pay <em>damages for bodily injury </em>to people injured or killed in certain accidents caused by uninsured, underinsured, or hit and run autos. We will pay only if <em>the injured person is legally entitled to recover </em>from the owner or operator. . . . We will pay damages to . . . [ajnyone else for <em>damages he or she is entitled to recover because of injury to a person </em>covered under this Part\u201d (emphasis supplied). We refrain from construing this language against Lumbermens, considering that the words find their source in the statutory provisions of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L. See <em>Bilodeau </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mut. Casualty Co., </em>392 Mass. 537, 541 (1984). \u201c[T]he fair meaning of the language used, as applied to the subject matter,\u201d in light of the above discussion concerning the interpretation of nearly identical statutory language, <em>id. </em>quoting <em>Save-Mor Supermarkets, Inc. </em>v. <em>Skelly Detective Serv., Inc., </em>359 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>221, 226 (1971), leads us to conclude that punitive damages are not recoverable under the terms of the policy.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">4. <em>Subrogation rights. </em>Finally, we consider the question of Lumbermens\u2019 subrogation rights under the policies in question. Each policy contained the following exclusion: \u201cSometimes you or someone else may recover money from the person legally responsible for an accident and <em>also </em>receive money from us for the same accident. If so, the amount we paid must be repaid to us to the extent that you or someone else recovers. . . . Whenever we are entitled to repayment from anyone, the amount owed us can be reduced by our proportionate share of the costs of recovery of the money, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Both parties agree that this provision applies to money recovered by the insured from <em>nonmotorist </em>third-party tortfeasors. The Santoses, however, contend that the subrogation provision contravenes the legislative policy underlying G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L. They argue that Lumbermens should not be entitled to recover any money the plaintiffs receive from third parties until they have recovered an amount more than their full damages. The Santoses argue that we should reconsider our recent holding in <em>Bertassi </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>402 Mass. 366, 372 (1988), which decided this issue against them. We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">In <em>Bertassi, </em>we held that subrogation provisions identical to those in this case did not conflict with the objectives of the Legislature in mandating underinsurance coverage. We stated that \u201c[a] person in the plaintiff\u2019s circumstances is entitled to be compensated to the extent of the applicable automobile liability insurance, plus, as a minimum, an amount equal to the limit of his underinsurance coverage.\u201d Under the subrogation provisions, \u201cwhen the plaintiff recovered an additional $20,000 from other alleged [nonmotorist] tortfeasors, that $20,000 was recovered for [the insurer\u2019s] bene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>fit,\u201d even though the plaintiff had not been compensated to the full extent of his loss. <em>Id. </em>at 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">That decision is consistent with the framework of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L. That statute was enacted to provide protection against uninsured and underinsured <em>motorists. </em>The statute does not, and was not intended to, provide protection against uninsured or underinsured <em>nonmotorist </em>tortfeasors. Indeed, subsection four of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L, itself provides the insurer with subrogation rights with respect to coverage required under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">The Santoses, perhaps anticipating that we would not overrule <em>Bertassi, </em>argue that Lumbermens should not be entitled to exercise its subrogation rights with respect to the <em>optional </em>underinsurance provisions of the two policies. \u201cWe must construe the words of the policy according to \u2018the fair meaning of the language used, as applied to the subject matter,\u2019 ... as long as the statutory language or legislative policy of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L, is not contravened.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Hanover Ins. Co., </em>400 Mass. 259, 266 (1987), quoting <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Fireman's Fund Am. Ins. Cos., </em>397 Mass. 38, 40 (1986). The subrogation provision\u2019s terms, with respect to damages exceeding the mandatory limits, was optional and \u201centirely a matter of contract.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Hanover Ins. Co., supra </em>at 266. The subrogation provision\u2019s terms are unambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">The Santoses argue that because the insurance policy was a \u201ccontract of adhesion,\u201d the subrogation provision should be declared null and void. It is true that in a situation of this type, where an individual consumer enters into a standardized contract with an insurance company, there is most often an inequality of bargaining power. See <em>Cardin </em>v. <em>Royal Ins. Co., </em>394 Mass. 450, 453 (1985). See also <em>Steven </em>v. <em>Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. of N.Y., </em>58 Cal. 2d 862, 879 (1962); <em>C &amp; J Fertilizer, Inc. </em>v. <em>Allied Mut. Ins. Co., </em>227 N.W.2d 169, 173-177 (Iowa 1975); Keeton, Insurance Law Rights at Variance with Policy Provisions, 83 Harv. L. Rev. 961, 966-967 (1970). It is this concern, in part, which animates our rule that ambiguous insurance policy provisions are to be strictly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>construed against the insurer. Cf. <em>Koshland </em>v. <em>Columbia Ins. Co., </em>237 Mass. 467, 472 (1921). However, the fact that an insurance policy may be considered a \u201ccontract of adhesion\u201d does not lead to the invalidation of all its exclusions. See <em>Lechmere Tire &amp; Sales Co. </em>v. <em>Burwick, </em>360 Mass. 718, 720-721 (1972). Where an insurance policy provision leads to an unconscionable result, or violates public policy, it may be held invalid even if, upon a close reading, the terms are clear. See <em>Liberty Mut. Co. </em>v. <em>Tabor, </em>407 Mass. 354, 358 (1990); <em>Lechmere Tire &amp; Sales Co. </em>v. <em>Burwick, supra. </em>Cf. <em>Minassian </em>v. <em>Ogden Suffolk Downs, Inc., </em>400 Mass. 490, 492 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">In this case, we do not think that enforcement of the subrogation provision leads to an unconscionable result or violates public policy. The policy did not purport to provide coverage for damages caused by nonmotorist uninsured or underinsured tortfeasors. It stated: \u201cWe will pay only if the injured person is legally entitled to recover from the <em>owner or operator of the uninsured, underinsured or hit and run </em>auto\u201d (emphasis supplied). We would be hard-pressed to declare as violative of public policy a provision which, at least with respect to mandatory underinsurance, has been explicitly sanctioned by the Legislature. See G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L (4). We do not think the result is so unconscionable as to require invalidation of the provision. See <em>Lechmere Tire &amp; Sales Co. </em>v. <em>Burwick, supra </em>at 721.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">5. <em>Summary. </em>We summarize our answers to the reported questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">1.
