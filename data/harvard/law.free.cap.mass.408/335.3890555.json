The plaintiff then brought this action alleging in a verified complaint that the unannounced, warrantless, suspicionless urinalysis test, in which supervisory personnel watched the cadets urinating, violated the plaintiff\u2019s rights secured by various articles of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution. The plaintiff asserted rights to injunctive relief and damages based directly on the alleged constitutional violations and also pursuant to the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, G. L. c. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 11H and 111 (1988 ed.). Also in his complaint, the plaintiff claims that the defendants violated his rights under the Commonwealth\u2019s invasion of privacy statute, G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 IB, when a supervisor at the academy told other cadets that the plaintiff had been dismissed for failing the urinalysis test.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">The plaintiff moved for summary judgment on one of the four counts in his complaint, and the defendants moved for summary judgment on all counts. A judge denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion and allowed that of the defendants. The plaintiff appealed, and we transferred the case here on our own initiative. We now affirm the judgment for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>The following undisputed facts have been established for purposes of the defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion. The plaintiff was appointed to the department in June, 1988, and was assigned to the academy for several weeks of training. When appointed, the plaintiff signed a form in which he agreed to submit to urinalysis when requested to by the department. On September 6, 1988, the plaintiff, along with all other probationary recruits at the academy, submitted a urine sample to be tested for the presence of drugs. The sample was contained in a bottle with a label showing the cadet\u2019s name and identification number and was placed with a \u201cchain of custody\u201d form into a sealed evidence bag and then into a box in accordance with established written department procedure. The plaintiff was discharged from the academy on September 9, 1988, after the urinalysis test revealed traces of cocaine. A few days later, an officer told the remaining cadets that the plaintiff had been dismissed from the academy because he had failed his drug test. The plaintiff\u2019s test results were not divulged by the defendants to the general public or potential employers of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">In addition to those undisputed facts, other relevant facts asserted by the plaintiff in his verified complaint and by affidavit remain in dispute. In ruling on the defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion, the judge assumed the plaintiff\u2019s disputed assertions to be true, and we do likewise. See <em>Coveney </em>v. <em>President &amp; Trustees of the College of the Holy Cross, </em>388 Mass. 16, 17 (1983). Accordingly, we assume that the plaintiff was directly and closely observed by supervising officers while providing the urine sample, that other recruits had access to the box in which the cadets\u2019 samples were kept, and that the plaintiff\u2019s test results were \u201cnot kept confidential\u201d to the extent they were divulged to other cadets.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">On appeal, the plaintiff\u2019s arguments based on the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights appear to be limited to art. 14. The plaintiff argues that direct observation by supervisory personnel of the plaintiff\u2019s act of urination is an unreasonable invasion of privacy in violation of his rights protected by art. 14. He also argues that such tests violated his art. 14 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>rights regardless of the closeness of supervision because they were conducted without probable cause or even reasonable suspicion that incriminatory evidence would be discovered thereby. The plaintiff appears to argue that he is entitled to relief for the violation of his art. 14 rights both under G. L. c. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 11H and 111, and independently of that statute. The plaintiff does not argue that the test was legally deficient from a reliability standpoint. Finally, the plaintiff contends that the defendants violated his privacy interests under G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 IB, by informing his fellow cadets of his test results.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The plaintiff's arguments that are predicated on art. 14 and G. L. c. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 11H and 111, are controlled by our decision in <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, supra </em>at 328-329, 331-332. We hold in that case, as we hold in this case, that the drug testing by urinalysis of a police cadet who has agreed to drug testing by urinalysis as a precondition to employment whether or not the testing is closely supervised, does not violate art. 14 or c. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 11H and 111, because the public interest in discovering and deterring drug use by police officers outweighs the invasiveness of the search. <em>Id. </em>at 328-329.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">We turn to the invasion of privacy claim under G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 IB. The plaintiff argues that the defendants violated that statute when his superior officer told the other cadets about his dismissal from the academy for testing positive for drugs. General Laws c. 214, \u00a7 IB, provides in relevant part: \u201cA person shall have a right against unreasonable, substantial or serious interference with his privacy.\u201d In the employment context, \u201c[i]n determining whether there is a violation of \u00a7 IB, it is necessary to balance the employer\u2019s legitimate business interest in obtaining <em>and publishing </em>the information against the substantiality of the intrusion on the employee\u2019s privacy resulting from the disclosure\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Bratt </em>v. <em>International Business Machs. Corp., </em>392 Mass. 508, 521 (1984). This principle applies to public as well as private employment. <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, supra </em>at 330. As we have stated above in connection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>with the plaintiff\u2019s art. 14 and G. L. c. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 11H and 111, arguments, the public, and therefore the defendants, have a legitimate interest in deterring drug use by police cadets. See <em>O\u2019Connor, supra </em>at 328-329. Furthermore, deterrence is clearly served by prompt disclosure to those who passed the drug test that those who did not had been dismissed. In view of the public interest served by such limited publication, together with the diminution of the cadets\u2019 reasonable expectation of privacy due to the obvious physical and ethical demands of their employment, see <em>O\u2019Connor, supra </em>at 328, the balance of interests as a matter of law weighs in favor of the defendants. There is no genuine issue of material fact bearing on the G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 IB, claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The judge correctly ordered summary judgment for the defendants on all the plaintiff\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b350-9\">Unlike the plaintiff in <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, supra </em>at 329-331, the plaintiff here does not assert that the urinalysis test violated his rights under G.
