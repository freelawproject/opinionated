L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 [1988 ed.]). The evidence warranted a finding that, before his arrest, the defendant had consumed codeine for which he had a prescription. Chapter 90, \u00a7 24 (l)(a)(l), of the General Laws makes it an offense to operate a motor vehicle while under the influence of \u201cnarcotic drugs . . . as defined in [G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 l].\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There was no direct evidence that codeine is a narcotic drug as defined in G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The defendant moved for a required finding of not guilty. The trial judge denied the motion, erroneously ruling that \u201cthe law states that prescription drugs are narcotics.\u201d On appeal, the Appeals Court concluded, on different grounds, that the evidence was sufficient to warrant a guilty finding, but ordered a new trial because of reversible error on issues we need not consider. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Green, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 762, 765, <em>711 </em>(1989). That court concluded that codeine is a derivative of opium, and therefore is within the definition of a narcotic drug in G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 1. It regarded the evidence as sufficient on two grounds: (1) a reading of G. L. c. 94C in its entirety, not just \u00a7 1 of that chapter, shows that in G L. c 94C the Legislature treated codeine as a narcotic drug <em>{id. </em>at 765-767), and (2) a judge may appropriately take judicial notice that codeine is a derivative of opium and thus is a narcotic drug as defined in \u00a7 1 <em>{id. </em>at 767-769).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>We agree with the Appeals Court that the trial judge could have taken judicial notice that codeine is a derivative of opium,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but he did not take judicial notice of that fact, even when requested to do so. It is inappropriate to supply an essential element of proof by taking judicial notice of a fact at the appellate level. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kingsbury, </em>378 Mass. 751, 755 (1979) (\u201cWe would not supplement the Commonwealth\u2019s proof on appeal by taking judicial notice of a fact not submitted to the jury\u201d). We thus conclude that proof that codeine is derivative of opium was not made at trial and may not now be made by the taking of judicial notice by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Consequently, the evidence was sufficient to warrant the defendant\u2019s conviction only if, as a matter of law, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 1, includes codeine within the definition of \u201cnarcotic drugs.\u201d Section 1 defines a \u201cnarcotic drug\u201d to include derivatives of opium, but it says nothing about codeine itself. Section 24 (l)(a)(l) of G. L. c. 90 directs us only to the definition of \u201cnarcotic drug\u201d in \u00a7 1 of G. L. c. 94C, not to all of G. L. c. 94C. Consideration of the status of codeine in G. L. c. 94C as a whole would be contrary to the explicit direction of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (l)(a)(l), and inconsistent with this court\u2019s traditional policy that we construe criminal statutes narrowly against the Commonwealth. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marrone, </em>387 Mass. 702, 706 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clinton, </em>374 Mass. 719, 721 (1978), and cases cited.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because the evidence did not show that codeine is a narcotic drug as defined in G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 1, and because \u00a7 1 does not make it so by its terms, the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty should have been allowed. The Commonwealth could have easily met its burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>proof that codeine was a derivative of opium by presenting expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The judgment is reversed. The verdict is set aside. Judgment shall be entered for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b63-6\">Chapter 94C, \u00a7 1, defines \u201cnarcotic drug\u201d as \u201cany of the following, whether produced directly or indirectly by extraction from substances of vegetable origin, or independently by means of chemical synthesis, or by a combination of extraction and chemical synthesis:</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">(a) Opium and opiate, and any salt, compound, derivative, or preparation of opium or opiate;</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">(b) Any salt, compound, isomer, derivative, or preparation thereof which is chemically equivalent or identical with any of the substances referred to in clause (a), but not including the isoquinoline alkaloids of opium;</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">(c) Opium poppy and poppy straw;</p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">(d) Coca leaves and any salt, compound, derivative, or preparation of coca leaves, and any salt, compound, isomer, derivative, or preparation thereof which is chemically equivalent or identical with any of these substances, but not including decocainized coca leaves or extractions of coca leaves which do not contain cocaine or ecgonine.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b64-6\">We do not agree that judicial notice that codeine is a derivative of opium could be taken as a matter of common knowledge. <em>Id. </em>at 767. On the other hand, it is a subject of generalized knowledge readily ascertainable from authoritative sources, and thus appropriate for judicial notice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whynaught, </em>377 Mass. 14, 17-18 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b64-7\">If codeine had been defined by statute as a narcotic drug, judicial notice of that fact would have been neither necessary nor appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
