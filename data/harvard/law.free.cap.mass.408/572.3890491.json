L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>c. 59, \u00a7 20A (1988 ed.). At issue is whether the Boston Water and Sewer Commission (BWSC) is entitled to the protection of c. 59, \u00a7 20A,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> with respect to assessments imposed upon it for sewerage services provided by the Metropolitan District Commission (MDC).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">After a hearing, a Superior Court judge allowed the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on December 21, 1988. The plaintiff, BWSC, seasonably appealed to the Appeals Court and we transferred the appeal to this court on our own motion. We hold that BWSC is not entitled to the protection of c. 59, \u00a7 20A. Accordingly, we affirm the judgments of the Superior Court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">The facts are not in dispute. In July of 1977, the Boston Water and Sewer Reorganization Act, St. 1977, c. 436, created the Boston Water and Sewer Commission as an independent \u201cbody politic and corporate and political subdivision of the commonwealth.\u201d \u00a7 3. The BWSC became responsible for owning and operating the sewerage and water supply systems within the city of Boston. Until the formation of the BWSC, Boston was a member of the Metropolitan Sewerage District, the Metropolitan Water District, and the Metropolitan Parks District (MSD, MWD, and MPD), respectively. All three were divisions of the MDC. In accordance with \u00a7\u00a7 5 and 6 of c. 436, the BWSC\u2019s enabling act, Boston\u2019s memberships in the Metropolitan Sewerage and Water Districts were transferred to the BWSC.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>From 1982 through 1985, the MDC services were funded from the State treasury. The treasury in turn received funds through assessments upon MDC district members, including BWSC, in accordance with G. L. c. 92. To collect the funds, the Treasurer sent warrants to each city or town which was a member of an MDC district. Boston, which had retained its membership in the MPD only, received these warrants. The BWSC, as provided in c. 436, paid the portion of the Boston assessment that covered the MDC\u2019s water and sewerage services. The MSD assessments for the fiscal years 1982 through 1985 are the subject matter of this litigation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">In its current form, c. 59, \u00a7 20A, limits the amount of certain assessments to cities and towns to \u201ctwo and one-half per cent of the total of such costs, charges or fees over the preceding fiscal year.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiff contends that \u00a7 20A applied to the MDC assessments for the years 1981 through 1985, and that such application should have capped the annual increases in assessments upon BWSC for sewerage services provided by the MDC during fiscal years 1982 through 1985.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The plaintiff argues that, under its enabling act, c. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>436, the BWSC inherited all rights and obligations of the city.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It contends that, since c. 59, \u00a7 20A, would have capped MDC assessments had they been paid directly by the city, the protection of c. 59, \u00a7 20A, should, in turn, be afforded the BWSC. The defendants contend that, under the plain meaning and purpose of c. 59, \u00a7 20A, which refers to assessments upon \u201ccities and towns,\u201d the BWSC is not within the protection of the statute. We agree with the defendants\u2019 assertion and therefore affirm the Superior Court judge\u2019s allowance of summary judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">1. <em>Chapter 59, \u00a7 20A. </em>Chapter 59, \u00a7 20A, \u201ccaps\u201d any increase in costs, charges, or fees upon \u201ccities and towns\u201d at two and one-half per cent of the total of such charges or fees in the preceding fiscal year. The BWSC is not a \u201ccity or town\u201d as provided for in the statute and therefore is not entitled to its protection. The BWSC is an independent \u201cbody politic and corporate and political subdivision of the commonwealth\u201d established by a special act.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> St. 1977, c. 436, \u00a7 3. Under the basic tenets of statutory construction, \u201c[t]he statutory language, when clear and unambiguous, must be given its ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Bronstein </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number><em>Co., </em>390 Mass. 701, 704 (1984). Here, the statute refers to \u201ccities and towns.\u201d No ordinary meaning of these terms can include the BWSC.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">In <em>Kargman </em>v. <em>Boston Water &amp; Sewer Comm\u2019n, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 51, 59 (1984), the Appeals Court determined that the BWSC was an \u201cindependent body politic and corporate\u201d and not a \u201cpublic employer\u201d under G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 1. A \u201c[pjublic employer\u201d is defined in that statute as \u201cthe commonwealth and any county, <em>city, town . . . </em>and any department, office, <em>commission, </em>committee . . . which exercises direction and control over the public employee\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 1. We likewise decline BWSC\u2019s invitation to define it as anything but an \u201cindependent body politic and corporate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Chapter 59, \u00a7 20A, may not be construed so as to protect such entities as the BWSC.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">In addition to the plain language of both c. 59, \u00a7 20A, and the enabling act, the purposes of \u00a7 20A further strengthen the determination that the BWSC is not entitled to this protection. Section 20A was originally enacted as part of Propostion <em>2Vi </em>(St. 1980, c. 580, \u00a7 12). In <em>Massachusetts Teachers Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>384 Mass. 209, 221 (1981), this court held that \u201c[a] 11 the subjects included in Proposition <em>2Vi </em>relate directly or indirectly to the limitation of State and local taxation.\u201d Section 20A was intended to provide relief from taxation. The BWSC obtains its funding from fees and charges (St. 1977, c. 436, \u00a7 7 [b]) and from bonds and notes (\u00a7 12). It is not supported by tax revenues. Therefore, the tax relief of c. 59, \u00a7 20A, would not be applicable to the BWSC, as no tax benefits would be gained even with application of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">2. <em>The enabling act. </em>The BWSC argues that it is \u201csimplistic\u201d to deny it protection solely because it is not a city or town. The BWSC states that, under \u00a7 5 of its enabling act, it \u201csteps into the shoes\u201d of the city and, therefore, is entitled to whatever protection \u00a7 20A would afford Boston. The BWSC\u2019s enabling act, c. 436, \u00a7 5, states, in part, that \u201call debts, liabilities and obligations of the city pertaining to or on account of the water works system and the sewerage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>works system . . . <em>shall be assumed by </em>and <em>imposed upon the commission-, </em>provided that all liabilities of the city in tort . . . <em>shall not be assumed </em>. . . but <em>shall continue to be the liabilities of the </em>city\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The plain language of c. 436 leads us to the conclusion that the city did <em>not </em>continue to be liable for these assessments after the establishment of the commission. Therefore, there were no shoes into which to step. All of the city\u2019s liability for assessments was \u201cassumed by and imposed upon\u201d the BWSC. <em>Id. </em>By assumption of the liability, the BWSC became the primary obligor to the MDC. <em>Merrill </em>v. <em>Prebilt Co., </em>329 Mass. 166, 169 (1952). The MDC assessments were \u201cimposed upon\u201d the BWSC, not the city. Boston was not a member of the MSD or the MWD in any of the relevant years and therefore had no liability for the assessments. It is immaterial that the Treasurer\u2019s warrants were first sent to the city, which then forwarded the water and sewerage portion to the BWSC. This was merely a ministerial action which did not, as the plaintiff argues, transform the assessments into assessments \u201cupon\u201d the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">3. <em>Equalization aid. </em>Given the Legislature\u2019s grant of aid to nonmembers of the MSD in 1984 and 1985, a ruling for the BWSC in this case would, in effect, give the residents of Boston a double recovery. Beginning in 1982, the Commissioner of Revenue was charged with calculating the \u00a7 20A limits upon assessments (G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 21D). The Commissioner did not calculate limits for the BWSC because it was not a city or town. In fiscal years 1982 and 1983, it was the Commonwealth\u2019s view that MDC services were not subject to the limits of \u00a7 20A. Therefore, assessments for those years exceeded the respective caps. During 1983, however, the Commonwealth acknowledged that MDC assessments to cities and towns were and had been subject to \u00a7 20A, and had previously exceeded the caps. Accordingly, not only were 1984 assessments to cities and towns held within the <em>2lh% </em>limit, but were reduced by an aggregate of almost $10,000,000 to remedy past over assessments. Compensating for the past overassessments left the MDC with a shortage of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>funds. To make up for the shortfalls, the Legislature granted the MDC special appropriations in 1984 and 1985. St. 1984, c. 188, \u00a7 16. St. 1985, c. 200, \u00a7 21. In the interest of fairness, the Legislature conferred so-called \u201cequalization aid\u201d in 1984 and 1985 to \u201ccities and towns which are not a part of both the Metropolitan Parks District and the Metropolitan Sewerage District.\u201d St. 1984, c. 188, \u00a7 2, item 1599-3318. St. 1985, c. 200, \u00a7 2, item 1599-3318.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Although assessments to the BWSC were not reduced in 1984, the city did receive $1,376,062 in \u201cequalization aid\u201d due to its nonmembership in the MSD. The defendants argue that to grant BWSC reduced assessments here would result in duplicative remedies to the citizens of Boston: one due to the equalization aid already received and another due to reduced assessments damages. We agree. The Legislature intended to treat communities equally by granting the aid only to those communities, including Boston, who had not received reduced MDC assessments. By granting the BWSC the protection of \u00a7 20A by way of reduced assessments, we would, in effect, be granting Boston residents a double recovery where the Legislature intended only one.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">The BWSC contends that the Legislature did not realize that the city would be benefiting from the equalization aid. The plaintiff asserts that the Legislature mistakenly believed that Boston\u2019s sewerage district assessments had been reduced by Proposition <em>2lh </em>and therefore the city would not be benefiting from the equalization aid it was granting. In support of its argument, the plaintiff offers statements of State representatives made on the House floor. We reject the plaintiff\u2019s notion that the Legislature was simply ignorant of the facts. Statements of individual legislators as to their motives concerning legislation are an inappropriate source from which to determine the intent of legislation. <em>Administrative Justice of the Hous. Court Dep\u2019t </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Admin., </em>391 Mass. 198, 205 (1984). We continue to adhere to the longstanding principle that the Legislature is \u201cpresumed to understand and intend all consequences\u201d of its acts. <em>Rambert </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>389 Mass. 771, 774 (1983). The Legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>did indeed grant equalization aid to the city in an amount in excess of $1.3 million. We presume, as we must, that the Legislature provided this aid with the understanding that the citizens of Boston had not benefited from the reduction of assessments under Propostion <em>2xh.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b587-7\"> Chapter 59, \u00a7 20A, was adopted originally as part of the tax limitation measure commonly known as Proposition 2Vi (St. 1980, c. 580, \u00a7 12), which was approved by the voters of Massachusetts on November 4, 1980.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b587-8\"> In July of 1985, the defendant Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA), acquired all relevant operations of the MDC\u2019s sewerage and water districts. The plaintiffs claims relate only to assessments levied for MDC services prior to July of 1985. MWRA was joined as an alleged successor in interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b587-9\"> Given our determination that G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 20A, does not apply to the BWSC, we do not reach the question whether the \u00a7 20A cap on assessments applies to the aggregate assessments by the MDC for all its divisions, or whether such cap must be calculated separately for each division\u2019s assessments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b588-6\"> On July 1, 1985, the MSD and MWD were dissolved and the provisions of G. L. c. 92 which pertained to them were repealed. St. 1984, c. 372, \u00a7 30.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b588-7\"> General Laws c. 59, \u00a7 20A, inserted by St. 1980, c. 580, \u00a7 12, reads as follows: \u201cNo county, district, public authority or other governmental entity authorized by law to assess costs, charges or fees upon cities or towns may increase the total of such costs, charges or fees with respect to any city or town in any fiscal year by more than four percent over the total of such costs, charges or fees for such city or town for the preceding fiscal year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">Section 20A was amended effective January 1, 1982. St. 1981, c. 782, \u00a7 9. That amendment reduced the allowable assessment increases from four per cent to two and one-half per cent and included the MDC and the Commonwealth among those entities governed by the limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">The plaintiff contends that the MDC was subject to the limitations of \u00a7 20A even before the 1981 amendment. Given our determination that the BWSC is not afforded the protection of c. 59, \u00a7 20A, we do not reach the question whether the MDC was within the ambit of the statute\u2019s earlier version.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b588-10\"> The over-all MSD November, 1981, assessment was 16.1 % greater than the corresponding 1980 assessment, and the portion assessed to the city and payable by BWSC was 17.1 % greater than the 1980 BWSC assessment. The BWSC instituted a suit in the Superior Court challenging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>the validity of the November, 1981, assessment. The MSD assessment of November, 1982 (for fiscal year 1983) was 15.9% over the November, 1981, assessment with the BWSC\u2019s portion increasing 12.5%. The BWSC filed a second suit challenging the November, 1982, assessment and the Commissioner of Revenue\u2019s failure to calculate limits under G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 21D. In November, 1983, the over-all MSD assessment (for fiscal year 1984) decreased as the Commonwealth determined that Proposition <em>2Vi </em>did indeed apply to its assessments of cities and towns. However, the BWSC share increased 4.1%. The BWSC sued for the third time contesting the November 1983 and 1984 assessments. The three cases were consolidated in Superior Court and are now the subject matter of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b589-13\"> The plaintiff contends that it is heir to whatever protection G.
