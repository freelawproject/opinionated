Employer Lockheed Martin Corporation (Lockheed) and its insurer, Bankers Standard Insurance Company (Bankers), petitioned for review of a decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (Board or WCAB) reversing the finding of a workers\u2019 compensation administrative law judge (WCJ) that employee applicant Virginia McCullough suffered no compensable psychiatric injury. We granted the petition and now reverse the Board\u2019s order in case No. WCK 32177.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-4\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">In 1986, while employed by General Electric (G.E.), McCullough sustained an admitted industrial injury to her left forearm and was awarded 35.5 percent permanent disability. In 1988, she filed another claim against G.E. alleging cumulative pulmonary and internal trauma (exposure to toxic chemicals), later adding an allegation of associated psychiatric injury. During the period ending April 1996, while employed by Lockheed, she sustained admitted cumulative injury to her right upper arm and neck and alleged additional psychiatric and internal injury (case No. WCK 32177).</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-6\">The WCJ found: (1) McCullough had never sought to reopen her first claim, as to which she was not entitled to further temporary disability indemnity, and the evidence did not justify, on an industrial basis, medical treatment for her psychiatric condition; (2) she did not sustain injury to her pulmonary or internal organs, or to her psyche, arising out of and in the course of her G.E. employment; and (3) she <em>did </em>sustain injury to her right upper arm and neck at Lockheed (for which she was awarded 27.75 percent permanent disability and future medical treatment), but not to her psyche or internal organs. In particular, the WCJ found McCullough\u2019s aggravated psychological state did not satisfy the threshold of compensability established by section 3208.3, subdivision (b)(1),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which he ruled applicable to <em>all </em>psychiatric injuries, even those incurred as a consequence of a physical work injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-7\">McCullough petitioned for reconsideration, challenging, inter alia, the WCJ\u2019s interpretation of section 3208.3, which she asserted does not apply to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1241\">*1241</page-number>a psychiatric injury that is a compensable consequence of an orthopedic injury. In his report and recommendation on her petition, the WCJ discounted the precedential value of the Board panel decision on which McCullough relied, <em>Rebelo </em>v. <em>Washington Hospital </em>(1999) SJ 195868, 27 Cal. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rptr. 159 <em>(Rebelo).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">The Board granted reconsideration and reversed the WCJ\u2019s order with respect to the claims based on McCullough\u2019s 1986 and 1996 injuries, finding in each case that under <em>Rebelo, </em>she <em>did </em>sustain psychiatric injury as a compensable consequence of the admitted industrial physical injury. Accordingly, the Board awarded her further psychiatric care in both cases, and increased her permanent disability award to 34 percent in the latter. As to the alleged 1988 injury, reconsideration was denied. Lockheed and Bankers (hereafter collectively Lockheed) filed a timely petition for writ of review; G.E. did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-8\">A. <em>Statutory Construction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1027-9\">\u201cAlthough the WCAB\u2019s findings on questions of fact are conclusive [citation], the construction of a statute and its applicability to a given situation are matters of law that are reviewable by the courts.\u201d <em>(Rex Club v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 1465, 1470-1471 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 393].) \u201cThe Board\u2019s administrative construction of statutes that it is charged to enforce and interpret is entitled to great weight unless it is clearly erroneous. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ralphs Grocery Co. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 820, 828 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 197].) \u201cAn erroneous interpretation or application of law by the WCAB is a ground for annulment of [its] decision. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Rex Club, supra, </em>53 Cal.App.4th at p. 1471.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-10\">\u201cThe fundamental goal of statutory interpretation is to \u201cascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Juran v. Epstein </em>(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 882, 893 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 588].) In determining legislative intent, courts must look first to the plain words of the statute, but statutes must also be construed in light of their historical background and evident objectives <em>(ibid.), </em>especially if the statutory language is ambiguous, i.e., susceptible of more than one reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1242\">*1242</page-number>interpretation <em>(Granberry </em>v. <em>Islay Investments </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 738, 744 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 650, 889 P.2d 970]). In general, the Legislature has directed us to construe workers\u2019 compensation laws \u201cliberally . . . with the purpose of extending their benefits for the protection of persons injured in the course of their employment.\u201d (\u00a7 3202.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-4\">B. <em>Section 3208.3</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\">\u201cLabor Code section 3208.3 was enacted as part of the Margolin-Greene Workers\u2019 Compensation Reform Act of 1989. It is part of the Legislature\u2019s response to increased public concern about the high cost of workers\u2019 compensation coverage, limited benefits for injured workers, suspected fraud and widespread abuses in the system, and particularly the proliferation of workers\u2019 compensation cases with claims for psychiatric injuries.\u201d <em>(Hansen v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Bd. </em>(1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 1179, 1183-1184 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 30] <em>(Hansen), </em>fn. omitted.) \u201cThe Legislature\u2019s expressed intent in enacting Labor Code section 3208.3 was to establish a new and higher threshold of compensability for psychiatric injury.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1184, citing \u00a7 3208.3, subd. (c).) As originally enacted, therefore, subdivision (b) of the statute provided, \u201cIn order to establish that a psychiatric injury is compensable, an employee shall demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that actual events of employment were responsible for at least 10 percent of the total causation from all sources contributing to the psychiatric injury.\u201d (Stats. 1989, ch. 892, \u00a7 25, p. 3003.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-6\">In 1991, section 3208.3 was amended to add subdivision (d), which provided that no compensation shall be paid for psychiatric injury resulting from a \u201cregular and routine employment event\u201d (including lawful personnel actions) unless the employee has been employed by the employer for at least six months. \u201cThe Legislature\u2019s apparent purpose in enacting subdivision (d) of section 3208.3 was to limit questionable claims for psychiatric injuries resulting from routine stress during the first six months of employment.\u201d <em>(Hansen, supra, </em>18 Cal.App.4th at p. 1184.) As the <em>Hansen </em>court explained, this policy decision was based on the fact that a new employee is customarily on probation for the first six months of employment, during which time problems often occur which may \u201cresult in disciplinary action, resignation, or termination and lead to claims of psychiatric injury due to stress.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>However, subdivision (d) also stated, <em>\u201cNothing in this section shall be construed to mean that there shall not be compensability for any psychiatric </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1243\">*1243</page-number><em>injury which is related to any physical injury in the </em>workplace.\u201d (Stats. 1991, ch. 115, \u00a7 4, p. 684, eff. July 17, 1991; italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-6\">In 1993, the Legislature again amended section 3208.3, increasing the causation requirement for work-related psychiatric injury from 10 percent to more than half. (See <em>ante, </em>fn. 2; <em>Department of Corrections v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 810, 815-816 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 716] [\u201cpredominant as to all causes\u201d means more than 50 percent].) At the same time, the italicized sentence quoted above was <em>deleted </em>from subdivision (d). (Stats. 1993, ch. 118, \u00a7 1, pp. 1225-1226.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-7\">C. <em>The Board\u2019s Interpretation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1029-8\">In <em>Bechtel Corporation &amp; Industrial Indemnity Insurance Company </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board </em>(1999) 64 Cal.Comp.Cases 661 <em>(Bechtel), </em>the Board affirmed a WCJ\u2019s ruling and declined to apply section 3208.3, subdivision (d)\u2019s six-month employment provision to a 1994 claim of psychiatric injury as a compensable consequence of admitted industrial injuries to the claimant\u2019s back (as opposed to \u2018\u201can independent or separate psychiatric injury claim\u2019 \u201d) absent specific language from the Legislature or any appellate authority. <em>(Bechtel, </em>at p. 662.) The Board did not believe the 1993 amendments had undermined the <em>Hansen </em>court\u2019s conclusion \u201c \u2018that the overriding purpose and the focus of the Legislature in enacting that [s]ection was to eliminate questionable psychiatric claims arising from short-term employment exposure.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Division Three of this court denied the employer\u2019s writ petition. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 663.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-9\">In <em>Rebelo, supra, </em>27 Cal. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rptr. 159, the Board rescinded a WCJ\u2019s order and ruled that \u201cthe requirements of Labor Code section 3208.3 do not apply to a psychiatric injury that is alleged to be a compensable consequence of a [1996] physical industrial injury.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 160.) Despite the omission effected by the 1993 amendment of subdivision (d), the Board nonetheless \u201cfound it worthy of note that the Legislature did not disturb the long-standing rule of compensable consequences when it enacted \u00a7 3208.3.\u201d <em>(Rebelo, </em>at p. 159.) \u201cAlthough the \u2018compensable consequence\u2019 doctrine has a long-standing foundation in workers\u2019 compensation law, the panel continued, compensable consequence injuries are nowhere described in \u00a7 3208.3. Nor were compensable consequences the subject or focus of the amendments to the statute that were directed to reducing or eliminating psychiatric claims due to stress arising from employment exposure. That is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1244\">*1244</page-number>the legislature was focused on psychiatric injuries resulting from employment events as opposed to the compensable consequences of an admitted physical injury. Thus, the panel was not persuaded that the deleting of the last sentence of \u00a7 3208.3(d) in 1993 was intended to do away with the compensability of psychiatric consequences of a physical injury.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 159-160.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-4\">There was apparently no appellate review of <em>Rebelo, </em>but the Board expressly followed its rationale in two other \u201cwrit denied\u201d cases. First, in <em>Circle K. Corporation, Travelers Insurance Company v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board </em>(1999) 65 Cal.Comp.Cases 64 <em>(Circle K), </em>the WCJ ruled the applicant\u2019s claimed psychiatric injury was a compensable consequence of an admitted 1996 industrial injury to her head, neck and shoulder. He found that section 3208.3, subdivision (b)(1) did not apply and, in the alternative, that the opinion of the qualified medical examiner justified a finding that the applicant\u2019s psychiatric injury was, in fact, predominantly caused by her admitted physical injury. <em>(Circle K, </em>at p. 65.) In granting reconsideration, the Board adopted and incorporated the WCJ\u2019s analysis and reiterated the <em>Rebelo </em>panel\u2019s conclusion that the Legislature\u2019s focus in enacting section 3208.3 was on reducing or eliminating stress claims \u201carising from the very brief exposure window in the initial stage of employment.\u201d <em>(Circle K, </em>at p. 65.) Alternatively, if a compensable-consequence psychiatric injury <em>is </em>governed by the statute, the precipitating orthopedic injury constitutes \u201c \u2018an \u201cactual event of employment\u201d \u2019 \u201d within the meaning of subdivision (b)(1). <em>(Circle K, </em>at p. 65.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-5\">Finally, in <em>County of Monterey, PSI, Helmsman Management Services v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board </em>(2000) 65 Cal.Comp.Cases 853 <em>(Monterey), </em>the applicant suffered a bilateral wrist injury in 1994. The psychiatric evaluator apportioned 60 percent of her psychiatric injury to the industrial injury, assuming the loss of medical insurance resulting from her absence from work was a compensable consequence of the wrist injury. If not, he apportioned 50 percent of the psychiatric injury to industrial factors. The WCJ found the loss of insurance was nomndustrial, and 50 percent industrial causation did not meet the statutory threshold. The Board granted reconsideration and rescinded the WCJ\u2019s finding based on \u201c \u2018the principle of compensable consequences, as applied in the <em>Rebelo </em>and <em>Bechtel </em>cases\u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 855), i.e., section 3208.3 does not apply to a claim of psychiatric disability resulting from physical industrial injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1245\">*1245</page-number>Thus, in the absence of appellate guidance, various panels of the Board have consistently taken the same position on this issue for over two years.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nevertheless, in the case before us, the WCJ characterized <em>Rebelo </em>as \u201conly a panel decision of the appeals board not entitled to much weight\u201d and concluded from \u201cthe sequence of legislative changes in the language of \u00a7 3208.3\u201d that the Legislature \u201cintended to raise the standard for all psychiatric injuries, even those incurred as a consequence of a physical injury.\u201d He noted that <em>Circle K\u2019s </em>\u201cvalue as precedent is low\u201d because there the applicant\u2019s physical injuries were indeed the predominant cause of her psychiatric injury. He was not familiar with <em>Monterey. </em>In reversing the WCJ, the Board repeated its statement in <em>Rebelo </em>that \u201cthe \u2018predominant cause\u2019 threshold does not apply to a psychiatric condition which is a compensable consequence, regardless of the date of injury. \u2018Compensable consequence injuries are nowhere described in \u00a7 3208.3.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-5\">D. <em>Resolution</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1031-6\">Until now, there has been no appellate authority on this issue. We are not bound by either Board panel decisions such as <em>Rebelo, </em>or writ denied cases such as <em>Bechtel, Circle K, </em>and <em>Monterey,</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> (Smith v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 530, 537, fn. 2 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 186].) The language of section 3208.3, subdivision (b)(1) clearly and unambiguously refers to the compensability of a \u201cpsychiatric injury,\u201d without any exceptions. The Legislature undoubtedly knows how to enact an exception as it did in 1991, and the fact that it later deleted that exception would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1246\">*1246</page-number>appear determinative.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cWhen the Legislature deletes an express provision of a statute, it is presumed that it intended to effect a substantial change in the law. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Royal Co. Auctioneers, Inc. v. Coast Printing Equipment Co. </em>(1987) 193 Cal.App.3d 868, 873 [238 Cal.Rptr. 538].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-4\">Lockheed submits that this is the only reasonable interpretation of the statute as it has evolved through successive amendments but, acknowledging that \u201cthose with opposing viewpoints often interpret the same plain language in different ways,\u201d requests judicial notice (Evid. Code, \u00a7 452) of selected documents furnished by the Legislative Intent Service. Exhibit H to the petition contains materials relating to the 1993 amendments, specifically, excerpts of 4 of the 51 documents the service sent Lockheed\u2019s attorney. Lockheed claims these materials demonstrate that insurance industry \u201cconcerns\u201d about the proposed amendment led to deletion of section 3208.3, subdivision (d)\u2019s previous exemption, that the Legislature expressly intended the increased threshold of compensability to apply to all psychiatric claims, not just \u201c \u2018mental-mental,\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that a different but related Assembly bill provided for psychiatric injury resulting from aggravation of physical injury to be governed by the \u201cpredominant cause\u201d provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-5\">We need not tarry over the propriety of judicial notice or the reliability of Lockheed\u2019s scant documentation as evidence of legislative intent, since it adds almost nothing that is not evident from the mere deletion of section 3208.3, subdivision (d)\u2019s last sentence. Neither McCullough nor her amici curiae (see <em>post, </em>at pp. 1247 &amp; 1248) have directed us to, nor have we independently found, any evidence whatever in the legislative history of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1247\">*1247</page-number>the 1993 amendments to section 3208.3 supporting the conclusion that the Legislature did not mean to repeal the previous exception by that deletion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1033-6\">Nor have we been offered any convincing arguments for the Board\u2019s interpretation. McCullough suggests the Legislature deleted the exclusionary language because it was redundant, since section 3208.3, by definition, <em>never </em>applied to compensable consequences cases. But she offers no authority for any legally meaningful distinction between the \u201cpsychiatric component\u201d of a physical injury, as she now styles it, and the \u201cpsychiatric injury\u201d referred to in both the statute and the Board\u2019s compensable consequence decisions on which she relies. CAAA asserts that \u201cpsychiatric injury\u201d is a term of art referring <em>not </em>to the \u201cpsychiatric sequela[e]\u201d of physical injuries, but <em>only </em>to the initial determination of exclusively emotional harm generally arising out of work-related stress. Section 3208.3, subdivision (a), however, defines a compensable psychiatric injury as \u201ca mental disorder which causes disability or need for medical treatment\u201d and is diagnosed in accordance with prescribed criteria. As McCullough notes, this definition has remained substantially unchanged. The cases on which CAAA relies <em>(Cole v. Fair Oaks Fire Protection Dist. </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 148 [233 Cal.Rptr. 308, 729 P.2d 743]; <em>Hart </em>v. <em>National Mortgage &amp; Land Co. </em>(1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 1420 [235 Cal.Rptr. 68]; <em>Livitsanos v. Superior Court </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 744 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 808, 828 P.2d 1195]) do not support its contention. These cases established that emotional distress claims based on alleged misconduct that is a normal part of the employment relationship come within the exclusive remedy provisions of the workers\u2019 compensation law (\u00a7\u00a7 3600, 3601), which preclude civil suit. And this is true, regardless of whether related physical injury is alleged or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-7\">McCullough also argues the Legislature may have deleted the final sentence of section 3208.3, subdivision (d) because it was redundant in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1248\">*1248</page-number>\u201conce the exclusion was established in the 1991 version, it did not have to remain in the statute.\u201d One shudders to think of the effect of such an approach on the whole of California\u2019s statutory law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-4\">Amicus curiae California Society of Industrial Medicine &amp; Surgery, Inc. (CSIM&amp;S), asserts that the doctrine of compensable consequences \u201cencompasses\u201d the concept of predominant cause; that is, the \u201cbut for\u201d test mentioned in <em>Brock v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board </em>(1999) 64 Cal.Comp.Cases 86, 87, and <em>Shannon, supra, </em>62 Cal.Comp.Cases at page 1464\u2014Would the injury have occurred but for the defendant\u2019s conduct?\u2014is more stringent than section 3208.3\u2019s causation threshold. This assertion cannot withstand scrutiny. According to the cited authority, the \u201cbut for\u201d rule was one of two tests for establishing \u201ccause in fact,\u201d a concept \u201cincluded in the term proximate cause.\u201d <em>(Mitchell v. Gonzales </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 1041, 1049 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 913, 819 P.2d 872].)  \u201cThe tort concept of proximate causation,\u201d however, \u201cis not followed in workers\u2019 compensation. [Citation.] Instead, the causal connection between employment and the injury is sufficient if the employment is a contributing cause of the injury. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Guerra </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 195, 199 [214 Cal.Rptr. 58]; see also <em>Rebelo, supra, </em>27 Cal. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rptr. at p. 159.) \u201cSince the legislature expressly declared an intent to establish a new and higher threshold, <em>the 10 percent threshold </em>must be greater than the previous threshold for compensability. Prior law required as a threshold that the industrial component in the causation of psychiatric injuries ... be [inter alia] that \u2018but for\u2019 the work stress, the injury would not have occurred.\u201d (Hanna, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 4.02[3][c], p. 4-21, italics added, fns. omitted.) According to Hanna then, the \u201cpredominant cause\u201d threshold is appreciably higher than that required to establish \u201cbut for\u201d causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-5\">And logically, how could it be otherwise? If, as CSIM&amp;S asserts, the compensable consequence doctrine imposed a <em>higher </em>burden on the injured employee than the statute, the Board would not have found that although McCullough did not establish \u201cpredominant cause,\u201d she did meet the compensable consequence requirement. Nor would employers like Lockheed challenge Board decisions employing the compensable-consequence test.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-6\">Finally, the fact that the statute may have a \u201cdevastating effect\u201d on some honest claimants does not show the Legislature did not mean what it said.  \u201c \u2018This court has no power to rewrite the statute so as to make it conform to a presumed intention which is not expressed. [Citations.]\u2019 \u201d <em>{California Teachers Assn v. Governing Bd. of Rialto Unified School Dist. </em>(1997) 14 Cal.4th 627, 633 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 671, 927 P.2d 1175].) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1249\">*1249</page-number>Thus, CAAA\u2019s policy concerns, expressed in a parade of horribles\u2014delay or denial of benefits, delay in employees\u2019 return to work, litigation explosion, increased claims costs, increased strain on government benefit programs, defense solicitation of \u201cbought\u201d medical opinions\u2014are better addressed to the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-6\">We conclude that at least since the 1993 amendment, a \u201ccompensable consequence psychiatric injury\u201d is governed by section 3208.3, and the precipitating physical injury constitutes an \u201cactual event[] of employment\u201d within the meaning of subdivision (b)(1). That is, a consequential psychiatric injury is compensable if and only if it is more than half attributable to a physical industrial injury. Despite the Board\u2019s repeated contrary rulings (none of which has been reversed <em>or </em>affirmed by an appellate court) <em>and </em>the undeniable fact that the Legislature was aiming <em>primarily </em>at phony stress claims, especially those filed by disgruntled short-term former employees\u2014 see, e.g., subdivision (e) (additional conditions for compensation based on psychiatric claims filed after notice of termination or layoff) and the Governor\u2019s comment that \u201c[t]his legislation marks the beginning of the end for the stress-mill millionaires\u201d (quoted in <em>Sakotas v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(2000) 80 Cal.App.4th 262, 273 [95 Cal.Rptr.2d 153])\u2014the fact remains that we can imagine no other logical explanation for the 1993 deletion of the exclusionary language of subdivision (d). As amicus curiae California Workers\u2019 Compensation Institute puts it, \u201cThere is no rational basis for arguing that the alteration of statutory language is inconsequential, irrelevant, or meaningless.\u201d Moreover, the potential for fraud and the problems inherent in psychiatric claims, \u201cnotably vagueness in defining the injury and problems of establishing industrial causation and apportionment\u201d <em>(Hansen, supra, </em>18 Cal.App.4th at p. 1184), exist no less because the alleged psychiatric injury is related to a physical injury.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1035-7\">Conclusion and Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-8\">The WCJ correctly ruled that Labor Code section 3208.3 applies to all claims of psychiatric injury, including those resulting from physical work injuries, and the Board erred in reversing this ruling. Therefore, the Board\u2019s October 2, 2000 opinion and order granting reconsideration and decision after reconsideration are reversed and the matter remanded to the Board with instructions to issue a new and different order in case No. WCK 32177 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1250\">*1250</page-number>consistent with our opinion herein.

In at least two writ denied cases, the Board <em>did </em>apply section 3208.3 to compensable-consequence psychiatric injuries. In <em>Shannon </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board </em>(1997) 62 Cal.Comp.Cases 1462 <em>(Shannon), </em>it ruled that a psychiatric injury arising from a 1992 industrial foot injury did not satisfy the statute\u2019s threshold of compensability. Even though the applicable version of subdivision (d) contained the later-deleted language <em>excluding </em>psychiatric compensable consequences claims from the section\u2019s purview, the Board \u201cwas not persuaded that [subdivision] (d) invalidated the higher threshold of compensability set forth in subdivisions (b) and (c), <em>because that would defeat the purpose of the </em>statute.\u201d <em>(Shannon, supra, </em>62 Cal.Comp.Cases at p. 1464, italics added.) Similarly, in <em>Evans v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board </em>(1998) 63 Cal.Comp.Cases 443, the WCJ ruled in the applicant\u2019s favor and the Board reversed, but both apparently applied the statutory threshold (then 10 percent) to the causal nexus between the applicant\u2019s June 1991 (before the addition of subdivision (d)) foot injury and his subsequent suicide attempt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1031-8\">The case of <em>United Airlines, Inc., Alexsis Rick Management v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board </em>(1997) 62 Cal.Comp.Cases 1180, cited by amicus curiae California Applicants\u2019 Attorneys Association (CAAA), does not fall squarely into this category. Although the term \u201ccompensable consequence\u201d was used, the issue was not the applicability of section 3208.3, subdivision (b)(l)\u2019s causation threshold. Rather, the question was whether the applicant\u2019s psychiatric injury was the result of an orthopedic injury or a personnel action governed by section 3208.3, subdivision (h).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1032-6\">Of course, the Legislature does not always choose its words as carefully as it might. For example, the fact that the provision at issue here <em>(ante, </em>at p. 1243, italicized sentence) appears at the end of section 3208.3, subdivision (d), rather than as a separate subdivision, makes one wonder whether the Legislature meant that nothing in this <em>subdivision </em>(i.e., subdivision (d) regarding the six-month employment requirement) changes the rules in \u201ccompensable consequences\u201d psychiatric injury cases, rather than \u201c[n]othing in this <em>section,\u201d </em>as it says. If that were the case, consequential psychiatric injury would always have been subject to subdivision (b)\u2019s causation threshold, though for at least a few years, not to the six-month requirement. To confuse matters a bit more, the penultimate sentence of subdivision (d), as originally enacted, provided, \u201cNothing in this <em>subdivision\u201d </em>is meant to undermine the exclusive remedy doctrine. (Italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1032-7\">\u201cThere are three general types of psychological injury related to employment: (1) physical injury producing psychic trauma or symptoms not physiologically verifiable [physical-mental]; (2) psychic trauma producing physical injury [mental-physical]; and (3) psychic trauma producing psychological injury [mental-mental].\u201d (1 Hanna, Cal. Law of Employee Injuries and Workers\u2019 Compensation (rev. 2d ed., Tancor, edit., 2001) Psychoneurotic and Emotional Injuries, \u00a7 4.69[1], pp. 4-92 to 4-93, fn. omitted (Hanna).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1033-8\">It is worth noting that the 1993 amendment, which deleted the language excluding compensable consequence cases from the purview of section 3208.3, also added subdivision (b)(2), which provides: \u201cNotwithstanding paragraph (1) [predominant as to all causes], in the case of employees whose injuries resulted from being a victim of a violent act or from direct exposure to a significant violent act, the employee shall be required to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that actual events of employment were a substantial cause of the injury.\u201d Substantial cause is defined as \u201cat least 35 to 40 percent of the causation from all sources combined.\u201d (\u00a7 3208.3, subd. (b)(3).) In a situation where a violent act against an employee results in physical injury and consequent psychiatric injury, subdivision (b)(2) thus indicates that compensable consequences cases are <em>not </em>beyond the statute\u2019s reach. It is reasonable to infer that in 1993, the Legislature decided no longer to exempt <em>all </em>compensableconsequences psychiatric injury cases from the causation threshold requirement, but to lower that threshold slightly for cases in which the precipitating physical injury was the result of workplace violence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1035-9\">CSIM&amp;S asserts that in any event, 60 percent of McCullough\u2019s psychiatric injury was caused by her physical injury, and therefore, even if section 3208.3 <em>does </em>apply, she satisfied its causation threshold. We have carefully reviewed the record, particularly the November 18, 1998 report of psychiatrist Roy L. Curry and the Board\u2019s discussion thereof, and concluded it does not support the contention.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
