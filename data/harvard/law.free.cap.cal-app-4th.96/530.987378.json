J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4n1\">The newly elected president of petitioner Tracy Educators Association, CTA/NEA (the Association) requested a half-time leave of absence from her position as a schoolteacher in order to fulfill her responsibilities for the Association. The real parties in interest, Tracy Unified School District, its governing board and superintendent (collectively the District), rejected the request. The Association filed a petition for writ of mandate in the respondent superior court seeking to compel the District to grant the leave request, but the superior court denied the petition. Because we conclude the District was compelled by Education Code section 44987, subdivision (a) (hereafter section 44987(a)),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to grant the leave request, we shall order the issuance of a writ of mandate directing the respondent superior court to grant the writ petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">The District employs Julie Escobedo as a third grade bilingual teacher. In May 2001, Escobedo was elected president of the Association for a two-year term. On May 29, 2001, Escobedo wrote to the District, requesting that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>be released from her teaching position half-time, at the start of the 2001-2002 school year, to attend to the Association\u2019s business. Escobedo stated she would seek a bilingual teacher to share a job with her \u201c2.5 days a week or possibly every afternoon.\u201d Escobedo enclosed a copy of a provision of the Education Code (presumably section 44987(a)), which she asserted authorized her leave request so long as the Association reimbursed the District for her release time.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">On June 6, 2001, the District rejected Escobedo\u2019s half-time leave request, asserting the District may place reasonable limitations on leaves granted under the Education Code. The District maintained that a reasonable limitation is the amount of leave authorized for union business by the parties\u2019 \u201cMaster Agreement,\u201d i.e., up to 36 days or 180 periods of leave. The District further argued that granting Escobedo a half-time leave would adversely affect the school\u2019s \u201cbilingual program, its students, its teachers and the District\u2019s rights and powers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">On June 13, 2001, the Association\u2019s attorneys made an express demand on the District for Escobedo\u2019s half-time leave pursuant to section 44987(a). On June 19, 2001, and again on July 3, 2001, the District\u2019s attorneys responded that the District disagreed with the Association\u2019s interpretation of section 44987(a), but would agree to discuss alternatives to allow Escobedo to take a reasonable amount of leave time.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">On July 31, 2001, the Association filed a petition for writ of mandate in the respondent superior court, seeking an order directing the District to grant Escobedo\u2019s half-time leave request for the 2001-2002 and 2002-2003 school years. During the hearing on the petition, the District conceded that if Escobedo had requested a full-time leave of absence the District would have been compelled to grant her request.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">On August 31, 2001, the respondent court filed an order denying the petition, explaining: \u201cPetitioner\u2019s request was not for a \u2018leave\u2019 as contemplated by the [sic] Education Code [s]ection 44987. Moreover, the \u2018Association Leave\u2019 Article in the Master Agreement between the Parties does not conflict with the Education Code; it offers benefits not otherwise available under the Education Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">On September 7, 2001, the Association filed a petition for writ of mandate in this court, seeking an order compelling the respondent superior court to vacate its order denying the writ petition filed in that court and to issue a writ compelling the District to grant Escobedo\u2019s request for a half-time leave. We issued an alternative writ of mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>\u201cMandamus is appropriate \u2018where there is not a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy, in the ordinary course of law.\u2019 (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1086.) . . . [T]his court necessarily determined that appeal was not an adequate remedy when it issued the alternative writ [citations].\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Given the time that would be consumed by an appeal from the respondent court\u2019s order denying the Association\u2019s writ petition, Escobedo\u2019s two-year term of office could well expire before this court\u2019s decision on appeal could become final.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The Association contends the language of section 44987(a) requires the District to grant Escobedo\u2019s request for a half-time leave to attend to the business of the Association. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">1. <em>Section 44987(a) Includes Half-time Leaves of Absence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">The meaning of section 44987(a) \u201cpresents a question of statutory interpretation for us to determine independently. [\u00b6] The objective of statutory interpretation is to ascertain the Legislature\u2019s intent to effectuate the law\u2019s purpose. In determining intent, we look first to the statute\u2019s words and give them their usual and ordinary meaning. When the language is unambiguous, there is no need for judicial construction. When the language is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation, however, we look to a variety of extrinsic aids, including the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part, the legislative history, and the ostensible objects to be achieved.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">\u201cThe meaning of a statute may not be determined from a single word or sentence; the words must be construed in context, and provisions relating to the same subject matter must be harmonized to the extent possible. [Citation.] ... An interpretation that renders related provisions nugatory must be avoided [citation]; each sentence must be read not in isolation but in the light of the statutory scheme [citation]; and if a statute is amenable to two alternative interpretations, the one that leads to the more reasonable result will be followed [citation].\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">Section 44987(a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe governing board of a school district shall grant to any employee, upon request, a leave of absence without loss of compensation for the purpose of enabling the employee to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>serve as an elected officer of any local school district public employee organization, or any statewide or national public employee organization with which the local organization is affiliated.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">\u201cThe leave shall include, but is not limited to, absence for purposes of attendance by the employee at periodic, stated, special, or regular meetings of the body of the organization on which the employee serves as an officer. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">\u201cFollowing the school district\u2019s payment of the employee for the leave of absence, the school district shall be reimbursed by the employee organization of which the employee is an elected officer for all compensation paid the employee on account of the leave. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">\u201cThe leave of absence without loss of compensation provided for by this section is in addition to the released time without loss of compensation granted to representatives of an exclusive representative by subdivision (c) of Section 3543.1 of the Government Code.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">The Legislature\u2019s choice of the phrase \u201cleave of absence\u201d in section 44987(a) (rather than \u201cleave\u201d or \u201ctime off\u2019) arguably creates ambiguity. A leave of absence may commonly be understood to refer to a period of extended absence.  However, when the words \u201cleave of absence\u201d are considered in the context of the full text of section 44987(a), it is apparent the Legislature intended to allow an elected officer of a local school district employee organization to take a leave of absence for any period of time for which the organization is willing to reimburse the school district.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">Thus, section 44987(a), in authorizing leave \u201cfor the purpose of enabling the employee to serve as an elected officer\u201d of the employee organization, necessarily anticipates a broad range of reasons for the employee to take a leave of absence, limited by the purpose of serving as an officer. Further, section 44987(a) provides that \u201c[t]he leave shall include, <em>but is not limited to, </em>absence for purposes of attendance by the employee at periodic, stated, special, or regular meetings of the body of the organization on which the employee serves as an officer.\u201d This language reinforces the legislative intent to allow the employee organization to determine the purposes for which leaves of absence are required. This language also demonstrates the Legislature intended to authorize leaves of absence of short or infrequent duration, as well as leaves of absence of longer or regular duration.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>Moreover, for several reasons, the phrase \u201cleave of absence\u201d cannot reasonably be interpreted to refer solely to an extended period of absence. First, such an interpretation would render nugatory the provision that the leave includes, but is not limited to, attendance at meetings. Second, the standard legal dictionary definition of \u201cleave of absence\u201d is: \u201cA worker\u2019s temporary absence from employment or duty with the intention to return. Salary and seniority normally are unaffected by a leave of absence.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A temporary absence from employment may well include a very short period of absence, or a temporary absence for a portion of every day or every week. And, third,'the article of which section 44987 is a part includes other statutes authorizing leaves of absence that may reasonably include temporary, short, intermittent or regularly repeated leaves of absence, such as section 44966 (leave of absence for travel or study) and section 44987.3 (leave of absence to serve on any of several committees, councils, groups, boards or commissions).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Accordingly, if the employee organization determines its purposes require its elected officer to take a leave of absence 50 percent of the work week, section 44987(a) requires the school district employer to grant the leave request, so long as the employee organization reimburses the school district for all compensation paid to the employee during the leave of absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Indeed, the District concedes that a \u201cleave of absence\u201d can consist of either a full-time absence or \u201csomething less than a full-time absence.\u201d Nevertheless, the District contends a part-time leave of absence constitutes a \u201cjob reclassification\u201d rather than a leave of absence. This argument is mere semantics. The Legislature has expressly authorized leaves of absence for officers to perform their union duties and to attend regular meetings of the employee organization. Consequently, if the employee organization requires an officer\u2019s presence some portion of every workday, or if the organization\u2019s regular meetings take place on workday mornings or afternoons, the District must authorize the officer\u2019s part-time leave of absence, regardless of how the District chooses to characterize the leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">The District next contends the Association\u2019s interpretation of section 44987(a) could lead to the absurd result of a teacher working only one-half day per week, or even only one hour per week. In enacting section 44987(a), the Legislature intended to allow an employee organization to determine the reasons for which its officers must have leave to serve the organization. It is neither absurd nor unreasonable that this will result in different durations of leaves of absence in different school districts. A large school district employee organization will likely require some or all of its officers to take full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>leaves of absence. A smaller employee organization will not necessarily need to have its officers attend to the organization\u2019s purposes on a full-time basis. Indeed, it would be unreasonable to construe section 44987(a) to require every officer of every employee organization seeking a leave of absence under the provision to take a full-time leave of absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">The District next contends that an interpretation of section 44987(a) that permits Escobedo to take a half-time leave of absence will harm the District\u2019s bilingual students because the District cannot find a half-time bilingual replacement for Escobedo, and even if it could, the quality of the bilingual program will be reduced by having two teachers in Escobedo\u2019s classroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The District\u2019s hardship contention is not well-taken for two reasons. First, the Legislature must have been aware that allowing a schoolteacher to take a leave of absence to attend to union business may cause hardship to the school district and may affect the quality of teaching in the classroom. Yet, the Legislature did not include any sort of hardship exception in section 44987(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Second, the record does not support the contention. The District relies on the declarations of its associate superintendent of human resources and the principal of the elementary school at which Escobedo teaches that, because of a shortage of bilingual teachers, the demand for such teachers exceeds the supply, and that it would be \u201cvery difficult\u201d to hire a part-time bilingual teacher. The District presented no evidence that it would have been impossible to have obtained a half-time bilingual teacher to share responsibilities in Escobedo\u2019s classroom. Moreover, the District ignores that Escobedo gave the District three months\u2019 notice of her request for a half-time leave of absence, prior to the start of the 2001-2002 school year, thus affording the District a considerable amount of time to seek a half-time bilingual teacher. Finally, although the District\u2019s principal declares Escobedo \u201cdid not seem interested\u201d in the alternative option of a transfer to a nonbilingual teaching assignment, Escobedo declares she \u201cbrought up the ideas of transfers from the bilingual program into a regular classroom, [or] even to a high school Spanish teaching assignment,\u201d but the principal and associate superintendent rejected the ideas.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">The District raises additional arguments without citation to the record or authority. The District asserts it would be inequitable to issue a writ because Escobedo refused to consider alternative leave arrangements and because the Association failed to respond to multiple offers to resolve the dispute in a mutually agreeable manner. The record does not support the first part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>contention. And the implied assertion that the Association behaved inequitably by refusing to accept the District\u2019s interpretation of section 44987(a) is frivolous. The District also argues the \u201cassociation leave\u201d clause of the parties\u2019 Master Agreement provides greater benefits than section 44987(a). This is patently incorrect. The association leave provision limits the Association\u2019s president to 36 days or 180 periods of leave to attend to the Association\u2019s business, while even the District admits section 44987(a) allows the Association\u2019s president to take up to a full-time leave of absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">2. <em>Deferral to Arbitration Is Not Required.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The District contends the <em>\u201cCollyer </em>doctrine\u201d requires deferral of the dispute to the parties\u2019 contractual grievance-arbitration procedure because this case actually involves a dispute over the meaning of the \u201cjob share,\u201d \u201cassociation leave\u201d and \u201crights and powers\u201d provisions of the parties\u2019 Master Agreement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Not so.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">The <em>Collyer </em>doctrine \u201cadvocates a species of judicial abstention when the dispute between the parties arguably falls within the contractual arbitration procedure. . . . [\u00b6] While a similar policy in favor of arbitration has been adopted in California, \u2018 <em>\u201cthere is no policy compelling persons to accept arbitration of controversies which they have not agreed to arbitrate . . . </em>.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] (Italics in original.) Thus, \u2018an order directing arbitration should be granted \u201cunless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">The arbitration provision of the parties\u2019 Master Agreement does not cover this dispute. The Master Agreement defines a grievance as \u201can allegation that the District has violated this Agreement\u201d; only a grievance may be pursued to arbitration. The Association made clear that its demand for Escobedo\u2019s leave of absence was pursuant to section 44987(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">\u201cThe petition in this case was not an attempt to enforce compliance with the collective bargaining agreement but with the controlling statute[]. Consequently petitioner was not required to exhaust administrative remedies before seeking equitable relief in the trial court.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">Nor can the District be heard to claim that the \u201cassociation leave\u201d provision of the parties\u2019 Master Agreement supersedes the rights accorded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>Escobedo by section 44987(a). The association leave clause provides, as relevant, for the Association\u2019s president to \u201chave up to thirty-six (36) days or one[]hundred eighty (180) periods of leave granted for the purpose of Association business.\u201d However, section 44924 provides in pertinent part, with exceptions not here applicable, that \u201cany contract or agreement, express or implied, made by any employee to waive the benefits of this chapter or any part thereof is null and void.\u201d The chapter referred to is chapter 4 (commencing with section 44800) of part 25 of division 3 of title 2 of the Education Code, which sets out the rights of certificated employees and includes section 44987(a). Accordingly, even assuming the association leave clause refers to the same type of leave provided by section 44987(a), the parties could not, through the Master Agreement, waive Escobedo\u2019s right to a leave of absence pursuant to section 44987(a).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">Finally, we reject the District\u2019s remaining contention, that it is inequitable to allow the Association to rely on section 44987(a) when the Association must have been fully aware of the section and yet negotiated the association leave provision in the parties\u2019 Master Agreement. The District too presumably was aware of both section 44987(a) and section 44924. The District thus knew, or should have known, that it could not limit its employees\u2019 section 44987(a) rights through collective bargaining negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue directing the superior court to vacate its order of August 31, 2001, denying the petition for writ of mandate, and to issue a new order granting the petition and directing the District to authorize Julie Escobedo\u2019s half-time leave of absence. The alternative writ of mandate issued by this court on October 18, 2001, having served its purpose, is discharged. Petitioner shall recover its costs of this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">Raye, J., and Callahan, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b466-12\"> Undesignated section references are to the Education Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b468-10\"><em> Robbins v.
