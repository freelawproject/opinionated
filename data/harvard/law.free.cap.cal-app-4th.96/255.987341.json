The city attorney requests that the trial court be directed to enter an order denying the <em>Pitchess </em>motion or to enter an order allowing the city attorney to review the sealed affidavit submitted in support of that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">We conclude the trial court erred in refusing to allow the city attorney to review the affidavit filed in support of Davenport\u2019s motion. Although a criminal defendant\u2019s right to confidentiality must be protected, in proceedings held pursuant to Evidence Code section 1043 the question whether the defendant has shown good cause should be, whenever possible, tested by the adversary process. In the present matter, the city attorney\u2019s office is not the prosecuting agency. Under these circumstances, Davenport\u2019s rights will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>protected and the city attorney\u2019s right to contest the affidavit submitted in support of Davenport\u2019s <em>Pitchess </em>motion will be accommodated by allowing the city attorney to review the affidavit under a protective court order. We accordingly will issue a writ of mandate so directing the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Real party in interest, Clinton Davenport, is a criminal defendant in a pending action <em>(People v. Davenport </em>(Super. Ct. L.A. County, No. SA041586)). On August 20, 2001, Davenport served on the discovery unit of the Los Angeles Police Department a <em>Pitchess </em>motion seeking to discover the personnel records of seven officers. The officers had participated in a search of Davenport\u2019s apartment and his subsequent arrest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In his motion, Davenport requested all records pertaining to any \u201cacts of aggressive behavior, violence, excessive force, or attempted violence or excessive force, threatening and/or coercive behavior, Dishonesty, false imprisonment or arrest, improper search and seizure, fabrication of charges and/or evidence, [and] improper tactics [,] abuse or mistreatment based upon any of the following: gender, race/ethnicity, nationality, or sexual orientation . . . .\u201d (Capitalization in original.) Pursuant to Evidence Code section 1043, Davenport filed an affidavit in support of his motion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The affidavit was, however, filed under seal. Accordingly, the Los Angeles City Attorney\u2019s Office, acting as the Los Angeles Police Department\u2019s counsel, was not provided with a copy.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">At a hearing held on September 6, 2001, the trial court granted Davenport\u2019s <em>Pitchess </em>motion. In making its ruling, the trial court indicated that Davenport\u2019s affidavit, filed under seal, provided \u201ca legitimate legal basis\u201d for the granting of the motion and that to allow the People to review the affidavit would jeopardize Davenport\u2019s defense and right to a fair trial. When the city attorney argued that the affidavit could be filed on information and belief by defense counsel and thus could be presented in such a way as to protect the defendant\u2019s constitutional privilege against self-incrimination, the trial court stated, \u201cWell, the issue here is not necessarily whether [the affidavit was made by] the defendant or defense counsel. It has to do with the issues relating to strategy, the defense . . . \u2014the factual basis for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>the <em>Pitchess </em>[motion] would not be something that the defense would have to disclose . . . . [\u00b6] And, you know, we\u2019re balancing the right of a defendant to get a fair trial because of the issue relating to not alerting the other side, especially if you think they\u2019re not telling the truth, which this all boils down to, versus the [police officer\u2019s] right to privacy. And I suppose that\u2019s why they put us in the middle and they give us the opportunity to look in camera.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">The city attorney then suggested that defense counsel provide the city attorney\u2019s office with a copy of the declaration \u201csubject to a protective order.\u201d The city attorney continued, \u201cWe could file our response under seal with the court. As the court knows, we are not the prosecution, we are a real party in interest [appearing on behalf of the police department]. So any defense strategy could be preserved ... by filing our opposition under seal with the court.\u201d The trial court responded, \u201cWell, I can tell you that factually the declaration under seal is supportive of a <em>Pitchess </em>request. So that\u2019s an alternative, and maybe it would be a good one if it were close. It\u2019s not close.\u2019 I mean, if I thought there was something out there that you could really defeat the request with, I think you might have a good idea, but I don\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The court performed in camera reviews of two of the named officers\u2019 personnel files, then continued the matter to September 14, 2001. At the September 14 proceedings, the court performed in camera reviews of the remaining five officers\u2019 files and determined that certain information was responsive to the <em>Pitchess </em>request and should be disclosed to Davenport. The compliance date was set for Wednesday, September 19, 2001. The Los Angeles City Attorney\u2019s Office, on behalf of the Los Angeles Police Department, filed the present petition for writ of mandate on September 17, 2001. The city attorney asserted the trial court\u2019s ruling granting the <em>Pitchess </em>motion on the basis of an affidavit submitted under seal was improper in that it prevented \u201cany meaningful adversarial challenge\u201d to the motion. On September 18, 2001, this court stayed all further proceedings in the matter pending determination of this petition. On September 25, 2001, we issued an order to show cause why the relief requested in the petition should not be granted and set the matter on calendar for oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">\u201cIn 1978, the California Legislature codified the privileges and procedures surrounding what had come to be known as <em>\u2018Pitchess </em>motions\u2019 (after [the court\u2019s] decision in <em>Pitchess </em>v. <em>Superior Court[, supra,] </em>11 Cal.3d 531 . . .) through the enactment of Penal Code sections 832.7 and 832.8 and Evidence Code sections 1043 through 1045. The Penal Code provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>define \u2018personnel records\u2019 (Pen. Code, \u00a7 832.8) and provide that such records are \u2018confidential\u2019 and subject to discovery only pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Evidence Code. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 832.7.) Evidence Code sections 1043 and 1045 set out the procedures for discovery in detail. As here pertinent, section 1043, subdivision (a) requires a written motion and notice to the governmental agency which has custody of the records sought, and subdivision (b) provides that such motion shall include, inter alia, \u2018(2) A description of the type of records or information sought; and [\u00b6] (3) Affidavits showing good cause for the discovery or disclosure sought, setting forth the materiality thereof to the subject matter involved in the pending litigation and stating upon reasonable belief that such governmental agency identified has such records or information from such records.\u2019 \u201d <em>(City of Santa Cruz </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 74, 81-83 [260 Cal.Rptr. 520, 776 P.2d 222], fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">\u201cA finding of \u2018good cause\u2019 under [Evidence Code] section 1043, subdivision (b) is only <em>the first </em>hurdle in the discovery process. Once good cause for discovery has been established, section 1045 provides that the court shall then examine the information \u2018in chambers\u2019 [and determine whether it should be released].\u201d <em>(City of Santa Cruz </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at p. 83.) The \u201crelatively low threshold\u201d for discovery embodied in section 1043 requires a showing of good cause for discovery in two general categories: (1) the materiality of the information to the subject matter involved in the pending litigation, and (2) a reasonable belief that the governmental agency has access to the information. These fairly simple requirements are offset by section 1045\u2019s significant \u201cprotective provisions.\u201d <em>(City of Santa Cruz, </em>at p. 83.) Those provisions \u201c(1) explicitly \u2018exclude from disclosure\u2019 certain enumerated categories of information ([Evid. Code,] \u00a7 1045, subd. (b)); (2) establish a procedure for in camera inspection by the court prior to any disclosure ([Evid. Code,] \u00a7 1045, subd. (b)); and (3) issue a forceful directive to the courts to consider the privacy interest of the officers whose records are sought and take whatever steps \u2018justice requires\u2019 to protect the officers from \u2018unnecessary annoyance, embarrassment or oppression.\u2019 [Evid. Code,] \u00a7 1045, subds. (c), (d) &amp; (e).)\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 83-84.) As the court stated in <em>City of Santa Cruz v. Municipal Court, </em>\u201cThe statutory scheme . . . carefully balances two directly conflicting interests: the peace officer\u2019s just claim to confidentiality, and the criminal defendant\u2019s equally compelling interest in all information pertinent to his defense.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 84.) Ultimately, whether a motion to discover police personnel records has been supported by an affidavit sufficient to show good cause and materiality of the requested information to the subject matter involved in the pending litigation is a factual determination made by the court in its sound discretion. <em>(Pitchess v. Superior Court, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d at p. 535.)</p>\n<p id=\"b273-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>A number of cases have considered whether particular affidavits met the requirements set forth in Evidence Code section 1043, subdivision (b)(3)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (see e.g. <em>City of Santa Cruz v. Municipal Court, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at pp. 84-85; <em>California Highway Patrol v. Superior Court, supra, </em>84 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1022-1025; <em>People v. Hustead </em>(1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 410, 416-418 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 875]; <em>City of San Jose </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1135, 1145-1150 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 624]; <em>People v. Gill </em>(1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 743, 750 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 369]). However, we have found no cases where the law enforcement officers\u2019 counsel was precluded from reviewing the defendant\u2019s or defense counsel\u2019s affidavit because it was filed under seal, and the trial court nevertheless determined the affidavit was sufficient to show good cause and materiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">In arguing that it has a right to review the affidavits filed by Davenport\u2019s counsel, the city attorney relies primarily on this court\u2019s decision in <em>City of Alhambra v. Superior Court </em>(1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 1118 [205 Cal.App.3d 1556d, 252 Cal.Rptr. 789]. In that case, which involved a general discovery motion, <em>not </em>a <em>Pitchess </em>motion, the defendant in a multiple murder case filed a motion in the trial court for discovery of 12 specific homicide/police reports being held by the district attorney\u2019s office. \u201cTo preserve the confidentiality of the defense, defendant\u2019s attorney submitted a separate declaration under seal for in camera inspection and review. . . . [T]he trial judge granted defendant\u2019s discovery motion and ordered that \u2018the summary of the investigator\u2019 of the 12 crimes be made available to defendant. . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1127.) The district attorney filed a petition for writ of mandate directing the trial court to annul or vacate its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">The People first argued that, \u201csince the defendant\u2019s ex parte discovery motion . . . was in a declaration that was sealed, the prosecutor was forced to speculate that it pertained to modus operandi evidence and, as a result, the People were denied a fair hearing . . . <em>(City of Alhambra </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>205 Cal.App.3d at p. 1129.) The court noted that it was for the trial court to determine whether a defendant\u2019s claim of confidentiality was warranted. \u201cIn making this determination[,] the trial court must recognize that while ex parte hearings may be necessary to protect a defendant\u2019s rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>[citation], it does not follow that the prosecutor (or interested third parties), must be precluded from effective participation .... If that were the rule, all defense discovery motions would soon be made and conducted in camera, to the detriment of our system of criminal justice in that those proceedings would not then be tested by the stringent and wholesome requirements of adversary litigation. The basic elements of due process are reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard. The People (and interested third parties) are entitled to that process no less than the defendant.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1130-1131, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">The court indicated that, when confronted with such a situation, the trial court should hold an ex parte in camera hearing to first determine \u201chow much, if any, of the matters submitted . . . must remain confidential. A balance must be struck between the requirement that a defendant make a plausible justification for the requested discovery and the limitations on prosecutorial discovery. It is conceivable that if too much is required of a defendant, he could be forced to reveal anticipated defense strategy.\u201d <em>(City of Alhambra v. Superior Court, supra, </em>205 Cal.App.3d at p. 1131.)</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">With regard to the case before it, the court indicated the People\u2019s argument\u2014that the filing of defense counsel\u2019s declarations under seal for in camera inspection and review denied them a fair hearing\u2014was without merit. The court stated, \u201cThe People made no objection to this procedure in the trial court. It cannot now be raised for the first time in a petition for an extraordinary writ. [Citation.] Further, from the record it appears that the People were <em>in fact </em>afforded a fair hearing. The deputy district attorney was well prepared and argued the motion at length, surmising that defendant was contending that there may be similar modus operand! in the crimes for which the reports were sought and thus should be allowed to inspect those reports.\u201d <em>(City of Alhambra </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>205 Cal.App.3d at p. 1135.)</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">In the present case; the city attorney asserts that, unlike the district attorney in the <em>City of Alhambra </em>case, he was not afforded a fair adversarial hearing. Moreover, although the present matter involves a <em>Pitchess </em>motion, while the <em>City of Alhambra </em>case involved a general motion for discovery, the same principles should apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">It has been recognized that the policy behind Evidence Code sections 1043 and 1045 is one which \u201ccarefully balances two directly conflicting interests: the peace officer\u2019s just claim to confidentiality, arid the criminal defendant\u2019s equally compelling interest in all information pertinent to his defense.\u201d <em>(City of Santa Cruz v. Municipal Court, supra, 49 </em>Cal.3d at p. 84.) A showing of good cause for discovery under section 1043 can be made by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>meeting a relatively low threshold; a defendant must show the materiality of the information sought and indicate that he or she has a reasonable belief that the particular governmental agency has access to that information. Once a showing of good cause has been made, it is for the trial court to implement Evidence Code section 1045\u2019s provisions enacted to protect a police officer\u2019s right to privacy. Under this system, it is the first step which affords the parties the opportunity to argue their cases. As we stated in <em>City of Alhambra </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>205 Cal.App.3d at page 1130, although courts must take care to avoid undue disclosure of defense strategy, \u201cit does not follow that the prosecutor (or <em>interested third </em>parties), must be precluded from effective participation in an important pretrial matter merely because the defendant asserts that the factual or legal showing made in support of a particular motion should remain confidential.\u201d (Italics added.) Accordingly, we determine that in proceedings held pursuant to Evidence Code section 1043, the question whether the defendant has shown \u201cgood cause\u201d should be, whenever possible, tested by adversarial proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">In the present case, the trial court refused to allow the city attorney to review Davenport\u2019s affidavit because to allow such review would jeopardize Davenport\u2019s defense and right to a fair trial by revealing his trial strategy. However, as the city attorney has pointed out, the city attorney\u2019s office is not the agency \u201cprosecuting\u201d Davenport.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">A \u201cprosecutor\u201d is \u201c[o]ne who prosecutes another for a crime in the name of the government. ... A \u2018prosecutor\u2019 is one who takes charge of [a] case and performs [the] function of trial lawyer for the people, as does a district attorney.\u201d (Black\u2019s Law Dict. (5th ed. 1979) p. 1099, col. 2.) With regard to the general disclosure of exculpatory evidence, it has been determined that the \u201cprosecutor\u201d also includes \u201ca person or agency that has been used by the prosecutor or [an] investigating agency [used] to assist the prosecution . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Barrett) </em>(2000) 80 Cal.App.4th 1305, 1315 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 264].) \u201cThe important determinant is whether the person or agency has been \u2018acting on the government\u2019s behalf\u2019 [citation] or \u2018assisting the government\u2019s case.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">In support of its petition, the city attorney\u2019s office has submitted a declaration by the deputy city attorney assigned to this matter. The affidavit clearly indicates that, in this case, the city attorney can be considered neither the prosecutor nor an assistant to the prosecutor. The deputy states that his \u201cunit specializes in <em>Pitchess </em>motions\u201d and that his \u201c \u2018client\u2019 on the motion[] is the Custodian of Records of the [Los Angeles Police Department].\u201d The deputy city attorney continues: \u201cMy unit represents the [Los Angeles Police Department] strictly in its record-keeping capacity. The Office has \u2018firewalls\u2019 set up internally so that my unit does not share information or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>communicate with other units which may get involved [in] the substantive facts of cases, such as those units which prosecute matters for the City. Nearly all of the judges I have appeared before have made comments during the hearing to indicate that they understand that the Custodian of Records is not the Prosecution . ... [\u00b6] ... [\u00b6] I have reviewed and opposed nearly one hundred <em>Pitchess </em>motions .... I have spoken with many of the Custodians and several [Los Angeles Police Department] Officers about their complaint-taking procedures. I have also reviewed the [Los Angeles Police Department] Manual with respect to complaint-taking procedures, and have noticed that the Manual states all complaints made must be formally taken and made into a Department record. . . . [I]t is my understanding that the [Los Angeles Police Department] personnel strictly adhere to this policy. . . . [\u00b6] Although the attorneys in my section are indeed advocates for the Custodian of Records, if the [Pitchess] motion states specific facts, which are plausible, as to material matters, we concede to <em>in camera </em>reviews. It is my understanding that [concession by our agency] to <em>in camera </em>review as to at least some allegations made by a motion is both frequent and routine. In my personal experience, at least one District Attorney became very angry when I disagreed about whether I should concede to the disclosure of certain peace officer personnel information. . . .[\u00b6] However, it is my experience that the majority of District Attorneys acknowledge that the City is its own entity with its own interests to protect and disclosure guidelines to follow, and they respect the City\u2019s pursuit of those interests and duties.\u201d (Underscoring and italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Davenport filed under seal with this court a copy of his counsel\u2019s affidavit submitted in support of his <em>Pitchess </em>motion. We have reviewed the affidavit and conclude that to allow the city attorney to review it, under a protective order, will in no way compromise Davenport\u2019s defense or right to a fair trial. Likewise, Davenport\u2019s rights will not be jeopardized if, should the city attorney wish to file a response or opposition regarding the contents of the affidavit, it does so under seal. These procedures will protect the defendant\u2019s right to confidentiality and at the same time allow the matter to be properly \u201ctested by the stringent and wholesome requirements of adversary litigation.\u201d <em>(City of Alhambra v. Superior Court, supra, </em>205 Cal.App.3d at p. 1130.)</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The order to show cause previously issued is hereby discharged. A peremptory writ of mandate shall issue directing the trial court to vacate its September 6, 2001, order refusing to allow the deputy city attorney assigned to this case to review the affidavit filed by Davenport\u2019s counsel in support of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>Davenport\u2019s <em>Pitchess </em>motion and to enter instead an order allowing the city attorney to review, under protective court order, the affidavit.
