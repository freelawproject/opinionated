Stephen J. Smith, Director of the Department of Industrial Relations, acting in his capacity as administrator of the Uninsured Employers Fund (UEF), filed a petition for writ <em>of </em>review of the WCAB\u2019s decision. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-11\">Relevant Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b148-12\">In May 1994, Yoon applied to the Contractors\u2019 State License Board (CSLB) for a painting contractor\u2019s license. Yoon\u2019s application indicated that he would do business as an individual and that he was the sole owner. In support of his application, Yoon submitted a declaration that he had no employees, and was thus exempt from the requirement under Business and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Professions Code section 7125<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to secure a certificate of workers\u2019 compensation insurance. On May 13, 1995, Yoon was issued a license valid until May 31, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">On September 13, 1996, Yoon doing business as Universal submitted a proposal for painting work to Tomadur. Yoon proposed to paint a building for $46,750. The proposal stated that \u201c[p]rior to job commencement the owner will be provided with a certificate of insurance showing company coverage limits for both General Liability ($1 million) and Worker\u2019s [sic] Compensation Insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">On October 9, 1996, Tomadur entered into an agreement with Yoon doing business as Universal \u201cin accordance with the terms set forth in [Yoon\u2019s] bid.\u201d The agreement stated: \u201cOur workers are fully covered by Worker [sic] Compensation Insurance, and Universal Painting carries a One Million Dollar liability insurance policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Yoon employed Lee, and on November 4, 1996, Lee was seriously injured while painting Tomadur\u2019s building. Yoon did not respond to Lee\u2019s claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, and Lee applied to the WCAB for an adjudication of his claim.  Tomadur was joined in the action, and the UEF<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> stipulated to advance benefits to Lee.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">On March 8, 2001, the workers\u2019 compensation judge (WCJ) found that Yoon lacked a valid contractor\u2019s license when Lee sustained his injuries, that Yoon and Tomadur were Lee\u2019s joint employers on that date, and that they were jointly and severally liable for his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">On March 12, 2001, Tomadur filed a petition for reconsideration. In the WCJ\u2019s report and recommendation on reconsideration, the WCJ explained that Yoon lacked workers\u2019 compensation insurance when he employed Lee, and that under the WCJ\u2019s understanding of sections 7125 and 7125.2, Yoon\u2019s license was suspended immediately upon his employment of workers. The WCJ concluded that Yoon lacked the valid license required for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>status of independent contractor when Lee was injured, and thus Tomadur shared liability for Lee\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">On May 8, 2001, the WCAB granted reconsideration and amended the WCJ\u2019s findings, concluding that Yoon had a valid license when Lee was injured, and that Yoon doing business as Universal was Lee\u2019s sole employer on that date. The WCAB reasoned that under subdivision (a) of section 7125.2, a contractor\u2019s license is suspended 30 days <em>after </em>the CSLB sends the contractor a notice concerning the lack of workers\u2019 compensation insurance, and that no such notice was sent to Yoon.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">On June 21, 2001, petitioner filed a petition for writ of review on behalf of the UEF, challenging the WCAB\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">Petitioner contends that the WCJ properly determined that under section 7125.2, subdivision (a), Yoon lacked a valid contractor\u2019s license when Lee was injured, and thus liability for Lee\u2019s injuries attached to Tomadur because Yoon was not an independent contractor.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">A. <em>Independent Contractor Status</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">Under the statutes governing workers\u2019 compensation, the overarching question concerning Tomadur\u2019s liability is whether Yoon was an independent contractor when Lee was injured.  Generally, \u201cabsent any statute imposing liability, California courts have consistently held that an owner or general contractor is not liable under workers\u2019 compensation for injury to the employee of an independent contractor hired by the general contractor. [Citations.] On the other hand, if the person hired by an owner or general contractor is an employee rather than an independent contractor, the general contractor may be liable under workers\u2019 compensation for injuries to persons hired by the employee, on the theory that such persons are also the general contractor\u2019s employees.\u201d <em>(Blew v. Horner </em>(1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 1380, 1387 [232 Cal.Rptr. 660].) These principles apply when, as here, the question concerns the liability of an owner for injuries to the employee of an ostensible independent contractor hired by the owner. (See <em>Brietigam </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1951) 37 Cal.2d 849, 852 [236 P.2d 582].)</p>\n<p id=\"b150-12\">Central to the determination of Yoon\u2019s status as an independent contractor for the purposes of workers\u2019 compensation liability is Labor Code section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>2750.5. <em>(Zellers </em>v. <em>Playa Pacifica, Ltd. </em>(1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 129, 132-133 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 919].) The parties do not dispute that Tomadur hired Yoon for work requiring a contractor\u2019s license (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 7026). On this matter, Labor Code section 2750.5 provides that \u201cany person performing any function or activity for which a [contractor\u2019s] license is required . . . <em>shall </em>hold a valid contractors\u2019 license as a condition of having independent contractor status.\u201d (Lab. Code, \u00a7 2750.5, subd. (c), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The parties also do not dispute the WCAB\u2019s implied finding that, setting aside whether Yoon held a valid contractor\u2019s license, Yoon\u2019s dealings with Tomadur\u2014including his autonomy and freedom from supervision\u2014met the factual requirements for the status of an independent contractor while he carried out the work under his agreement with Tomadur (Lab. Code, \u00a7 2750.5, subd. (a)).  Thus, the crucial question under Labor Code section 2750.5 is whether Yoon held a valid contractor\u2019s license on the date that Lee was injured. <em>(Zellers v. Playa Pacifica, Ltd., supra, </em>61 Cal.App.4th at pp. 132-133.)</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">B. <em>Section 7125.2, Subdivision (a)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">The resolution of this question hinges on the correct interpretation of section 7125.2, subdivision (a), which governs the suspension of licenses for failure to maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance.  We review the WCAB\u2019s conclusions on this matter of statutory interpretation de novo. (See <em>Save Mart Stores </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 720, 723 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 597].) However, to the extent that our inquiry also requires an examination of the WCAB\u2019s factual determinations, we review these determinations for the existence of substantial evidence. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">\u201cA fundamental rule of statutory construction is that a court should ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law. [Citations.] In construing a statute, our first task is to look to the language of the statute itself. [Citation.] When the language is clear and there is no uncertainty as to the legislative intent, we look no further and simply enforce the statute according to its terms. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(DuBois v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 382, 387-388 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 523, 853 P.2d 978].)</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">In examining the language of the statute, we must consider \u201cthe context of the statute . . . and the statutory scheme of which it is a part. \u2018We are required to give effect to statutes \u201caccording to the usual, ordinary import of the language employed in framing them.\u201d [Citations.]\u2019 [Citations.] \u2018 \u201cIf possible, significance should be given to every word, phrase, sentence and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>part of an act in pursuance of the legislative purpose.\u201d [Citation.] .... \u201cWhen used in a statute [words] must be construed in context, keeping in mind the nature and obvious purpose of the statute where they appear.\u201d [Citations.] Moreover, the various parts of a statutory enactment must be harmonized by considering the particular clause or section in the context of the statutory framework as a whole. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(DuBois v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 388.)</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Here, section 7125.2 makes express reference to sections 7125 and 7125.1, and thus they must be interpreted together. Subdivisions (a) and (d) of section 7125 establish licensing and reporting requirements regarding workers\u2019 compensation insurance. Subdivision (a) of section 7125 provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe [CSLB] shall require as a condition precedent to the issuance, reinstatement, reactivation, renewal, or continued maintenance of a license, that the applicant or licensee have on file a Certificate of Workers\u2019 Compensation Insurance or Certification of Self-Insurance. A Certificate of Workers\u2019 Compensation Insurance shall be issued and filed by one or more insurers duly licensed to write workers\u2019 compensation insurance in this state. A Certification of Self-Insurance shall be issued and filed by the Director of Industrial Relations.\u201d Subdivision (d) of section 7125 requires insurers to report the cancellation of a workers\u2019 compensation policy to the registrar<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the CSLB within 10 days of the cancellation.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Subdivision (b) of section 7125 carves out an exception to these requirements for contractors who do not employ workers. It provides: \u201cThis section does not apply to an applicant or licensee who has no employees provided that he or she files a statement with the [CSLB] on a form prescribed by the registrar that he or she does not employ any person in any manner so as to become subject to the workers\u2019 compensation laws of California. The filing of a false statement constitutes a cause for disciplinary action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Section 7125.1 governs the reinstatement of licenses subject to the certificate requirement in subdivision (a) of section 7125. It requires the registrar to reinstate such a license \u201cretroactive to the effective date of the certificate\u201d when the certificate is received in a timely manner or other conditions (not relevant here) are met, provided that the license is \u201cotherwise eligible ...\u201d (\u00a7 7125.1, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">The focus of the dispute before us is subdivision (a) of section 7125.2, which states: \u201cThe failure of a licensee required pursuant to this chapter to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance shall result in the automatic suspension of the license by operation of law. The registrar shall notify any licensee who fails to maintain workers\u2019 compensation that his or her license shall be automatically suspended 30 days from the date of the notice. Within 30 days of a suspension pursuant to this section, the registrar shall provide the licensee with an additional notice that informs the licensee of the suspension date, the cause for suspension, and reinstatement procedures. Reinstatement shall be made at any time following the suspension by showing proof of compliance as specified in Sections 7125 and 7125.1.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Emphasizing the first sentence of section 7125.2, subdivision (a), petitioner contends that Yoon\u2019s employment of workers, coupled with his lack of workers\u2019 compensation insurance as required by section 7125, resulted in the \u201cautomatic suspension of [his] license by operation of law.\u201d (\u00a7 7125.2, subd. (a).) By contrast, the WCAB concluded that the final three sentences condition the suspension of licenses upon a notice from the CSLB, and thus that Yoon\u2019s license was not suspended because the CSLB never sent him the requisite notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">C. <em>Suspension of License</em></p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">This question of statutory interpretation is one of first impression.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As we explain below, the proper interpretation of subdivision (a) of section 7125.2 is a difficult task, given the multiple and sometimes competing goals of California\u2019s statutes governing contractor licensing and workers\u2019 compensation. Although the question is close, we conclude that the WCAB has correctly interpreted and applied this subdivision under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">We begin by acknowledging that, read in isolation, the first sentence of section 7125.2, subdivision (a), supports the construction urged by petitioner.  The phrase \u201coperation of law,\u201d as ordinarily understood, \u201cexpresses the manner in which rights, and sometimes liabilities, devolve upon a person by the mere application to the particular transaction of the established rules of law, without the act or co-operation of the party himself.\u201d (Black\u2019s Law Dict. (6th ed. 1990) p. 1092, col. 1.) Thus, had subdivision (a) of section 1725.2 comprised this single sentence, the legislative intent would be clear: Yoon\u2019s license was suspended upon his employment of workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">Nonetheless, the Legislature did not so limit subdivision (a) of section 1725.2. The second sentence requires the registrar to send a notice to <em>\u201cany </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>licensee\u201d not in compliance with the certification requirement that the pertinent license <em>\u201cshall be </em>automatically suspended 30 days <em>from </em>the date of the notice\u201d sent by the registrar. (\u00a7 7125.2, subd. (a), italics added.) This sentence, by its plain language, applies to <em>all </em>noncompliant licensees, and it indicates that suspension automatically occurs 30 days <em>after </em>the notice is sent. To ignore this sentence and those that follow it is to render them \u201credundant and a nullity, thereby violating one of the most elementary principles of statutory construction. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Cal Pacific Collections, Inc. </em>v. <em>Powers </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 135, 139 [74 Cal.Rptr. 289, 449 P.2d 225].)</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">The language of section 7125.2, subdivision (a), thus provides support for two opposed interpretations. To resolve this conflict, we examine this subdivision in the context of the statutory schemes governing the licensing of contractors and workers\u2019 compensation insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The schemes in question place special emphasis on <em>licensing </em>as an instrument for achieving their goals. To begin, sections 7125, 7125.1, and 7125.2 state a small portion of California\u2019s complex requirements concerning contractor\u2019s licenses found in the Business and Professions Code (\u00a7 7000 et seq.).  The purpose of these requirements \u201cis to protect the public from incompetence and dishonesty in those who provide building and construction services. [Citation.] The licensing requirements provide minimal assurance that all persons offering such services in California have the requisite skill and character, understand applicable local laws and codes, and know the rudiments of administering a contracting business. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Hydrotech Systems, Ltd. v. Oasis Waterpark </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 988, 995 [277 Cal.Rptr. 517, 803 P.2d 370].)</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The CSLB is authorized to administer these requirements (\u00a7 7010), and to enforce them through disciplinary action, including the suspension of licenses (\u00a7 7090). By statute and regulation, the CSLB is required to provide certain information to the public concerning licensees and disciplinary action, if any, taken against them. (\u00a7 7124.6; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 16, \u00a7 863 [\u201cThe Registrar shall establish a system whereby members of the public may obtain from board records information regarding complaints made against licensed contractors, their history of legal actions taken by the board, and license status, as hereafter specified.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">To supplement the CSLB\u2019s efforts to ensure compliance with the licensing requirements, section 7031 bars unlicensed contractors from bringing a lawsuit to recover compensation for services unless \u201cthere has been substantial compliance with licensure requirements\u201d (\u00a7 7031, subd. (e)). Here, \u201c[t]he obvious statutory intent is to discourage persons who have failed to comply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>with the licensing law from offering or providing their unlicensed services for pay.\u201d <em>(Hydrotech Systems, Ltd. v. Oasis Waterpark, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at p. 995.)</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The Legislature has also harnessed the licensing requirements in the Business and Professions Code to serve the statutory goals of the workers\u2019 compensation system. As we have noted (see pt. <em>A., ante), </em>Labor Code section 2750.5 renders a party who hires a contractor liable for workers\u2019 compensation when the contractor lacks a valid license. The Legislature\u2019s intent regarding this aspect of Labor Code section 2750.5 was explained in <em>State Compensation Ins. Fund v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 5 [219 Cal.Rptr. 13, 706 P.2d 1146]. Noting that licensed contractors, unlike unlicensed contractors, were likely to obtain workers\u2019 compensation coverage, our Supreme Court stated: \u201cWhile it may seem anomalous to hold that the hirer is liable for compensation only if the contractor lacks the required license, and that he would not be liable if the contractor were licensed, the justification is apparent in that the Legislature has sought to assure that both licensed and unlicensed contractors and their employees will have compensation should they be injured on the job.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 13.)</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">The pertinent provisions of Labor Code section 2750.5 also serve several related goals. Labor Code section 2750.5 places responsibility for the payment of unemployment fund contributions and various taxes on hirers of unlicensed contractors. <em>(Hunt Building Corp. v. Bernick </em>(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 213, 218-220 [93 Cal.Rptr.2d 883].) The legislative history of Labor Code section 2750.5 indicates that it was intended to \u201chelp end the \u2018subterranean economy\u2019 where contractors hire unlicensed subcontractors and pay them in cash, resulting in the \u2018loss of large sums in taxes, employee social insurance contributions, and employee pension funds.\u2019 \u201d (79 Cal.App.4th at p. 222, quoting Assem. Com. on Labor, Employment &amp; Consumer Affairs, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 3249 (1977-1978 Reg. Sess.) p. 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">Licensing thus serves two different sets of statutory goals. First, licensing <em>protects </em>those who hire contractors. To facilitate this protection, the Legislature has authorized the CSLB to provide the public with information about the current licensing status and disciplinary history of contractors. Second, the absence of a valid license <em>places liability </em>for workers\u2019 compensation coverage and related employer taxes and contributions on those who hire contractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">The interpretation of section 7125.2 marks a point of tension between these statutory goals. The construction adopted by the WCAB enhances the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>protective value of information about contractors available through the CSLB by tying suspension of an exempt contractor\u2019s license to a notice from the CSLB. By contrast, petitioner\u2019s construction would assure workers\u2019 compensation coverage for injuries to the employees of ostensibly exempt contractors, but reduce the protective value of information from the CSLB: the hirer of the exempt contractor would become liable for workers\u2019 compensation coverage when the contractor retained employees, regardless of whether the CSLB had issued a notice regarding this conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">In our view, the Legislature\u2019s determination concerning the proper balance between these goals with respect to section 7125.2, subdivision (a), is found in section 7030. Section 7030 requires that a contractor serving as a \u201cprime contractor\u201d must include in all written contracts a term stating that the CSLB is authorized to investigate complaints about the contractor, and that \u201cany questions\u201d about the contractor \u201cmay be referred\u201d to the CSLB (\u00a7 7030, subd. (a)). Furthermore, when the contractor is engaged to work on residential property with four or fewer units, section 7030 requires the contractor to issue a notice to the hirer before entering into a contract (\u00a7 7030, subd. (b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">The requisite notice must use capital letters and state in pertinent part: \u201cLicensed Contractors Are Regulated by Laws Designed to Protect the Public. . . . Your Only Remedy Against an Unlicensed Contractor May Be in Civil Court, and You May Be Liable for Damages Arising out of Any Injuries to the Contractor or His or Her Employees. [\u00b6] You May Contact the [CSLB] to Find Out If This Contractor Has a Valid License. The [CSLB] Has Complete Information on the History of Licensed Contractors, Including Any Possible Suspensions, Revocations, Judgments, and Citations.\u201d (\u00a7 7030, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Section 7030 thus requires a contractor to inform a defined class of hirers that the contractor\u2019s lack of a license may impose liability on the hirer, that the hirer may contact the CSLB to determine whether the contractor has a valid license, and that the CSLB has \u201ccomplete information\u201d on \u201cpossible suspensions.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This requirement makes little sense unless the Legislature intended that the information available through the CSLB should generally permit hirers in the defined class to determine whether a contractor has a valid license, and thereby avoid liability for injuries to the contractor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>employees. Otherwise, section 7030 would mandate that contractors must provide misleading notices.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Although this notice requirement applies only to a limited class of hirers, it indicates a legislative preference that the information available from the CSLB should be sufficient in the usual or typical case to enable <em>any </em>hirer to avoid liability for injury to the contractor\u2019s employees. For the reasons described above (see pt. A., <em>ante), </em>the imposition of liability on the hirer of a contractor under Labor Code section 2750.5 does not hinge on whether the hirer falls within the class defined in Business and Professions Code section 7030, but on whether the contractor has a valid license. In our view, the legislative preference evinced in Business and Professions Code section 7030 supports the conclusion that Business and Professions Code section 7125.2, subdivision (a), conditions suspension of a license upon the issuance of the requisite notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Here, the WCAB determined that no such notice issued, and that the CSLB was unaware of Yoon\u2019s violation of his status as an exempt licensee. The record supports these determinations, and also indicates that the information available to Tomadur from the CSLB and other sources would not have placed Tomadur on notice that Yoon was licensed as an exempt contractor or that he had violated the conditions of his status. Yoon\u2019s proposal and agreement with Tomadur recited that Yoon (doing business as Universal) was licensed and insured. The record also discloses that during the pertinent time, the CSLB answered routine inquiries about Yoon by stating that Yoon was licensed, without disclosing that Yoon was an exempt licensee.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">For this reason, nothing in the record reasonably supports the conclusion that Tomadur knew, or should have known, that Yoon had violated the conditions of his license in employing Lee. Although the agreement between Yoon and Tomadur obliged Yoon to provide Tomadur with a copy of his insurance policy and Yoon presumably did not provide this proof of insurance, had Tomadur sought information from the CSLB about the status of Yoon\u2019s license, it would have been informed simply that Yoon was then licensed as a contractor. Accordingly, the WCAB correctly determined that Tomadur had no liability for Lee\u2019s injuries under the workers\u2019 compensation scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>Petitioner disagrees on several grounds. To begin, petitioner contends that, as a factual matter, Tomadur knew that Yoon was illegally uninsured when it accepted Yoon\u2019s proposal. However, the record does not reasonably support this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">After setting forth the terms of Yoon\u2019s offer, Yoon\u2019s proposal states: \u201cIt is important to know that if an employer does not pay payroll taxes for all personnel, those persons are not protected by workers compensation benefits and, thus become your \u2018responsibility\u2019 in the event of an accident. [\u00b6] The combined costs of payroll taxes and worker\u2019s [sic] compensation insurance amount to approximately 25% of the job cost. Unfortunately, avoiding these costs becomes an attractive temptation for those willing to \u2018Cut comers\u2019. Auditing payroll records for all personnel utilized on-site is the only available method to ensure complained [sic].\u201d The proposal also indicates that Yoon revised his original bid for Tomadur\u2019s work from $46,750 to $41,750, but does not explain the basis for this revision.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Petitioner suggests that the statements in Yoon\u2019s proposal, coupled with Yoon\u2019s revision of his bid, raises the inference that Tomadur knew or understood that Yoon had reduced his costs by failing to obtain workers\u2019 compensation coverage. We disagree. The statements in Yoon\u2019s proposal, on their face, are a generic warning about owner responsibilities and the dangers of accepting unusually low bids. Moreover, there is no evidence that Yoon\u2019s revised bid was unusually low. Accordingly, the statements in the proposal do not support the inference that Tomadur knew that Yoon had illegally avoided the costs of workers\u2019 compensation insurance. Finally, because there is no evidence that Yoon had workers\u2019 compensation coverage before he revised his bid, it is pure speculation that this revision reflected an understanding between Yoon and Tomadur that Yoon would reduce his bid by foregoing the costs of workers\u2019 compensation insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Petitioner also contends that the WCAB\u2019s interpretation of section 7125.2 is incorrect for several reasons. First, citing <em>ICF Kaiser Engineers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 226 [89 Cal.Rptr.2d 88], <em>Buzgheia v. Leasco Sierra Grove </em>(1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 374 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 427], <em>Rushing </em>v. <em>Powell </em>(1976) 61 Cal.App.3d 597 [130 Cal.Rptr. 110], and <em>Shields </em>v. <em>Shoaff </em>(1953) 116 Cal.App.2d 306 [253 P.2d 1002], petitioner argues that the concept of an automatic suspension by operation of law, by its nature, implies that any such suspension would occur independent of action by the CSLB.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">We agree that the phrase \u201coperation of law,\u201d taken in isolation, carries the meaning that petitioner proposes. Nonetheless, we must constme subdivision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>(a) of section 7125.2 in its entirety, and in the context of the pertinent statutory schemes. <em>(DuBois v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, 5 </em>Cal.4th at p. 388.) For this reason, the phrase \u201coperation of law,\u201d by itself, does not dictate the correct interpretation of this subdivision. <em>(Lungren v. Deukmejian </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 727, 735 [248 Cal.Rptr. 115, 755 P.2d 299].)</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The cases cited by petitioner provide no guidance on the issue before us. In these cases, the courts addressed current section 7068.2 or its predecessors, all of which provide (with some variation in language) that when a business holds a license by virtue of a \u201cresponsible managing employee\u201d (RME), the license is automatically or \u201cipso facto\u201d suspended unless the business notifies the CSLB in a timely manner that the RME has been disassociated. <em>(ICF Kaiser Engineers, Inc. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>75 Cal.App.4th at pp. 230-231; <em>Buzgheia </em>v. <em>Leasco Sierra Grove, supra, </em>60 Cal.App.4th at pp. 380-381; <em>Rushing </em>v. <em>Powell, supra, </em>61 Cal.App.3d at pp. 606-607 &amp; fn. 12; <em>Shields </em>v. <em>Shoaff, supra, </em>116 Cal.App.2d at p. 308.)</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The versions of section 7068.2 addressed in those cases lack any language resembling the final three sentences of section 7125.2, subdivision (a). Moreover, each case cited by petitioner concerns the interaction of section 7068.2 (or its predecessors) with section 7031, which generally denies unlicensed contractors access to the courts to recover compensation for their services. <em>(ICF Kaiser Engineers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>75 Cal.App.4th at pp. 231-235; <em>Buzgheia v. Leasco Sierra Grove, supra, </em>60 Cal.App.4th at p. 380; <em>Rushing </em>v. <em>Powell, supra, </em>61 Cal.App.3d at p. 605; <em>Shields v. Shoaff, supra, </em>116 Cal.App.2d at pp. 306-308.) As we have explained, section 7031 supplements the CSLB\u2019s efforts to enforce licensing requirements, and thus it serves a legislative goal not at issue here. Accordingly, the cases cited by petitioner are not pertinent to the question before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">We recognize that in enacting section 7068.2, the Legislature may have determined that in some situations, liability for workers\u2019 compensation is properly imposed on hirers due to an automatic suspension through the operation of this section, even though inquiries to the CSLB would not have disclosed the suspension. We do not address or decide that question here. However, assuming that the Legislature enacted section 7068.2 with this intent, our conclusion regarding subdivision (a) of section 7125.2 is undisturbed. Unlike section 7068.2, sections 7125, 7125.1, and 7125.2 directly address a matter concerning liability for worker injury, a key subject of the notices mandated under section 7030, and subdivision (a) of section 7125.2 expressly ties suspensions to the issuance of notices. Furthermore, in enacting subdivision (a) of section 7125.2, the Legislature also enacted a version <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>of section 7030 whose language materially resembles the now-effective section 7030. (Stats. 1995, ch. 467, \u00a7\u00a7 1.5, 14-20.) Accordingly, the legislative intent concerning subdivision (a) of section 7125.2 appears to be clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Second, petitioner suggests that an automatic suspension under section 7125.2, subdivision (a), must be construed as independent of any notice from the CSLB, citing subdivision (a) of section 7125, which provides that workers\u2019 compensation insurance is \u201ca condition precedent to the . . . continued maintenance of a license\u201d when the licensee has no employees. However, subdivision (a) of section 7125, by its plain language, is directed in the first instance at the CSLB, and not the licensees: it states that <em>the CSLB </em>\u201cshall require\u201d workers\u2019 compensation as a condition precedent for a license. So understood, subdivision (a) of section 7125 provides the rationale for the notice provisions in section 7125.2, subdivision (a), and it therefore comports with our conclusion concerning the latter subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Third, petitioner contends that subdivision (a) of section 7125.2, viewed in the context of the workers\u2019 compensation system, must be regarded as imposing an automatic suspension as soon as an ostensibly exempt contractor hires employees. Petitioner argues that unless an automatic suspension occurs at that time, the contractor\u2019s employees will not receive workers\u2019 compensation coverage through the owner that hired the contractor, thereby defeating the statutory goal of wide coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Again, we are not persuaded. We recognize that the workers\u2019 compensation scheme should be construed, whenever possible, in favor of coverage <em>(Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Ind. Acc. Com. </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 219, 223 [14 Cal.Rptr. 548, 363 P.2d 596]). However, as we have explained, the question before us involves a conflict between the goals of the workers\u2019 compensation system and the licensing requirements in the Business and Professions Code, and the Legislature has resolved this conflict in favor of protecting those who hire contractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">Finally, noting that the statutes in question do not establish a mechanism that alerts the CSLB when exempt contractors hire employees, petitioner contends that the WCAB\u2019s interpretation, unlike that offered by petitioner, renders the pertinent statutes defective. Petitioner argues that under the WCAB\u2019s interpretation, the CSLB will frequently fail to issue the requisite suspension notices, and thus exempt licensees will be free to violate the conditions of their licenses. By contrast, under petitioner\u2019s interpretation, hirers are encouraged to monitor their contractors through the imposition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>liability for workers\u2019 compensation coverage. Petitioner suggests that the Legislature intended to enact such a system of hirer supervision, citing excerpts from the legislative history of the pertinent provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">We recognize that we should avoid statutory constructions that would produce absurd consequences. <em>(Flannery </em>v. <em>Prentice </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 572, 578 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 809, 28 P.3d 860].) However, we have \u2018\u201cno power to rewrite the statute so as to make it conform to a presumed intention which is not expressed.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(California Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>Governing Bd. of Rialto Unified School Dist. </em>(1997) 14 Cal.4th 627, 633 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 671, 927 P.2d 1175].)</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Here, nothing before us reasonably indicates that the Legislature intended to implement a system of hirer supervision. We agree that sections 7125, 7125.1, and 7125.2 do not provide the CSLB with any systematic means of detecting exempt licensees who hire employees. However, for the reasons explained above, the language of section 7125.2, subdivision (a), does not disclose an intent to deter noncompliance by imposing liability for workers\u2019 compensation coverage on hirers. Furthermore, nothing in the history provided by petitioner demonstrates the existence of any such intent.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On the contrary, the record suggests that the although the Legislature recognized the potential problems created by the CSLB\u2019s inability to detect noncompliance by exempt licensees, it did not respond to these problems by creating a system of hirer supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">The legislative history indicates that the pertinent provisions were enacted to \u201crequire the maintenance of workers\u2019 compensation insurance as a condition of licensure and . . . make the failure to maintain this coverage grounds for <em>disciplinary action.\u201d </em>(Assem. Com. on Governmental Efficiency and Consumer Protection, Rep. on Assem. Bill No. 2282 (1989-1990 Reg. Sess.) Apr. 12, 1989, p. 1, italics added.) Regarding the exemption for contractors without employees, the history discloses that members of the Legislature expressed concerns about the CSLB\u2019s enforcement of this exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">A Senate committee analysis contains the following statements under the caption \u201cPossible amendments\u201d: \u201cThe bill contains an \u2018honor system\u2019 self-exemption relating to the maintenance of workers\u2019 compensation insurance. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>The exemption allows a contractor to file a statement with the CSLB signed under penalty of perjury that they are not subject to workers\u2019 compensation laws. Should the CSLB verify these self-exemption filings or at least investigate the validity of the exemption claim?\u201d (Sen. Com. on Business and Professions, Rep. on Assem. Bill No. 2282 (1989-1990 Reg. Sess.) May 21, 1990, p. 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">Nonetheless, the pertinent provisions, as enacted, do not reflect any such amendments. Furthermore, nothing in the legislative history suggests that the Legislature decided to supplement the CSLB\u2019s enforcement efforts with a system of hirer supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Rather, an examination of the existing statutory scheme discloses an alternative resolution of these concerns. Under section 7083, exempt contractors are required to inform the registrar within 90 days of material changes to information recorded under chapter 9, division 3 of the Business and Professions Code, which encompasses section 7125. As we have noted, the CSLB is authorized to discipline licensees who violate the requirements of their licenses (\u00a7 7090). Finally, section 7126 provides that any licensee who violates the provisions of section 7125, 7125.1, or 7125.2 is guilty of a misdemeanor. In light of these provisions, it appears that the Legislature determined that the threat of disciplinary action and criminal penalties would significantly deter exempt contractors from hiring employees, and thus it was unnecessary to provide the CSLB with a systematic means of detecting such conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Petitioner disagrees with this assessment of the effectiveness of these threats,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and argues that it would be wise policy to require that hirers ensure their exempt contractors meet the conditions of their licenses. Petitioner may be correct, and the Legislature may wish to revisit this matter.  Nonetheless, \u201c[w]hen the Legislature has spoken, the court is not free to substitute its judgment as to the better policy. We are obliged to carry out the intent of the Legislature if it can be ascertained.\u201d <em>(City and County of San Francisco v. Sweet </em>(1995) 12 Cal.4th 105, 121 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 42, 906 P.2d 1196].) It is thus the Legislature\u2019s exclusive prerogative to remedy deficiencies in the existing statutory scheme. (See <em>Blew </em>v. <em>Horner, supra, </em>187 Cal.App.3d at p. 1390, fn. 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">In sum, the WCAB correctly determined that Tomadur is not liable for Lee\u2019s injuries under the workers\u2019 compensation scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The petition for writ of review is denied.

Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3715, 3716), once the [UEF] pays the entire award, the [UEF] becomes subrogated to the employee\u2019s claim and may proceed directly against the uninsured employer to recover the entire amount of the award from him.
