We conclude that the deceased must provide a net financial benefit to the household, deducting first those costs attributable solely to the deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>When a worker dies with no dependents, the employer is required by Labor Code section 4706.5, subdivision (a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to pay an equivalent death benefit to the Department of Industrial Relations (DIR) for addition to the Subsequent Injuries Fund (SIF) (see subd. (c)). The amount paid to DIR is equal to the death benefit paid when the deceased leaves one person totally dependent and no partial dependents, currently set at $125,000 by section 4702, subdivision (a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">In this case, an unmarried worker living with his parents died from industrial causes. His parents elected not to pursue a claim that they were dependent upon him. However, the employer filed a dependency claim on their behalf. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (Board) agreed with the employer that, by paying Lori and Lawrence Walker $150 per month as rent, Joshua Walker made them his dependents. The Board awarded the Walkers a partial dependency award of $7,200, four times the annual rent. It then ordered that DIR take nothing, permitting the employer/ insurance carrier to save $117,800.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">We conclude that the Board analyzed dependency incorrectly and for that reason discounted compelling evidence that the $150 per month rent did not fully reimburse the Walkers for Joshua\u2019s food. We annul the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">\n<em>Facts and Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Joshua was 22 when he died from industrial causes. At the time, he was working for J. R. W. Contemporary, Inc. (JRW), a furniture manufacturer. He had always lived at home and when he turned 21, he began paying $150 per month as rent. He made his own car payments and reimbursed his parents for car insurance because his car was covered by their policy. He was also covered by their health insurance and they paid his copayments for him. Copayments were at most $50 per year. After Joshua was injured and went into the hospital, the household food bill went down by $50 to $75 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">Before the Walkers purchased their house, they rented it. They took Joshua\u2019s rent into consideration when they decided to purchase the house in 1998 and they counted on his payments to help them make the mortgage payments. However, their standard of living did not change financially when they stopped receiving his payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">Although the Walkers originally submitted a death benefit claim, they asked the Board to dismiss it. JRW objected to dismissal of the Walkers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>application and filed its own claim on the Walkers\u2019 behalf. The Board allowed the claim to proceed and JRW to make dependency arguments for the Walkers.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">After hearing, the workers\u2019 compensation judge (WCJ) found that the Walkers were partially dependent upon Joshua because his $150 rent helped them purchase their home. Pursuant to section 4702, subdivision (a)(4), she awarded them $7,200, calculated at four times his annual rent. The Board denied the DIR\u2019s petition for reconsideration, and this petition followed. We granted writ of review. Based upon our review of the record, we annul the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">\n<em>The DIR\u2019s Arguments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">Citing several Supreme Court cases, some recent and some from the 1920\u2019s, the DIR contends that the Board applied the wrong standard for dependency when it found the Walkers were partial dependents even though Joshua made no net financial contribution to their household. DIR asserts the WCJ and Board erroneously took into account the rent paid without deducting the amount devoted to Joshua\u2019s own support.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">When an injured worker dies, any accrued or unpaid compensation is paid to his or her dependents. If there are no dependents, these funds are distributed with the worker\u2019s estate. (\u00a7 4700.) The employer is also liable for reasonable burial expenses, not to exceed $5,000, and for \u201c[a] death benefit, to be allowed to the dependents when the employee leaves any person dependent upon him or her for support.\u201d (\u00a7 4701.) Section 4702 sets the death benefit amount. If the worker left one total dependent and no partial dependents, the death benefit is $125,000 (\u00a7 4702, subd. (a)(3)). If the worker left only partial dependents, the amount of the benefit is \u201cfour times the amount annually devoted to the support of the partial dependents\u201d but in no case more than $125,000 (\u00a7 4702, subd. (a)(4)). Section 4703 governs allocation of the death benefit when there are two or more dependents. It provides that in the case of only partial dependents, \u201cthe amount allowed as a death benefit shall be divided among the persons so partially dependent in proportion to the relative extent of their dependency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">If an employee dies without any surviving dependent, section 4706.5, subdivision (a) dictates that \u201cthe employer shall pay a sum to the Department of Industrial Relations equal to the total dependency death benefit that would be payable to a surviving spouse with no dependent minor children.\u201d That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>amount is set at $125,000 by section 4702, subdivision (a)(3). The amount is to be deposited in the General Fund and credited as a payment into the SIF.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">None of these code sections defines dependency, but the wording of section 4702, subdivision (a)(4) suggests its meaning; it defines the partial dependency benefit as four times the amount \u201cdevoted to the support of the partial dependents.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Division One of this court has proffered the following definition, taken from the dictionary and from treatises: \u201cGenerally speaking, a dependent is one who relies on another for support. [Citation.] Webster defines dependent as \u2018One who is sustained by another, or who relies on another for support or favor.\u2019 [Citations.] 1 Campbell on Workmen\u2019s Compensation (1935 ed.) section 863, pages 767-768 states: \u2018Dependency is a present, existing relation between two persons where the one is sustained by, or relies on, the aid of the other for his means of living. This does not mean absolute dependency for the necessities of life, but rather that the dependent looks to and relies upon the contributions of the injured employee in whole or in part as a means of supporting and maintaining such dependent in accordance with his accustomed mode of life. Dependency within the meaning of the Act involves the idea of a present, current reliance upon the decedent for support.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Industrial Indem. Co. v. Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1966) 243 Cal.App.2d 700, 705-706 [52 Cal.Rptr. 647].)</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Much of the case law on dependency in the workers\u2019 compensation setting arises under sections 3501 and 3502. Section 3501 provides that a child under 18 or one over that age who is physically or mentally unable to earn \u201cshall be conclusively presumed to be wholly dependent\u201d upon a parent with whom he or she was living. Section 3502 provides that in all other cases \u201cquestions of entire or partial dependency . . . shall be determined in accordance with the facts as they exist at the time of the injury of the employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Many of the concepts in the current death benefit statutes were a part of the original workers\u2019 compensation act, adopted in 1917. Originally, the partial disability award was calculated at \u201cthree times the annual amount devoted by the deceased to the support of the [dependents].\u201d (Stats. 1917, ch. 586, \u00a7\u00a7 9(c)(2), 14, pp. 840, 844-845.) The concepts and much of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>wording of this part of the act were continued in its 1937 rewrite. (Stats. 1937, ch. 90, \u00a7 4702, p. 284.) The formula then changed from three times to three and one-half times annual support in 1939 (Stats. 1939, ch. 308, \u00a7 1, p. 1581) and to four times annual support in 1947. (Stats. 1947, ch. 1031, \u00a7 1, p. 2302.)</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The Supreme Court addressed the 1917 version in <em>Spreckels S. Co. v. Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1921) 186 Cal. 256 [199 P. 8]. That decision demonstrates partial dependency in its simplest form, receiving money and providing nothing in return. The deceased in that case at first provided $145 per month, the sole support for his paralyzed brother and the brother\u2019s family. By the time of the accident, the decedent\u2019s brother\u2019s wife had secured a teaching position, and the decedent reduced his support to $45 per month. The Supreme Court simply held that the per annum amount used to compute the benefit paid to the brother and his family should be based upon the $45 per month rate at the time of death, not the total amount provided by the decedent during the previous year. \u201cThe whole theory of the compensation act as to death cases is that the dependents of the employee killed through some hazard of his employment shall be compensated for the loss of the support they were receiving from him at the time of his injury.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 258.)</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Later the same year, the Supreme Court decided <em>Insurance Co. v. Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1921) 186 Cal. 517 [199 P. 8] <em>(Insurance Co.), </em>a decision involving facts similar to those presented here. The 18-year-old decedent in <em>Insurance Co. </em>was living with his mother, sister and 20-year-old brother at the time of his death. During the previous year, he contributed $1,218.30 to the support of his partially dependent mother, a sum that included the expenses of his own board and lodging and $30 of his own clothing. In making its award to the mother, the commission made no deduction for the decedent\u2019s own expenses for clothing, board and lodging. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 518.)</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">The <em>Insurance Co. </em>court concluded the commission erred. \u201cMoney which goes to the support of the deceased himself is, of course, not devoted to the support of any other person. ... It follows that in determining the annual amount devoted to the support of the dependent mother, the amount of the general family expense paid by the decedent should be diminished by deducting the fair proportion thereof that went to the support of the decedent himself and to others in the family who were not dependent upon him.\u201d <em>(Insurance Co., supra, </em>186 Cal. at p. 519.) The court distinguished a contrary Massachusetts decision because compensation under its statute was gauged by the \u201c \u2018the amount contributed by the employee to such partial dependents,\u2019 \u201d not the amount devoted to the support of the partial dependents, as stated in the California statute. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 519-520.)</p>\n<p id=\"b500-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>In <em>Standard Varnish Wks v. Indus. Acc. Com. </em>(1925) 197 Cal. 143, 146-147 [239 P. 1067], applying the foregoing principle, the court upheld a commission award that was computed by deducting from the payments made to the decedent\u2019s mother the proportion used for the decedent\u2019s own support.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Two recent Supreme Court decisions cited to the Board have brought forward in time the principles stated by the court in its 1921 opinions. <em>Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 715, 720, 722 [182 Cal.Rptr. 778, 644 P.2d 1257], cited favorably the <em>Spreckels </em>decision and stated that \u201c[f]ood, clothing, or incidental expenses incurred for the decedent\u2019s own personal use, however, cannot reasonably be considered as part of \u2018the amount annually devoted to the support of the partial dependent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1999) 19 Cal.4th 1182, 1194-1195 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 521, 969 P.2d 613], cited <em>Insurance Co., </em>discussed <em>Spreckels </em>in some detail and rejected a claim that, in computing the amount devoted to the dependent\u2019s support, the Board should exclude income from sources that continued after death.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\"><em>Larsen v. Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1950) 34 Cal.2d 772 [215 P.2d 16], an earlier Supreme Court decision examining dependency of a child, not a parent, lends further support to the notion that the value of food and housing should be considered when deciding the \u201cdependency\u201d issue. In <em>Larsen, </em>the decedent left a totally dependent widow, a partially dependent mother-in-law and a 19-year-old daughter whose dependency status was in issue. The commission found that the daughter was not dependent because she had income of $37 per week. The <em>Larson </em>court noted, however, that the daughter contributed nothing to household expenses and received her room and board free because she was trying to save money. It noted also that the commission had found the value of the mother-in-law\u2019s free room and board to be $72 per month. The court concluded that because the decedent was contributing the same necessities to both, the daughter, like the mother-in-law, was partially dependent upon the decedent. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 773-774.)</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">We find it clear from <em>Larsen </em>that receiving free room and board may help a family member qualify as a dependent. The questions we confront here are the reverse: (1) whether providing room and board to a working adult in exchange for \u201crent\u201d payments may qualify a \u201clandlord\u201d family member as a dependent, and (2) whether, in order for the landlord to qualify as a dependent, the amount of rent must exceed the cost of the food and other necessities provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>(1) <em>May receiving </em>\u201crent\u2019 <em>qualify a parent as a dependent?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">The WCJ concluded, because Joshua\u2019s payment of $150 per month rent \u201calong with the rent paid by his sisters enabled his parents to purchase the home,\u201d it qualified as support payments. The payments \u201ccontributed to the family\u2019s standard of living.\u201d The principle applied by the WCJ is sound. Payments made by an adult child to assist the family in paying its bills, buying its home, or otherwise maintaining its lifestyle qualify as support payments and may be considered in assessing whether the parent is a dependent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While the principle is sound, the Board\u2019s decision may be sustained only if the principle was applied correctly. The Walkers may be considered dependents only if, in fact, Joshua\u2019s payments contributed to maintaining the family\u2019s standard of living.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">(2) <em>Must the \u201crent\" exceed cost of food and other necessities provided?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">The WCJ did not directly address this question in her opinion. She gave the Walkers full credit for the $150 per month payments in calculating the \u201camount devoted to\u201d their support. In justifying this award, she merely stated: \u201c[DIR] argues that dependency cannot be found because allegedly decedent cost more to feed than he paid in rent. I do not believe that is the test that must be applied. Joshua lived in the family home all his life and was eating at the same rate before he started to pay rent as after.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">In her report and recommendation on petition for reconsideration, the WCJ considered the evidence about Joshua\u2019s eating, noting his mother\u2019s estimate that her food bill went down $50 per week after Joshua was hospitalized (inaccurately converting the testimony from \u201c$50 to $75\u201d into $50). She noted that, on further questioning, Ms. Walker acknowledged that she was with Joshua every day and was not eating at home when he was hospitalized. The WCJ opined that the food bill was reduced by Ms. Walker\u2019s changed pattern and by a daughter\u2019s moving out. Again the WCJ rejected DIR\u2019s claim that the parents could not be considered Joshua\u2019s dependents because he made no net monetary contribution to them. She noted again the direct relationship between Joshua\u2019s paying rent and the family\u2019s buying its home.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>The error in the WCJ\u2019s analysis was her uncritical acceptance of Joshua\u2019s free food as the \u201cstatus quo\u201d despite his attaining adulthood and obtaining employment. It is true that, in typical fashion, Joshua received free food from his parents when he was a minor. Presumptively and perhaps actually, he was totally dependent upon them. By the time he turned 18, that situation had changed somewhat because he was working and they required him to pay them $150 per month, which they described as \u201crent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">Neither the fact that they called it \u201crent\u201d and apparently related it to their mortgage payment nor the circumstance that they might not have purchased the house without his agreement to pay rent turned them into his dependents. If, as the evidence shows, Joshua was not fully reimbursing his parents for the food and medical copayments they provided, his $150 payment merely made <em>him less dependent upon them. </em>It did not make them dependent upon him.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">The WCJ mentioned the <em>Atlantic Richfield </em>decision in her report and recommendation on petition for reconsideration but ignored the crucial passage from its page 722, quoted above. She relied instead upon the decision in <em>Arp </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 395 [138 Cal.Rptr. 293, 563 P.2d 849] <em>(Arp). Arp </em>is an important decision because, instead of extending it to widowers, the court invalidated on equal protection grounds the conclusive presumption that a widow who had been living with her husband was totally dependent upon him. The WCJ purported to find a \u201ctest\u201d in <em>Arp </em>and concluded that the test was met in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Scouring <em>Arp </em>for a test, we find only one candidate: \u201cwidows and widowers alike, will be required to prove their dependency, and will be compensated in accordance with the facts and circumstances shown. (\u00a7 3502.) An unemployed spouse presumably can easily establish total financial dependency on the deceased employee, and even an employed spouse may well be able to show partial dependency, since partial dependency is determined in light of the applicant\u2019s standard of living. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Arp, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at p. 410.) This explanation can hardly be considered a \u201ctest\u201d and certainly is not a test that supersedes that described by <em>Insurance Co., Atlantic Richfield </em>and other Supreme Court decisions or a test that justifies the Board\u2019s decision. The WCJ and the Board therefore erred in concluding that no deductions should be made for Joshua\u2019s personal expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">The WCJ\u2019s analysis of the evidence about food cost deserves further examination\u2014to see if the evidence could possibly support the Board\u2019s determination that the Walkers were dependent upon Joshua. Lori Walker first testified that when Joshua went into the hospital, the family food bill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>went down \u201c[b]etween $50 and $75 a week.\u201d On examination by JRW, she testified that before his injury, it had been about $200 a week, and it then went down to \u201c$125 to $150 a week, so $200 a month that\u2019s conservative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Ms. Walker also admitted that her youngest daughter moved out about two weeks before the injury, but she testified her daughter is not a very big eater. The daughter only ate dinner with the family about three times a week and would have only a cup of coffee at breakfast time. She did not notice the bill going down in the weeks between the daughter moving out and Joshua\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Ms. Walker also testified that she herself ate less for a while after her son\u2019s injury. On occasion she would eat at the hospital, but most of the time she ate at home or brought food from home. On further examination, after testifying about her own eating habits and her daughter\u2019s departure from the home, Ms. Walker agreed with her earlier testimony that the reduction attributable to her son not eating at home anymore was $50 to $75 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Mr. Walker testified that he agreed with his wife on the changes in their food bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">No witness quantified the food bill reduction in a way that would support a finding that Joshua\u2019s $150 monthly payment covered all the food he ate. JRW fails to even argue here that Joshua made a net contribution to his parents. Instead, JRW repeats the WCJ\u2019s position that the Walkers relied upon Joshua\u2019s payment in purchasing their house. JRW says only the following about food costs: \u201cIf, in the case at hand, the Walkers were able to maintain the same living standards even after the death of the deceased, it would clearly be based upon the fact that the weekly food bill decreased by $50.00 to $75.00 following the decedent\u2019s injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">JRW\u2019s and the WCJ\u2019s analyses are equally flawed. They fail to follow the approach outlined by the California Supreme Court in 1921 and repeated in 1982. They do not deduct from the decedent\u2019s payments the portion attributable to his or her own food, clothing, etc. The fact that the Walkers could maintain their living standard after Joshua\u2019s death demonstrates that they were not financially dependent upon him.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">That the Walkers took into account Joshua\u2019s $150 in deciding to purchase the house does not show that they were dependent upon him for their standard of living. It shows only that <em>his dependency upon them </em>was a strain upon their finances before they started charging him rent. They could not afford to purchase a house while they were providing him $200 to $300 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>worth of free food each month. When he started reimbursing them $150 per month, they could. After his death, they still could afford their house-because their food bill decreased more than $150.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">The Board\u2019s award to the Walkers is vacated, and the Board is directed on remand to make an appropriate award to the DIR instead.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Jones, P. J., and Simons, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b496-10\"> All statutory references are to the Labor Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b498-8\"> The SIF is taxpayer supported.
