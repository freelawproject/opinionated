J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-V\">Kern County and the owner-operator of a hazardous waste facility appeal the issuance of a writ of mandate directing the Governor to convene an administrative appeal board to review the county\u2019s approval of a conditional use permit for the modification and expansion of the hazardous waste facility. The county and the owner contend the community group challenging the permit failed to timely file a completed application for administrative appeal with the Governor. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-10\">Procedural History and Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b911-11\">In October 1991, Safety-Kleen (Buttonwillow) Inc. (S-K) (then known as Laidlaw Environmental Services (Lokern), Inc.) noticed its intention to seek a conditional use permit and general plan amendment from Kern County to modify and expand its hazardous waste facility near Buttonwillow, California.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-12\">On December 12, 1994, the Kern County Board of Supervisors, acting on behalf of Kern County (collectively the County), adopted resolution No. 94-684 approving Conditional Use Permit No. 4, Map No. 97 (the CUP), concerning the hazardous waste project.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-13\">On January 9, 1995, Padres Hacia una Vida Mejor, an unincorporated association of residents from Buttonwillow, California, and eight individuals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1126\">*1126</page-number>who are farmworkers or spouses (collectively Padres) submitted to the Governor of the State of California an application for appeal, under the Tanner Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the County\u2019s approval of the CUP. The application asserted 24 separate reasons why the conditions imposed by the CUP did not adequately protect the public health, safety and welfare. The application also acknowledged that the appeal was not yet ripe for consideration because, although local approval of the CUP had been obtained, three permits were still required from state agencies regulating toxic substances, air pollution and water quality. These three state permits were obtained over the next four and a half years.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">In a letter dated January 17, 1995, the California Environmental Protection Agency (Cal-EPA) acknowledged Padres\u2019s appeal was timely filed and agreed with the statement by Padres that the appeal should not go forward until all the necessary permits from state agencies had been obtained. The letter then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-5\">\u201cIt has been our practice to treat the application for an appeal as incomplete until such time as all state agencies have made an appropriate permit determination for the project. Until that time, the appeal board cannot be convened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-6\">\u201cWe will retain your appeal as having been timely filed. Once all state permit determinations have been made, you will need to resubmit your appeal to this office, for a further evaluation concerning convention of an appeal board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-7\">\u201cPlease direct all future correspondence concerning this appeal directly to the California Environmental Protection Agency, Office of the Secretary, with a carbon copy to the Office of the Governor, Legal Affairs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">After nearly 1,600 days elapsed, the last permit was obtained on June 1, 1999, when the San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution Control District issued S-K an authority to construct (ATC). On June 30, 1999, Padres filed with the hearing board of the district a petition for an appeal hearing regarding the issuance of the ATC. By letter dated July 14, 1999, the hearing board advised Padres its petition was rejected because it was filed late and without the required filing fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-9\">Nine days later, on July 23, 1999, Padres sent a letter to the Governor and Cal-EPA to inform them that all the permits had been approved for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1127\">*1127</page-number>proposed expansion and modification of the hazardous waste facility and to request the Governor to convene an administrative appeal board under the Tanner Act to review the January 5, 1995, appeal. The letter added as additional grounds for the appeal that the site had accepted 2,200 tons of radioactive waste for disposal, despite the fact that it was not licensed to accept radioactive waste.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\">Between July 23, 1999, and November 12, 1999, Padres\u2019s counsel made a series of telephone calls to the Attorney General\u2019s Office and Cal-EPA in an attempt to get a Tanner board appointed. On November 12, 1999, Padres sent a second letter to Cal-EPA requesting the appointment of a Tanner board to hear its appeal. Padres did not receive a written response from either the Governor or Cal-EPA to its July 23, 1999, or November 12, 1999, letters until after filing its lawsuit against the Governor requesting a writ of mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">In March 2000, counsel for Padres was informed orally by a deputy attorney general that the Governor had determined the Padres appeal should be denied because it was not timely perfected. About a month later, this position was confirmed in a letter dated April 17, 2000, from the Governor\u2019s office that stated the \u201cappeal has been rejected because you failed to perfect the appeal in a timely manner\u201d and explained \u201cyou failed to resubmit your complete appeal to this office for evaluation within the required time frame under the Tanner Act after the June 1, 1999, date.\u201d June 1, 1999, was when the air pollution control district issued the ATC.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">In the meantime, on December 21, 1999, Padres filed a petition for writ of mandate directing Gray Davis, in his capacity as Governor of the State of California, to appoint an administrative appeal board under the Tanner Act to review Padres\u2019s application for appeal of the County\u2019s approval of the CUP for the modification of S-K\u2019s hazardous waste facility. The petition was filed in the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">On April 5, 2000, Governor Davis filed a motion requesting the venue be changed from the City and County of San Francisco to Kern County. The County and S-K filed motions to intervene on April 5 and 6, 2000. In May 2000 the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco granted the motion to change venue and denied the motions to intervene. On July 18, 2000, the County and S-K filed notices of appeal regarding the denial of their motions to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">In August 2000 the County and S-K requested the Superior Court for the County of Kern for leave to participate in the mandamus action as amicus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1128\">*1128</page-number>curiae. The court allowed the County and S-K to file a joint brief opposing the grant of a peremptory writ of mandate and to file requests for judicial notice, but denied their request to participate in oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">On September 1, 2000, the trial court heard arguments on the petition for peremptory writ of mandate and took the matter under submission. On October 5, 2000, the trial court issued its three-page ruling granting the writ. The \u201cJudgment and Order Directing Issuance of Writ of Mandate\" was filed on December 4, 2000. Two days later, the peremptory writ of mandate was issued directing the Governor to \u201c[c]onvene an appeal board as required by the Tanner Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">On December 13, 2000, the County and S-K filed a motion to vacate the judgment and the writ. The County and S-K also attempted to obtain a stay of the enforcement of the writ of mandate. On January 4, 2001, the trial court denied the motion to vacate the judgment and writ and declined to stay enforcement of the judgment and writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">On January 12, 2001, the County and S-K filed a petition for writ of mandate and a request for stay of the judgment and writ with this court, which denied the petition and request four days later. <em>(County of Kern v. Padres Hacia una Vida Mejor, </em>F037379.)</p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">The County and S-K next filed a notice of appeal of the judgment, writ and order denying their motion to vacate the judgment and writ. The appeal was consolidated with their earlier appeals of the denial of their motions to intervene. Those consolidated appeals (Case Nos. F036205, F037576, F037828 &amp; F037832) are the subject of this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-8\">On July 31, 2001, the County and S-K filed a petition in this court seeking a stay of the writ mandating the convention of the administrative appeal board under the Tanner Act (the Tanner Board) or an accelerated hearing date because they believed the impending hearing before the Tanner Board might preclude them from asserting certain jurisdictional and equitable defenses to the convention of the Tanner Board. This court summarily denied the petition on September 7, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-9\">The Tanner Board was constituted and James R. Ryden, adininistrative law judge, Cal-EPA, was designated its presiding officer. Proceedings before the Tanner Board included a prehearing conference on March 15, 2001, hearings on motions to compel discovery on May 9 and 22, 2001, a closed meeting on November 6, 2001, for confidential mediation, and a public hearing on November 14, 15 and 16, 2001, in Bakersfield, California. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1129\">*1129</page-number>parties report that on January 16, 17 and 18, 2002, the Tanner Board resumed but did not complete its hearing to determine whether or not Padres\u2019s application for appeal should be accepted. The hearing is scheduled to resume on March 13, 14 and 15, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-4\">The foregoing procedural history is limited to those matters relevant to the present appeals concerning the writ of mandate directing the Governor to convene a Tanner Board. Further information on another portion of the extensive litigation arising from the attempt to enlarge the hazardous waste facility is set forth in <em>Laidlaw Environmental Services, Inc., Local Assessment Com. v. County of Kern </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 346 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 666].</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">\n<em>County and S-K Have Standing to Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">The County and S-K assert they have standing to bring this appeal because (1) they should have been permitted to intervene in the action; (2) they are \u201caggrieved\u201d parties for purposes of filing a motion to vacate the judgment; and (3) each also is a \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure section 902 and, thus, may appeal the judgment. For purposes of this decision, we assume without deciding that the County and S-K have standing to bring this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">\n<em>The Trial Court Properly Granted the Writ of Mandate Directing the Governor to Convene the Tanner Board</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b915-11\">The merits of this appeal concern the meaning of certain provisions of the Tanner Act that set forth the procedures for an administrative appeal of a local agency\u2019s decision on a hazardous waste facility project. The relevant provisions of the Tanner Act concerning such an administrative appeal are set forth in sections 25199.9<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 25199.10.3</p>\n<p id=\"b915-12\">Broadly stated, the claim by the County and S-K that Padres\u2019s administrative appeal was properly rejected by Cal-EPA is undermined by two main <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1130\">*1130</page-number>problems. First, in handling Padres\u2019s application for an administrative appeal, Cal-EPA created a procedure not set forth in the statute and imposed it on Padres. Second, Cal-EPA did not inform Padres of an important aspect of the extrastatutory procedure it created, namely, the amount of time in which Padres was required to \u201cresubmit\u201d its application.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">There is no evidence the extrastatutory procedure was imposed on Padres in bad faith for the purpose of thwarting Padres\u2019s right to a hearing before the Tanner Board. Rather, it appears Cal-EPA created the extrastatutory procedure as a pragmatic way to deal with the procedural awkwardness arising in certain situations as a result of the Tanner Act\u2019s silence concerning what should happen between (1) the determination by the Governor or his designee that an application for appeal relates to a project that has not received all the required state agency permits and (2) the act by the Governor or his designee directing a Tanner Board be convened.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">The standards applicable to appellate review of a trial court\u2019s interpretation of a statute are well established. Appellate courts review statutory interpretation de novo. <em>(Be v. Western Truck Exchange </em>(1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1139, 1143 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 527].)</p>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">\u201c[W]hen statutory language is clear and unambiguous, we need not construe its meaning. [Citation.] However, where the provisions of a statute are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1131\">*1131</page-number>ambiguous or conflict, we must engage in statutory construction. [Citation.] Our primary purpose is to determine the intent of the Legislature. [Citation.] To do so, we first examine the words of the statute itself, attributing the usual, ordinary, and commonsense meaning to them. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Santa Ana Unified School Dist. </em>v. <em>Orange County Development Agency </em>(2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 404, 408-409 [108 Cal.Rptr.2d 770].) Furthermore, when courts construe a statute, they simply ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein and do not insert what has been omitted. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1858.)</p>\n<p id=\"b917-4\">We are not aware of (1) any published decision analyzing the procedural steps imposed upon an interested person pursuing an administrative appeal under the Tanner Act, (2) any administrative regulation that amplifies or explains the Tanner Act\u2019s administrative appeal provisions, or (3) any published legal opinion of the Attorney General interpreting the administrative appeal provisions of the Tanner Act. Nor does the legislative history of the Tanner Act provided by the parties directly address the issues raised in this case. Accordingly, the construction of sections 25199.9 and 25199.10 required by this case presents an issue of first impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">B. <em>Padres\u2019s Application Was Not \u201cIncomplete\u201d for Purposes of Section 25199.10</em></p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">The County and S-K contend (1) Padres\u2019s January 5, 1995, application for appeal was \u201cincomplete\u201d within the meaning of section 25199.10, subdivision (a); (2) Padres failed to resubmit a completed application for appeal within the required time frame; (3) Padres waived any argument that Cal-EPA\u2019s January 17, 1995, determination was not reasonable, appropriate or consistent with the Tanner Act; and (4) there must be a definite period for resubmitting a completed application for an appeal under the Tanner Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">The first mandatory step of the administrative appeal process contained in the Tanner Act requires the \u201cinterested person\u201d to \u201cfile the appeal within 30 calendar days after the date the local agency takes final action on the land use decision.\u201d (\u00a7 25199.9, subd. (a).) In this case, the Kern County Board of Supervisors approved the CUP on December 12, 1994, and Padres submitted its application for appeal on Monday, January 9, 1995. The application was submitted within the required 30 calendar days and was acknowledged as timely filed by Cal-EPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-10\">The second mandatory step is imposed on the Governor or his designee. \u201c[T]he Governor or the Governor\u2019s designee shall determine within five working days whether the proponent has obtained all permits for the specified hazardous waste facility project which can be obtained before construction from those responsible agencies which are state agencies . . . .\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1132\">*1132</page-number>(\u00a7 25199.10, subd. (a).) In this case, Cal-EPA\u2019s January 17, 1995, letter indicated the appeal board could not be convened until all state agencies made an appropriate permit determination for the project. This letter satisfied the requirement that the Governor\u2019s designee determine within five working days<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> whether all state agency permits had been obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">The parties disagree on the third mandatory procedural step to be applied to the facts of this case. On one hand, the County and S-K argue Cal-EPA properly required Padres to resubmit the application after all state agency permits for the project had been obtained because the application was \u201cincomplete\u201d within the meaning of subdivision (a) of section 25199.10 at the time Padres submitted it. On the other hand, Padres contends the next mandatory step was for the Governor to convene a Tanner Board once the air pollution control district issued the ATC.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">The position of the County and S-K regarding the third mandatory step is tied to their interpretation of the term \u201cincomplete.\u201d However, the problem with their interpretation is illustrated by applying it, along with the mandatory provisions of section 25199.10, to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">When the Governor or his designee determines an application for appeal is \u201cincomplete,\u201d the Tanner Act states they <em>\u201cshall </em>return the application for appeal to the . . . interested party.\u201d (\u00a7 25199.10, subd. (a), italics added.) Next, the interested party <em>\u201cshall </em>resubmit the <em>completed </em>application for an appeal within 20 calendar days after receiving the returned appeal . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 25199.10, subd. (a), italics added.) If an application cannot be \u201ccompleted\u201d unless it shows the project obtained all applicable state agency permits, then it would have been impossible for Padres to resubmit a \u201ccompleted application\u201d within the required 20 calendar days. The consequence of failing to resubmit a \u201ccompleted application\u201d within 20 calendar days is that the Governor or his designee <em>\u201cshall </em>not reconsider whether to convene an appeal board.\u201d (\u00a7 25199.10, subd. (a), italics added.) This mandatory language, when coupled with the interpretation of the term \u201cincomplete\u201d advocated by the County and S-K, would prevent an interested party, like Padres, from ever presenting its position to an appeal board when any of the state agency permits were obtained more than 55 days after the local land use determination. Furthermore, Padres could not avoid this trap by waiting to submit its initial application <em>after </em>all of the state agency permits had been obtained by the project because of the requirement that the application for appeal must be submitted within 30 calendar days of the County\u2019s approval of the CUP.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1133\">*1133</page-number>Cal-EPA recognized the Catch-22<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> its interpretation of the term \u201cincomplete\u201d produced in the context of a timely filed application relating to a project that had not yet received all required state agency permits. To create a way around the Catch-22, Cal-EPA implemented an extrastatutory procedure pursuant to which Cal-EPA (1) retained Padres\u2019s application and (2) instructed Padres to \u201cresubmit your appeal to this office\u201d after all state permit determinations had been made. Because Cal-EPA\u2019s January 17, 1995, letter did not inform Padres that its resubmission would be subject to a deadline, Padres was not aware of the length of the resubmission period, or even the existence of such a period, until after that period had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-4\">We construe the term \u201cincomplete\u201d to refer to an application containing a defect that can be cured by the interested person and, thus, avoid (1) the absurdity of creating the Catch-22 arising from the interpretation of the County and S-K, or (2) violating Code of Civil Procedure section 1858 by inserting an additional procedure into the Tanner Act. Accordingly, an otherwise valid application for administrative appeal is not \u201cincomplete\u201d within the meaning of section 25199.10, subdivision (a), simply because all applicable state agency permits for the project have not been obtained. Rather, an application is \u201cincomplete\u201d when the Governor or his designee cannot determine (1) whether the appeal is based solely on the grounds that the conditions imposed on the project do not adequately protect the public health, safety or welfare, or (2) whether or not the state agency permits have been obtained. If the appeal is based on the required grounds and the application does not provide information about the state agency permits, then the application should be returned to the applicant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The applicant should resubmit and advise whether all the state agency permits have been obtained or not. If the permits have been obtained, then the Governor or his designee will know that the Governor is obligated to convene a Tanner Board. If the state agency permits have not been obtained, then the Governor will know his duty to convene a Tanner Board will not arise until such permits have been issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">As written, section 25199.10 is silent about what happens from the time the Governor or his designee determines not to convene an appeal board because the required state agency permits have not been obtained by the project until the time the Governor or his designee determines all state agency permits for the project have been obtained. Despite the Legislature\u2019s silence about that time period, subdivision (e) of section 25199.9 clearly imposes a mandatory obligation on the Governor or his designee to convene <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1134\">*1134</page-number>an appeal board if all state agency permits have been obtained by the proponent of the project.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">In light of this silence and the mandatory obligation imposed on the Governor or his designee by the statute, we hold the third step mandated by the Tanner Act under the facts of this case was for the Governor to convene a Tanner Board after the project obtained all required state agency permits. The extrastatutory procedure of resubmission created by Cal-EPA and applied to Padres goes beyond what is required by the Tanner Act<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and cannot be considered a valid administrative regulation because, among other things, its creation did not comply with the Administrative Procedure Act. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11340 et seq.; see <em>Cuadra </em>v. <em>Millan </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 855, 864, fn. 10 [72 Cal.Rptr.2d 687, 952 P.2d 704], disapproved on another ground in <em>Samuels v. Mix </em>(1999) 22 Cal.4th 1, 16, fn. 4 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 273, 989 P.2d 701].)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">The County and S-K present a parade of horribles to attack the interpretation of section 25199.10 that does not fill the silence of the Tanner Act about what is to occur between the time the Governor or his designee determine that all the required state agency permits have not been obtained by a project, and the time the Governor convenes a Tanner Board after all the permits have been obtained. However, the silence has existed for 15 years and the Legislature has not acted to create statutory procedures to fill the silence. Nor has Cal-EPA promulgated administrative regulations to address the silence. Also, the record before us does not show the inconvenience for the Governor or his designee in tracking the permitting process is so burdensome that this court should rewrite the statute to eliminate the purported burden. For example, after receiving an application for appeal, the Governor or his designee could request each state agency to send a copy of its determination of whether or not to issue a permit required by the project at the same time the proponent is notified.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">The argument by the County and S-K that there must be a definite period of time for resubmitting the application after all the permits are obtained is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1135\">*1135</page-number>rejected because it is based on the faulty premise that resubmission is required. With respect to the concern that the appeal process could be delayed indefinitely if a deadline is not imposed, a delay will only arise if the Governor or his designee do not perform their obligation of convening a Tanner Board once all of the permits have been obtained. In addition, equitable principles such as laches may result in the interested person\u2019s losing the right to a Tanner Board appeal. Consequently, the interested person has an incentive to inform the Governor or his designee of the completion of the permitting process in the event it is overlooked.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-4\">In the present case, the County and S-K have not shown any prejudice resulting from the lapse of time from June 1, 1999, through July 23, 1999. During that time, Padres pursued on appeal of the ATC issued by the air pollution control district. After that appeal was denied on July 14, 1999, Padres notified Cal-EPA and the Governor\u2019s office that all required permits had been obtained by the project. As a result of the appeal of the ATC, the County and S-K were aware that Padres had not given up its fight against the expansion of the hazardous waste facility. Accordingly, principles of equity do not bar Padres from pursuing the administrative appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">As an alternative application of the Tanner Act to the facts of this case, the County and S-K argue that (1) the application for appeal was, in effect or impliedly, \u201creturned\u201d in accordance with section 25199.10, subdivision (a) to Padres for completion and resubmission and (2) the 20-day statute of limitations applicable to the resubmission was tolled by Cal-EPA\u2019s January 17, 1995, letter until the last state agency permit was issued. This argument fails because it too relies on an inappropriate definition of \u201cincomplete.\u201d Moreover, it is contrary to the facts of this case and the ordinary meaning of the word \u201creturn.\u201d It is undisputed that the application for appeal was not physically delivered back to Padres and that Cal-EPA\u2019s January 17, 1995, letter explicitly stated, \u201cWe will retain your appeal as having been timely filed.\u201d Thus, we cannot find the letter was an <em>effective </em>return of the application for appeal to Padres when both the actions and the words of Cal-EPA clearly indicated the application for appeal was retained rather than returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">C. <em>Padres Did Not Waive Its Ability to Challenge Cal-EPA\u2019s Extrastatutory Procedure</em></p>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">The County and S-K contend that Padres\u2019s reaction to Cal-EPA\u2019s ambiguous January 17, 1995, letter failed to preserve Padres\u2019s right to subsequently challenge the deadline imposed on Padres\u2019s resubmission of its application for appeal or Cal-EPA\u2019s determination that Padres\u2019s January 9, 1995, application for an appeal was \u201cincomplete.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ApB\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1136\">*1136</page-number>(3) Waiver is the intentional relinquishment of a known right by a party with full knowledge of the facts. <em>(Bickel v. City of Piedmont </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 1040, 1051 [68 Cal.Rptr.2d 758, 946 P.2d 427], abrogated with regard to its construction of the Permit Streamlining Act.) (lc) That standard was not met in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"AP5\">There is no direct evidence that Padres intended to give up its statutory rights or intended to be subject to extrastatutory procedures. Furthermore, the County and S-K have failed to show that Padres had full knowledge of how Cal-EPA and the Governor\u2019s Office would later interpret and apply Cal-EPA\u2019s January 17, 1995, letter. The letter is ambiguous and does not state that Padres\u2019s timely filed appeal will be rejected if it is not \u201cresubmitted\u201d within a specified amount of time after the last state agency permit is obtained by the project. Padres could have reasonably inferred from the ambiguous letter that the resubmission requested by Cal-EPA was not a formal resubmission contemplated by section 25199.9, subdivision (a), and thus, was not subject to the 20 calendar days\u2019s resubmission period specified in the statute. One of the reasons Padres could have made this inference is the application for appeal was not returned, which is mandated by the statute for \u201cincomplete\u201d applications.</p>\n<p id=\"A6v\">Accordingly, we hold that Padres did not waive its right to argue that Cal-EPA misinterpreted and misapplied the Tanner Act to Padres\u2019s application for an administrative appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"A5R\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"AkZ\">The judgment is affirmed.
