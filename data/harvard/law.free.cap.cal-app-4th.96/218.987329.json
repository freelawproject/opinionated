Plaintiff claimed that defendant violated the public policy set forth in the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> article I, section 8 of the California Constitution (Section 8), and title YU of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In response to a demurrer filed by defendant, the trial court found, as a matter of law, that plaintiff failed to state a cause of action for wrongful termination because the cited authorities were inadequate to overcome the religious-entity exemption under the preamended version of FEHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">In challenging the court\u2019s decision sustaining defendant\u2019s demurrer, plaintiff argues that all three sources of public policy were adequate to support his claims for wrongful termination. Although we reject plaintiff\u2019s reliance on FEHA, which at the time of plaintiff\u2019s termination completely exempted religious entities from liability under its provisions, we agree with plaintiff that Section 8 and Title VII are alternative sources of fundamental and well-established public policy sufficient to support plaintiff\u2019s common law cause of action for wrongful termination. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">2. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b251-11\">In November of 1995, plaintiff began his employment as a social worker at St. Mary Regional Medical Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>In January of 1998, plaintiff filed a complaint with DFEH for race and sex discrimination. In his complaint, plaintiff alleged that, because he was an African-American male, defendant subjected him to discriminatory treatment with regards to certain employment benefits, including pay raises, job duties, and family care and medical leave under the Family Rights Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On August 19, 1998, plaintiff and defendant entered a settlement agreement resolving the allegations of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">Less than three months later, on November 9, 1998, defendant terminated plaintiffs employment at the medical center.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">In November of 1998, plaintiff filed another complaint with DFEH alleging that defendant suspended and later terminated him because of his earlier complaint for race and sex discrimination. Defendant informed plaintiff that the reason for its employment decision was plaintiff\u2019s poor judgment in transferring a patient to another facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">On May 24, 1999, plaintiff filed his original complaint for the following causes of action: breach of implied contract; breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing; retaliation in violation of FEHA; and wrongful termination in violation of public policy. Defendant filed its motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication on the ground that plaintiffs at-will employee status barred his claims for breach of implied contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Defendant also asserted that it was exempt under FEHA as a nonprofit religious corporation. As to plaintiff\u2019s final cause of action, defendant noted that plaintiff failed to identify a particular public policy. The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary adjudication as to plaintiff\u2019s first three causes of action, but denied the motion as to the last cause of action for wrongful termination in violation of public policy. The court granted plaintiff leave to amend his complaint to identify a particular public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">On April 19, 2000, plaintiff filed his first amended complaint for wrongful termination in violation of public policy under FEHA, Section 8, and Title VII. In his complaint, plaintiff alleged that defendant terminated him in retaliation for filing a complaint with DFEH and EEOC for race and sex discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">Defendant demurred to plaintiff\u2019s first amended complaint on the ground that plaintiff failed to plead facts sufficient to state a cause of action. In support of its demurrer, defendant made the following arguments: FEHA could not support plaintiff\u2019s public policy claim because defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>exempt from FEHA as a matter of law; Section 8 did not provide the basis for a wrongful termination claim based on retaliation; and Title VII did not apply because plaintiff failed to file his complaint with the EEOC.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">At the hearing on August 29, 2000, the trial court noted that plaintiff\u2019s complaint included allegations that he had filed claims with both DFEH and EEOC. During the same hearing, the trial court noted that the parties had failed <em>to </em>provide adequate briefing on how the Legislature\u2019s recent amendment limiting the religious-entity exemption under FEHA affected plaintiff\u2019s claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy. On this subject, the court requested that the parties submit supplemental briefing.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">In his supplemental brief, plaintiff argued that the court should consider California\u2019s current public policy, as manifested in the amended version of FEHA, because defendant should have foreseen that the Legislature would limit the religious-entity exemption. Defendant responded that the amended version of FEHA could not serve as the basis of plaintiff\u2019s wrongful termination in violation of public policy cause of action because the amendments could not be applied retroactively, and because religious-entity liability was not the firmly established public policy in California at the time of plaintiff\u2019s termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">After receiving all further briefing from the parties, the trial court sustained defendant\u2019s demurrer without leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">3. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">On appeal from a judgment of dismissal following the . sustaining of a demurrer, we exercise our independent judgment in determining whether the complaint states, or can be amended to state, a cause of action as a matter of law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In making this determination, we assume the truth of all properly pleaded material facts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">4. <em>Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">The tort cause of action for wrongful termination in violation of public policy provides a vehicle for recourse that otherwise would be unavailable under general rules of the at-will employment doctrine.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> First recognized by the California Supreme Court in <em>Tameny v. Atlantic Richfield </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>Co.,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> this public policy exception allows an employee to bring a tort cause of action against an employer who terminates an at-will employment on a ground that violates fundamental public policy.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The exception is based on the principle that, although an employer may terminate an at-will employee for no reason, or any arbitrary or irrational reason, the employer has no power to terminate the employee for a reason contrary to the law or fundamental public policy.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Despite broad acceptance of the public policy exception, \u201c[t]he difficulty . . . lies in determining where and how to draw the line between claims that genuinely involve matters of public policy, and those that concern merely ordinary disputes between employer and employee. This determination depends in large part on whether the public policy alleged is sufficiently clear to provide the basis for such a potent remedy.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">To support a wrongful discharge claim, the policy must be \u201c(1) delineated in either constitutional or statutory provisions; (2) \u2018public\u2019 in the sense that it \u2018inures to the benefit of the public\u2019 rather than serving merely the interests of the individual; (3) well established at the time of the discharge; and (4) substantial and fundamental.\"<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">By limiting the sources of public policy to constitutional and statutory provisions, the California Supreme Court recognized that the concept of public policy was \u201cnotoriously resistant to precise definition.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus, \u201ccourts should venture into this area, if at all, with great care and due deference to the judgment of the legislative branch, Test they mistake their own predilections for public policy which deserves recognition at law.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Moreover, \u201c[a] public policy exception carefully tethered to fundamental policies that are delineated in constitutional or statutory provisions strikes the proper balance among the interests of employers, employees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>and the public. The employer is bound, at a minimum, to know the fundamental public policies of the state and nation as expressed in their constitutions and statutes; so limited, the public policy exception presents no impediment to employers that operate within the bounds of law. Employees are protected against employer actions that contravene fundamental state policy. And society\u2019s interests are served through a more stable job market, in which its most important policies are safeguarded.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">5. <em>FEHA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Plaintiff offers three sources of public policy, the first of which is FEHA. Plaintiff contends that Government Code sections 12920 and 12940 of FEHA serve as a source of fundamental public policy for his claim of wrongful discharge. Plaintiff also contends that, despite the religious-entity exemption in the preamended version of FEHA, the court should have applied the amended version of FEHA retroactively because defendant\u2019s liability for such discriminatory conduct was foreseeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">We conclude that, while FEHA may be a source of fundamental public policy, well-established law, as set forth in the preamended version of FEHA at the time of plaintiffs termination, bars his common law claim under FEHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">FEHA establishes a civil right to be free from job discrimination based on certain classifications including race and sex.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Government Code section 12920 provides: \u201cIt is hereby declared as the public policy of this state that it is necessary to protect and safeguard the right and opportunity of all persons to seek, obtain, and hold employment without discrimination or abridgement on account of race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, medical disability, medical condition, marital status, sex, age, or sexual orientation.\u201d FEHA\u2019s provisions prohibiting discrimination may provide the policy basis for a claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">However, FEHA does not serve as a policy basis where another statutory provision exempts defendant from liability. In <em>Jennings </em>v. <em>Marralle,</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the plaintiff sued the defendant for wrongful termination in violation of public policy under FEHA against age discrimination. There, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant terminated her to prevent her from receiving her benefits under the defendant\u2019s pension plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>In <em>Jennings, </em>the California Supreme Court noted that, while FEHA stated a public policy against employment discrimination based on.age, FEHA also limited its application to employers of five or more employees.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The court advised that, in extracting public policy from legislation, courts must consider the entire statutory scheme in conjunction with any language limiting its application.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Government Code section 12926, subdivision (d), defines \u201cemployer\u201d as \u201cany person regularly employing five or more persons.\u201d The court reasoned: \u201cWe agree with plaintiff that the public policy declared by the Legislature in section 12920 applies to all employers. It does not follow, however, that in declaring that policy the Legislature intended to create the basis for a common law tort action and to thereby subject employers whom it expressly exempted from FEHA coverage to liability for age discrimination.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The court concluded that FEHA\u2019s age discrimination policy did not support the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy against a defendant that employed fewer than five employees.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">In <em>Kelly v. Methodist Hospital of So. </em>California,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> the California Supreme Court addressed another limitation on qualified employers. As here, in <em>Kelly, </em>the defendant was a nonprofit religiously affiliated hospital. The defendant terminated the plaintiff, a 50-year-old nurse, because she refused to return to work after her medical leave expired. In her lawsuit, the plaintiff included a claim for wrongful termination based on age in violation of public policy under FEHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Government Code section 12926, former subdivision (d) provided that an \u201cemployer\u201d did not include a nonprofit religious entity. Before the amendments, as discussed below, qualified religious entities enjoyed complete exemption from FEHA\u2019s requirements.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Therefore, the court found the defendant exempt from the plaintiff\u2019s claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy under FEHA.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Likewise, in this case, defendant, as a nonprofit religious corporation, is exempt from plaintiffs common law claim under FEHA. And, plaintiff does not challenge defendant\u2019s qualification as a nonprofit religious entity within the meaning of Government Code section 12926, subdivision (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>Nevertheless, plaintiff, in citing <em>Dabbs </em>v. <em>Cardiopulmonary Management Services,</em><footnotemark><em>25</em></footnotemark><em> </em>argues that the current version of FEHA, which limited the scope of the religious-entity exemption, may serve as the basis of public policy for her wrongful termination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">In 1999, the Legislature enacted Government Code section 12922, which provides: \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of this part, an employer that is a religious corporation may restrict eligibility for employment in any position involving the performance of religious duties to adherents of the religion for which the corporation is organized.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The Legislature also enacted Government Code section 12926.2. Former subdivision (c) of that provision read: \u201cNotwithstanding subdivision (d) of Section 12926 and except as otherwise provided in paragraph (1) or (2), \u2018employer\u2019 includes a religious corporation or association with respect to persons employed by the religious association or corporation to perform duties, other than religious duties, at a health care facility operated by the religious association or corporation for the provision of health care that is not restricted to adherents of tiie religion that established the association or corporation.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">As stated earlier, to support a wrongful discharge claim, the public policy must be, among other things, well established at the time of plaintiff\u2019s termination.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Obviously, legislation enacted after plaintiff\u2019s termination neither existed, nor was well established at the pertinent time. Although the preamended version of FEHA was inconsistent with federal civil rights law,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> we cannot impose civil liability upon an employer under FEHA\u2014a legislative scheme that expressly precluded application of its provision to such employers.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Furthermore, the newly enacted provisions of FEHA are not retroactive.  Generally, statutes do not apply retroactively unless the Legislature clearly indicated otherwise.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Also, a retroactive statute affects the parties\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>rights and obligations that exist before the statute\u2019s adoption.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark>\n                   In regards to the FEHA amendments, plaintiff concedes that the Legislature made no express provision for retroactive application. Under the circumstances in this case, the amendments substantially affect defendant\u2019s liability under FEHA. This case does not resemble the situation presented in <em>Dabbs, </em>which involved an act, that became operative two months after the plaintiff\u2019s termination, but neither changed nor conflicted with existing statutory law and policy that supported the plaintiff\u2019s wrongful discharge claim.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> In this case, the presumption against retroactive application would preclude plaintiff\u2019s reliance on the newly enacted provisions of FEHA as the basis of public policy for his wrongful discharge claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">We conclude that the trial court properly found that FEHA did not support plaintiffs cause of action for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">6. <em>Section 8</em></p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Plaintiff also claimed that defendant terminated his employment in violation of public policy as set forth in Section 8. Section 8 provides: \u201cA person may not be disqualified from entering or pursuing a business, profession, vocation, or employment because of sex, race, creed, color, or national or ethnic origin.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Although defendant acknowledges that Section 8 may provide the public policy for discrimination claims, defendant argues that Section 8 does not support wrongful termination claims based on an employer\u2019s retaliatory conduct. Defendant\u2019s argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">Courts have found Section 8 as an alternative source of public policy for wrongful termination claims.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Section 8 reflects fundamental and firmly established public policy against employment discrimination based on certain classifications including race and sex.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>In <em>Badih </em>v. <em>Myers,</em><footnotemark><em>36</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the defendant claimed that, as an employer with fewer than five employees, he was not subject to liability under FEHA for the plaintiff\u2019s wrongful termination claim based on pregnancy discrimination. The plaintiff, however, argued that her wrongful termination claim was not only based on FEHA, but also the public policy set forth in Section 8. The court therefore determined whether pregnancy discrimination constituted a form of sex discrimination under Section 8. Although pregnancy discrimination was not a specifically enumerated category of prohibited discrimination under Section 8, the court, after reviewing certain statutes and court decisions, agreed that pregnancy discrimination should be treated as a form of sex discrimination. In citing the California Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Rojo </em>v. <em>Kliger,</em><footnotemark><em>37</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the court held that because Section 8 expresses fundamental public policy against sex discrimination, it provided the public policy basis for maintaining a cause of action for wrongful discharge based on pregnancy discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">. As stated above, although defendant may agree that Section 8 provides an alternative source of public policy against discrimination, defendant challenges plaintiff\u2019s characterization of his claim as one based on discrimination, as opposed to retaliation. Defendant argues that, while Section 8 states a public policy against discrimination based on race and sex, it provides no policy in regards to employer retaliation. Defendant notes that Section 8 neither explicitly mentions the term \u201cretaliation,\u201d nor implicitly prohibits an employer from retaliating against an employee \u201cfor filing a charge with a government agency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Quoting from <em>Sequoia Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court,</em><footnotemark><em>38</em></footnotemark><em> </em>defendant states that \u201c[A] constitutional or statutory provision must sufficiently describe the type of prohibited conduct to enable an employer to know the fundamental public policies that are expressed in that law.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> As noted by plaintiff, however, the quoted language is prefaced by the clause: \u201cAlthough one should not assume that the employer\u2019s <em>precise act </em>(e.g., discharging an employee for refusing to commit a crime) must be specifically prohibited for the public policy exception to apply . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> In <em>Sequoia, </em>the plaintiff failed to point to a specific provision of any law in support of his wrongful termination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Here, plaintiff referred to Section 8\u2019s prohibition against employment discrimination based on race and sex. In his complaint, plaintiff alleged that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>defendant terminated his employment in retaliation for filing a claim of race and sex discrimination with the EEOC. As in <em>Badih v. Myers,</em><footnotemark><em>41</em></footnotemark><em> </em>while this form of discrimination is not enumerated specifically in Section 8, employment discrimination often manifests itself in retaliatory conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">Indeed, one category of wrongful discharge claims occurs where an employer terminates an employee for \u201creporting an alleged violation of a statute of public importance.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> One court explained: \u201c[A] violation of the statute is <em>also </em>a violation of public policy, and if an employer fires an employee who complains to the authorities about such violation, then the termination is a termination in violation of public policy. And such termination, being in contravention of a fundamental public policy, is hence actionable as the tort of wrongful termination in violation of public policy.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Courts have allowed wrongful termination claims in the following circumstances: where an employer discharged an employee for complaining about the employer\u2019s use of defective parts;<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> where an employer terminated an employee in retaliation for supporting a coworker\u2019s sexual harassment claim;<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> where an employer fired employees in retaliation for reporting immigration violations;<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> where an employer fired an employee in retaliation for attempting to implement antidiscrimination policies,<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> and, as here, where an employer terminated an employee for filing complaints of race and sex discrimination with the EEOC.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">In <em>Rojo </em>v. <em>Kliger,</em><footnotemark><em>49</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the California Supreme Court noted that the plaintiffs alleged that they were terminated for refusing to submit to their employer\u2019s sexual advances and that they were terminated in retaliation for exercising their fundamental right to be free from sexual harassment.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> The court indicated that under either theory, the plaintiffs\u2019 causes of action for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy were sufficient to survive demurrer.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">For these reasons, we reject defendant\u2019s attempt to draw a distinction between retaliation and discrimination. \u201c. . . <em>Tameny </em>and its progeny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>confirm, implicitly and explicitly, that discharge of an employee in retaliation for resisting employer violations of laws that secure important public policies contravenes those policies, and gives rise to a common law action in tort.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> We hold that the trial court erred in sustaining defendant\u2019s demurrer as to plaintiff\u2019s wrongful termination claim based on defendant\u2019s retaliation in violation of Section 8\u2019s policy against race and sex discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">7. <em>Title VII</em></p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">In addition to FEHA and Section 8, plaintiff also offered Title VII as an alternative source of public policy against employment discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Defendant argues that, because it directly conflicted with the California Legislature\u2019s intent at the time of plaintiffs termination, Title VII could not serve as the policy basis for defendant\u2019s wrongful discharge claim. Although defendant acknowledges that courts have relied on federal law to support such claims, defendant contends that no court has relied on federal authority that directly conflicted with California law.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">We begin our analysis with the relevant provisions of Title VII. Title 42 United States Code section 2000e-2 states: \u201cIt shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer . . . [\u00b6] . . . to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">Title 42 United States Code section 2000e-3(a) provides: \u201cIt shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees or applicants for employment. . . because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter, or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">Lastly, 42 United States Code section 2000e-l(a) states: \u201cThis subchapter shall not apply to an employer with respect to the employment of aliens outside any State, or to a religious corporation, association, educational institution, or society with respect to the employment of individuals of a particular religion to perform work connected with the carrying on by such corporation, association, educational institution, or society of its activities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">These provisions indicate that, while federal law is consistent with state law in prohibiting retaliatory discharge for filing a charge of race and sex <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>discrimination, federal law contradicts state law, as it existed at the time of plaintiff\u2019s termination, in applying this policy to religious entities.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">As discussed above, to support a wrongful termination claim, the policy must be \u201c(1) delineated in either constitutional or statutory provisions; (2) \u2018public\u2019 in the sense that it \u2018inures to the benefit of the public\u2019 rather than serving merely the interests of the individual; (3) well established at the time of the discharge; and (4) substantial and fundamental.\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Without question, federal law condemning employment discrimination based on race and sex satisfies the last three requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">The question, however, is whether Title VH is an appropriate source of public policy. \u201cThe employer is bound, at a minimum, to know the fundamental public policies of the <em>state and nation </em>as expressed in their constitutions and statutes; so limited, the public policy exception presents no impediment to employers that operate within the bounds of law.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Under circumstances as the one presented here, where the public policies of the state and the nation are in direct conflict, the precise issue is whether federal law that is inconsistent with state law can serve as the source of public policy for a state common law cause of action for wrongful termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Before evaluating this issue, we first note that in the absence of a conflict between state and federal policies, federal statutory and constitutional law may provide the policy basis for a wrongful termination claim.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> While the claim is a state law cause of action,<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> there is no requirement that the public policy basis for the cause of action be derived solely from state law.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Rather, federal law, and in particular, Title VII, may supply an alternative public policy basis for a wrongful termination claim.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">In <em>Green v. Ralee Engineering Co.,</em><footnotemark><em>60</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the California Supreme Court held that statutorily authorized federal administrative regulations on airline safety provided the necessary public policy basis for plaintiff\u2019s wrongful termination claim.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> The court noted that its conclusion was consistent with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>rule that public policy be tethered to specific statutory or constitutional provisions.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">In response to the defendant\u2019s argument that the common law claim should not be based on federal authority that neither prohibits the act of retaliatory termination, nor provides for civil damages, the court found that the defendant\u2019s argument lacked merit because employers are \u201cresponsible for knowing \u2018the fundamental public policies of the state <em>and </em>nation.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> The court also noted that, in <em>Tameny, </em>the first case in which the court recognized the common law cause of action for wrongful termination, the claim was based in part on federal antitrust laws.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> Thus, so long as the other requirements are satisfied, the public policy for a wrongful termination claim may be delineated in federal statutory, constitutional, and even regulatory provisions.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">In this case, although a conflict exists between state and federal law, we have found no authority restricting the use of federal law as public policy for a wrongful discharge claim in the face of conflicting state law. Nevertheless, defendant, during oral argument, contended that, in allowing plaintiff to assert a claim for wrongful discharge in violation of federal public policy that is contrary to clear state legislative intent, we are in effect infringing upon the Legislature\u2019s authority to define California\u2019s public policy. We disagree. California has not limited the definition of public policy solely to remedies provided by state statutory or regulatory provisions. In enacting FEHA, the state Legislature intended to supplement existing state and federal remedies for employment discrimination.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">In fact, nothing in FEHA or Title VII prevents a plaintiff from raising alternative theories for his wrongful termination claim. As stated above, \u201c[t]he absence of an [sic] FEHA remedy would not negate the existence of a common law tort remedy if another law created the right on which this action is predicated.\u201d<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> Even if a plaintiff relies on a policy that conflicts with FEHA, such conflict does not preclude plaintiff from submitting an alternative policy ground.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark>\n                   Unlike other states that either do not provide a common law public policy exception to the at-will employment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>doctrine,<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> or do not allow a common law claim to be based on statutory sources that provide their own remedies,<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> California law allows a plaintiff to rely on alternative antidiscrimination remedies in order to afford the plaintiff the maximum opportunity to vindicate his civil rights.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">In particular, under California law, despite FEHA\u2019s limitation on religious-entity liability, FEHA was not intended to provide an exclusive remedy for civil rights violations.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> \u201cAn examination of [FEHA] supports the view it lacks the comprehensiveness necessary to infer a legislative intent to displace all preexisting or alternative remedies for employment discrimination. For example, with the exception of cases involving harassment, the FEHA applies only to \u2018employers\u2019 of five or more persons . . . , it excludes religious associations or nonprofit corporations . . . , and it does not protect against discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation.\u201d<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> Plaintiffs are not bound by FEHA\u2019s limitations, but rather, are free to seek alternative sources of law to support their wrongful discharge claim.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> Therefore, limitations, including those that define which employers are subject to liability for employment discrimination under FEHA, do not apply to common, law causes of action for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy based on policy found elsewhere.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">As with the California Legislature, Congress has promoted liberal construction of its employment discrimination laws to afford the greatest protection to the victims of discrimination.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> The remedies afforded under Title VII do not preempt a state law claim for wrongful termination in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>violation of public policy.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> The Congress specifically provided: \u201cNothing in this subchapter shall be deemed to exempt or relieve any person from any liability, duty, penalty, or punishment provided by any present or future law of any State or political subdivision of a State . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> The employment discrimination laws of California and the nation, therefore, provide alternative remedies to achieve the goal of combating inequality in the workplace.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">In allowing plaintiff to rely on public policy based on the law of the nation, as opposed to the state, another important consideration is whether the employer had adequate notice of such theory of liability.  The requirement that the public policy be delineated in a statutory or constitutional provision balances the competing interests of \u201c(1) providing the employer with proper warning it is violating fundamental public policies, (2) ensuring employees are protected against employer actions that contravene fundamental policy, and (3) guaranteeing to the public that employers\u2019 interests will not be protected at the expense of society\u2019s most important policies. [Citations.]\u201d<footnotemark>80</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">The federal antidiscrimination statutes provide employers with adequate notice. Title VII prohibits employment discrimination based on race and sex. Under 42 United States Code section 2000e-1(a), while religious-entity employers may base their employment decisions on religious preferences, they are not exempt from liability for discrimination based on other impermissible grounds including race and sex.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> Because California religious-entity employers must comply with federal antidiscrimination laws, they have adequate notice that employment discrimination based on race and sex may subject them to possible liability under those laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Moreover, in this case, plaintiff\u2019s first charge with DFEH noted that he had filed a claim with both DFEH and the EEOC. Plaintiff\u2019s charge also listed his EEOC claim number. Plaintiff\u2019s second charge with DFEH provided the same information. Therefore, in this particular case, defendant had adequate notice of plaintiff\u2019s possible reliance on the provisions of both state and federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that, although the public policies under FEHA and Title VII are in direct conflict in regards to the scope of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>religious-entity exemption, a plaintiff may rely on Title VII as a source of public policy for his state common law cause of action for wrongful termination. This conclusion, albeit problematic by allowing a plaintiff to extract public policy from various statutes without complying with certain statutory requirements,<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> is nonetheless consistent with the purpose of both state and federal antidiscrimination laws. In enacting California\u2019s antidiscrimination laws, \u201cthe Legislature has manifested an intent to amplify, not abrogate, an employee\u2019s common law remedies for injuries relating to employment discrimination.\u201d<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> The same can be said of Congress\u2019s intent in enacting Title VII.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> Policies against race and sex discrimination are among the state and nation\u2019s most fundamental and substantial public policies,<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> and therefore, multiple remedies, while at times overlapping or even conflicting, serve the purpose of maximizing plaintiff\u2019s opportunity to seek relief from discrimination based on such impermissible classifications.<footnotemark>86</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">Accordingly, the trial court erred in sustaining defendant\u2019s demurrer on the ground that plaintiff could not apply Title VII as a public policy source for his wrongful termination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">8. <em>Disposition</em></p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">We reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment of dismissal. Plaintiff shall recover his costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">Hollenhorst, Acting P.
