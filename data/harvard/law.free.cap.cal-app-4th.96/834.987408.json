J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ax5\">Appellant Lauren H. (Lauren), through her guardian ad litem, Renae Romandia, sued respondents Dr. Tillaikarasi Kannappan and San Dimas Medical Group, alleging personal injury, medical malpractice and negligence. Lauren suffered permanent damage as a result of certain conditions and events which occurred during her birth at San Dimas. Kannappan was the physician responsible for Lauren\u2019s delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">The trial court granted respondents\u2019 postverdict motion for a new trial on all issues of liability and damages and did not decide appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial on damages only. The trial court\u2019s specification of reasons for its new trial order stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-7\">\u201cThe Court finds the evidence legally inadequate to support a finding that the Plaintiffs\u2019 economic damages are in the amount of $150,000.00. The only credible evidence in this case was that the economic damage sustained by the Plaintiff was future medical expenses which was estimated to be between $10,000.00 and $15,000.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-8\">\u201cThe Court finds the evidence to be legally inadequate to sustain a finding that the Plaintiff did not sustain any non-economic damages. The evidence was that the Plaintiff sustained trauma at birth and a disfiguring injury for which the only reasonable inference would be that she would have anxiety and embarrassment irrespective of her ability to cope with her disfigurement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-9\">\u201cThe motion for new trial on all issues of liability and damages is granted. The evidence on liability was sharply disputed and the jury finding of zero non-economic damages causes the Court to conclude that the jury rendered a compromise verdict.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b647-11\">Reduced to its essence, appellant\u2019s contention is that the trial court erred in finding a compromise verdict and therefore the portion of the order which directed a new trial on liability must be overturned because the finding of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>compromise verdict lacks support in the record. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 657.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant stakes her case upon the three juror declarations she produced in opposition to respondents\u2019 new trial motion and claims the declarations \u201cconstituted <em>unrebutted, direct evidence </em>which <em>completely negated </em>any possible inference of compromise verdict.\u201d According to appellant, the facts described in the juror affidavits should have been \u201cdeemed admitted\u201d or \u201cestablished\u201d for purposes of the court\u2019s ruling on the motion because respondents did not file juror counteraffidavits. (See <em>Chronakis v. Windsor </em>(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 1058, 1066 [18 Cal.Rptr.2d 106] [quotient verdict]; <em>Lankster v. Alpha Beta Co. </em>(1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 678, 681 [18 Cal.Rptr.2d 923] [juror misconduct]; <em>Tapia v. Barker </em>(1984) 160 Cal.App.3d 761, 765 [206 Cal.Rptr. 803] [juror bias].)</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">Respondents maintain the new trial order must be affirmed notwithstanding the absence of counteraffidavits because the record discloses the classic indicia of a compromise verdict. Respondents rest their case upon the principle that an order for a complete new trial is compelled when certain circumstances are shown to exist, such as inadequate damages and a close question as to liability. (See <em>Leipert v. Honold </em>(1952) 39 Cal.2d 462, 467 [247 P.2d 324, 29 A.L.R.2d 1185]; <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Melody Lane </em>(1952) 39 Cal.2d 481, 489-490 [247 P.2d 335].) Respondents also assert that the juror declarations were entirely inadmissible under Evidence Code section 1150.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">I <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">Appellant is incorrect that the three juror declarations must be deemed to have conclusively disproved a compromise verdict. Appellant misapprehends the nature of the decision made by the trial court and the posture of the appeal before us.  The rule affording primacy to unopposed affidavits is confined in its application to new trial motions based upon irregularity in the proceedings, jury misconduct, accident or surprise, and newly discovered evidence, because the governing statute directs that motions on these grounds \u201cmust be made upon affidavits.\u201d (\u00a7 658; see <em>Linhart </em>v. <em>Nelson </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 641, 644 [134 Cal.Rptr. 813, 557 P.2d 104] [statute strictly construed; no oral testimony by jurors permitted].) Though respondents\u2019 motion for a new trial was in part based upon irregularity in the proceedings (\u00a7 657, subd. 1) and jury misconduct (\u00a7 657, subd. 2), the trial court granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>the motion on different grounds\u2014that is, insufficiency of the evidence (\u00a7 657, subd. 6). (See <em>Tramell </em>v. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. </em>(1984) 163 Cal.App.3d 157, 171 [209 Cal.Rptr. 427] [Although jury misconduct is a distinct ground for granting a new trial, evidence of jury misconduct may be relevant to a determination that damages were excessive, another distinct ground for granting a new trial.]; <em>Stevens v. Parke, Davis &amp; Co. </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 51, 59-60 [107 Cal.Rptr. 45, 507 P.2d 653, 94 A.L.R.3d 1059] [a finding that damages are excessive is equivalent to a finding that the evidence is insufficient to support the award].) When a motion is made upon the ground of insufficient evidence, it \u201cmust be made on the minutes of the court.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (\u00a7 658.) Necessarily, then, the \u201cminutes of the court\u201d will support a new trial order based upon subdivision 6 of section 657.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">We find nothing to the contrary in <em>Tramell </em>v. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp., supra, </em>163 Cal.App.3d at page 157, relied upon by appellant. <em>Tramell </em>simply acknowledged that evidence of jury misconduct may be pertinent to a new trial motion based upon alleged excessive damages, even though jury misconduct is \u201cin itself a ground for granting a new trial.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 171.) <em>Tramell </em>does not anywhere say that unopposed juror affidavits are conclusive when presented in opposition to a new trial motion brought on the ground of insufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Appellant is also incorrect in her assumption that the notion of a compromise verdict, as it is relevant to this case, constitutes procedural irregularity (\u00a7 657, subd. 1) or jury misconduct (\u00a7 657, subd. 2) and thus that respondents\u2019 motion should have been resolved in appellant\u2019s favor as the party who produced unchallenged affidavits. Whether or not a compromise verdict would furnish a <em>substantive </em>basis for a new trial motion under one of the other subdivisions of section 657, an issue we need not address, the existence of a compromise verdict becomes a <em>procedural </em>question relevant to the proper scope of the new trial order when the new trial is granted under subdivision 6 of section 657\u2014that is, whether the new trial may be limited to the issue as to which the evidentiary problem was found or instead must encompass all litigated issues. (See discussion at 8 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Attack on Judgment in Trial Court, \u00a7 113 et seq., p. 617 et seq.; Wegner et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Trials and Evidence (The Rutter Group 2001) \u00b6 18:423 et seq., pp. 18-86 et seq (rev. #1 1999).) Many factors beyond the adequacy of a damage award are relevant to the decision about whether a verdict is a product of compromise (8 Witkin, California <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>Procedure, <em>supra, </em>Attack on Judgment in Trial Court, \u00a7 115, p. 620). These other factors would be immaterial if the deficiency which furnished the basis for the new trial order was alone enough to mandate a comprehensive new trial. Nothing in the relevant statutes, case law, or secondary authorities remotely suggests that the rule according decisive effect to uncontested affidavits applies to the resolution of the question, when posed for the purpose of determining the issues to be retried, whether the verdict was a compromise.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">The inapplicability of the \u201cdeemed admitted\u201d rule pertaining to unchallenged juror affidavits may not mean the affidavits submitted by appellant were inadmissible.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> What it does mean, however, is that such uncontested affidavits, if admissible, were not decisive, and the trial court, as the trier of fact <em>(Lane v. Hughes Aircraft Co. </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 405, 412 [93 Cal.Rptr.2d 60, 993 P.2d 388]), was entitled to rely upon the \u201cminutes of the court,\u201d to the extent they supported respondents\u2019 motion and the relief requested by respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">The trial court\u2019s decision that the new trial should not be restricted to damages and should also encompass liability is supported by substantial evidence and therefore was not an abuse of the trial court\u2019s considerable discretion. <em>(Lane v. Hughes Aircraft Co., supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at p. 412 [The factual findings made by a trial court when it grants a motion for a new trial are entitled to the \u201csame deference that an appellate court would ordinarily accord a jury\u2019s factual determinations.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Witkin addresses the topic of compromise verdicts as follows: \u201cVerdicts are sometimes rendered in personal injury or death actions that, in view of the evidence of injuries, suffering, and medical and other expenses, are clearly inadequate. Common experience suggests that these are the result of compromise, some jurors believing that the evidence fails to establish liability, but yielding to the extent of agreement on a small recovery. It would be unfair to the defendant to ignore this unmistakable evidence of compromise and to accept the verdict for the plaintiff at face value as a determination of liability. Accordingly, it is well settled that the error calls for a general new trial, and a limited order is an abuse of discretion. [Citations.]\u201d (8 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>supra, </em>Attack on Judgment in Trial Court, \u00a7 115, pp. 619-620.)</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>Other indicators of a compromise verdict are (1) a close verdict; (2) jury requests for readback; (3) jury indecision whether the plaintiff should recover a certain amount or nothing; (4) a subsequent jury election to straddle and award a compromise recovery in a lesser amount than that to which plaintiff would be entitled if plaintiff prevailed; and (5) a short trial. <em>(Leipert v. Honold, supra, </em>39 Cal.2d 462; <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Melody Lane, supra, </em>39 Cal.2d at p. 489; 8 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>supra, </em>Attack on Judgment in Trial Court, \u00a7 115, p. 620; 7 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>supra, </em>Trial, \u00a7 364, p. 414.) When this sort of <em>\u201cunmistakable </em>evidence\u201d (8 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>supra, </em>Attack on Judgment in Trial Court, \u00a7 115, p. 620, italics added) is present, \u201cthe only reasonable conclusion\u201d to be drawn \u201cis that the jurors compromised the issue of liability\u201d <em>(Rose </em>v. <em>Melody Lane, supra, </em>39 Cal.2d at p. 489). It is an abuse of discretion to grant only a partial new trial when liability is close, the damages are inadequate, and the jury returns a nine-to-three verdict, all of which signal that the verdict was probably the result of a compromise of the liability issue. <em>(Shaw v. Hughes Aircraft Co. </em>(2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 1336, 1346 [100 Cal.Rptr.2d 446].)</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">The record contains abundant evidence of such a verdict. The evidentiary portion of the trial was relatively short\u2014approximately three and a half days. The jury deliberations were relatively long\u2014a further three days. The expert witnesses held diametrically opposed views concerning Kannappan\u2019s adherence to the applicable standard of care during the delivery.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Additionally, the jury rendered a nine-three verdict on liability; a jury deadlock had occurred on the first full day of deliberations; the court subsequently had given a deadlocked-jury admonition; there had been a later mistaken verdict; and still further deliberations had been conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">We recognize the trial court\u2019s findings included a determination that the jury\u2019s award for economic damages exceeded what the evidence might have justified. Though excessive damages has not been regarded as a hallmark of a compromise verdict, such a finding does not invariably limit the resulting retrial to damage issues. (See <em>Liodas v. Sahadi </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 278, 285-286 [137 Cal.Rptr. 635, 562 P.2d 316].) Given the conflicting evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>of liability, the jury\u2019s mishandling of both aspects of damages, and the presence of the other many signs of a placatory verdict in the case here, we cannot say the trial court\u2019s decision to order a complete new trial was a manifest abuse of discretion. <em>(Ibid.)</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The judgment is affirmed.
