J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2q\">Appellants, manufacturers of asbestos products, appeal from an adverse judgment in this wrongful death action. They raise issues recurring in asbestos litigation regarding admissibility of the decedent\u2019s pension and Social Security income under the collateral source rule; foundational evidence for damages for lost household services; prejudgment interest in a wrongful death case; failure to allocate fault to tobacco companies; imposition of costs under Code of Civil Procedure section 998; and inadequate foundation for business records.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-10\">We decline California Portland Cement Company\u2019s (CPC) invitation to reconstruct the collateral source rule in a way that would reduce respondents\u2019 damages. In addition, we find that there was sufficient evidence of the nature of the decedent\u2019s household services, together with appropriate reference to a study of household services. It was not error to assess personal injury prejudgment interest in this wrongful death case. Tobacco companies were immune from liability at all relevant times in the case; thus, no allocation of fault was appropriate. In the unpublished portion of the opinion, we determine that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding costs after appellants\u2019 failure to accept an offer to compromise and that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1219\">*1219</page-number>was sufficient evidence of reliability to support admission of a number of business records. We therefore affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-4\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">Roland and Sharon McKinney were married in the early 1950\u2019s and had two children, Kevin and Melody Ann. When Roland got out of the Navy in 1955, he returned to work as a plasterer, and was exposed to asbestos-containing products during his working career. In particular, decedent used asbestos-containing gun plastic cement, manufactured by appellants. In the early 1980\u2019s, Roland first received a warning about the dangers of asbestos from the plasterer\u2019s union. By that time, he was no longer using asbestos products in plastering.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">Roland retired, for reasons unrelated to asbestos exposure, and began drawing income from his union pension in 1989. At age 62, he elected to begin receiving Social Security payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">Two days before his death, Roland and his family learned that he had lung cancer. Although Sharon McKinney believed that cigarette smoking played a role in her husband\u2019s death, she also believed that asbestos exposure contributed to his death. Roland McKinney died of lung cancer on August 18, 1996, at the age of 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-8\">On December 31, 1996, Sharon McKinney and her two children brought an action for damages against a number of asbestos defendants, including appellants CPC and Amcord, Inc. The complaint alleged a survivor\u2019s action and a wrongful death action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-9\">On January 14, 1998, McKinney served an offer to compromise on the defendants pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 998.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> CPC and Amcord objected to the offer on the ground that it was premature in that discovery was still at an early stage. By the time of trial, most of the defendants had settled and only CPC and Amcord remained in the action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1005-10\">At the trial, Dr. Barry Ben-Zion, McKinney\u2019s economist, calculated that Roland McKinney\u2019s death resulted in lost financial support in the amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1220\">*1220</page-number>$154,050. He concluded that the value of lost household services was $65,425.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">On January 10, 2000, the jury returned a special verdict finding both Amcord and CPC partially responsible for McKinney\u2019s injury. The jury awarded $135,700 as lost financial support and $54,300 as the value of lost home services. In addition, it found that Roland McKinney, a smoker, was 50 percent responsible for his own injuries and that Amcord and CPC were each 17.5 percent responsible. The jury found that Amcord, but not CPC, acted with malice or oppression. Following the court\u2019s determination of offsets, judgment was entered jointly and severally against both defendants in the amount of $77,190.06 as economic damages. Noneconomic damages were assessed against CPC in the amount of $481,250, and against Amcord in the same amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">The court filed an amended judgment on October 17, 2000, finding that McKinney\u2019s offer to compromise was valid and assessed costs and expert witness fees against appellants. The court also imposed prejudgment interest on the damages awards. Amcord and CPC appealed, and the two appeals were consolidated for purposes of briefing, oral argument and decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-7\">CPC raises three issues on appeal: (1) improper denial of its motion to suppress all evidence of the decedent\u2019s pension and Social Security income; (2) absence of supporting evidence for Dr. Ben-Zion\u2019s testimony as to the value of lost household services and improper reliance on a Cornell University study; and (3) erroneous imposition of prejudgment interest pursuant to Civil Code section 3291. Amcord also presents three issues: (1) failure to allow allocation of fault to tobacco companies; (2) error in granting enhanced costs and interest pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 998; and (3) abuse of discretion by admission of business records absent an adequate foundation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1006-8\">We discuss these issues in the order presented, and conclude that reversal is not required for any of the reasons argued by appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-9\">I. <em>The Collateral Source Rule Does Not Bar Evidence of a Plaintiffs Damages</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1006-10\">CPC filed a motion in limine seeking to preclude evidence of Sharon McKinney\u2019s claim of past and future loss of the decedent\u2019s union <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1221\">*1221</page-number>pension and Social Security benefits. CPC presented the following facts in its motion: Decedent retired in 1989 for reasons unrelated to asbestos exposure; he started receiving pension benefits and Social Security benefits at that time; he died on August 18, 1996; and, Sharon McKinney testified at her deposition that after the death, she received benefits from his Plasterer\u2019s Union pension and Social Security benefits calculated on the basis of her husband\u2019s income.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-4\">Appellants argued that McKinney\u2019s expert, Dr. Ben-Zion, testified at his deposition that Sharon McKinney was not receiving any less from the pension\u2019s survivor option than she would have received if decedent were alive.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Arguing that Sharon McKinney suffered no actual loss of income, CPC requested an order that she be precluded from introducing evidence regarding any financial loss based on the decedent\u2019s Social Security and pension payments. It appears in the record that Mrs. McKinney was receiving only minimal benefits in her own name prior to the death.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">When Dr. Ben-Zion testified at the trial, he stated that he computed \u201ctwo types of economic losses sustained by the plaintiff as a result of the death of her husband.\u201d He described lost financial support as \u201cthe amount of dollars by which the plaintiff is worse off as a result of premature death of her husband. How many more dollars would she have had available for herself had her husband not died prematurely and had he continued to receive the pension and the social security.\u201d CPC argues that Ben-Zion\u2019s description demonstrates how admission of the pension and Social Security evidence was misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">In opposition, McKinney argued that decedent originally elected reduced pension benefits in order to obtain survivor benefits for his spouse. Sharon McKinney only began collecting the pension\u2019s survivor benefits after her husband died. Decedent had elected to receive Social Security payments at age 62, at a reduced rate. Those benefits were available by virtue of his payments into the system for many decades. Sharon McKinney received minimal Social Security benefits in her own name prior to the death. Since her husband\u2019s death, McKinney has also received Social Security widow\u2019s benefits of 70 percent of her late husband\u2019s predeath benefits.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1007-7\">The trial court denied the motion, stating that Sharon McKinney had not received her husband\u2019s Social Security and pension benefits prior to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1222\">*1222</page-number>death and that the benefits decedent received were derived from his employment and were similar to the wage he would have contributed during his life had he been working instead of retired.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">CPC\u2019s claim is based on its argument that the widow\u2019s pension benefits and the Social Security survivor\u2019s insurance benefits were not \u201cpaid in connection with the injury or death at issue.\u201d It also argues that no benefit was lost because of the death since the widow afterwards received pension and Social Security payments. CPC claims that the collateral source rule only applies to pension benefits when they are paid to replace something that was lost because of the death. Contrary to appellants\u2019 claim, we find that Sharon McKinney\u2019s survivor benefits were paid as a direct result of the death. The loss sustained was the loss of Roland McKinney\u2019s contributions to the household from his income. The survivor benefits paid to Sharon McKinney were a replacement for the lost contributions from a source unrelated to appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">The collateral source rule operates to prevent a defendant from reducing a plaintiff\u2019s damages with evidence that the plaintiff received compensation from a source independent of the defendant. <em>(Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. v. Superior Court </em>(1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 174, 176 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 522].) Examples of collateral sources that may not be used to decrease a plaintiff\u2019s recovery include medical insurance, pension and disability benefits, and continued wages paid by an employer. <em>(Helfend v. Southern Cal. Rapid Transit Dist. </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 1, 13-14 [84 Cal.Rptr. 173, 465 P.2d 61, 77 A.L.R.3d 398].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">\u201cThe idea is that tortfeasors should not recover a windfall from the thrift and foresight of persons who have actually or constructively secured insurance, pension or disability benefits to provide for themselves and their families. A contrary rule, it is feared, would misallocate liability for tort-caused losses and discourage people from obtaining benefits from independent collateral sources. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Arambula v. Wells </em>(1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 1006, 1009 [85 Cal.Rptr.2d 584].)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1008-7\">To this end, our Supreme Court has stated that \u201cin a case in which a tort victim has received partial compensation from medical insurance coverage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1223\">*1223</page-number>entirely independent of the tortfeasor the trial court properly followed the collateral source rule and foreclosed defendant from mitigating damages by means of the collateral payments.\u201d <em>(Helfend v. Southern Cal. Rapid Transit Dist., supra, </em>2 Cal.3d 1, 13-14.) The compensation, to be subject to the rule, must be \u201cfrom a source wholly independent of the tortfeasor . . . .\u201d <em>(Hrnjak v. Graymar, Inc. </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 725, 729 [94 Cal.Rptr. 623, 484 P.2d 599, 47 A.L.R.3d 224]; <em>Helfend v. Southern Cal. Rapid Transit Dist., supra, </em>2 Cal.3d 1, 6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-4\">An independent collateral source is most often obtained as a result of plaintiff\u2019s actual or constructive payment and planning. <em>(Helfend </em>v. <em>Southern Cal. Rapid Transit Dist., supra, </em>2 Cal.3d 1, 10.) The purpose of the rule is not served by allowing the defendant to escape liability for a wrong merely because the decedent was wise enough to provide for his spouse after death. The ruling CPC seeks would, in effect, allow it to offset the pension and Social Security widow\u2019s benefits from the wrongful death damages, a result that violates the spirit and intent of the collateral source rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">There are exceptions to the rule of exclusion, for example, where the defendant is allowed to introduce otherwise inadmissible evidence of the lack of assets in a decedent\u2019s estate to impeach self-serving testimony by the children as to the loss of anticipated gifts of large amounts of cash. <em>(Stathos </em>v. <em>Lemich </em>(1963) 213 Cal.App.2d 52, 56-57 [28 Cal.Rptr. 462].) In that case, the court refused to allow the plaintiff to hide behind the rule of exclusion and use it as \u201can aggressive weapon\u201d to prevent the defendant from showing decedent\u2019s inability to make such gifts. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 57; see also <em>Hrnjak </em>v. <em>Graymar, Inc., supra, </em>4 Cal.3d 725 [evidence of insurance receipts admissible to show plaintiff is malingering]; <em>Lafayette v. County of Los Angeles </em>(1984) 162 Cal.App.3d 547 [208 Cal.Rptr. 668] [value of disability payments may be shown, after Evid. Code, \u00a7 352 analysis, on issue of plaintiff\u2019s motivation to seek work].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1224\">*1224</page-number>However, CPC is not trying to fit within an exception by producing impeaching evidence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> CPC seeks to apply the rule to affirmatively block the widow from producing evidence of her deceased husband\u2019s income. CPC argues that if the collateral source rule prevents it from obtaining an offset of damages in the amount of the pension, it should also apply to preclude the widow from referring to her husband\u2019s pension in her affirmative showing of lost financial contributions to the household. Although the argument has a superficial hint of fairness, we reject what is in essence an attempt to apply the collateral source rule in reverse, as it does not serve the purposes of the rule. CPC\u2019s attempted use of the collateral source rule as a weapon to diminish damages conflicts with the underlying, long-standing principle of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">CPC\u2019s complaint that McKinney did not actually suffer a loss because she received postdeath benefits from the same source as her husband\u2019s earnings makes no difference in the application of the collateral source rule. Barring consideration of payments from an outside source will always result in a reduction of the loss actually suffered by a plaintiff. As noted in <em>Hume v. Lacey </em>(1952) 112 Cal.App.2d 147 [245 P.2d 672], the fact that a plaintiff may in fact receive as much, or more than he or she received prior to the injury, does not impact the collateral source rule. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 151-152.) It is an integral part of the rule that a plaintiff will be compensated for his or her loss in some fashion from the outside source. The rule is no different because the compensation comes from a pension benefit rather than an insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">For example, the plaintiff in <em>Hume </em>received more because of his injury than he would have received if he had not been injured. This fact did not change the legal analysis and plaintiff\u2019s pension benefits were not allowed as an offset to reduce the damages for lost earning capacity. The court stated: \u201cIt may be observed that there is a valid reason for not giving the wrongdoer any benefit from pension rights, with which he had nothing to do. They were previously acquired by the injured party, were paid for by him in some manner, and the fact that he had other property in the nature of a pension right may logically be held immaterial.\u201d <em>(Hume v. Lacey, supra, </em>112 Cal.App.2d at p. 152.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">CPC cites two out-of-state cases to support its contention that because the decedent in this case was retired and receiving a pension at the time of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1225\">*1225</page-number>death, we should apply the collateral source rule to reduce his widow\u2019s damages. The cited cases do not reflect the law in this state. <em>St. Louis, I.M. &amp; S. Ry. Co. v. Maddry </em>(1893) 57 Ark. 306 [21 S.W. 472] <em>(Maddry) </em>actually upheld the trial court\u2019s suppression of evidence of the widow\u2019s eligibility for a pension as a result of her husband\u2019s death. CPC finds importance in a comment to the effect that if the pension \u201chad been granted and made payable to [decedent] for his life, and to his widow and children upon his death, it may be that the matter would not have been proper for consideration, as his death would have caused no deprivation in that respect. [Citation.] But such is not the law. Under the law the pension granted to him lapsed at his death, and did not pass by limitation to plaintiffs.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 473.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-4\">The dictum in <em>Maddry </em>does not help CPC. Even if that case correctly stated California law, CPC failed to produce any evidence that Roland McKinney\u2019s pension and Social Security rights did not terminate at death. There is no evidence in this case that Sharon McKinney received pension payments prior to her husband\u2019s death. The only indications are that she received survivor\u2019s benefits after his death. These are new benefits, issued for the first time in her name, as a direct result of the death. They are collateral sources that may not be used to diminish CPC\u2019s financial responsibility for the death of Roland McKinney.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">The other case cited by CPC, <em>McLemore </em>v. <em>Broussard </em>(Tex.App. 1983) 670 S.W.2d 301, was a mother\u2019s action for the wrongful death of her child in an automobile collision. Before the accident, the mother, a widow, was receiving monthly minor\u2019s and mother\u2019s Social Security payments as a consequence of her husband\u2019s death. Those payments were terminated when the child died. Citing the Texas statute, the court stated that the mother could only obtain damages for \u201cactual damages on account of the injuries causing the death.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 303.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Without discussion, the court held that because \u201cfringe benefits\u201d were not admissible to diminish the survivor\u2019s damages, the loss of the minor\u2019s and mother\u2019s Social Security benefits should be excluded from the calculation of damages. We are not convinced by the <em>McLemore </em>court\u2019s short discussion of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">A Wisconsin court found <em>McLemore </em>to be poorly reasoned, and an improper reverse application of the collateral source rule. <em>(Estate of Holt v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. </em>(1989) 151 Wis.2d 455 [444 N.W.2d 453, 455].) The <em>Holt </em>court stated: \u201cIf we were to apply the collateral source rule inversely, we would allow [defendant] to escape liability for a wrong for which it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1226\">*1226</page-number>responsible and we would thereby defeat the purpose of the rule.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 455.) We agree with the <em>Holt </em>court\u2019s comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">The nature of the sources of income at issue in this case supports the conclusion that they were properly considered as damages for the wrongful death of Roland McKinney. The Social Security benefits paid to Roland McKinney during his life were based on his earnings and paid to decedent. He apparently applied a portion of those benefits to support his household. The only evidence available in the record on appeal indicates that Sharon McKinney did not directly receive her husband\u2019s Social Security payments while he was alive. As a result of his death, she became entitled to Social Security death benefits in her own name, based on her husband\u2019s earnings. The Social Security Administration itself refers to such benefits as \u201csurvivors insurance.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (Social Security Survivors Benefits, Publication No. 05-10084, part 1, reprinted at &lt;http://www.ssa.gov/pubs/10084.html&gt; [as of Mar. 18, 2002].) Social Security publications instruct survivors like Sharon McKinney to apply promptly for widow\u2019s benefits, which indicates that the benefits paid to the deceased spouse do not automatically continue in an unchanged form. <em>(Id., </em>part 2, reprinted at &lt;http://www.ssa.gov/pubs/ 10084.html&gt; [as of Mar. 18, 2002].) This benefit did not exist before decedent\u2019s death, but is a new benefit flowing to Sharon McKinney as a direct result of the death. It is a classic collateral source, and CPC has produced no reason to ignore the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">The issue regarding the pension is not quite as clear, but CPC did not place any evidence in the record to indicate that the union pension was a joint payment to Sharon McKinney and her husband that merely continued unchanged after his death. Since CPC was the proponent of the motion, if this were a joint continuing payment, it was CPC\u2019s burden to produce supporting evidence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> McKinney\u2019s offer of proof was that, like many pensions, the plasterers union pension offered reduced lifetime benefits in exchange for death benefits to a surviving spouse. (See, e.g., <em>In re Marriage of Lowell </em>(1991) 171 Ariz. 462 [831 P.2d 838, 839] [husband\u2019s federal civil service pension provided survivor option funded by reduction in current pension payments]; <em>Plaster and Plaster </em>(1982) 55 Or.App. 700 [639 P.2d 1287, 1289] [husband\u2019s telephone company pension plan offered survivor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1227\">*1227</page-number>benefit in exchange for reduced lifetime benefits]; <em>In re Marriage of Lionberger </em>(1979) 97 Cal.App.3d 56, 67 [158 Cal.Rptr. 535] [operating engineers pension plan provided for survivor benefit in exchange for reduced lifetime income].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-4\">This feature of a pension, which is, in essence, a constructive payment for the survivor benefit, makes it look much like an insurance policy. In <em>McQuillan </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Co. </em>(1974) 40 Cal.App.3d 802 [115 Cal.Rptr. 418], this court noted that a Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System pension benefit is \u201c \u2018a derivative right, an element of the deceased\u2019s compensation earned by the employee by his performance of his duties. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 807-808.) The contributions to the pension plan resulted in a collateral source benefit wholly independent from the tortfeasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">We decline to adopt CPC\u2019s proposed application of the collateral source rule to allow a defendant to decrease an injured plaintiff\u2019s recovery. The benefits paid to Roland McKinney were in the nature of a salary replacement that ended with his death and were properly considered in the calculation of lost support. The subsequent widow\u2019s benefits paid to Sharon McKinney were from sources independent of CPC, due entirely to Roland McKinney\u2019s planning and constructive payment. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellants\u2019 request to preclude the evidence of Roland McKinney\u2019s predeath income.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">II. <em>Substantial Evidence Supported Testimony as to Lost Household Services</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1013-7\">CPC brought an unsuccessful motion in the trial court seeking to exclude Dr. Ben-Zion\u2019s testimony regarding loss of household services. On appeal, CPC argues that there was no evidence to support Dr. Ben-Zion\u2019s testimony concerning loss of household services. CPC also challenges the use of a Cornell University study because it did not break down the value of each household service and used only an aggregate estimate for the value of such services. We have reviewed the record on appeal and find substantial evidence was produced regarding the household services performed by the deceased. There was no error in allowing use of the Cornell study.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-8\">Kevin McKinney testified that after his father\u2019s death, he became responsible for lawn mowing, weeding, gardening, changing light bulbs, fixing leaky faucets and doing whatever maintenance was required around the house. Without Kevin\u2019s help, his mother would have to pay someone to do those tasks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1228\">*1228</page-number>Sharon McKinney testified that her husband maintained the family\u2019s recreational vehicle. He did all the shopping for clothes. When asked about the household services Roland McKinney provided in general, Mrs; McKinney testified: \u201cThere wasn\u2019t anything he couldn\u2019t do. Outside he built the patio cover, he poured the cement, inside he redecorated for me, he redid the kitchen and the bathroom, putting new fixtures in, he did the plumbing, he was very\u2014a very handy man.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">Appellants argue that because the services previously performed by decedent were not proven to be services that Mrs. McKinney would need and pay for after her husband\u2019s death, they do not come within the category of economic damages, but are akin to noneconomic damages such as loss of companionship and rendering help out of love for a spouse. But the record on appeal shows that decedent performed household services that had a particular economic value. Decedent performed services that saved the expense of hiring someone else. The jury was correctly instructed under BAJI No. 14.50 (1995 rev.) (8th ed. 1994) that it could consider \u201cthe costs of obtaining substitute domestic services\u201d as economic damages. The jury then decided from the evidence whether such typical quantifiable services were needed in the future. (See Cal. Tort Damages (Cont.Ed.Bar 1988) \u00a7\u00a7 3.23-3.24, pp. 103-104; <em>id. </em>(2001 supp.) \u00a7 3.23, pp. 39-40.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">The family\u2019s testimony provided sufficient support for a determination that the decedent performed substantial household services. It provided a sufficient factual foundation for Dr. Ben-Zion\u2019s testimony regarding the ascertainable value of particular household services that are distinguishable from generalized noneconomic damages from the loss of a dutiful, loving and helpful spouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">During his testimony, Dr. Ben-Zion relied in part on the Cornell University study of the value of household services. CPC contends that unless the surviving spouse actually pays money to replace the lost services, the resulting loss represents only the noneconomic damages of lost companionship and comfort. Building on this point, CPC relies on <em>Loth v. Truck-A-Way Corp. </em>(1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 757 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 571] to argue that it was improper to use the Cornell study to measure damages for loss of household services.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-7\">The <em>Loth </em>case concerned expert testimony that purported to compute the element of pain and suffering by use of a mathematical formula. <em>{Loth v. Truck-A-Way Corp., supra, </em>60 Cal.App.4th at <em>p. </em>767.) The court rejected the arbitrary formula used by the expert to value plaintiff\u2019s loss of enjoyment of life as a result of a vehicle accident. The formula relied on studies of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1229\">*1229</page-number>amount society is willing to pay for seat belts and other protective devices, the premium pay for hazardous jobs and a cost/benefit analysis of federally mandated safety projects, adjusted for life expectancy, and set a dollar figure on various percentages of lost enjoyment of life. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 762.) The court rejected the formula as having nothing to do with plaintiffs injuries. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 768.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-4\">In this case, Dr. Ben-Zion described the Cornell University study as one that analyzed what people did around the home such as home repair and maintenance, automobile maintenance, yard work, cooking, cleaning, shopping and general home maintenance. In his analysis, Dr. Ben-Zion assumed that decedent was an average provider based on the study criteria.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> He explained that the fact finder decides if the particular individual did more or less than average and whether he had more than average skills in determining the value of services. He explained that using the average individual to calculate the value of a retired man\u2019s home services resulted in a figure of $6,500 a year, which he characterized as low. Applying the Cornell study average, as adjusted for life expectancy and other factors, Dr. Ben-Zion computed a total of $20,975 in lost household services caused by the death of Roland McKinney.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">Unlike <em>Loth v. Truck-A-Way Corp., supra, </em>60 Cal.App.4th 757, the criteria used in the Cornell study had a direct bearing on the value of household services that are lost when the retired male head of the household dies. Using the study, Dr. Ben-Zion presented an estimated value of an average provider\u2019s services in the. home. This estimate, coupled with the evidence of Roland McKinney\u2019s actual work around the house, was properly presented for the jury\u2019s consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">III. <em>Prejudgment Interest Under Civil Code Section 3291 Was Appropriate</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-7\">Over appellants\u2019 objection, the trial court granted McKinney\u2019s request for prejudgment interest based on Civil Code section 3291. On appeal, CPC again raises its contention that Civil Code section 3291 applies only to personal injury actions, and not to wrongful death cases.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We determine that this wrongful death action is one for personal injury, and that interest was properly assessed on the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1230\">*1230</page-number>Civil Code section 3291 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1016-4\">\u201cIn any action brought to recover damages for personal injury sustained by any person resulting from or occasioned by the tort of any other person, corporation, association, or partnership, whether by negligence or by willful intent of the other person, corporation, association, or partnership, and whether the injury was fatal or otherwise, it is lawful for the plaintiff in the complaint to claim interest on the damages alleged as provided in this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1016-5\">\u201cIf the plaintiff makes an offer pursuant to Section 998 of the Code of Civil Procedure which the defendant does not accept prior to trial or within 30 days, whichever occurs first, and the plaintiff obtains a more favorable judgment, the judgment shall bear interest at the legal rate of 10 percent per annum calculated from the date of the plaintiff\u2019s first offer pursuant to Section 998 of the Code of Civil Procedure which is exceeded by the judgment, and interest shall accrue until the satisfaction of judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1016-6\">CPC argues that if the Legislature intended to include wrongful death cases within the definition of \u201cpersonal injury\u201d it would have specifically so stated. It points to several other statutes that use the terminology \u201cpersonal injury or wrongful death\u201d as support for its claim that to be included, wrongful death must be expressly stated. We acknowledge the possibility that CPC has uncovered a statutory design that arguably supports its theory, but we reject the theory in light <em>of </em>the apparent intent of the statute and the nature of the damages recoverable in a wrongful death action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-7\">\u201cFor more than a century it has been settled that one purpose of . . . prejudgment interest in general, is to provide just compensation to the injured party for loss of use of the award during the prejudgment period\u2014in other words, to make the plaintiff whole as of the date of the injury. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Lakin </em>v. <em>Watkins Associated Industries </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 644, 663 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 109, 863 P.2d 179] <em>(Lakin).) </em>Another purpose of Civil Code section 3291 is to \u201cprovide a statutory incentive to settle personal injury litigation where plaintiff has been physically as well as economically impaired, and thus it has been considered inapplicable to contractual disputes, business-tort losses and arbitration proceedings.\u201d <em>(Gourley v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 121, 126, 130 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 666, 822 P.2d 374] [finding that damages in action for breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing relate primarily to loss caused by interference with a property right, so not subject to prejudgment interest].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-8\">Passage of the bill that became Civil Code section 3291 was heralded as a \u201cvictory for trial lawyers\u201d in that it was expected to reduce court congestion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1231\">*1231</page-number>by providing a powerful incentive for settlement of tort cases. (Pollard, <em>Prejudgment-Interest Bill a Victory for Trial Lawyers </em>(June 1982) 2 Cal. Law. No. 6, p. 27.) \u201cThe Legislature intended different treatment of personal injury actions because of the manifest greater prejudice of delay in recovering personal injury damages as compared to contractual or business-tort losses given the probability personal injury plaintiffs are likely to be physically as well as monetarily impaired.\u201d <em>(.Morin v. ABA Recovery Service, Inc. </em>(1987) 195 Cal.App.3d 200, 206, fn. 1 [240 Cal.Rptr. 509].)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1017-4\">The background of the statute indicates a concern with differentiating broadly between property damage and personal injury. The most useful approach, therefore, when deciding if Civil Code section 3291 applies to a specific case, is not to rely on the formal label placed on the complaint, such as negligence, defamation or wrongful death. The appropriate query is whether the damages may be characterized as compensation for a personal injury. <em>(Lakin, supra, 6 </em>Cal.4th at p. 661.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">For example, <em>Lakin </em>concerned a claim of emotional distress related to defendant\u2019s unwarranted denial of the fact of an automobile accident involving defendant\u2019s employee and plaintiff. The court compared that claim to the emotional distress claim in <em>Gourley </em>v. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., supra, </em>53 Cal.3d 121, 126-127, which was based on an insurer\u2019s bad faith failure to provide insurance benefits. The court determined that, unlike the situation in <em>Gourley, </em>the plaintiff\u2019s claims in <em>Lakin </em>were not based on an invasion of a property interest, but \u201cwere at the heart of her case.\u201d <em>(Lakin, supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at pp. 656-657.) The emotional distress in <em>Lakin </em>emanated from the accident itself and the defendants\u2019 actions in giving a false name and denying that the accident occurred. The court stated that the fact that the events caused some property damage did not change the nature of the damages as being caused by a personal injury. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 657.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">\u201c \u2018 \u201cAn injury is personal when it impairs the well-being or the mental or physical health of the victim.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Bihun </em>v. <em>AT&amp;T Information Systems, Inc., supra, </em>13 Cal.App.4th 976, 1005 [finding workplace sexual harassment is a personal injury].) We believe the answer is clear that the damages awarded to a spouse and children as a result of the wrongful death of a husband and father are personal injury damages. (See, e.g., <em>Weaver v. Bahumes </em>(N.D.Cal. 1955) 127 F.Supp. 85, 87 [phrase \u201cinjury to the person\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1232\">*1232</page-number>used in statute of limitations refers an action for consequential damages by a husband on account of death of wife]; and <em>Yates </em>v. <em>Pollock </em>(1987) 194 Cal.App.3d 195, 199 [239 Cal.Rptr. 383] [wrongful death claims included in statute referring only to actions for \u201cinjury\u201d rather than \u201cinjury or wrongful death\u201d].) The trial court did not err in applying Civil Code section 3291 to damages suffered because of a wrongful death.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We turn now to the issues raised by Amcord.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">IV. <em>Trial Court Correctly Refused to Allocate Liability to Tobacco </em>Companies<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">The trial court instructed the jury not to apportion any fault to tobacco companies because those entities were statutorily immune to liability at the time of Roland McKinney\u2019s diagnosis and death. Appellants argue that the Legislature removed the statutory immunity when it amended Civil Code section 1714.45, effective January 1, 1998. Relying on language in the amended statute stating that the new law applies to \u201cclaims that were or are brought . . . ,\u201d appellants argue that because the tobacco immunity was repealed while this action was pending, the jury should have been instructed to allocate a portion of fault to tobacco companies.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1019-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1233\">*1233</page-number>Appellants urge this court to apply the amended statute to a case in which no claim was brought against a tobacco company, either before or after the amendment became effective. The Supreme Court is considering several cases involving the applicability of the amendment to Civil Code section 1714.45 to cases arising before its enactment.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The statute has presented interpretive problems since its original enactment in 1987. It has been described as \u201cpoorly drafted\u201d and internally inconsistent and the product of a hasty compromise between competing interests known as the \u201c \u2018napkin deal.\u2019 \u201d <em>(American Tobacco Co. v. Superior Court </em>(1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 480, 485, 487-488 [255 Cal.Rptr. 280]; see Assem. Com. on Judiciary, Rep. on Sen. Bill No. 67 (1997-1998 Reg. Sess.) as amended Apr. 16, 1997, p. 1; Moy, <em>Tobacco Companies, Immune No More\u2014California\u2019s Removal of the Legal Barriers Preventing Plaintiffs from Recovering for Tobacco-Related Illness </em>(1998) 29 McGeorge L.Rev. 761, 770.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-4\">Parts of the original statute remain after the amendment, perpetuating the inaccuracy and inconsistency in the legislative language. Despite a comment in a senate committee analysis that concern had been expressed that the amendment would have only prospective application without specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1234\">*1234</page-number>language specifying retroactive application, no specific language was added.(Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 67 (1997-1998 Reg. Sess.) as amended Feb. 14, 1997, for hearing date of Apr. 8, 1997, p. 3.) Instead, the Legislature added subdivision (f), which contains the language regarding claims that \u201cwere or are brought.\u201d The difficulty in interpreting the language of this statute brings to mind former Justice Newsom\u2019s comment that the legislation \u201cillustrates poignantly the maxim so useful in statutory construction\u2014that if the Legislature had known what it meant, it would have said so.\u201d <em>(Bunion v. Arizona Pacific Tanklines </em>(1983) 141 Cal.App.3d 210, 223 [190 Cal.Rptr. 295] (conc. opn. of Newsom, J.).) While we do not necessarily presume legislative uncertainty as to intent, the expression of that intent could have been stated in a more affirmative manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">However, we need not directly address the issue of whether the statute applies retroactively to causes that arose prior to enactment of the amendment, for there is no hint in the legislative verbiage that the amendment was intended to revive an already barred claim for purposes of applying Proposition 51 to allocate noneconomic damages to a statutorily immune nonparty to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">In this case, the claim accrued when Roland McKinney was diagnosed with cancer, two days before he died in 1996.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>(Buttram v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 520, 540 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 438, 941 P.2d 71] [cause of action for latent progressive disease accrues when diagnosed or when plaintiff otherwise discovers disease].) No claim was ever filed against a tobacco company in this case. The reason for that circumstance is probably that the statute of limitations on the wrongful death claim expired in August of 1997, before the amendment to Civil Code section 1714.45 took effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-6\">We need look no farther than <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp. </em>(2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 42 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 531] for the proper result in this case. In <em>Barker, </em>the plaintiff brought a wrongful death action against a tobacco company, based on his father\u2019s death in 1962 from a tobacco-related illness. The <em>Barker </em>court held that the Legislature intended only to eliminate the tobacco immunity. Nothing in the legislative history or in the language of the amendments indicates an intent to revive claims that are time-barred. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 49.) Because the claim in this case was barred before the tobacco immunity was repealed, it would be unfair and contrary to the legislative intendment to allocate fault to an absent defendant that was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1235\">*1235</page-number>statutorily immune during the time the plaintiff could have filed an action against that defendant.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1021-4\">Appellants contend that the statute of limitations need not be implicated in this case. Appellants argue that the Legislature passed the bill amending Civil Code section 1714.45 prior to August of 1997, so McKinney could have amended the complaint before the statute of limitations expired on August 17, 1997, and delayed service on the tobacco defendants until the amendment to section 1714.45 took effect on January 1, 1998.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We are aware of no authority requiring such prescience on the part of plaintiffs. During the entire time that the limitations period was running on the wrongful death claim, tobacco companies were completely immune from liability. Whether or not the scenario proposed by appellants would have overcome that immunity for purposes of allocating fault to an absent defendant is not an issue that is raised by the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">We also reject the argument that the opinion in <em>DaFonte v. Up-Right, Inc. </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 593 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 238, 828 P.2d 140] supports the notion that a share of noneconomic damages may be assessed against tobacco companies, despite expiration of the statute of limitations on a particular claim. The Supreme Court itself has explained that unlike the employer in <em>DaFonte, </em>tobacco suppliers that are protected by the Civil Code section 1714.45 immunity breach no duty and commit no tort for which liability may rightfully be apportioned. <em>(Richards v. Owens-Illinois, Inc. </em>(1997) 14 Cal.4th 985, 989, 998-1001 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 103, 928 P.2d 1181].)<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The trial court did not err in refusing to allocate a percentage of noneconomic damages to nonparty tobacco companies where the claim was barred by the statute of limitations prior to the effective date of the amendments to section 1714.45.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-6\">V., VI.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1022-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1236\">*1236</page-number>Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">Stein, J., and Swager, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">The petition of appellant Amcord, Inc., for review by the Supreme Court was denied June 12, 2002.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1005-11\">The amounts listed in the offer for Amcord were $19,999.50 for each category of loss of consortium and the estate of Roland McKinney.

This subdivision does not constitute a change in, but is declaratory of, existing law relating to tobacco products.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1S\">\u201c(f) It is the intention of the Legislature in enacting the amendments to subdivisions (a) and (b) of this section adopted at the 1997-98 Regular Session to declare that there exists no statutory bar to tobacco-related personal injury, wrongful death, or other tort claims against tobacco manufacturers and their successors in interest by California smokers or others who have suffered or incurred injuries, damages, or costs arising from the promotion, marketing, sale, or consumption of tobacco products. It is also the intention of the Legislature to clarify that those claims that were or are brought shall be determined on their merits, without the imposition of any claim of statutory bar or categorical defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AT-a\">\u201c(g) This section shall not be construed to grant immunity to a tobacco industry research organization.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1019-9\">This issue is currently pending before the Supreme Court in <em>Henley </em>v. <em>Philip Morris, Inc. </em>(2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 824 [113 Cal.Rptr.2d 494], review granted January 29, 2002, S102941; <em>Naegele v.
