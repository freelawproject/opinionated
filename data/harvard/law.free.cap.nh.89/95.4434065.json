But a use \u201crequired by reasonable necessity\u201d may sometimes be inferred from the terms of the bailment although not specifically included therein. <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>64 N. H. 98, 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">The trial court in the present case has found that the bailor permitted the bailee the reasonable use of the car for the bailee\u2019s needs, that the bailee had an urgent need for the car on the night of the accident, and that the use made of it was reasonable; that such use was within the permissive scope contemplated by the bailor and the bailee, and did not constitute a conversion. These findings are fully warranted by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-11\">The bailee testified in part as follows: \u201cQ. About a year before the accident happened did you have some understanding with Mrs. Chandler about this automobile? A. I was to drive for her. .. Q. And . .. why did Mrs. Chandler have you drive for her at that time? A. Because she was unable to drive herself .... She just couldn\u2019t learn to drive. ... Q. When you went up there to Hampton what was done about the car, between you and Mrs. Chandler? A. I drove the car back and forth to the Tavern just as though it was my own ... Q. And what understanding did you have with her about the use that you were to make of the car? A. I was to use the car as though it was my own. ... Q. And you say that you used the car <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>as you would your own? A. Yes. Q. She understood that? . . . A. There was nothing said that I could do or could not do. . . . <em>Court: </em>Did she ever object to your using the car? <em>Witness: </em>No. I drove just as though it was my car, using discretion of course because it was her car... . Whenever she wanted to go some place I was to take her and then when I went to work at Lamie\u2019s Tavern she gave me permission to drive the car back and forth to work. If I stayed down there I hired a garage to put it in and when I was at home I left it in my own garage. ... Q. If you wanted it for your own needs and reasonable, why you understood you could. A. Yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">On the facts found, the court correctly ruled that the coverage of the policy extended to the bailee\u2019s agent, through whom at the time of the accident the bailee was making a reasonable use of the car for her urgent needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">The plaintiffs made numerous requests for findings of fact and rulings of law, and excepted to the court\u2019s refusal to grant these requests in so far as \u201cnot covered in form or substance by the decree as rendered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">The request for a ruling that the defendant assumed the burden of proof on the issue of coverage <em>(Travelers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Greenough, </em>88 N. H. 391) was obviously granted, since at the conclusion of the evidence introduced at the original hearing the Presiding Justice stated that the evidence failed to \u201cthrow any substantial light\u201d on the issue and permitted the case to be reopened at a later date for the introduction of further testimony. His findings after a consideration of this additional testimony were definite, affirmative assertions, determined unquestionably by a balance of the probabilities. The court had discretionary power to reopen the case and receive the added proof. <em>Dunlap </em>v. <em>Dunlap, </em>84 N. H. 352, 353; <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Boscawen Mills, </em>71 N. H. 288, 290, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel in their brief state that certain requests relating to inferences to be drawn from the evidence are \u201citerations of the objection\u201d voiced at the trial. The objection referred to was as follows: \u201cWe ask that the testimony that she [Miss Harriman] could use the car as if it were her own be stricken from the record.\u201d Even though Mrs. Chandler had not granted that privilege in express terms, evidence that Miss Harriman used the car as her own without objection on Mrs. Chandler\u2019s part was clearly admissible. And this evidence together with the other facts and circumstances surrounding the bailment justified the inferences of fact which the trial court has drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>Request No. 13 was as follows: \u201cIn considering the evidence of Mrs. Fleming [Miss Harriman] as to her understanding of the use of the car, the meaning of her words that she could use it as if it were her own, must be read as she described her use of such words on cross-examination that is, that she meant only operation of the car between Haverhill and Hampton and return.\u201d The court was entitled to consider Miss Harriman\u2019s testimony as a whole. The fact that her express permission to use the car may have been limited to traveling between Hampton and Haverhill did not as a matter of law preclude a finding, on all the evidence, that she had implied permission to make a reasonably necessary use of it outside the limits of those places. <em>Sauriolle </em>v. <em>O\u2019Gorman, </em>86 N. H. 39, 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The mere fact that no one except Miss Harriman had ever driven the car before did not mean, in the light of all the evidence, that Mrs. Chandler had no reason to anticipate such a contingency. Hence the court correctly denied the fourteenth request, \u201cThere is no evidence that the assured\u2019s car was ever used or allowed to be used by anyone but Mrs. Fleming [Miss Harriman] prior to the accident, and therefore there is no evidence that the assured had any reason to anticipate that Mrs. Fleming would let a third person use the car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">In view of the evidence as to Miss Harriman\u2019s use of the car as though it were her own, the court did not err in refusing to find that \u201cThe understanding between Mrs. Fleming [Miss Harriman] and the assured was that the former was to use the car personally.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">According to the plaintiffs\u2019 brief, the sixteenth and seventeenth requests were predicated upon \u201cthe theory that express consent was a prerequisite to the liability of the insurer.\u201d This theory is untenable. \u201cSome \u2018omnibus\u2019 clauses use the words \u2018express or implied consent\u2019, thereby precluding any question as to whether or not the consent contemplated by the clause may be implied as well as express. In other such clauses, the words \u2018permission\u2019, \u2018permission and consent\u2019, \u2018knowledge and consent\u2019, etc., if and when they are used, appear without definition; in that event, the word or words involved are construed to include implied permission, etc.\u201d Annotation, 72 A. L. R. 1375, 1398.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">The substance of various other requests has already been considered, since each of these requests is virtually a motion for judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">The remaining requests have reference to the testimony of Wallace I. Randall as to Mrs. Chandler\u2019s statements and conduct after the accident occurred. Concerning this testimony the plaintiff requested the court to rule that \u201cThe evidence of Randall as to the alleged con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>versation with Mrs. Chandler is admissible only to impeach the credibility of Mrs. Chandler, and is not admissible either as an admission on the part of Mrs. Chandler or as evidence of the circumstances of, or surrounding the bailment.\u201d Mrs. Chandler is not properly a party to these proceedings nor is she, as bailor of the car, under any liability to the defendants. The request should have been granted: <em>Morin </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>85 N. H. 471.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Although Randall testified at the first hearing, when the court stated that the evidence then introduced failed to throw any substantial light on the issue, the testimony was nevertheless received as having \u201csome bearing in relationship.\u201d Furthermore, at the conclusion of the second hearing, the Presiding Justice remarked: \u201cThe evidence is closed and consists of what transpired at the original hearing and today.\u201d Under these circumstances the general rule \u201cthat the admission of incompetent evidence upon a material issue in a trial before any judicial tribunal vitiates the result\u201d must be applied. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Lucy, </em>83 N. H. 160, 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">\n<em>New trial.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b128-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
