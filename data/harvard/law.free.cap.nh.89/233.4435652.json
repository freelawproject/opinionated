The evidence that Bragg stopped the truck as Sanborn approached and that Sanborn attempted to pass, whereupon Bragg started again and skidded into the plaintiff\u2019s car, together with evidence that Bragg had skidded at the same place earlier the same day and knew the condition and tendency of the roadway, would have justified a finding of Bragg\u2019s negligence. The defendant\u2019s position that Bragg had no authority to bind the defendant by his testimony upon the issue of his agency is not tenable. <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Bank, </em>86 N.
