It is evident that without the safeguard of local inspection in all cases, a requirement of it only for cases of local disposal of the product would create difficulties of enforcement in local cases. The inquiry into the destination of the product of a given instance of slaughtering might often prove uncertain and futile in outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>The right to establish incidental regulation in aid of an admittedly proper subject of the police power is well settled. If the regulation may be found to be of reasonable service towards accomplishing the object sought to be attained, it is valid, and covers all cases where its application may thus be of service. <em>State </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>64 N.
