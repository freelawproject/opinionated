Markarian <em>v. </em>Michael Bartis <em>&amp; a.</em></parties>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b399-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number><em>Wason, Guertin &amp; Leahy {Mr. Guertin </em>orally), for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b399-10\"><em>Robert J.

It must therefore be presumed that the findings were \u201cbased upon an adequate amount of competent evidence.\u201d <em>Durand </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>86 N. H. 575, 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">The findings are consistent. The only reasonable interpretation to be given the referee\u2019s explanation of the verdict is that, although the details of computation indicated in the original report may be subject to some criticism, yet the real basis of the decision.is the value of the plaintiff\u2019s services to the defendants. Contracts for .attorneys\u2019 services stand on the same ground and are governed by the same rules as other similar contracts- for services. <em>Dodge </em>v. <em>Janvrin, </em>59 N. H. 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">: . The document dated December 2, 1932, is not a contract in any sense of the term. It comprises the simple recital that the plaintiff has received $250 for \u201cprofessional services in settlement of\u201d certain Cases. It is a receipt, and \u201c. . . no principle, perhaps, is better settled than that receipts may be explained by parol, and their true meaning and purpose shown.\u201d <em>Furbush </em>v. <em>Goodwin, 25 N. </em>H. 425, 444, 445. For cases to the same effect, see Hening\u2019s Digest, <em>p. </em>662.</p>\n<p id=\"AzM\">,: There is an express finding to the effect that the plaintiff, when he advised the bringing of the suit for contribution, acted honestly and on reasonable grounds. The referee correctly ruled that the plaintiff, having been discharged before the termination of the suit, was entitled to the value of his services even though he had agreed to accept a percentage of the amount recovered in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">In <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Gilman, </em>58 N. H. 417, the common law against maintenance and champerty is declared to be in force in this State, and in <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Legro, </em>62 N. H. 350, it is held that an attorney\u2019s contract to prosecute an action \u201con shares\u201d is \u201ccontrary to public justice and professional duty,\u201d that it tends \u201cto extortion and fraud,\u201d and is \u201cchampertous and void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">The earlier case of <em>Christie </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>44 N. H. 298, holds, however, that an attorney may render services and advance money in carrying on a lawsuit for a person without property, upon an agreement that he'Bhall first be paid from the funds recovered, and that .this arrangement is neither maintenance nor champerty..</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">Maintenance has been defined as \u201ca malicious or officious inter-meddling with a suit\u201d that does not belong to one, \u201cby maintaining or assisting either party with money, or otherwise, to prosecute .or defend it.\u201d <em>Christie </em>v. <em>Sawyer, supra, </em>303.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>\u25a0In maintenance \u201cno personal profit is expected or stipulated,\u201d but in champerty \u201cthere is a bargain with the plaintiff or defendant by which the champertor is to carry on the suit at his own expense and is to derive some profit out of the thing sued for if he prevails.\u201d <em>Sampliner </em>v. <em>Company, </em>255 Fed. 242, 247. A mainiainer.has been characterized as \u201cone who stirs up vexatious suits to which he is not a party,\u201d and a champertor as \u201cone who does so for pecuniary gain.\u201d Radin, \u201cMaintenance by Champerty,\u201d 24 Cal. Law Rev. 48, 66, 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">\u201cThe English doctrine of maintenance arose from causes peculiar, to the state of the society, in which it was established. The great reason for the suppression of champerty and maintenance, was an apprehension, that justice itself, was endangered by these practices .... The power of great men, to whom rights of action were transferred, in order to obtain support and favor in suits brought to assert those rights; the confederacies which were thus formed; and the oppression which followed from the influence of great men, in such cases, are themes of complaint, in the early books of the English law.\u201d <em>Thallhimer </em>v. <em>Brinckerhoff, </em>3 Cow. 623, 644.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Much of that law \u201cisjof merely curious interest today.\u201d <em>Cardozo, </em>C. J., <em>In the Matter of Gilman, </em>251 N. Y. 265, 270. Its \u201cpsychological background\u201d is the assumption of medieval society that \u201clitigation is at best a necessary evil, and litigiousness a vice.\u201d 24 Cal. Law Rev. 48, 68. There is scant reason for the retention of the doctrine in anything like its original severity in modern times.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">\u201cThe statutes for the limitation of actions, the statute of frauds, the extension of the aetion for malicious prosecutions, and the costs given against unsuccessful parties, have all taken place since the Taw of maintenance was established; and all these alterations have contributed to prevent or punish groundless and vexatious litigation.\u201d <em>Thallhimer </em>v. <em>Brinckerhoff, supra, </em>645.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">In the case of <em>Christie </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>44 N. H. 298, 303, the court, though \u201cnot prepared, to say that the law, relative to maintenance and champerty is not part of- our law,\u201d nevertheless suggests that the law may \u201cbe administered in a very different spirit here at this day\u201d from the spirit in which it was administered \u201cin a different state of society.\u201d As early as 1828 some relaxation of the early English rule was <em>countenanced! In Shapley </em>v. <em>Bellows, </em>4 N. H. 347, 355, decided in that year, it is said that there is a general understanding between attorneys and their clients \u201cthat the former shall retain their fees and disbursements out of the sum that may be recovered of the opposite party,\u201d that it is not uncommon for attorneys to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>\u201ccommence actions for poor people and make advances of money-necessary to the prosecution of the suit upon the credit of the cause,\u201d and that thus \u201ca person in indigent circumstances is enabled to obtain justice in cases where, without such aid, he would be unable to enforce a just claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">It is held in <em>Jordan </em>v. <em>Gillen, </em>44 N. H. 424, that the assignment to an attorney of a claim for unliquidated damages, founded on a tort, the assignment being fairly executed between attorney and client in consideration of a precedent debt, is neither champertous nor against public policy. Reference is there made to the following statement of Lord <em>Abinger </em>in <em>Findon </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>11 M. &amp; W. 675, 681: \u201cThe law of maintenance, as I understand it upon the modern constructions, is confined to cases where a man improperly, and for the purpose of stirring up litigation and strife, encourages others either to bring actions, or to make defences which they have no right to make.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">In 1903 the House of Representatives was advised that the Governor and Council, by virtue of certain legislative enactments, had authority in 1897 to enter into a contract with an attorney for the collection of a claim in the State\u2019s favor, whereby the attorney was to \u201creceive for his legal services in and about said matter a sum equal to fifteen per cent of the entire sum collected, payable only out of any sums that may be collected hereunder, and without any liability on the part of the state for expenses in connection therewith.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>72 N. H. 601. In 1911 the claim of an attorney for a contingent interest in a recovery under the workmen\u2019s compensation act, if approved by the Superior Court, was made an enforceable lien on such recovery. P. L., c. 178, <em>s. </em>37.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Thus, today, in this State, the mere fact that an attorney\u2019s fees are to be contingent upon his success and are to constitute a sharer of the proceeds recovered can scarcely be said to offend the public conscience. It is of course true that a particular contract for such fees may be oppressive and unconscionable or subversive of public morals. When such an agreement is attacked, it is the duty of the court to declare it invalid. <em>Edgerly </em>v. <em>Hale, </em>71 N. H. 138. If all agreements for contingent fees were of this nature, an arbitrary rule would be imperative.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">\u201cBut this is not so at all. There is no necessary and inevitable connection between improper litigation, hard-bargains . and solicitation on the one hand and the acquisition by a third party of an interest in a litigated case, on the other. Surely it would be more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>rational and sensible to say that champerty is an evil when, and only when, it leads to these evils. When it does not, it is not merely unobjectionable, but may actually serve a good purpose, as so many courts have expressly and quite justifiably found.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">\u201cIt is quite true that it readily lends itself to the accomplishment of the wrongful purposes just specified. But the real source of such purposes goes much deeper in social life than the mere existence of an instrumentality. Fraud and overreaching have never been abolished by outlawing the particular form they have assumed at any given time. If champertous contracts can serve any good purpose\u2014and they apparently can\u2014it is not foresight, but the infantile psychosis of \u2018all-or-nothing\u2019 which demands that we discard them altogether.\u201d 24 Cal. Law Rev. 48, 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">It is our conclusion that, except in those cases where it is found as a fact that litigious strife is sought to be promoted, the rule against champerty and maintenance is not now in force in this jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">It follows that the agreement as to the plaintiff\u2019s compensation for services in the suit for contribution, if made, was not illegal. The plaintiff, on being discharged, was therefore entitled to recover what his services were reasonably worth. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>51 N. H. 594.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">\n<em>Judgment on the referee\u2019s report.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b403-9\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
