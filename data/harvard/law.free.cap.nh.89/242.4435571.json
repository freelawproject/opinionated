Jewell </em>v. <em>Railway, </em>55 N. H. 84; <em>Clough </em>v. <em>Company, </em>75 N. H. 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">The case of <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Knepper, </em>245 N. Y. 158, on which the plaintiff relies, is inapplicable. There are here no facts from which it could be found that Boardman, though unlicensed, was not a competent driver or that Lapierre knew, or even ought to have known, that he had no license. Furthermore there is no evidence that the accident was caused by Boardman\u2019s negligence or incompetence (if he was incompetent) and no evidence that Lapierre, even if he had been awake and vigilant, could have avoided the accident. See <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Knepper, supra, </em>164.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">Whether the plaintiff is entitled to be relieved of his agreement \u201cis a question primarily of fact and may be raised only by petition to the Superior Court.\u201d <em>Venus Shoe Corporation </em>v. <em>Company, </em>88 N.
