It is not in any sense an admission of agency and if it were it would be inadmissible in evidence against the defendant. <em>Semprini </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>87 N. H. 279, 280, and cases cited. The plaintiff asserts that an inference of Poole\u2019s agency for the defendant may be drawn from the fact that he made a report of the accident over the telephone. Obviously no such inference is possible because it nowhere appears that Poole made that report to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">The evidence of the brother-in-law\u2019s telephone conversation with the defendant shows only an effort or offer to compromise. This, without more, under well settled principles of law cannot be considered as an admission of liability. The phrase \u201cto square the thing up\u201d is a loose one. Its use under some circumstances might imply a willingness to pay all damages. Its use under others might indicate only a willingness to compromise the dispute upon some basis of mutual satisfaction without the payment of full compensation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>There being no evidence of the circumstances under which the phrase was here used by the defendant it would be conjectural to say that it imported an agreement to pay all damages and in that way provided the factual basis essential to support a preliminary finding that an admission of liability was contained in its use. <em>Gagne </em>v. <em>Company, </em>87 N. H. 163, 169 and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
