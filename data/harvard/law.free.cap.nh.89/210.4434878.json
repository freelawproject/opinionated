Buffum, <em>Adm\u2019r v. </em>David W. Buffum.</parties>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b239-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number><em>Timothy F. O\u2019Connor, Myer Saidel </em>and <em>J. Francis Roche (Mr. Roche </em>orally), for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b239-13\"><em>Devine &amp; Tobin (Mr. Tobin </em>orally), for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b239-14\">Marble, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQv\">After instructing the jury that the only question before them was that of damages, the Presiding Justice went on to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>distinguish between the measure of damages in the event of a finding that the decedent \u201cdid not die as a direct result... of the accident\u201d and the rule to be. applied in case of a finding that her death was so caused. He next referred to the burden of proof on the issue of damages and then said: \u201cThe claim being made that defendants were negligent here must be proven, and is proven if, upon all the evidence in the case you are satisfied that the probabilities favor the claim that the defendants were negligent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Invoking the rule which obtains in some jurisdictions permitting a judge to comment on the evidence <em>(State </em>v. <em>LaVerne, </em>83 N. H. 419, 421), plaintiff\u2019s counsel suggest that the opening paragraphs of the charge merely embody the trial court\u2019s opinion of the merits of the controversy and that the jury must have understood from the instructions last quoted that the question of liability was submitted to them for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">It is unnecessary at this time to determine how far a judge in this State may express his view of the facts for the assistance of the'jury, since that part of the charge to which exception was taken cannot be interpreted other than as an imperative instruction. If we assume, as the plaintiff contends, that the question of David <em>W. </em>Buffum\u2019s negligence was definitely submitted for a finding (the reference to \u201cdefendants\u201d being inadvertent), then the instruction on that issue was in direct contradiction to the instructions given at the beginning of the charge and cannot have failed to mystify the jury. <em>Cohn </em>v. <em>Saidel, </em>71 N. H. 558, 566. See also <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>88 N. H. 430, 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">But the plaintiff claims that, although this be true, the verdict of the jury must stand, since both the evidence and the conduct of the trial clearly called for the direction of a verdict in his favor. This claim is untenable even on the assumption that a trial court may direct a verdict in the absence of a motion therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">The defendant was not obliged to introduce evidence but could if he saw fit, rely on the weakness of the plaintiff\u2019s case. <em>Gaudette </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>88 N. H. 368, 371; <em>Ingalls </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>83 N. H. 397, 398. \u201cOnly in exceptional cases may a verdict as matter of law be ordered in favor of one who has the burden of proof .... It is not ordered for the plaintiff because the defendant offers no evidence.\u201d <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Duston, </em>79 N. H. 490, 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">One of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses testified that the defendant started the car \u201cas if all the passengers had got out,\u201d that two of them had already alighted, and that he had \u201cjust barely started\u201d when he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>evidently \u201crealized something had happened\u201d and \u201cstopped quick again.\u201d This conduct was not necessarily negligent. There may have been circumstances which justified a reasonable belief on the defendant\u2019s part that the decedent had alighted with the others, and the plaintiff was required to establish the defendant\u2019s lack of ordinary care by a balance of probabilities. In this situation, the court could not properly direct a verdict on the issue of liability. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Duston, </em>79 N. H. 490; <em>Hussey </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>82 N. H. 236, 240; <em>Webster </em>v. <em>Seavey, </em>83 N. H. 60, 62; <em>Exeter Banking Co. </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>85 N. H. 458, 460. There is no express finding that the defendant abandoned his defence on that issue and, in view of his motions for a nonsuit and directed verdict, a finding to that effect would be unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">\n<em>New trial.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b241-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
