Jur. (4th <em>ed.), s. </em>193, <em>pp. </em>269, 270. See, also, Bispham, Equity (10th <em>ed.), s. </em>558; <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Company, </em>71 N. H. 332, 345.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">In exercising this equitable power, however, a trial judge should be careful to observe the very definite limits of his authority. \u201cThe fundamental rule on this subject is, that the plaintiff\u2019s right to a dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>covery does not extend to all facts which may be material to the issue, but is confined to facts which are material <em>to his . . . cause of </em>action; it does not enable him to pry into the defendant\u2019s case, or to find out the evidence by which that case will be supported.\u201d 1 Pomeroy, Eq. Jur. (4th <em>ed.), s. </em>201. On the other hand, although the plaintiff is not entitled to a statement of the evidence material to the defence, he may nevertheless compel the discovery of all the facts material to his own cause of action, even though the defendant\u2019s evidence may thereby be incidentally disclosed. <em>Ib., </em>citing <em>LaCoss </em>v. <em>Lebanon, </em>78 N. H. 413, 414; Bispham, Equity (10th <em>ed.), s. </em>561.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">It is no objection that the evidence sought may be merely cumulative. <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Company, </em>71 N. H. 332, 339. Nor need its materiality be definitely established. Its production will be ordered if the court can fairly find that it may in any way be material to the plaintiff\u2019s cause. <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Ashley, </em>12 Met. 478, 481; <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Company, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The principles which govern discovery in general are applicable to the discovery of documentary evidence. 1 Pomeroy, Eq. Jur. (4th <em>ed.), s. </em>205, <em>p. </em>310. In the case of <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Company, </em>79 N. H. 377, the trial court expressly found that the plaintiff was unable properly to prepare his case without an opportunity to inspect the documents sought to be discovered and that justice required their production. The order in the present case is assumed to be based on such a finding, under the rule that where no findings appear which make an order improper, all special findings necessary to justify it were presumably made. <em>LaMarre </em>v. <em>LaMarre, </em>84 N. H. 553. See, also, <em>Keyes </em>v. <em>Baird, </em>88 N. H. 449, 451, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">It is suggested that the allowance of the motion may require the disclosure of facts which will subject the defendant to a penalty under P. L., c. 238, ss. 38, 39. There is nothing in the record, however, to indicate that any such claim was made at the hearing. Moreover, it is the general rule that a corporation has no privilege against self-incrimination. <em>Hale </em>v. <em>Henkel, </em>201 U. S. 43; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>221 U. S. 361, 382; <em>Wagner &amp;c. Co. </em>v. <em>Mali, </em>74 Fed. (2d), 666, 670.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">The defendant also contends that excessive hardship may result to it if compelled to comply with an order which grants to the plaintiff \u201cthe untrammeled right to inspect at will\u201d the records in question. There is some force to this contention. The order is a very broad and general one, and if the defendant desires that some safeguard be imposed, it may request the Superior Court to appoint a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>special master who will see not only that the order is properly complied with by the defendant but that the plaintiff does not inspect any records \u201cnot legitimately necessary to enable her\u201d to prove her case on the trial. <em>Motley, Green &amp;c. Co. </em>v. <em>Company, </em>174 Fed. 734. See, also <em>Glenney </em>v. <em>Stedwell, </em>64 N. Y. 120, 123.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-3\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b308-4\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
