The barque had been, on several foreign voyages, resulting in a loss of $8,\u2018707.41, six sixty-fourths of which was due from the plaintiffs as owners of that undivided share in the vessel. When the declaration in set-off was filed, the bill in the case of <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Butler, ante, </em>38, was pending, and the plaintiffs in this action were defendants in that suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>The Superior Court ruled that the defendant\u2019s claim against the plaintiffs was not a matter which could be availed of in set-off. That ruling was right.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">The claim which it is sought to set off is a claim for contribution, which can only be enforced in a bill in equity brought by the ship\u2019s husband, in which those liable to contribute are made parties defendant, <em>(Smith </em>v. Butler, 164 Mass. 37,) and therefore cannot be made the. subject of a declaration in set-off in an action at law brought by one part owner to collect an outside debt due from the ship\u2019s husband. Since there was a bill to enforce contribution pending in the same court when the plaintiffs brought their action to collect the debt due from the defendant, the defendant\u2019s remedy was plain: he should \u25a0 have moved to have the action at law to recover the outside debt continued until the bill in equity reached a decree, and then have made a motion to have the judgment and decree set off one against the other and execution issued, or a final decree entered for the balance due him or his adversary, as the case might be. The power of the court to order a continuance in case of two actions at law, and to direct execution to issue for the balance between the two judgments, has been practised upon for many years; <em>Rider </em>v. <em>Ocean Ins. Co. 20 </em>Pick. 259; <em>Ames </em>v. <em>Bates, </em>119 Mass. 397, 398, 399; see also Pub. Sts. c. 171, \u00a7\u00a7 25, 26, 27; and on the same principle the Superior Court could have set off the judgment and decree one against the other, and issued execution or entered a decree for the balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
