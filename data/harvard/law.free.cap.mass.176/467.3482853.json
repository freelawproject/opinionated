O\u2019Brien, which is as follows : \u201c All my property, real and personal, to my mother, Mary O\u2019Brien, for the education and support of my daughter, Mary A. O\u2019Brien.\u201d At the trial, before Knowlton, J., it appeared that Mary A. O\u2019Brien, now Mary A. Danahy, and Edmund F. O\u2019Brien were the only children of the testator, and that Edmund F. O\u2019Brien had executed and delivered a deed of release to the plaintiff of all his interest, if any, under the will in and to the trust property. \u201e The judge reserved the case upon the pleadings and an agreed statement of facts for the consideration of the full court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b490-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number><em>J.

O\u2019Brien took the whole equitable estate by the will or acquired it later by the conveyance from her brother of any interest that he might have in the trust property is immaterial. If her brother had any interest, it was subordinate to the trustee\u2019s right and duty to apply as much of the property as he deemed necessary to Mary A. O\u2019Brien\u2019s support. The acquisition of her brother\u2019s interest did not affect this paramount right and duty. The trust is an active trust, requiring the exercise of discretion on the part of the trustee. Therefore it is not to be terminated at the will of the <em>cestui que trust.
