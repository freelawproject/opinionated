The information referred to was in substance that the milk inspector told the defendant that he would give him the result of the analysis of the samples if he would like it, and did so, telling him the percentages of total solids and of fat in the case of each sample ; that afterwards the defendant came back to the inspector\u2019s office- and the inspector then told him that he \u201c would give him the figures in writing if he wanted them, and he said he would like the figures of the analysis of the samples that were below standard,\u201d and that the inspector wrote them down and caused the paper on which they were to be given to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">We think that this was a sufficient compliance with the statute, and that the jury were properly so instructed in substance. The object of the analysis is to show the amount of milk solids or of fat, and if a defendant in any case is furnished with those he is furnished, we think, with the analysis required by the statute to be sent to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
