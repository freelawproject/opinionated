The judge refused to give this ruling.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-6\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b28-7\">The case was submitted on briefs to all the justices.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b28-8\"><em>C.

But the ruling asked for by the defendant was too broad. It went upon the ground that if the defendant\u2019s principal business was supplying meals sbe could not be guilty of keeping the place open on the Lord\u2019s day. If one of her purposes in keeping the place open was the sale of cigars she was guilty of the offence charged. The sale of cigars in the restaurant on the Lord\u2019s day was evidence for the jury that one of the defendant\u2019s purposes in keeping it open was to make such sales. Because of this evidence the request was rightly refused. The only exception is to the refusal to give the request. It is to be presumed that correct instructions were in fact given.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-11\">\n<em>jExceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
