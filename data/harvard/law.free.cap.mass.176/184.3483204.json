The income was given to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>the legatee for life, and the will expressly directs that \u201c no income or principal shall in any case be assignable or alienable by anticipation, or subject to attachment, levy, or seizure by any creditor of the beneficiary, prior to his or her actual receipt thereof.\u201d Even if this clause attempts to go further than the law permits, its validity with regard to an equitable life estate is settled, as against both attaching creditors and assignees in insolvency. <em>Billings </em>v. <em>Marsh, </em>153 Mass. 311. The trustee in bankruptcy very candidly admits that he does not think that he can distinguish the decisions or make good his claim. We see no ground for a distinction in the words of the Bankrupt Act, \u00a7 70. U. S. St. of July 1, 1898, c. 541; 30 U. S. Sts. at Large, 544. Some matters discussed by the defendant Fitz in his unnecessarily elaborate brief are not open.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-3\">\n<em>Decree accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
