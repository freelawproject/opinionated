Emerson, the appellant. Perkins, prior to and in consideration of such indorsement, and as collateral security therefor, gave Emerson a second mortgage on certain real estate in Watertown, and a mortgage note dated July 17, 1896, for $5,000. The first mortgage thereon, held by the Waltham Savings Bank, was subsequently foreclosed and the property under it sold, so that the collateral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>security to the mortgage note held by Emerson was rendered of no value, and he had no collateral which he was obliged to surrender or offer to surrender before offer of proof of claim. It was agreed that the collateral security should apply to renewals of the note, and the original note discounted by the Union Market National Bank of Watertown when it fell due on November 23,1896, was taken up with a new note for the same amount with the same maker and indorser. This second note when it fell due was taken up with a new note for the same amount with the same maker and indorser. This third note was paid before maturity,\" the money to pay it being obtained by the discount of still another note for $5,000, with the same maker and indorser, at the Newton National Bank in Newton. Before this last note fell due Perkins died, and the note had not been paid at the time of the hearing before the commissioners, though Emerson had waived demand and notice thereon, and had pledged collateral of his own upon it, at the request of the Newton National Bank. This last note was offered by the Newton National Bank for proof before the commissioners, and by them allowed for its full amount. Emerson testified before the commissioners that the mortgage note of July 17, 1896, was held by him as collateral for his indorsement, as herein stated.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b414-3\"><em>C. H. Tyler &amp; O. D. </em>Young, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b414-4\"><em>G. S. Littlefield H. R. </em>Skinner, for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b414-5\">Lathrop, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6B\">Both parties in this case have assumed that the note discounted by the Newton bank was a renewal of the original hate discounted by the Watertown bank. Assuming it to be such, the only question is whether Emerson, the indorser, having a promissory note given to him as collateral security by Perkins, the maker, and which -by agreement was to apply to all renewals of the original note, can prove his claim against the insolvent estate of Perkins, who has deceased, the Newton bank having proved the note discounted by it against said estate in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">We see no reason why the claim cannot be proved. There is nothing in the \"Pub. Sts. c. 137, relating to the insolvent estates of deceased persons, or in our decisions, to prevent it. The note was given for a valuable consideration, namely, the lending by Emerson of the credit of his name to Perkins. An action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>upon it could have been maintained by the holder against the maker in the lifetime of the latter ; <em>Hapgood </em>v. <em>Wellington, </em>136 Mass. 217; and it follows that it may be proved against his estate. <em>Moseley </em>v. <em>Ames, </em>5 Allen, 163. <em>Miller\u2019s River National Bank </em>v. <em>Jefferson, </em>138 Mass. 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">Emerson does nob seek to prove his claim as an indorser, nor does he ask the Probate Court for an order, under the Pub. Sts. c. 137, \u00a7\u00a7 28-30, as the holder of a contingent claim, and the case, therefore, does not come within <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>7 Met. 132, and <em>French </em>v. <em>Hayward, </em>16 Gray, 512.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">\n<em>Binding reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
