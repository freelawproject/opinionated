The same' principle is announced in the following cases, holding a municipal corporation not liable for the negligent acts of its police officers: Harrison v. City of Columbus, 44 (Texas, 418; City of Corsicana v. White, 57 Texas, 382; Rusher v. City of Dallas, 83 Texas, 151; Whitfield v. City of Paris, 84 Texas, 431; Givens v. City of Paris, 5 Texas Civ. App.. 708.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b298-4\">STEPHENS, Associate Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"A_-\">Appellant\u2019s cause of action is thus-briefly stated by his counsel: \u201cThis suit was brought by appellant against appellee for damages for personal injuries received by him while in discharge of Ms duties as engineer of a fire engine belonging to the fire department of appellee city, said injuries having been inflicted as-alleged by reason of the gross negligence and incompetency of one Mat-kin, the driver of the said fire engine, by Ms negligently driving said engine upon which appellant was engineer into a collision with a hose wagon, upsetting said engin\u00e9 and causing same to fall upon and injure appellant, and by reason as alleged of the gross negligence of said city and .its officers in employing and retaining in its employment said Mat-kin as such driver of said engine, knowing him to be incompetent and unfit for such position.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">It was charged that appellee had sought and obtained a special charter, with authority to maintain and regulate a fire department, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">A general demurrer was sustained to the petition, and to that action of the court, and that only, error is assigned. The single law question thus raised seems to have been quite thoroughly and generally settled against appellant\u2019s contention by the textwriters and adjudged cases. For a late citation and,review of the authorities, see Gillispie v. Lincoln (Neb.), 16 L. R. A., 349; also Dodge v. Grange (R. I.), 15 L. R. A., 781, and notes. For cases having weight by analogy, see Whitfield v. City of Paris, 84 Texas, 431, and cases there cited, and notes to this case as reported in 15 L. R. A., 783; Givens v. City of Paris, 5 Texas Civ. App., 708; 24 S. W. R., 974, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">The theory of these numerous cases is that the officers of the fire department and the like of a city, whether operating under general law or by special charter, are not the agents or servants of the corporation appointing them, but of the general public, and therefore that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>doctrine of respondeat superior does not apply to their conduct. It follows, then, that the city would not he liable, though its council may have knowingly selected an incompetent driver. Rusher v. City of Dallas, 83 Texas, 151.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b299-9\">Delivered October 26, 1895.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">In the able opinion of Judge Stayton in the leading case in this State on the subject of municipal liability for defective streets (62 Texas, 118), some stress seems to have been laid upon the fact that the city of Galveston had obtained a special charter, hut aside from that the decision \u25a0was in accordance with the great weight of authority holding cities and towns liable for negligence in respect to streets and sidewalks.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The action of a community in adopting a city charter under general law in-this State and in obtaining one by special act of the Legislature is equally voluntary, and no good reason is perceived why there should be any difference of liability in the two cases. At all events, we are df opinion that the fact- of the alleged special charter in this case did not make the petition good.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
