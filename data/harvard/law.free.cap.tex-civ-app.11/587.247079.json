On July 14, 1890, receivers were appointed for the defendant corporation, and after about two years \u00f3f administration of its affairs by the re-ceivers, it was allowed to resume its property, through a reorganization committee, without a sale. On July 14, 1890, Mr. Lott wrote appellant a letter notifying them of the receivership.

W. Todd, President.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-18\">The appellant did not manufacture rails, but had a contract with the ' Bethlehem Iron Co., a manufacturer of such rails, to cover the kind and quality of rails demanded by its contract with defendant, which contract with the Bethlehem Iron Co. required that appellant should give the Bethlehem Iron Co. thirty days\u2019 notice when deliveries were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>desired. Appellee knew that appellant was to procure the rails by such purchase. Appellant was a manufacturer of the articles mentioned in the fastenings contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-3\">The rails were not procured by appellant to be rolled at the factory until some time in December following, when they were made as appellee\u2019s contract required, as appear from letters to the receivers, of date October 31, 1890, and December 19, 1890. The rails were sold by appellant in the market for the best value obtainable, something less per ton than they had cost appellant, and appellant sues for the difference between this and the contract price. The articles mentioned on the fastenings contract were never manufactured, and the damage claimed in this behalf is the difference between what the production of the articles would have cost' appellant and the price contracted to be paid by appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\"><em>Opinion. </em>\u2014 We will first treat of the defense of waiver. The property having passed out of the receivers\u2019 hands to the corporation without a sale, all of its unpaid debts followed the property by force of the statute, whether or not they had been presented by intervention. The evidence is that the claims sued for were not presented against the receivers by intervention, or otherwise urged against them, nor were they called to the attention of the reorganization committee. Appellant had another claim for a large amount which it urged and had paid through the committee, hut in reference to these claims it (appellant) remained passive during the reorganization. This is the extent to which the evidence goes on the subject, and it seems to us clear that it does not make a case of estoppel. No act of fraud was done from which it could be said that the committee was induced to act upon the fact that the claim which was presented was the only one held by appellant. The failure of appellant to assert these demands during the period of receivership and reorganization, under the circumstances shown by this record, was no obstacle to its subsequent assertion of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The court, however, submitted to the jury this issue of waiver, and they were directed to find in favor of defendant if they found it sustained by the evidence. This was an error which may be responsible for the verdict, and for which the judgment must be reversed, unless the testimony before the jury, together with what was offered by plaintiff and rejected, would justify no other disposition of the case than that made by the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">It is claimed by appellant, among other things, that in executory contracts of this nature, the becoming insolvent of one party, and the appointment of a receiver for his property, constitutes a breach of the contract on his part, and relieves the other party who is willing and able to perform from the necessity of performing or placing himself in a position to perform, and that the latter has then and there his cause of action. The rule sought to be applied is the general one that where a party by his act places it out of his power to perform a contract, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>other may at once bring an action against him for a breach thereof. 3 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. of Law, 907, and cases cited. Whatever may be said of other cases, the rule does not seem to apply to a railway corporation whose property is placed in the hands of a receiver. We must so hold, if we understand the decisions on the subject in this State. Brown v. Warner, 78 Texas, 543; Howe v. Harding, 76 Texas, 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-3\">These cases are to the effect that such receivers are not bound to carry out the contracts of the corporation, but may adopt them and execute them so far as beneficial to the purposes of the administration. The court, in any instance, would have the power to require the receivers to carry out such a contract. It must follow from these principles that it is not until the receivers refuse or fail to recognize and observe the contract that a breach thereof takes place, and that the fact of receivership is not per se a breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Appellant states in its brief, \u201cThat the placing of the property in the hands of the receiver deprived the defendant of the ability to carry out its contract, and this act was a breach of the contract by defendant, and was so treated by plaintiff, because from time to time all plaintiff ever did or attempted to do concerning the 'fastenings\u2019 contract was' to send receivers a copy of it on July 23, 1890, and in December, 1890, placed its claim for damages in the hands of its attorney for collection, and the frequent bringing it to the attention of the reorganization committee, and finally the institution of this suit.\u201d Also that, \u201cThe. testimony of all the witnesses is to the effect that none of the fastenings, nuts, bolts, or fish plates or other things called for in that contract were ever manufactured, but that the contract was treated as breached by the plaintiff (defendant) upon receipt of the letter of Mr. Lott advising plaintiff that the road had been placed in the hands of the receiver.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">If such be really the testimony, and our conclusions above expressed be correct, it would seem that plaintiff had elected not to proceed with the performance of the contract for fastenings before any act of refusal or other breach had been created by the action of the receivers. We rather think that the correspondence of appellant with the receivers tends to show that the former did not regard the appointment of receivers as a breach of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">It is clear that the receivers, by their telegram and letters, particularly their letter of July 29, 1890, indicated their unwillingness to be bound by the contracts. Under such circumstances, appellant would have had a cause of action against the corporation, provided it was made to appear that but for this refusal of the receivers,-it was willing and able omits part to have performed the contract at the time fixed for performance. Appellant could not have the right of action, if, before any act of breach on the part of the corporation or the receivers, it had placed itself in a position of inability to perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">The delays procured by defendant in the furnishing of the rails and fastenings culminated on June 27, 1890, when the president of defendant company, by his letter of that date, gave plaintiff the thirty days\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>notice required for delivery of rails and fastenings, fixing the date at which performance on the part of plaintiff was to he ready, viz., July 31, .1890. From that time on, defendant did nothing that would warrant plaintiff in assuming that delivery could he made at a later date. The only ground upon which such a view could have been based was the fact that Lott stated in this letter that defendant would let appellant know by July 1st whether they would use rails of the weight of 56 or 60 lbs. It appears that appellant was willing for defendant to designate rails of 56 lbs. in lieu of those of 60 lbs., required by the contract, and the latter, in giving the notice for delivery to take place or begin on July 31, promised to indicate its selection by July 1. When that day passed without the designation being made, it was incumbent on appellant, if it intended to hold defendant to its contract, to proceed to have the rails made of the weight the contract required. The right or duty to make the selection in weight of the rails was not a part of the contract, and had not become such; but was merely a matter of privilege appellant seemed willing to extend, if desired by appellee. Appellee promised to exercise it by July 1st, and failed to do so, and thereafter it was clearly the duty of appellant to prepare to perform the contract as it was, in the absence of any further waiver or delay that was chargeable to defendant. As a matter of law, we do not think the failure of defendant to \u25a0indicate its preference as to the rails would, after July 1st, excuse plaintiff from doing what was necessary on its part in order to be in position to perform at the time fixed. If, therefore, the time for performance arrived, and it was not able to perform on its part, and this inability was not due to or excused by some act of the corporation or the receivers, plaintiff was not entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">The testimony is that appellant was required by its contract with the Bethlehem Iron Co. to give it thirty days\u2019 notice for delivery of rails, and the letters of appellant show that the Bethlehem Iron Co. insisted on the thirty days\u2019 notice, and nowhere is there any evidence or indication that appellant would have been able to have them ready in the time that elapsed from the date of the receivership to July 31. Plaintiff unwarrantably delayed this matter from the date of Lott\u2019s notice to the date of'receivership (July 14), and did not communicate with the receivers on the subject until July 19. There remained but eleven days, and the conduct of the receivers at and after that date is immaterial in view of the fact that plaintiff had already so delayed that it could not have had the rails ready for delivery on July 31, had the receivers been ready and willing to carry out the contract. We do not discover in this record testimony that would warrant the jury in finding that appellant, after the delay it indulged in, could have been able to comply, with its contract at the time required, but what evidence there is on the subject indicates the contrary, and for the reason that there is nothing in the evidence excusing performance on its part, the verdict, so far as it relates to the rail contract, was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">We will now consider the branch of the case concerning the contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>for fastenings. In this regard it will not be necessary to determine who was responsible for the non-fulfillment of the contract. Assuming that the receivers were, and that appellant was, willing and able to have complied therewith in every respect, still it seems to us upon the evidence that the verdict was the only verdict which the jury could have rendered. The difference between the cost of producing the \u201cfastenings\u201d and the price at which they were contracted to defendant, which was the measure of damages in such case, was proved. But it was also proved by appellant\u2019s witnesses that the materials which appellant had provided itself with to fulfill this contract, were utilized by it in manufacturing other articles from which it realized a profit. Appellant\u2019s officers who were witnesses left the testimony in this state, saying that they did not know the extent of the profit, one witness stating that it would take a week to arrive at it. To our minds it is clear that the damages ascertained by the measure aforesaid should have been credited with these profits. It may be such profits exceeded the profits appellant would have derived from this contract. The jury were not enabled by the testimony furnished them to arrive at appellant\u2019s damages, or to say that it had suffered any damage from the non-fulfillment of said contract. The verdict for defendant was therefore the proper one.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b622-8\">Delivered November 20, 1895.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b622-3\">We need not enter upon a consideration of the action of the District Court in overruling appellee\u2019s plea in abatement. That portion of appellee\u2019s brief which mentions this subject is not such as to engage our attention, under the rules. The ruling was in favor of appellant, and of course it is in no position to complain of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">The evidence ruled out or admitted according to assignments of error 1, <em>2, </em>3, 5 to 26 inclusive, had the rulings been to the contrary of what they were, was not such as would have affected the conclusion that the verdict rendered was necessary from the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The fourth assignment discloses no error. Upon our view of the case it is immaterial what the charges were.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">Writ of error refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
