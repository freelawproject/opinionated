The district court answered no, accepting taxpayer\u2019s argument that a saving clause in the repealing legislation, which expressly saved civil seizures or forfeitures and- certain injunctive actions but did not mention the tax, prevailed over the general saving statute, 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109 (1970). The district court further reasoned that Congress so acted because <em>Leary v. United States, </em>395 U.S. 6, 89 S.Ct. 1532, 23 L.Ed.2d 57 (1969), had \u201cdealt the [Marihuana Tax Act] a crippling blow\u201d and \u201cwashed away its constitutional underpinnings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-12\">The government urges the opposite answer. It contends that a limited saving clause in repealer legislation cannot affect an implied, pro tanto repeal of the general saving statute, which states it would preserve the tax \u201cunless the repealing act shall expressly so provide . . ..\u201d It points out that the district court\u2019s construction would attribute to Congress an intent to preserve criminal prosecutions for failure to pay a tax that could not be collected. Finally, the government argues that the district court misconstrued <em>Leary\u2019s </em>holding as to the constitutionality of the tax involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-14\">We agree with the district court that <em>Leary </em>dealt the Marihuana Tax Act a crippling blow in holding its order form requirement amounted to self-incrimination, but it did not hold the tax to be unconstitutional. More importantly, we hold both parties are correct to the extent that their arguments prove it is impossible to divine a consistent or logical construction of the special saving clause in the repealing legislation and the general saving statute. At best, we are left with a tension between redundancy and absurdity. Within this limited range of choices, redundancy must be the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-15\">The facts are not in dispute. On September 21, 1970, the taxpayer, Jon Allen Frey, was convicted upon his plea of guilty to violating the laws of the United States regulating the transfer of marihuana and the payment of a federal excise tax thereon. The subject transfer of 208.96 ounces of marihuana occurred during the period from April to May, 1969. Under the provisions of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4741(a)(2) then in effect, a tax was imposed upon such transfers at the rate of $100 per ounce. The Internal Revenue Service made an assessment against the taxpayer in the amount of $20,900 on August 29, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-16\">On October 27, 1970, the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, P.L. 91-513, 84 Stat. 1236 (Drug Control Act), was enacted. Certain sections, including \u00a7 1103 which saved specific pending proceedings, became effective immediately. On March 25, 1971, taxpayer paid $100 of the above assessment and filed a timely refund claim. On May 1, 1971, the remainder of the Drug Control Act became effective. This included \u00a7 1101 which repealed the Marihuana Tax Act, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4741, <em>et seq. </em>Taxpayer paid an additional $1,416.40 of the above assessment on October 6, 1971, and instituted this action to recover both payments. The government denied taxpayer\u2019s right to recover and counterclaimed for the unpaid balance of the assessment. The district court granted taxpayer\u2019s motion for summary judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>on the government\u2019s counterclaim. Taxpayer consented to a dismissal with prejudice of his entire claim for refund and the case was appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Precedent requires that we construe the general saving statute as part of the Drug Control Act. Great <em>Northern Ry. Co. v. United States, </em>208 U.S. 452, 28 S.Ct. 313, 52 L.Ed. 567 (1908); <em>United States v. Brown, </em>429 F.2d 566 (5th Cir. 1970); <em>United States v. Carter, </em>171 F.2d 530 (5th Cir. 1948). However, this does not advance the ball very far in the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">The special saving clause of the Drug Control Act read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-6\">\u00a7 1103. Pending Proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-7\">(a) Prosecutions for any violation of law occurring prior to the effective date of section 1101 [May 1, 1971] shall not be affected by the repeals or amendments made by such section or section 1102, or abated by reason thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-8\">(b) Civil seizures or forfeitures and in-junctive proceedings commenced prior to the effective date of section 1101 [May 1, 1971] shall not be affected by the repeals or amendments made by such section or section 1102, or abated for reason thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">The incorporation of the general saving statute would add to the Drug Control Act this language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-10\">The repeal of any statute shall not have the effect to release or extinguish any penalty, forfeiture, or liability incurred under such statute, unless the repealing Act shall so expressly provide, and such statute shall be treated as still remaining in force for the purpose of sustaining any proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of such penalty, forfeiture, or liability * * *. 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-13\">A comparison of the two saving provisos shows that \u00a7 1103 preserved no proceeding not already saved by \u00a7 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-14\">Taxpayer urges that we resolve the redundancy by applying the \u201cmaxim\u201d of statutory construction that the expression of one thing excludes others not expressed, and thereby limit the rights of action under repealed laws which would be saved to those pending proceedings enumerated in \u00a7 1103.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Taxpayer has constructed this ingenious two-part formulation which he asserts will harmonize existing precedent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-15\">(A) Where a repealing act contains a special saving clause, the general saving statute (1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109) does not apply. In such case, the special saving clause applies to the exclusion of the general saving statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-16\">(B) An exception to Rule (A) above occurs if the purpose of the special saving clause is to save something which would not otherwise be saved by 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109. In such a case the special saving clause is a supplement to 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109 and both are applicable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-17\">The basic flaw in taxpayer\u2019s novel approach is that it treats statutory construction as a science sufficiently orderly to obey set rules or formulae. It is not. <em>See National Railroad Passenger Corp. v. National Association of Railroad Passengers, </em>414 U.S. 453, 94 S.Ct. 690, 38 L.Ed.2d 646 (1974). The only pole star is legislative intent. In every case, that star\u2019s location must be plotted on the basis of all available <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>information. That this approach applies full force to the coordinated interpretation of repealer legislation, with or without a special saving clause, and an existing separate general saving statute is the lesson taught by the Supreme Court\u2019s reversal of the Ninth Circuit in <em>Territory of Alaska v. American Can Co., supra </em>n.1, and by our prior precedent in <em>United States v. Carter, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Even if the repeal of \u00a7 4741 could conceivably be viewed as prohibiting the collection of the remainder of an excise tax which was imposed on a specific transaction that was complete before repeal, assessed in full before repeal, and partially paid before repeal; we find persuasive evidence that Congress did not intend that result in this case. Neither the Drug Control Act itself nor its extensive legislative history<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> mentions an intent to extinguish tax liabilities previously incurred under \u00a7 4741. The House Report stated the principal purpose of the Drug Control Act thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AsO\">This legislation is designed to deal in a comprehensive fashion with the growing menace of drug abuse in the United States (1) through providing authority for increased efforts in drug abuse prevention and rehabilitation of users, (2) through providing more effective means for law enforcement aspects of drug abuse prevention and control, and (3) by providing for an overall balanced scheme of criminal penalties for offenses involving drugs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">In the section-by-section analysis of the bill as enacted, the repealer and saving clauses were respectively described in these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzD\">Section 1101. Repeals</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-11\">This section repeals the provisions of existing law which deal with narcotics and/or marihuana and which are presently within the jurisdiction of the Ways and Means Committee. The principal laws repealed are the Harrison Narcotics Act (sections 4701-4736 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954), the Marihuana Tax Act (sections 4741-4762 of the 1954 Code), the Narcotic Drugs Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 171, 173, 174, 176-184, 185), and the Narcotics Manufacturing Act of 1960 (21 U.S.C. 501-517). Section 1103. Pending proceedings</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AsA\">Subsection (a) of this section provides that prosecutions for any violation of law occurring prior to the effective date of the repealer section (sec. 1101) will not be affected by, or abated by reason of, the repeals or the conforming amendments made by section 1101 or 1102.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-12\">Subsection (b) provides that civil seizures or forfeitures and injunctive proceedings commenced prior to such effective date will not be affected by, or abated by reason of, the repeals or conforming amendments.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-13\"><em>Leary </em>was not mentioned. No concern was expressed for its impact on the Marihuana Tax Act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> To the contrary, Congress expressly preserved all pending criminal proceedings under this Tax Act, even those which would have been directly affected by <em>Leary. </em>Moreover, it did not make repeal of the Marihuana Tax Act effective for seven months after the Drug Control Act was enacted. This highlights the most devastating argument against taxpayer\u2019s contention. It would attribute to Congress an implied intent to extinguish a tax liability imposed on a past transaction contrary to the specific negation of such an implication by the general saving statute. It would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>derive the implication both from and in spite of an express saving clause which preserved criminal prosecutions for failure to pay the extinguished tax. We refuse to ascribe such a ridiculous intent to this enactment. To the contrary, treating the general saving statute as a part of the Drug Control Act, we discern an intention that its liability-saving provision save the incurred, assessed and partially paid tax here.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Although we reject taxpayer\u2019s proposed rules, they do forcefully demonstrate that the general saving statute made the specific saving clause inserted in the Drug Control Act altogether unnecessary. This suggests a second \u201cmaxim\u201d which requires courts to construe an enactment so as to give effect to all its provisions. Here again, the \u201cmaxim\u201d must yield to the better view of legislative intent which can be garnered from an overview of the entire situation. Inadvertence or redundancy should not be assumed, but when the alternative is absurdity, the court seeking intent has no real choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">The judgment appealed from is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b344-11\">. Taxpayer\u2019s principal precedent for asserting that the Drug Control Act enactment must be construed to displace the general saving statute is <em>Territory of Alaska v. American Can Co., </em>246 F.2d 493, 17 Alaska 280 (9th Cir. 1957), <em>reversed, </em>358 U.S. 224, 79 S.Ct. 274, 3 L.Ed.2d 257 (1959). This case construed a three-section emergency act that repealed all of the Alaska Property Tax Act except municipal, school, and public utility district taxes which had been levied and assessed or would be levied and assessed during the current year. The Court of Appeals found the repealer enactment was intended to override the General Saving Act of Alaska, \u00a7 19-1-1 Alaska Compiled Stat. Ann. (1949). Great reliance was placed on the wording in the bill\u2019s title \u201cexcepting from repeal certain taxes\u201d which referred to the saving clause. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that this construction would conflict with a more reliable indication of legislative intent found in the history of the repealing bill. The government would distinguish this case on the basis that the General Saving Act of Alaska is significantly different from \u00a7 109 involved here because it does not include the phrase \u201cunless the repealing Act shall so expressly provide.\u201d We need not reach this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b345-7\">.

Rather, it held that a timely and proper assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination should have provided <em>Leary </em>a complete defense to prosecution under the statute making it unlawful to acquire, transport or conceal untaxed marihuana, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4744. Indeed, the Court found the Marihuana Tax Act was intended merely to impose a very high tax on transfers to nonre-gistrants and not to prohibit such transfers entirely.
