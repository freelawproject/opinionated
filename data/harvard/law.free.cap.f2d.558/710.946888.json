Hale filed for black lung disability benefits on March 15,1971 under the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 901 et seq. [amended in 1972]. Hale is presently 65 years old and has over 30 years coal mining experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">In a December 3, 1974 determination the Administrative Law Judge denied Hale\u2019s claim because the proof made out neither actual, nor presumed pneumoconiosis, nor total disability. An alternate ground for denial was Hale\u2019s failure to file a State workmen\u2019s compensation claim in compliance with 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 923(c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Appeals Council on March 11, 1975 approved the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s opinion, thus making it the final decision of the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">On review the District Court, finding substantial evidence supporting the Secretary\u2019s resolution that Hale did not establish a <em>totally disabling </em>pulmonary or respiratory impairment, entered summary judgment for the Secretary April 12,1976. The Court did not pass on the substantiality of proof in regard to Hale\u2019s actual or presumed pneumoconiosis, nor did it reach the question of whether his failure to seek workmen\u2019s compensation barred his black lung claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">Appealing, Hale insists that, as a miner with more than fifteen years experience, he is entitled to a presumption of pneumoconiosis which the Secretary failed to rebut. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c)(4). But his presumption is not accorded until the applicant has been proved totally disabled. Here the Secretary has found him not totally disabled. <em>Phillips v. Mathews, </em>555 F.2d 1182 (4 Cir. 1977). We cannot say the Secretary\u2019s denial of black lung benefits fails for want of substantial evidential support.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-13\">Finally Hale contends that a filing for workmen\u2019s compensation is not required because it would be futile. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 923(c).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Secretary gave him ample opportunity to press the State claim within the statutory time limit, but he persistently declined to do so. Consequently, we are unable to say the Secretary erred in denying benefits on this alternate ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-14\">With neither error at trial nor insubstan-tiality of evidence appearing, we affirm the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b783-10\">. This section stipulates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-11\">\u201c(c) No claim for benefits under this section shall be considered unless the claimant has also filed a claim under the applicable State workmen\u2019s compensation law prior to or at the same time his claim was filed for benefits under this section; except that the foregoing provisions of this paragraph shall not apply in any case in which the filing of a claim under such law would clearly be futile because the period within which such a claim may be filed thereunder has expired or because pneumoconiosis is not compensable under such law, or in any other situation in which, in the opinion of the Secretary, the filing of a claim would clearly be futile.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b783-27\">.
