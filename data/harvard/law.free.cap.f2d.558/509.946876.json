Appellant primarily challenges the constitutionality of the seizure of his property pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>suant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6331<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by Internal Revenue agents. Because the merits of appellant\u2019s claims have been resolved in pri- or litigation, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">Appellant has been a familiar litigant in federal court. The facts underlying this case are adequately set forth in <em>United States v. Pilla, </em>550 F.2d 1085 (8th Cir. 1977), <em>cert. </em>denied, - U.S. -, 97 S.Ct. 2954, 53 L.Ed.2d 1080 (1977), in which this court affirmed appellant\u2019s conviction pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7212(b) for unlawfully attempting to rescue property that had been seized by the Internal Revenue Service. The instant case represents the third civil action contesting the seizure of his property by IRS agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">In the first case, appellant requested a three-judge court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2282 and 2284 to declare unconstitutional all parts of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, including 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6331, that enable IRS agents to seize property without a court order. He sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The claim for injunctive relief was dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The district court determined that the injunctive request was barred by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7421(a), which prohibits suits to restrain the assessment or collection of taxes. The court also concluded that the Federal Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201, does not permit declaratory judgments with respect to federal taxes. For these reasons, the district court denied the request to convene a three-judge court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> No appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">In the second case, appellant sought compensatory and punitive damages for the allegedly unlawful seizure of his property. The district court, upon consideration of uncontroverted affidavits submitted by the IRS agents, found that the agents were acting within the scope of their employment and with the good faith belief that their actions were lawful. Accordingly, the court granted the government\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Again, Pilla did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-13\">In the instant case, appellant repeats his allegation that IRS agents unlawfully entered his business premises and seized his property. His complaint requests compensatory damages, an injunction, a declaratory judgment and the convention of a three-judge court. As in his first civil action and in the criminal case, appellant contends that the levy statute, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6331, is unconstitutional. In addition, he maintains that 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7421, 7422, and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201 are unconstitutional to the extent they interfere with access to the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-14\">The district court, in granting summary judgment in favor of the government, concluded that appellant\u2019s claims are barred under the doctrine of res judicata because \u201cplaintiff is still complaining of the same alleged violation of his rights arising out of the seizure of his printing equipment.\u201d The district court also denied the motion to convene a three-judge court on the ground that the claims are insubstantial. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-15\">Appellant contends the district court erred in denying his request to convene a three-judge court to rule on the constitutionality of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6331, 7421, 7422 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201. The essence of appellant\u2019s complaint in the instant case, as in the prior litigation, is that IRS agents unlawfully entered his business establishment and seized his property, and particularly, that section 6331 is unconstitutional.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>Because appellant has raised analogous claims in two prior civil proceedings, we conclude he is barred under the doctrine of res judicata from litigating matters that were or might have been raised in earlier suits. <em>See Chicot County Drainage District v. Baxter State Bank, </em>308 U.S. 371, 378, 60 S.Ct. 317, 84 L.Ed. 329 (1940); <em>Hanson v. Hunt Oil Co., </em>505 F.2d 1237, 1239-41 (8th Cir. 1974). For the same reason, he has not presented a substantial federal constitutional question, and a three-judge court need not be convened.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Furthermore, in appellant\u2019s criminal case, <em>United States v. Pilla, supra, </em>550 F.2d at 1092, this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-6\">The defendant\u2019s argument boils down to the proposition that 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6331 is unconstitutional because it permits a seizure of property without prior judicial proceedings. That argument has been out of date since the Supreme Court decided <em>Phillips v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>283 U.S. 589, 51 S.Ct. 608, 75 L.Ed. 1289 (1931), more than forty-five years ago. <em>See Fuentes v. Shevin, </em>407 U.S. 67, 90-92, 92 S.Ct. 1283, 32 L.Ed.2d 556 (1972); <em>Kalb v. United States, </em>505 F.2d 506, 510 (2d Cir. 1974); and <em>Tavares v. United States, </em>491 F.2d 725 (9th Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>420 U.S. 925, 95 S.Ct. 1120, 43 L.Ed.2d 394 (1975).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">On January 12, 1977, following the decision in <em>United States v. Pilla, supra, </em>550 F.2d at 1085, the Supreme Court decided G. <em>M. Leasing Corp. v. United States, </em>429 U.S. 338, 97 S.Ct. 619, 50 L.Ed.2d 530 (1977), in which G. M. Leasing Corporation sought, <em>inter alia, </em>damages arising from the levy and seizure pursuant to section 6331 of assets by IRS agents who conducted a war-rantless entry into the corporation s business premises. The Supreme Court held<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that the warrantless entry into the privacy of the corporation\u2019s office was violative of the Fourth Amendment and, in order to determine entitlement to monetary damages, remanded for consideration of' whether the IRS agents acted in good faith. 97 S.Ct. at 628-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-12\">Subsequently, this court had the opportunity to reconsider the <em>Pilla </em>decision in light of G. <em>M. Leasing </em>and, on March 15, 1977, denied appellant\u2019s motion for rehearing and rehearing en banc. Appellant\u2019s petition for certiorari was denied by the Supreme Court on June 20, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-13\">The merits of appellant\u2019s constitutional challenge to the seizure of his property have been decided in his criminal case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, in a prior civil case from which appellant did not appeal, the district court found that the IRS agents were acting within the scope of their employment and with the good faith belief that their actions were lawful. <em>Cf. G. M. Leasing Corp. v. United States, supra, </em>97 S.Ct. at 619. The issues raised in the instant case have been fully heard and resolved during earlier litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b581-25\">. The Honorable Earl R. Larson, United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b582-9\"><em>. </em>Section 6331(a) authorizes collection of taxes \u201cby levy upon all property and rights to property\u201d belonging to a person who \u201cneglects or refuses to pay\u201d any tax \u201cor on which there is a lien * * * for the payment of such tax.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b582-10\">. The court suggested that the correct procedure for appellant to follow would be to pay the tax deficiency, file a claim for refund pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7422(a), and proceed with an action against the United States pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a)(1). Section 7422 precludes a civil action unless a claim for refund has been filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b582-17\">. In this case, appellant has also claimed that the IRS agents failed to appraise and set aside $250 worth of exempt business property pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6334(a)(3) and (b). The record reflects that appellant was permitted to remove certain property from the building after the levies were served, and he has not raised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>any previous objection to lack of appraisal. Furthermore, this court in <em>United States v. Pil-la, supra, </em>550 F.2d at 1091-92, noted that the seizure complied with prescribed procedures.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b583-9\">. The Supreme Court declined to review the question of the validity of the levies placed during the unlawful entry and accepted the Tenth Circuit\u2019s determination that the levies were valid. Citing <em>Phillips v. Commissioner, </em>283 U.S. 589, 596-97, 51 S.Ct. 608, 75 L.Ed. 1289 (1931), and its progeny, the Court reaffirmed that the statutory system under which taxes may be collected summarily meets the requirements of due process as long as there is an adequate opportunity for a post-seizure determination of the taxpayer\u2019s rights. 97 S.Ct. at 628.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b583-17\">. Because the substantive basis for the complaint has been resolved, we need not consider appellant\u2019s additional claims concerning the constitutionality of \u201cjurisdictional\u201d statutes, such as 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7421, 7422, and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
