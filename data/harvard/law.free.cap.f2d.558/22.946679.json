Four declarations were submitted to satisfy this requirement. The declarations\u2019 contents may be briefly summarized:</p>\n<p id=\"b96-11\">(1) Declaration of Breuer (the joint inventors). Breuer declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-12\">That, as assignors to E. R. Squibb &amp; Sons, Inc., we introduced the concept of the invention to another, delivered a sample of a compound of the invention and had said compound submitted to tests which demonstrated the antibacterial activity of said compound all by employees of said assignee in the United States pri- or to August 17, 1973;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-13\">That said acts are the same as those documented and corroborated by Jack Bernstein, Salvatore J. Lucania and Harold I. Basch in their respective declarations accompanying this declaration and were carried out on our behalf;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-14\">That said acts in the United States with respect to the investigation show that concept of the invention was introduced into the United States, that a compound of the invention was introduced into the United States and the said compound was tested and found to be antimi-crobially active in the United States, thereby reducing the invention to practice in the United States prior to August 17, 1973, and thereby were sufficient to establish priority of the invention relative to the effective filing date of the pat-entee * * * ,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>(2) Declaration of Bernstein (I). Bernstein declared that, as Assistant Director of Organic Chemistry of the assignee corporation, he received in the United States, prior to August 17, 1973, two reports from Breuer which disclose \u201ca concept of the compound [naming Compound A] as an antimicrobial agent.\u201d Photocopies of the pertinent pages of the reports were attached. The second report discloses a proposed method of synthesis for a compound having the structure of Compound A.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">(3) Declaration of Lucania (I). Lucania declared that, as Preclinical Research Administrator of the assignee, he received in the United States, prior to August 17,1973, a document called a \u201cTransmission Record\u201d for Compound A. As shown by the photocopy attached to the declaration, the Trans1 mission Record, a printed form, contains the following typewritten information: (1) company code number for the compound (\u201c67,364\u201d); (2) empirical formula (\u201cC17H16N4 O5S3\u201d); (3) name of the chemist (\u201cDr. Breuer\u201d); (4) notebook number; (5) chemical structural formula and chemical name for Compound A; (6) molecular weight, melting point, physical state, solubility, a \u201cNMR\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> spectrum number, an \u201cIR\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> spectrum number, elemental analysis (carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulfur), and purity; and (7) date (\u201c30.1.73\u201d),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> grams (\u201c70 mg\u201d), batch number, and specific testing requested (\u201cantimicrobial activity\u201d). The Transmission Record also has a handwritten entry \u201c0.07\u201d inserted before the printed language: \u201c[Gjrams received by Research Evaluation Office * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b97-16\">Lucania further declared that he received, in the United States prior to August 17, 1973, 0.07 grams of Compound A and that, on behalf of the inventors, he \u201cdistributed 10 mg. for analysis and 50 mg. for microbiological testing\u201d as shown by the photocopy of a \u201cResearch Chemical Distribution\u201d card also attached to the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-17\">(4) Declaration of Basch (I). Basch declared that, as an Assistant Research Investigator of the assignee, he tested Compound A in the United States prior to August 17, 1973 \u201cfor antimicrobial activity by two fold tube dilution assay and confirmed [it] as active.\u201d The photocopies of two notebook pages attached to the declaration show that a compound (identified by company code number and by the chemical name for Compound A) was tested for \u201cMIC\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> by twofold tube dilution assay against some sixteen organisms.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-18\">\n<em>Order To Show Cause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AKg\">Breuer\u2019s Rule 204(c) showing was reviewed by an examiner of interferences who, for various reasons, found it insufficient \u201cto make out a <em>prima facie </em>case of priority by applicants <em>vis-a-vis </em>patentee within the meaning of 37 C.F.R. 1.204(c).\u201d Therefore, concurrent with the declaration of the interference, the examiner of interferences issued against Breuer an Order to Show Cause why summary judgment under 37 CFR 1.228 (Rule 228)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Responding to the Order to Show Cause, Breuer submitted three additional declarations:</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">(1) Declaration of Bernstein (II). In this declaration, Bernstein declared that he also received a copy of the Transmission Record (referred to in Lucania\u2019s declaration (I) above) and furthermore:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-6\">That the physical data provided on said Transmission Record is consistent with the structural formula set forth therein and confirmed by the two additional pages accompanying that cover sheet (all pages attached for convenience), the second page of which shows in greater detail <em>the synthesis of the compound outlined previously </em>and the third page of which is a copy of <em>the infrared spectrum which contains the structure identifying peaks noted on the </em>curve;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-7\"><em>That from the foregoing, prior to August 17, 1978,1 knew the structure of the compound conceived, synthesized and introduced into the United States </em>by applicants Breuer and Treuner, the method for synthesizing as an antibacterial agent useful against organisms named above and that <em>the analytical data submitted supported the structure expected from the method of synthesis. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">(2) Declaration of Lucania (II).

However, we are unable to find that any person acting on behalf of applicants established <em>in the United States </em>that the compound shipped into the United States was a compound having a structural formula falling within the scope of the count. It is admitted in applicants\u2019 Response to the Order to Show Cause (Paper No. 7) that all the analytical work purporting to establish the identity of the compound shipped into the United States was carried out in Germany. The express wording of 35 U.S.C. 104<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> precludes reliance on such activities to establish a date of invention, except as to applications filed pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 119 and indeed no application appears to have been filed by applicants pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 119. <em>Schmierer v. Newton, </em>397 F.2d 1010, 55 CCPA 1362, 158 USPQ 203 (1968). [Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-6\">Inasmuch as <em>applicants have failed to prove knowledge of the structure in the United States </em>prior to patentee\u2019s filing date, they have not made out a <em>prima facie </em>case for all the limitations of the count. Compare <em>Rochling </em>v. <em>Burton, </em>178 USPQ 300 (Bd.Pat.Int.1971) and see <em>Golota v. Strom, </em>* * * [489 F.2d 1287, 180 USPQ 396 ([Cust. &amp; Pat.App.] 1974)]. It follows that applicants have failed to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case of an actual reduction to practice prior to patentee. While we might agree that applicants have established a conception, we note that applicants have not alleged conception and diligence as part of their <em>prima facie </em>case. [Emphasis, first occurrence, added. Remaining emphases in original.] Applicants allege that the record is sufficient to permit this case to proceed to the testimony taking period. We disagree. The answers to applicants\u2019 arguments are presented in <em>Kistler v. Weber, </em>412 F.2d 280, 56 CCPA 1413, 162 USPQ 214 (1969).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">Thus, the board awarded priority of invention by summary judgment to DeMarin-is.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-11\">\n<em>The Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b99-12\">The general question is whether the board erred in holding that the declarations submitted on behalf of Breuer do not s\u00e9t forth what Rule 204(c) requires: \u201c[A] factual description of acts and circumstances performed or observed by the affiant, which collectively would prima facie entitle him [Breuer] to an award of priority with respect to the effective filing date of the patent.\u201d The specific issue is whether the board erred in holding that Breuer has not proven prima facie that the compound introduced into the United States was Compound A.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-13\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b99-14\">Breuer (appellants) rely on 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(g): \u201c[T]he invention was made in this country * * *Thus, they contend that they introduced a compound (i. e., Compound A) into the United States and that the invention was completed (actually reduced to practice) in this country by virtue of the successful antimicrobial testing, performed at their request, which demonstrated \u201ca practical utility.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Breuer\u2019s theory of the case follows established law.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>Finding of fact (5) by the board reads: \u201cNo person analyzed the compound in the United States to determine or confirm its structure * * *The board then held that, absent such a domestic chemical analysis, Breuer \u201cfailed to prove knowledge of the structure in the United States prior to patentee\u2019s filing date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">At oral hearing, counsel for DeMarinis (appellee) was asked this question from the bench: \u201cThere was knowledge of the structure in the United States prior to the pat-entee\u2019s filing date, wasn\u2019t there?\u201d Counsel responded: \u201cI think there was. We don\u2019t endorse that aspect of the board\u2019s decision.\u201d DeMarinis nevertheless supports the board\u2019s award of priority to him on the ground that Breuer, \u201cwhile proving introduction of some invention into this country, did not prove by means of corroborated evidence what it was that was introduced.\u201d DeMarinis suggests that such corroboration could have been supplied by a domestic chemical analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Regardless of whether the alleged deficiency in Breuer\u2019s showing is characterized as a failure of proof as the board did or as a failure of corroboration as DeMarinis did, the question remains the same: Has Breuer proved prima facie that the compound introduced into the United States was Compound A despite the absence of a domestic chemical analysis?<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">A prima facie showing under Rule 204(c) \u201ccalls upon the junior party to <em>prove </em>(by way of affidavits) setting forth facts) at least so much of his case as would entitle him to an award of priority <em>if </em>the senior party were to rely only on his filing date and were not to rebut any of the junior party\u2019s case.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Kistler </em>v. <em>Weber, </em>412 F.2d 280, 285, 56 CCPA 1413, 1419-20, 162 USPQ 214, 218 (1969).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Furthermore, \u201cthe burden on the applicant here is not to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, or even by a preponderance of the evidence, but merely to establish a prima facie case.\u201d <em>Schwab v. Pittman, </em>451 F.2d 637, 640, 59 CCPA 720, 725, 172 USPQ 69, 71 (1971). We hold that Breuer has met that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">The declarations include, as attachments, the inventors\u2019 Transmission Record which clearly discloses the synthesis and chemical structure of Compound A. Bernstein and Lucania both declared that they received the Transmission Record in this country, that it came from the inventors, and that they \u201cknew\u201d or \u201cunderstood\u201d the chemical structure of the transmitted compound to be Compound A.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-11\">DeMarinis argues that this knowledge possessed by Bernstein and by Lucania \u201ccame from the inventors themselves\u201d and that, as such, it must be \u201cproperly corroborated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-12\">Clearly, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 104 does not preclude using evidence of the inventor\u2019s knowledge from a foreign country for <em>all </em>purposes, but only where it is used to \u201cestablish a date of invention.\u201d See <em>Hedgewick v. Akers, </em>497 F.2d 905, 182 USPQ 167 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1974). Here, the knowledge of the inventors, embodied in the Transmission Record, is admissible evidence to prove the chemical structure of the compound introduced into this country. Cf. <em>Rebuffat v. Crawford, </em>68 F.2d 980, 982, 21 CCPA 901, 904, 20 USPQ 321, 324 (1934) (\u201c[Wjork abroad might be important in determining the identity of the invention * * *.\")</p>\n<p id=\"b100-13\">Moreover, the Transmission Record document included, in an attachment, the infrared spectrum which, in this case, serves two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>functions: (1) it proves that the knowledge of the structure supplied by the inventors was correct; and (2) it corroborates the inventors\u2019 knowledge. As DeMarinis stated in his reply to Breuer\u2019s response to the Order to Show Cause: \u201cIt is well known that an infrared spectrum is considered a distinctive <em>fingerprint </em>for chemical compounds.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Bernstein declared that the infrared spectrum \u201ccontains the structure identifying peaks noted on the curve\u201d and that \u201cfrom the foregoing * * * I knew the structure of the compound.\u201d Lucania declared that the Transmission Record \u201cappeared to me to be consistent with the structure provided and also with the * * * infrared spectrum\u201d and that \u201cfrom these sources I understood the structure.\u201d Thus, Bernstein and Lucania declare that the infrared spectrum document is proof of the structure supplied by the inventors and that it also corroborates the inventors\u2019 knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">We have frequently stated that a \u201crule of reason\u201d approach is required in determining the type and amount of evidence necessary for corroboration. See <em>Mikus v. Wachtel, </em>542 F.2d 1157, 191 USPQ 571 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1976), and cases cited therein. This approach recognizes the realities of technical operations in modern day research laboratories. <em>Berry v. Webb, </em>412 F.2d 261, 56 CCPA 1272, 162 USPQ 170 (1969); <em>Hurwitz v. Poon, </em>364 F.2d 878, 53 CCPA 1502, 150 USPQ 676 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">The board would require proof <em>of a </em>second, domestic infrared analysis.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We deem this to be an unreasonable requirement under the circumstances of this case and in view of the realities of modern day research laboratories. Bernstein and Luca-nia, professional researchers vitally interested in the accuracy of the technical information, did not question the chemical structure supplied by the inventors after viewing the infrared spectrum, the \u201cfingerprint\u201d of the compound. If the professional researchers saw no reason to question the structure supplied by the inventors, as proved and corroborated by the infrared spectrum, then it would be <em>unreasonable </em>to require a second, domestic infrared analysis which would merely duplicate the infrared spectrum made abroad and sent here as an attachment to the Transmission Record. Thus, the declarations of Bernstein and Lu-cania, which specifically refer to the infrared spectrum, provide sufficient evidence to prove prima facie the fact that the compound introduced into the United States was Compound A.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">We are satisfied that Breuer has proved prima facie that the compound which was introduced into this country was Compound A and that Breuer met the requirements of Rule 204(c). Accordingly, the decision of the board awarding priority of invention by summary judgment to DeMarinis is <em>reversed </em>and the case is <em>remanded </em>for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-11\">\n<em>REVERSED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b95-21\">.
