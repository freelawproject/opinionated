For the reasons which follow, we vacate the entry of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">In late 1967 and early 1968, defendant, James Leffel &amp; Co., agreed to design, manufacture and install replacement turbines in generator units No. 2 and No. 3 at plaintiff\u2019s Snowden, Virginia hydroelectric plant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Installation of these turbines was completed in April, 1969.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Upon being placed into service, the turbine in unit No. 2 failed to perform satisfactorily; and, in November, 1972, it was discovered that the turbine in unit No. 3, which had appeared to be operating properly, was physically deteriorating. From the advent of these problems until March, 1975, defendant recommended and participated in various remedial measures.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These repair efforts were unsuccessful and plaintiff commenced this action on August 25, 1974,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> alleging breach of contract and warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular use.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">On defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the district court held that the action was barred by Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 8.2-725<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (UCC \u00a7 2-725) which, in pertinent part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-8\">(1) An action for breach of any contract for sale must be commenced within four years after the cause of action has accrued. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-9\">(2) A cause of action accrues when the breach occurs, regardless of the aggrieved party\u2019s lack of knowledge of the breach. A breach of warranty occurs when tender of delivery is made, except that where a warranty explicitly extends to future performance of the goods and discovery of the breach must await the time of such performance the cause of action accrues when the breach is or should have been discovered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-19\">(4) This section does not alter the law on tolling of the statute of limitations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-20\">The court reasoned that, under Section 8.2-725(2), the period of limitations ran from the installation of the turbines in 1969 and, consequently, expired in 1973, two years before suit was filed. It rejected plaintiff\u2019s contention that defendant\u2019s repair efforts had estopped it from pleading the statute of limitations as a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-21\">Plaintiff now renews that contention before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-22\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b289-23\">The four-year period prescribed by Section 8.2-725 is expressly subject to the law on tolling of the statute of limitations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, none of the Virginia tolling statutes <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> is applicable to this case, and Virginia apparently does not recognize any non-statutory basis for \u201ctolling\u201d the statute.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See Quackenbush </em>v. <em>Isley </em>(1930) 154 Va. 407, 153 S.E. 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-24\">But Virginia does recognize that the doctrine of equitable estoppel may pre-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>elude a defendant from raising expiration of the period of limitations as a defense. <em>E. g., Wilson v. Butt </em>(1937) 168 Va. 259, 190 S.E. 260 and <em>Sadler v. Marsden </em>(1933) 160 Va. 392, 168 S.E. 357. That doctrine has been described as \u201ca standard of fair dealing applied by the courts.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As applied to the statute of limitations, its central premise is that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-4\">one cannot justly or equitably lull his adversary into a false sense of security, and thereby cause his adversary to subject his claim to the bar of the statute [of limitations], and then be permitted to plead the very delay caused by his course of conduct as a defense to the action when brought.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The doctrine is, of course, most clearly applicable where the aggrieved party\u2019s delay in bringing suit was caused by his opponent\u2019s intentional misrepresentation;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> but deceit is not an essential element of estoppel. <em>T... v. T... </em>(1976) 216 Va. 867, 224 S.E.2d 148, 152, citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fidelity and Casualty Co. of New York </em>(4th Cir. 1986) 402 F.2d 893, 898. It is sufficient that the aggrieved party reasonably relied on the words and conduct of the person to be estopped in allowing the limitations period to expire. <em>See, e. g., T... v. T..., supra; United States v. Fidelity and Casualty Co. of New York, supra </em>at 897-98; <em>Bergeron v. Mansour </em>(1st Cir. 1945) 152 F.2d 27, 30-31; <em>id. </em>at 33 (concurring opinion of Magruder, J.); and <em>Howard v. West Jersey &amp; S. S. R. Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">While the Virginia courts have not considered the question, it seems clear that the principle of estoppel may be applicable where a vendor claims that defects in noncomplying goods can be corrected and attempts to do so. <em>Nowell v. Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company </em>(1959) 250 N.C. 575, 108 S.E.2d 889, and <em>Styron v. Loman-Gar-rett Supply Company </em>(1969) 6 N.C.App. 675, 171 S.E.2d 41. This follows because such conduct may lead the injured party to reasonably believe that it will receive satisfaction without resort to litigation. <em>Cf. de la Houssaye </em>v. <em>Star Chrysler, Inc. </em>(La.App. 1973) 284 So.2d 63; <em>Zahler </em>v. <em>Star Steel Supply Company, </em>(1973) 50 Mich.App. 386, 213 N.W.2d 269, 271-72 (dissenting opinion); <em>Southern California Enterprises v. D. N. &amp; E. Walter &amp; Co. </em>(1947) 78 Cal.App.2d 750, 178 P.2d 785; <em>and Louisville Silo &amp; Tank Co. v. Thweatt </em>(1927) 174 Ark. 437, 295 S.W. 710.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-12\">Defendant contends, however, that its conduct in this case could not have misled plaintiff because it gave no express assurances that the problems would ever be corrected. But one may be misled as much by implication as by express statement, and the record demonstrates that defendant coupled its remedial efforts with comments calculated to induce plaintiff to refrain from bringing suit. Thus, on June 30,1969, Mr. Groff, defendant\u2019s president and general manager, wrote: \u201cwe have never done business with finer people than you folks\u2014 or more cooperative \u2014 and keeping this spirit we certainly want to work this out to your very best possible advantage.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>on July 28, 1969, a letter from Mr. Groff acknowledged that \u201c[w]e do have a problem together\u201d and requested that plaintiff \u201c[p]lease bear with us as we are trying earnestly to be helpful and work this out to the good of all concerned.\u201d Similarly, in a memorandum dated December 11, 1973, Mr. Groff stated: \u201cWe conclude with the feeling that mutual consideration and forebearance is what we have tried to exhibit and will continue to do. We are sure we can expect the same on your part.\u201d On December 16, 1974, Mr. Groff, responding to a threat of litigation, wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-5\">Now legalities will not settle a matter like this \u2014 it is a question of mechanical stability, and proper adjustment . . [I]t is a matter of segregating out possibilities of trouble, and seeing if they cannot be cured. It shoud [sic] be well known that Leffel turbines of this type are installed in all parts of the country, . and this wheel is no exception other than getting it properly adjusted and oriented into position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6zP\">Your threat of litigation is not good common sense, that will not cure anything, . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-13\">[A] company cannot be in business as we have \u2014 and the length of time we have, . . . and not make good with their equipment ... So we have something, and it is just a question geared up together.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-15\">Clearly, the implication of these various statements was that defendant would eventually locate and eliminate the source of the problems with the turbines. Consequently, defendant cannot complain if plaintiff, relying on such statements, delayed the commencement of litigation for a reasonable time to allow it to do so.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> While the case may appear differently after discovery and a full hearing, the present record does not disclose admitted or otherwise established facts which conclusively refute plaintiff\u2019s assertion that it did, in fact, act in reliance on defendant\u2019s words and conduct; nor does it reveal undisputed facts which conclusively establish that such reliance was unreasonable either <em>ab initio </em>or in duration.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Therefore, defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment should have been denied.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Longo v. Pittsburgh and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number><em>Lake Erie Railroad Co., N. Y. C. Sys. </em>(3rd Cir. 1966) 355 F.2d 443, 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">For the reasons stated, the entry of summary judgment is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b289-10\">.

While the authorities cited deal with \u201ctolling\u201d of the statute of limitations, their reasoning is clearly based on notions of estoppel. <em>See, e. g., Zahler v. Star Steel Supply Company, supra, </em>50 Mich.App. 386, 213 N.W.2d 269 at 272:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-10\">The seller should not be permitted to lull a buyer into inaction by assurances that his merchandise will be repaired, and at the same time claim the benefit of the running of the statute of limitations.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b290-14\">. In the same vein, Mr. Sahle, defendant\u2019s chief engineer, wrote on June 5, 1973, that \u201c[W]e will do our utmost to help you in reference to the problem you are having.\u201d And, on November 21, 1973, Mr. Groff wrote, \u201cwe are not doing anything more than trying to find the root of the trouble . . . We want you happy and satisfied, and everything going good.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-16\">Defendant correctly observes that these and subsequent representations postdated the end of the four-year limitations period and, thus, could not have induced plaintiff to allow that period to expire. We think, however, that, the post-April, 1973, representations merely re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>peated (perhaps more emphatically and explicitly) that which had been implicit in earlier letters. In any event, those representations are clearly relevant to the reasonableness of plaintiffs delay during the period from June 1973 until August 1975 when suit was filed.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b291-9\">. In a follow-up letter dated December 24, 1974, Mr. Groff stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-10\">We do hope this can be worked out, and believe it can; because we believe altimate [sic] justice and truth lies [sic] in this whole situation. It\u2019s just a matter of getting things together and properly orient it [sic]. This is what we have been trying to do and would be glad to have your comment on the above [proposed remedial measures] in the same spirit of amicable attempt that we are trying to display. We have seen enough of the nonresults of war in the world today and it hasn\u2019t solved anything. Now certainly a thing like this can have some solution if we all put our shoulders to the wheel. We invite that to be done.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b291-11\">. See <em>Nowell v. Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company, supra, </em>108 S.E.2d at 891:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-12\">The appellant, by its promises, invited the delay and should not complain that the invitation was accepted.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b291-16\">. The district court stressed the fact that plaintiff was, at all relevant times, represented by counsel. However, plaintiff contends that it was misled on a matter of engineering and not on a matter of law. Consequently, as lawyers have no special expertise in engineering, we think that, in this case, the presence of counsel is of little relevance in determining whether plaintiff reasonably relied on the words and conduct of defendant. <em>United States v. Fidelity and Casualty Co. of New York, supra, </em>899-900.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b291-17\">. Our conclusion that this may be a proper case for application of the doctrine of equitable estoppel is bolstered by the fact that such application would in no way frustrate the purpose of the statute of limitations. \u201cStatutes of limitation are statutes of repose . . . designed to suppress fraudulent and stale claims from being asserted after a great lapse of time, to the surprise of the parties, when the evidence may( have been lost . . . .\u201d <em>Street v. Consumers Mining Corporation, </em>(1946) 185 Va. 561, 575, 39 S.E.2d 271, 277. A four-year period and \u201ctime of breach\u201d rule of UCC \u00a7 2-725 were designed \u201cto fix a reasonable time after which merchants and manufactur\u00e9is could destroy their records with respect to the manufacture and sale of an item without fear of being unable to defend against liabilities subsequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>asserted.\u201d <em>Engelman v. Eastern Light Co., Inc. </em>(1962) 30 Pa.D. &amp; C.2d 38, 1 UCC Rep. 187, 192. <em>See </em>UCC \u00a7 2-725, Draftsmen\u2019s Comment. However, where an item fails to perform satisfactorily immediately after the sale and the parties engage in extensive and continuing efforts to correct the malfunction, it is unlikely that the pertinent records will be destroyed. Certainly the vendor in such cases cannot claim to have been unfairly surprised when the buyer files suit after it becomes clear'that the repair efforts will not succeed.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-17\">Our conclusion is also reinforced by the belief that refusal to apply the doctrine in cases such as this may encourage premature resort to the courts. Where, as here, a product has been specially, designed to meet the buyer\u2019s requirements, \u201cstart-up\u201d problems are more likely than with more standardized goods. In most cases the manufacturer can correct such problems if given an opportunity to do so. However, a rule that the period of limitations runs from the date of delivery regardless of any repair efforts by the seller would tend to discourage the buyer from providing him that opportunity. In this day of crowded court dockets, <em>reasonable </em>patience should be encouraged in such cases, not discouraged.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
