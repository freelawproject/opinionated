Rath Packing Co., </em>430 U.S. 519, 97 S.Ct. 1305, 51 L.Ed.2d 604 (1977), only two days before our opinion was issued in this case, appellee landlords and federal intervenors petitioned for rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">There is some force in petitioners\u2019 argument. The Court in <em>Rath </em>cited, to illustrate the standard it was applying, some of the older cases indicating a more relaxed and preemption-oriented approach to balancing state and federal interests. <em>See Rath, supra, </em>at 526, 97 S.Ct. 1305, <em>citing Hines v. Davidowitz, </em>312 U.S. 52, 61 S.Ct. 399, 85 L.Ed. 581 (1940) and <em>Perez v. Campbell, </em>402 U.S. 637, 91 S.Ct. 1704, 29 L.Ed.2d 233 (1971). It made no reference to the four recent cases we relied on as calling for a stronger showing of conflict between federal and local laws before finding federal preemption. <em>Goldstein v. California, </em>412 U.S. 546, 93 S.Ct. 2303, 37 L.Ed.2d 163 (1973); <em>New York State Department of Social Services v. Dublino, </em>413 U.S. 405, 93 S.Ct. 2507, 37 L.Ed.2d 688 (1973); <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. v. Ware, </em>414 U.S. 117, 94 S.Ct. 383, 38 L.Ed.2d 348 (1973); <em>Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corp., </em>416 U.S. 470, 94 S.Ct. 1879, 40 L.Ed.2d 315 (1974). Petitioners also argue that \u201cthe delay and fractiousness inherent in the Boston Rent Control process\u201d bring it squarely within the <em>Hines </em>conflict test adopted in <em>Rath, </em>since it \u201c \u2018stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress\u2019 \u201d. <em>Rath, supra, </em>430 U.S. at 526, 97 S.Ct. at 1309, <em>quoting Hines v. Davidowitz, supra, </em>312 U.S. at 67, 61 S.Ct. 399.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">Accepting petitioners\u2019 argument would require us to assume that the Court in <em>Rath </em>was rejecting, without discussion, the mor\u00e9 delicate balancing of local and federal interests which it has recently found appropriate when the federal interest was not \u201cnecessarily national in import\u201d, <em>Goldstein v. California, supra, </em>412 U.S. at 554, 93 S.Ct. 2303, and its stated preference for reconciling \u201c \u2018the operation of both statutory schemes with one another rather than holding one completely ousted.\u2019 \u201d <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. v. </em>Ware, <em>supra, </em>414 U.S. at 127, 94 S.Ct. at 390, quoting <em>Silver v. New York Stock Exchange, </em>373 U.S. 341, 357, 83 S.Ct. 1246, 10 L.Ed.2d 389 (1963). <em>See also Dublino </em>and <em>Kewanee, </em>both <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">We would assume such an unarticulated change of position only if there were no other way in which to read <em>Rath. </em>We conclude, however, that <em>Rath </em>does not undermine our reading of the cases cited in our opinion. First, it is obvious that the majority of the Court in <em>Rath </em>felt that it was dealing with a national scheme which, like the system for alien registration in <em>Hines v. Davidowitz, </em>required uniformity in order to achieve its primary purpose. In <em>Rath </em>the subject of federal regulation, food package labeling, was deemed by the majority to require national uniformity to carry out one of the principal purposes of the law, value comparisons of similar products by consumers. The .Court, on the basis of its view of the record, concluded that if the state scheme were allowed to operate, \u201cconsumers throughout the country who attempted to compare the value of identically labeled packages of flour would not be comparing packages which contained identical amounts of flour solids.\u201d 430 U.S. at 543, 97 S.Ct. at 1318.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">We therefore interpret <em>Rath </em>as a decision which, once it identified the federal purpose requiring uniformity, was concerned only with the disparities introduced by state law. Since no state interest could justify distortion of the necessary national uniformity, there was no basis for weighing state interests. By contrast, in the instant case, absent a national policy decision by HUD, we deal with the federal interests of inducing entrepreneurs to enter the field of low and middle income housing and of avoiding financial loss on federal guarantees \u2014 interests which do not necessarily require national uniformity and indeed have been deemed by HUD up to the time of its regulation, 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 403.9, to be compatible with local rent control.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>We also see some internal indicia that <em>Bath </em>was not intended to disapprove the recent interest balancing cases. The Court, in citing to the <em>Hines v. Davidowitz </em>standard, whether the state\u2019s law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the full purposes and objectives of Congress, at 526, 97 S.Ct. 1305, 1309, also cited <em>De Canas v. Bica, </em>424 U.S. 351, 363, 96 S.Ct. 933, 47 L.Ed.2d 43 (1976). This case, which eluded us in our earlier research, is one in the company of the four others we relied upon. In Parts I and II of the opinion the Court refused to find a constitutional or statutory preemption of state legislation merely because of \u201csome purely speculative and indirect impact on immigration\u201d, <em>id. </em>at 355, 96 S.Ct. at 936, and in Part III it manifested concern to find out how the state law was interpreted and applied before deeming it \u201can obstacle\u201d to the purposes of Congress, <em>id. </em>at 363, 96 S.Ct. 933. Particularly suggestive is the Court\u2019s explanation of its approach to identifying impermissible federal-state conflict at 424 U.S. 357-58 n. 5, 96 S.Ct. 937 n. 5, where it said in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-4\">Of course, even absent such a manifestation of congressional intent to \u201coccupy the field,\u201d the Supremacy Clause requires the invalidation of any state legislation that burdens or conflicts in any manner with any federal laws or treaties. See Part III, <em>infra. </em>However, \u201cconflicting law, absent repealing or exclusivity provisions, should be pre-empted \u2018only to the extent necessary to protect the achievement of the aims of\u2019 \u201d the federal law, since \u201cthe proper approach is to reconcile \u2018the operation of both statutory schemes with one another rather than holding [the state scheme] completely ousted.\u2019 \u201d <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith v. </em>Ware, 414 U.S. 117, 127, 94 S.Ct. 383, 389, 38 L.Ed.2d 348 (1973), quoting <em>Silver v. New York Stock Exchange, </em>373 U.S. 341, 361, 357 [, 83 S.Ct. 1246, 1259, 10 L.Ed.2d 389] (1963).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">We are therefore not persuaded that we erred in our prior opinion and deny the petition for rehearing.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b686-6\">CAMPBELL, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AxP\">(concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">As indicated in my concurring opinion, I see this less as a question of preemption than as of statutory construction. Preemption cases normally involve statutes which are silent on the precise issue, and a court has to struggle with what is implied. Here, however, I think Congress has expressly delegated to HUD the authority to accept or reject local rent control. Since HUD acquiesced during the period in question, I agree with the court\u2019s result. Given my own view of the issues, the doctrinal underpinnings of the ongoing preemption cases seem less important than they do to my brethren, and I do not necessarily agree (nor do I necessarily disagree) with what is said in that regard.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
