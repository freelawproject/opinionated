Godshall. Defendants agreed that that sum was due on the note, but they assert that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1819. We disagree. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-11\">The note on which suit was brought was executed and delivered by defendants to American Bank &amp; Trust Company (Bank). To show how FDIC became the holder and to set forth the facts relating to the question concerning the district court\u2019s jurisdiction, it is necessary to state the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b293-16\">Bank was closed on September 20, 1974 by order of the South Carolina State Board of Bank Control upon its determination that Bank was unable to meet the demands of its depositors. Bank\u2019s deposits were insured by FDIC, a corporation created by and existing under an Act of Congress,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> having the primary function of \u201cstabilizing or promoting the stability of banks\u201d by providing deposit insurance. <em>Doherty v. United States, </em>94 F.2d 495, 497 (8 Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>303 U.S. 658, 58 S.Ct. 763, 82 L.Ed. 1117 (1938). The State Board of Bank Control tendered to FDIC appointment as receiver for Bank.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> FDIC accepted the tender, became receiver for Bank, and began performance of its duties.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-17\">To meet the demands of Bank\u2019s depositors, and to prevent the disruption of vital business, FDIC immediately took the following steps: FDIC, as receiver, sold certain assets of Bank to Southern Bank &amp; Trust Co. (Southern). These assets consisted of cash, currency, receivables due from other banks, government securities, and other items of established value. In return, Southern agreed to assume nearly all of Bank\u2019s liabilities (including obligations to depositors), and to reopen Bank\u2019s offices under Southern\u2019s name. FDIC, as receiver, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>agreed to pay Southern cash in an amount equal to the difference between the value of the assets Southern purchased and the amount of the liabilities Southern assumed. To raise that cash, FDIC, as receiver, sold the remainder of Bank\u2019s assets to itself, in its general corporate capacity, and FDIC, in its general corporate capacity, paid itself, as receiver, the cash needed to consummate the original transaction with Southern.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> FDIC also agreed that if, in the liquidation of the assets it purchased, it realized more than the purchase price, the costs of liquidation, reimbursement for another potential liability it had assumed, and a reasonable return, it would pay such \u201cexcess recoveries\u201d to itself, as receiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">The note given by defendants to Bank was among the assets which FDIC purchased from itself, as receiver. In order to replenish the cash it had expended,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> FDIC undertook collection of the assets it had acquired. <em>Inter alia, </em>it brought suit upon the note in the district court. Despite a contrary initial ruling, the district court found that it had jurisdiction over the claim and granted summary judgment in favor of FDIC in the amount that the parties agree was due. Defendants appeal, asserting only that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Defendants rely primarily upon 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1819, the statute which governs FDIC\u2019s ability to sue and be sued in federal court. The statute, after conferring upon FDIC the power to sue and be sued, complain and defend in any court of law and equity, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-11\">All suits of a civil nature at common law or in equity to which the Corporation shall be a party shall be deemed to arise under the laws of the United States, and the United States district courts shall have original jurisdiction thereof without regard to the amount in controversy except that any such suit to which the Corporation is a party in its capacity as receiver of a State bank and which involves only the rights or obligations of depositors, creditors, stockholders, and such State bank under State law shall not be deemed to arise under the laws of the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-12\">12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1819. Defendants argue that by bringing suit upon the note (1) FDIC continues to act as receiver of Bank, a state bank, and (2) FDIC raises legal issues which pertain solely to the \u201crights or obligations\u201d of Bank\u2019s depositors, creditors or stockholders under state law. Extrapolating from the language of \u00a7 1819, defendants conclude that the action upon the note does not arise under the laws of the United States and must be brought in state court. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-13\">In the instant lawsuit, FDIC acted in its general corporate capacity and not as receiver for Bank. This conclusion flows from an analysis of the purchase agreement, whereby FDIC bought the note. The agreement clearly indicates that FDIC acquired the note in its corporate capacity, or as an ordinary purchaser for value.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>FDIC\u2019s capacity as purchaser does not change merely because FDIC, as receiver for Bank, also acted as seller. The federal courts have recognized that FDIC may often act in two capacities simultaneously: as receiver of a bank and as an insurance corporation. <em>Freeling </em>v. <em>Sebring, </em>296 F.2d 244, 245 (10 Cir. 1961). Under the facts in the instant case, the dichotomy is clear. FDIC sold the note as receiver for Bank,but purchased it in its general corporate capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">Quite apart from the purchase agreement, there are other indications that FDIC, as plaintiff, does not act as receiver for Bank. As an example, any recovery upon the note would flow to FDIC\u2019s corporate treasury and not to the receivership estate. The latter result would have been dictated had FDIC continued to function as receiver when the suit was filed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In sum, therefore, FDIC cannot be said to act as receiver in this context.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Turning to the second argument advanced by the defendants, we conclude that the instant lawsuit, taken to collect the note, does not raise issues concerning <em>only </em>the \u201crights or obligations\u201d of Bank\u2019s depositors, creditors or stockholders under state law. The financial impact resulting from the success or failure of the lawsuit is almost solely on FDIC. If no recovery were realized, FDIC would bear the entire loss of what it paid for the note; Bank\u2019s depositors, creditors and stockholders would be unaffected. Only if recovery is realized and it, together with all other recoveries, amounts to an \u201cexcess recovery\u201d would Bank\u2019s creditors and stockholders be benefited. But even then, the benefit to them would be secondary to the benefit to FDIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-12\">For these reasons, we think that defendants have failed to establish the two requirements for ousting federal jurisdiction under \u00a7 1819: (1) that FDIC, by bringing the instant lawsuit, continues to act as receiver of Bank, and (2) that the lawsuit raises questions pertaining solely to the \u201crights or obligations\u201d of Bank\u2019s depositors, creditors or stockholders under state law. . The district court correctly ruled that it had jurisdiction to consider the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b293-13\">. <em>See </em>the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Act, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1811, <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b293-14\">. The tender was made pursuant to S.C.Code \u00a7 8-273 (1962), which provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ayl-dedup-0\">[t]he Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation may, with the approval of the State Board of Bank Control, be and act without bond as receiver or liquidator of any banking institution the deposits in which are to any extent insured by the Corporation and which shall have been closed on account of inability to meet the demands of its depositors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-15\">The State Board of Bank Control may, in the event of such closing, tender to the Corporation the appointment as receiver or liquidator of such banking institution, and, if the Corporation accepts such appointment, it shall have all the powers and privileges provided by the laws of this State with respect to a receiver or liquidator of a banking institution, its depositors and other creditors and be subject to all the duties of such receiver or liquidator.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-19\">Since (as the text notes) Bank\u2019s deposits were insured by FDIC, and Bank was closed on account of inability to meet the demands of its depositors, the tender was fully authorized.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b293-20\">. Although primarily an insurer, FDIC is also empowered to act as receiver of an insured state bank, if such bank is \u201cclosed ... on account of inability to meet the demands of its depositors, . . [and an] appointment [to act as receiver] is tendered by the authority having supervision of such bank and is authorized or permitted by state law.\u201d 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821(e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b294-7\">. FDIC is expressly empowered to purchase assets from the receivers of insured state banks, when such banks are closed because of inability to meet the demands of depositors. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1823(d). The sale must be approved by the appropriate state authority or court. FDIC refers to these transactions as \u201cspecial purchases.\u201d A \u201cspecial purchase\u201d is traditionally used to generate cash for the receivership (which, in turn, is used to fully compensate a solvent bank for assuming the liabilities of the distressed bank.) See Annual Report of the FDIC for the Year Ending December 31, 1958, at pp. 88-89.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-9\">Ordinarily, the assets are purchased from a third party acting as the distressed bank\u2019s receiver. However, a situation may arise where FDIC finds itself on both sides of the transaction. This is because FDIC is authorized and does act as receiver for insured state banks. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821(e), discussed in note 2, <em>supra. </em>When this occurs, FDIC sells the assets as a receiver and purchases them as a corporation.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b294-15\">. According to the affidavit of Donald J. Lubitz, FDIC Liquidator-at-Large, FDIC expended some $53,600,000.00 in the transactions described in the text.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b294-16\">. The agreement recited that it was by and between \u201cFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Receiver of [Bank] (the \u2018Receiver\u2019), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>corporation created and existing under an Act of Congress . . . (the \u2018Corporation\u2019).\u201d The agreement was signed by FDIC as \u201cReceiver of American Bank &amp; Trust\u201d and by FDIC, without designation. The operative language of the agreement was \u201c[t]he Receiver does hereby sell ... to the Corporation all of the Receiver\u2019s right, title and interest in certain assets not purchased by [Southern].\u201d The note in suit was an asset of Bank not purchased by Southern.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b295-8\">. Despite the fact that any recovery would flow directly to FDIC\u2019s corporate treasury, defendants continue to insist that the receivership estate would derive a benefit from the lawsuit. Defendants hypothesize that a successful lawsuit, coupled with the liquidation of all other acquired assets, would produce \u201cexcess recovery.\u201d Even if we assume the likelihood of any payback, we think that the \u201cexcess recovery\u201d provision merely reflects a recognition that FDIC was not intended to operate as a profit-making venture but as a public service. Therefore, we do not believe that the \u201cexcess recovery\u201d provision has any appreciable effect on the characterization of this lawsuit. The suit continues to be for the benefit of FDIC as a corporation and not as receiver for Bank.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b295-16\">. We note that one federal district court has recently addressed this issue; i. e., whether FDIC, by bringing such an action, is continuing to act as receiver for an insured state bank. <em>FDIC </em>v. <em>Ashley, </em>408 F.Supp. 591 (E.D.Mich.), <em>appeal docketed, </em>No. 76-2416 (6 Cir. 1976). The <em>Ashley </em>court concluded that FDIC continues to act as a receiver. We are not persuaded and decline to follow its reasoning.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
