Johnson was convicted on three counts of making and subscribing false and fraudulent corporate income tax returns for two corporations which he controlled. Title 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206(1) (1970). In appealing his conviction he has raised 14 arguments in favor of reversal. We find none of them meritorious and affirm. Two of the points raised on appeal warrant comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-17\">Both the original indictment and a superseding indictment to which Johnson pleaded not guilty and went to trial contained seven counts charging violations of law as to income taxes. Counts I and III charged him with income tax evasion on his Individual Income Tax Returns, Forms 1040, for calendar years 1971 and 1972, in violation of Title 26, U.S.C. \u00a7 7201. Counts II and IV charged him with making false and fraudulent statements on his Individual Income Tax Returns for the same years, in violation of Title 26, U.S.C. \u00a7 7206(1). Counts V, VI and VII, on which Johnson was convicted, charged him with making and subscribing false and fraudulent corporate income tax returns, of corporations controlled by him, in violation of Title 26, U.S.C. \u00a7 7206(1). Prior to trial, on motion of the United States, the district court dismissed Counts I, II and III, thus removing the issue of tax evasion from the trial. The jury acquitted appellant as to Count IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-18\">Many of Johnson\u2019s objections to the fairness of his trial stem from the dismissal of the tax evasion charges because, he contends, he was thereby prevented from introducing evidence to establish that, during the period in question, he actually overpaid his taxes by neglecting to make permissible deductions. Because he was tried only for wilfully making false statements on his and his corporations\u2019 tax returns, his tax liability or overpayment was irrelevant. Johnson maintains that he was prejudiced because evidence submitted by the government led the jury to believe that he had underpaid his taxes and the trial judge would not allow him to counter this suggestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>The irrelevancy of Johnson\u2019s alleged overpayment of tax to any issue at his trial is firmly established by cases in this and other Circuits. We held the following in <em>Schepps v. United States, </em>395 F.2d 749 (5th Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 925, 89 S.Ct. 256, 21 L.Ed.2d 261:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-4\">The appellant has been found guilty, in two counts, of violating 26 U.S.C., \u00a7 7206(1), wilfully making and subscribing a federal income tax return which he did not believe to be true and correct as to every material matter. That the return was false in certain particulars is not disputed. Although not charged with nor being tried for income tax evasion, appellant says that he should have been allowed to introduce proof showing that the falsity resulted in no tax deficiency. This proof was not relevant to the issue raised by the indictment and it was not error to reject it, <em>Siravo v. United States, </em>1 Cir., 1967, 377 F.2d 469; <em>Silverstein v. United States, </em>1 Cir., 1967, 377 F.2d 269; <em>Hoover v. United States, </em>5 Cir., 1966, 358 F.2d 87, 89, cert. denied, 385 U.S. 822, 87 S.Ct. 50, 17 L.Ed.2d 59.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">See also <em>United States v. Fritz, </em>481 F.2d 644 (9th Cir. 1973); <em>United States v. Jernigan, </em>411 F.2d 471 (5th Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 927, 90 S.Ct. 262, 24 L.Ed.2d 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">These precedents notwithstanding, Johnson raises two objections to the district court\u2019s refusal to allow evidence of income tax overpayment. First, Johnson contends that such evidence was relevant in his case to the issue of whether he in good faith relied on his accountants properly to compute and classify reportable items of income and expense. He argues that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-7\">Had the appellant not left the accounting procedures to his accountants and trusted their computations, surely some of the deductible items which would have reduced Appellant\u2019s tax liability would have been picked up by him when he examined his returns.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">Brief for Appellant at 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-9\">We agree that the failure to make permissible deductions, resulting in a tax overpayment, logically tends to prove reliance on the integrity and expertise of one\u2019s accountants. Although this evidence might thus have aided the reliance aspect of Johnson\u2019s defense, it could have had no appreciable impact on the case as a whole because much of the prosecution\u2019s evidence demonstrated that Johnson withheld relevant information from his accountants. Under these circumstances, Johnson\u2019s alleged reliance on his accountants is irrelevant. Cf. <em>United States v. Signer, </em>482 F.2d 394, 398 (6th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-12\">Even if we assume that reliance evidence is logically relevant to any issue in the case, our inquiry cannot end there. Under Federal Rule of Evidence 403, admissibility is predicated on more than mere logical relevance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-13\">Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b818-14\">In determining legal relevance, the trial judge has broad discretion. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>522 F.2d 1068, 1079 (9th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1049, 96 S.Ct. 775, 46 L.Ed.2d 637 (1976). We may not disturb his ruling unless he has clearly abused his discretion. <em>United States v. Dwyer, </em>539 F.2d 924, 927 (2d Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-15\">No showing of abuse of discretion has been made here. Where reliance on the accountants was relevant, the district court allowed direct evidence on that point. Because it depends on a series of inferences, however, evidence of neglected deductions is only indirectly probative of reliance. Moreover, it carries several risks against which Rule 403 was designed to protect. It could have resulted in unfair prejudice to the government\u2019s case by appealing to the emotions of the jury. Indeed, the conduct of Johnson\u2019s counsel during the trial made this no small concern of the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>Also, the danger of confusing the issues was great because tax liability was irrelevant to the offenses for which Johnson was tried. Finally, presenting evidence of overpayment could have resulted in a waste of time on collateral issues. See 1st Supp.Record, Vol. III, at 308. We conclude that the district court properly excluded evidence of neglected tax deductions.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">Johnson\u2019s second contention in this regard is that the district court erred in overruling his motion for a mistrial when the prosecutor, in his closing argument, implied a tax liability on Johnson\u2019s part. Specifically, Johnson objected to the prosecutor\u2019s statements that improper business deductions were made \u201cat the expense of the taxpayers of this country\u201d. See Tr.Pros. Arg. at 22. We do not agree that this expression implies a tax liability. But, however it is interpreted, any prejudicial effect that it might have had was cured by the district court\u2019s instruction to the jury: whether \u201ca tax is due or owing by the defendant is immaterial to the charges before you in this case\u201d. The instruction continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-10\">Accordingly, whether the Government has or has not suffered a pecuniary or monetary loss as a result of the alleged false return is not relevant and need not be considered by you in your deliberation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-11\">We have carefully examined Johnson\u2019s 12 other allegations of error and find them to be without merit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-12\">During oral argument, counsel for appellant stressed <em>United States v. Schilleci, </em>545 F.2d 519 (5th Cir. 1977) as his strongest point. In <em>Schilleci </em>we held that, on the \u201cunique factual situation presented\u201d, the combined effect of several errors required reversal of the convictions, even though none of the errors standing alone constituted grounds for reversal. <em>Id. </em>at 526. Because we have found no error in the instant case, <em>Schilleci, </em>with its emphasis on cumulative error, is not pertinent.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>The judgment of conviction appealed . from is</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b818-10\">. The district court repeatedly admonished Johnson\u2019s counsel for appealing to the sympathy of the jury in a manner unrelated to the merits of the case. The Court at one point <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>sustained an objection to an attempt to elicit from Mr. Johnson information about his contributions to a religious school: \u201cCounsel, I think you well know that attempts to evoke sympathy on the basis of religious activities is wholly improper to the merits of this case. You have repeatedly gone into this, notwithstanding the Court\u2019s rulings.\u201d. 1st Supp.Record Vol. IV, at 251. In his closing argument, Johnson\u2019s counsel noted that his client had gone to war for his government, \u201csubjected himself to the enemy\u2019s bullets\u201d, and that now the same government had turned his life \u201cinto a nightmare\u201d. <em>Id, </em>Vol. V, at 46. The district court was moved to comment to Johnson\u2019s counsel: \u201cyou were able to turn tears on and off like a faucet during your closing argument ... if there can be such a thing as erudition in tears, you certainly displayed it\u201d. <em>Id </em>at 163, 165. This comment occurred during the argument of post-trial motions, and thus <em>not </em>in the jury\u2019s presence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b819-7\">. 1st Supp.Record, Vol. V, at 103. We note also that in his closing argument Johnson\u2019s counsel stated: \u201cBut bear in mind, this case is not about any taxes that are alleged to be due by Mr. Johnson. No claim, you read these indictments, there is no claim for any amount of taxes\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 41.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b819-8\">. These assignments of error are as follows: (1) The trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion for pretrial discovery of corporate employees\u2019 and fiduciaries\u2019 grand jury testimony; (2) The trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss the superseding indictment; (3)The trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion for a temporary restraining order and permanent injunction against conducting an I.R.S. survey of prospective jurors; (4) The trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion to quash the general venire, to dismiss the indictment, and to proffer evidence in support of the motion [We had already decided this issue in <em>United States v.
