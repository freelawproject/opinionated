We reverse on the ground that the Government, to which the employees had voluntarily assigned their compensation claims, was by subrogation entitled to reimbursement for the expense of medical service furnished the employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-20\">The facts of the two cases are similar. In both cases, veteran-employees, who worked as sandblasters for respondent Bender Welding &amp; Machine Company, a maritime employer subject to the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, were hospitalized in V.A. hospitals for treatment of job-related non-service-connected disabilities. Both singed statements prior to admission verifying that they were veterans and were \u201cunable to defray the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>expenses of necessary hospital care.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Upon subsequent discovery of each employee\u2019s eligibility for compensation benefits, the hospital billed the employees for the cost of medical care, and took from both assignments of their medical expense recovery rights under the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">It is undisputed that the Longshoremen\u2019s Act imposes a duty upon the employers to pay the reasonable cost of medical care furnished to the employees for these job-related disabilities or injuries. 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 901(a), 907(a). Had the medical care been furnished by non-Veterans Administration hospitals, there would presumably be no resistance to payment therefor by the employers or their insurance carriers. Recovery was denied simply because the expenses would have been paid to the Veterans Administration, which provided the care that would have otherwise been provided by \u201ccompensable\u201d hospitals.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">The fundamental point which controls this decision is whether Congress, in establishing the criteria for veterans\u2019 hospital care by the Government, has authorized the Veterans Administration to recover for such services from a workmen\u2019s compensation carrier. Although no legislation specifically answers this question, an appropriate understanding of the Veterans\u2019 Benefits Act as juxtaposed against the purpose and provisions of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act leads to the conclusion that recovery is authorized. The key to the decision is an appreciation of the fact that the Veterans Administration is not required to provide free medical care to a veteran unless \u201c[he] is unable to defray the expenses of necessary hospital care.\u201d If compensation coverage is treated as giving an employee the ability to defray expenses, it necessarily follows that medical services need not have been rendered by the Government without charge. If the services provided by the Veterans Hospital are not free, they would become a proper obligation of the compensation carrier to the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-15\">The Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act has as its general purpose the distribution of economic loss sustained by employees and their de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>pendents as a result of personal injuries incurred in the course of employment to the industries and ultimately to the consuming public served by such employees. <em>West Penn Sand &amp; Gravel Co. </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>95 F.2d 498 (3d Cir. 1938). <em>See also </em>H.R.Rep.No. 1441, 92d Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>[1972] U. S.Code Cong. <em>&amp; </em>Admin.News, pp. 4698, 4699. Although the compensation carrier would not be liable for any free services rendered the employee, it must pay for services which were not free.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">The relevant Veterans\u2019 Benefits Act authorizes the Veterans Administration to provide hospital care to \u201cany veteran for non-service-connected disability if [he] is unable to defray the expenses of necessary hospital or nursing home care.\u201d Veterans Health Care Expansion Act of 1973, P.L. 93-82, \u00a7 102, 87 Stat. 179 (current version at 38 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 610(a)(1)(B) (Supp.1977)). Pursuant to the Veterans\u2019 Benefits Act of 1957, P.L. 85-56, \u00a7 521, 71 Stat. 113 (current version at 38 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 621 (Supp.1977)), the Administrator has promulgated regulations which state that persons admitted to a V. A. hospital on this basis, who are entitled to reimbursement for medical care by reason of a state or federal workmen\u2019s compensation statute, will not be furnished medical care without charge to the extent that they are entitled to reimbursement. 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 17.48(d) (1976).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Act fulfills a congressional purpose of providing free hospital services to veterans who have suffered non-service-connected disabilities and who are unable to pay for hospital care, in consideration for their prior service to their country. To include veterans legally entitled to the provisions of hospital care by third parties would be inconsistent with Congress\u2019s exclusion of those veterans who would otherwise be able to \u201cdefray the expense\u201d of hospital care.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-13\">Nothing in the Veterans\u2019 Benefits Act indicates that Congress intended to relieve an employer of his statutory responsibility for providing medical treatment to his injured employees. <em>See Marshall v. Rebert\u2019s Poultry Ranch &amp; Egg Sales, </em>268 N.C. 233, 150 S.E.2d 423 (1966). The wisdom of this plan is apparent. To allow a compensation carrier to escape liability merely because the injured employee was a veteran treated at a V.A. hospital, rather than a private hospital, would be a windfall to the carrier, which has been paid a premium by the employer to cover this employee. The V.A. hospital has incurred expenses in treating the employee whom it was not obligated to treat, and should not have to absorb that cost. Charging a veteran for the medical care costs that he is entitled to receive from a workmen\u2019s compensation carrier violates the purpose of neither statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-14\">Where the Veterans Administration has taken a voluntary assignment of a veteran-employee\u2019s compensation claim, as prescribed by the regulations, 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 17.-48, it is entitled to recover the medical care cost as a subrogee of the employee\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-15\">This holding is consistent with this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Pennsylvania National Mut. Cas. Ins. Co. v. Barnett, </em>445 F.2d 573 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>(5th Cir. 1971). There we sustained the workmen\u2019s compensation insurance carrier\u2019s position that the V.A. hospital\u2019s recovery for medical treatment rendered an injured employee was, by regulation, conditioned upon the procurement of an assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Although we need not address the third-party beneficiary claims of the Government, we note the analogy between this decision and the third-party beneficiary cases in which the Government has been allowed reimbursement from a liability insurer for the cost of medical care provided to an injured veteran. <em>See., e. g., United States v. Automobile Club Ins. Co., </em>522 F.2d 1 (5th Cir. 1975); <em>United States v. United Services Automobile Ass\u2019n, </em>431 F.2d 735 (5th Cir. 1970); <em>United States v. Government Employees Ins. Co., </em>461 F.2d 58 (4th Cir. 1972); <em>United States v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co., </em>455 F.2d 789 (10th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\"><em>United States v. Standard Oil of California, </em>322 U.S. 301, 67 S.Ct. 1604, 91 L.Ed. 2067 (1947), was not a subrogation case, and reliance on the denial of recovery to the Government in that case is misplaced. In <em>Standard Oil </em>the Supreme Court held that, in the absence of legislation providing a right of recovery, the Government could not recover from a tort-feasor amounts expended for an injured soldier\u2019s hospitalization and for his compensation paid during disability. The injured soldier had previously accepted payment from the tort-feasor\u2019s insurer and executed a release. The case dealt only with the Government\u2019s independent right of recovery against the tort-feasor. The Court noted expressly</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aui-dedup-0\">[t]he Government\u2019s claim, of course, is not one for subrogation. It is rather for an independent liability owing directly to itself as for deprivation of the soldier\u2019s services and \u201cindemnity\u201d for losses caused in discharging its duty to care for him consequent upon the injuries inflicted by appellants. ... It is, in effect, for tortious interference by a third person with the relation between the Government and the soldier and consequent harm to the Government\u2019s interest, rights and obligations in that relation, not simply to subrogation to the soldier\u2019s rights against the tort-feasors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-9\">332 U.S. at 304 n. 5, 67 S.Ct. at 1606 (citation omitted). Here the Government seeks no independent right of recovery, but only subrogation through voluntary assignments to the rights of the injured veteran-employees. There is no chance of double liability, as was the case in <em>Standard Oil. </em>The assignments operate to divest the veteran-employees of any rights they might have for the hospital cost and medical care. <em>See United States v. Kirkland, </em>405 F.Supp. 1024 (E.D.Tenn., 1976). <em>Standard Oil </em>does not preclude the Government\u2019s subrogation to a veteran-employee\u2019s rights for workmen\u2019s compensation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b837-10\">In both of these cases, defendants seek to dismiss the petitions for review on the ground that the Government was not a proper party to seek review of the Board\u2019s decision because it did not participate in the proceedings before the Administrative Law Judge or the Benefits Review Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>The Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 921(c) (Supp.1977), provides that \u201c[a]ny person adversely affected or aggrieved by a final order of the Board may obtain a review of that order in the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the injury occurred . . . .\u201d The statute speaks not in terms of \u201cparties\u201d but in terms of \u201cperson[s] adversely affected or aggrieved.\u201d The Government was aggrieved by the Board\u2019s ruling which expressly held that neither the employee nor the Veterans Administration was permitted to recover the costs of care furnished by the V.A. hospital. With respect to the employee\u2019s claim for costs incurred at the V.A. hospital, the Government was in fact the real party in interest. The claimant himself had nothing to gain or lose by the Board\u2019s decision as to these costs, for he was required to pay the Veterans Administration only to the extent he was entitled to reimbursement by reason of workmen\u2019s compensation. 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 17.48(d) (1976). Only the Veterans Administration and the compensation carrier were affected by the decision. This is unlike a situation where an employee incurred costs for which he would be liable to the hospital whether or not he could recover from the compensation carrier. Under these circumstances, the Government was a \u201cperson adversely affected or aggrieved\u201d by the Board\u2019s order and has standing to petition for review in this Court. The motion to dismiss is therefore denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">The judgments of the Benefits Review Board are reversed, and the cases are remanded for entry of awards in favor of the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b835-7\">.

It is noted that Congress responded to <em>Standard Oil </em>by enacting the Medical Care Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2651. <em>See </em>S.Rep.No. 1945, 87th Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted </em>in [1962] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News, 2637, 2637-2639. That Act allows the United States to recover from a tort-feasor the reasonable value of care furnished to an injured soldier or veteran. The statute further provides that the Government shall be subrogated to any right or claim that the individual shall have against the tort-feasor to the extent of that right or claim. Although the statute is limited in operation to tort claims, <em>see Pennsylvania National Ins. Co. v. Barnett, </em>445 F.2d 573 (5th Cir. 1971), and is inapplicable to the instant case, it does indicate a congressional policy favoring recovery by the Government through subrogation to the rights of the injured person in damages for the care and treatment furnished. <em>Id. </em>at 2640-2641.
