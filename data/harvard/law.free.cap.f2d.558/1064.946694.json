Masciarelli in Bing-hampton, New York. The order, designated MP-16, stated that there was probable cause to believe that the phone was being used \u201cin violation of Article 225 of the Penal Law of the State of New York and thereby in violation of Section 1955 of Title 18\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and in violation of the conspiracy statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. MP-16 authorized wire interceptions relating to these gambling offenses for a maximum of 15 days and required the government to provide fifth and tenth day reports to the court pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-14\">During the first five days of the wiretap, the government intercepted a total of 283 calls, of which 275 were related to operation of a gambling business. One intercepted conversation was between defendant Lawrence Schultz in Akron, Ohio, and defendant Masciarelli (using the alias Ray Mills) in Binghamton, in which Masciarelli agreed to purchase from Schultz \u201cline\u201d information used for the purpose of setting \u201cpoint spreads\u201d in sports betting. The government summarized this conversation, noting the location of each of the parties,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in its Fifth Day Report to Judge Port, who thereupon approved continuation of the wiretap.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-15\">After being presented with tapes of the intercepted conversations, a federal grand jury on November 18, 1974, handed down one indictment charging Masciarelli and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1066\">*1066</page-number>nine others with operating a gambling business in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1955, and another indictment charging Masciarelli and Schultz with interstate transmission of wagering information in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1084.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Masciarelli and Schultz moved to dismiss the \u00a7 1084 indictment on the grounds that the interstate conversation, although it related to a violation of \u00a7 1955 as specified in the court\u2019s order, related to a violation of \u00a7 1084, which was not so specified, and the government had failed to obtain \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d a finding by Judge Port, as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2517(5),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to the effect that the \u201ccontents were otherwise intercepted in accordance with the provisions\u201d of the federal wiretap authorization laws and an approval by him of its use other than in relation to a \u00a7 1955 prosecution. Defendants argued that since the government failed to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 2517(5), exclusion of the conversation and dismissal of the indictment was mandated by \u00a7 2515,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which prohibits the receipt by a grand jury or at trial of any intercepted communication disclosed in violation of the intercept laws, or any evidence derived therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-4\">On November 9, 1976, Judge Port dismissed the indictment in a decision from the bench, relying on <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brodson, </em>528 F.2d 214 (7th Cir. 1975), and our decision in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Marion, </em>535 F.2d 697 (2d Cir. 1976). Although indicating that he would have decided the case differently if \u201cwriting on a clean slate,\u201d Judge Port felt \u201cobliged\u201d to follow <em>Marion\u2019s </em>reasoning that communications relating to crimes not set forth in the order of authorization, \u201cwhether or not they also relate to specified crimes,\u201d 535 F.2d at 706, cannot be used as evidence of an unspecified offense unless judicial approval is obtained by the government through a timely subsequent application. Judge Port refused to find that his authorization to continue the wiretap after reading the Fifth Day Report complied with \u00a7 2517(5), since that report, although it disclosed the contents of the Akron-Binghamton conversation and that it was interstate in character, failed to mention that it would be evidence of a \u00a7 1084 offense as well as of the authorized \u00a7 1955 offense. From this order the government appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-12\">In enacting \u00a7 2517(5) as part of the comprehensive wiretap provisions of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2515, <em>et seq., </em>Congress sought to balance two conflicting principles.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> One is the necessity of protecting Fourth Amendment and privacy rights, which require scrupulous particularity as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1067\">*1067</page-number>the circumstances and reasons for an electronic search before permitting it to be authorized by the courts as a means of insuring that its scope will be limited and its invasion of privacy minimized. See <em>Berger v. New York, </em>388 U.S. 41, 87 S.Ct. 1873, 18 L.Ed.2d 1040 (1967); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Marron, </em>275 U.S. 192, 48 S.Ct. 74, 72 L.Ed. 231 (1927). It was recognized that unless stringent detail were required the government might obtain an overly broad wiretap authorization for one offense as a pretext for gaining information with respect to offenses for which probable cause could not be established or for which wiretap authorization would be unavailable.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The countervailing principle is that where a law enforcement officer lawfully engaged in a search for evidence of one crime inadvertently comes upon evidence of another crime the public interest militates against his being required to ignore what is in plain view. <em>Harris v. United States, </em>331 U.S. 145, 155, 67 S.Ct. 1098, 91 L.Ed. 1399 (1947); <em>United States v. Eisner, </em>297 F.2d 595, 597 (6th Cir. 1962). See also <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>403 U.S. 443, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 29 L.Ed.2d 564 (1971) (warrantless search). In permitting court authorization for electronic interceptions in investigations into certain types of crime, Congress provided that the court authorization must specify the offenses in connection with which the permission was granted and, should the law enforcement officer, in the course of conducting the authorized interception, come across communications relating to offenses other than those specified in the order of authorization or approval, he must obtain the authorization or approval of a court of competent jurisdiction as soon as practicable before the communications might be used in connection with the unspecified offense. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2517(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-5\">The government argues that there was no necessity in the present case to obtain authorization and approval under \u00a7 2517(5) for the Akron-Binghamton conversation in issue because it did in fact relate to the offense specified in the original order of authorization, clearly evidencing an important element of the conduct of an illegal gambling business in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1955, which led to the grand jury\u2019s filing of an indictment against Masciarelli and others charging violation of that statute. The government contends that it therefore cannot be said that its application for the wiretap order in connection with its investigation into violations of \u00a7 1955 was a pretext. It urges that Congress, in using the phrase in \u00a7 2517(5), \u201ccommunications relating to offenses other than those specified in the order of authorization or approval\u201d intended it to apply only where the communications did not relate to the offenses specified in the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-8\">Were this a case of first impression appellants\u2019 interpretation might be persuasive. However, we are confronted with our own decision in <em>United States v. Marion, </em>535 F.2d 697 (2d Cir. 1976), which repeatedly cites with approval the Seventh Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Brodson, </em>528 F.2d 214 (7th Cir. 1975). Both decisions interpret \u00a7 2517(5) as requiring that supplemental court approval promptly be obtained for conversations relating to an offense unspecified in the original wiretap authorization even though the communications also relate to offenses that were specified in that order. Confronted with these decisions the government asks us to overrule <em>Marion </em>or in the alternative to distinguish it on the ground that the unspecified offense there was, unlike that in the present case, substantially dissimilar to the offense specified in the original wiretap authorization. We find it unnecessary to take either of these courses in the present case for the reason that Judge Port, in authorizing continuation of the interceptions after being advised in detail of the interstate conversation in issue, gave sufficient approval to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 2517(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1068\">*1068</page-number>Congress intended that judicial approval of the interception of evidence relating to unauthorized offenses might retroactively be granted pursuant to \u00a7 2517(5) upon a showing that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ali-dedup-0\">\u201cthe original order was lawfully obtained, that it sought in good faith and not as a subterfuge search, and that the communication was in fact incidentally intercepted during the course of a lawfully executed order.\u201d S.Rep. 1097, <em>supra </em>at 2189.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A35T\">Where these conditions have been satisfied, nothing in the statute requires that the supplemental court authorization be express rather than implied. Indeed, in <em>United States v. Tortorello, </em>480 F.2d 764, 781-83 (2d Cir. 1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 866, 94 S.Ct. 63, 38 L.Ed.2d 86 (1974), we decided that an implied authorization or approval would satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 2517(5). In that case the government had obtained a wiretap authorization under New York State law for a variety of state offenses, including grand larceny. During the course of carrying out the authorized interception the government uncovered a large-scale securities fraud scheme which it set forth in renewal affidavits to the New York State justice who had issued the original order of authorization. Although the federal statutes allegedly violated by the scheme were not specified, we held that the evidence obtained was admissible as proof of the federal crimes for the reason that the justice\u2019s renewal of the wiretaps satisfied \u00a7 2517(5) and its New York counterpart, New York Crim.Proc. Law \u00a7 700.65.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AkM\">\u201cNeither the New York statute nor [\u00a7 2517(5)] requires the issuing judge to announce formally in open court that he had noticed the interception of evidence not covered by the original order and has determined that it was properly obtained. <em>It is enough if notification of the interception of evidence not authorized by the original order be clearly provided in the renewal and amendment application papers. </em>A judge presumably will scrutinize any application and will scrupulously impose the restrictions required by statute.\u201d 480 F.2d at 783 (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1140-4\">Thus, although a subsequent court authorization or approval issued after express delineation of offenses \u201cother than those specified in the order\u201d unquestionably satisfies \u00a7 2517(5), it does not represent the only method of compliance. We have adhered to the view that the disclosure in subsequent affidavits to the issuing judge of material facts constituting or clearly relating to other offenses satisfies the requirements of \u00a7 2517(5) under the <em>\u201cTortorello </em>rationale of implicit authorization,\u201d <em>United States v. Marion, supra, </em>535 F.2d at 703, 704 n. 13. See also <em>United States v. Rizzo, </em>492 F.2d 443, 447 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>417 U.S. 944, 94 S.Ct. 3069, 41 L.Ed.2d 665 (1974); <em>United States v. Moore, </em>168 U.S.App.D.C. 227, 513 F.2d 485, 502 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-5\">Applying this interpretation of \u00a7 2517(5) to the present case, the interstate phone call from Schultz to Masciarelli was clearly set forth in the First Day Report required by Judge Port and, as we stated in <em>United States v. Marion, </em>535 F.2d at 703, \u201cwe presume, as in <em>United States v. Tortorello, supra, </em>that in renewing [here continuing] the tap the judge carefully scrutinized those supporting papers and determined that the statute\u2019s requirements had been satisfied.\u201d The disclosure of a wealth of relevant, highly material conversations relating to the operation of a gambling business indicated that the finding of probable cause was justified and therefore \u201cthe original order was lawfully obtained.\u201d The fact that 275 of 283 conversations intercepted related to the operation of a gambling business in violation of \u00a7 1955, including the interstate conversation evidencing a violation of \u00a7 1084, was sufficient indication that \u201cthe original order was sought in good faith and not as a subterfuge search.\u201d Since the detailed facts set forth in the report clearly evidenced a violation of \u00a7 1084, it was unnecessary for the government in its Fifth Day Report to specify that statute by number. Moreover, because it was apparent that the government had intercepted the \u00a7 1084 communication during the closely related \u00a7 1955 investigation, the \u00a7 1084 communication was relevant to the \u00a7 1955 violation, the government set forth the relevant aspects of the conversation in support of its continuation of the authorization, nothing about the challenged communication or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1069\">*1069</page-number>surrounding circumstances indicated that the \u00a7 1955 investigation was being used as a pretext, and the investigation resulted in indictments charging violations of both \u00a7 1955 and \u00a7 1084, compare <em>United States v. Brodson, </em>there was sufficient evidence before Judge Port that \u201cthe communication [relating to \u00a7 1084] was in fact incidentally intercepted during the course of a lawfully executed order,\u201d even though Judge Port was never apprised, undoubtedly in good faith,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that the conversation related to a violation of \u00a7 1084 in addition to providing evidence of the \u00a7 1955 offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-5\">Under these circumstances, we hold that court authorization required by \u00a7 2517(5) was implicitly obtained by the government when Judge Port approved continuation of the wiretap after being fully advised by the Fifth Day Report of the essential facts constituting the unspecified violation, and that suppression of the conversation and dismissal of the indictment was not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-6\">The order of the district court is reversed and the indictment is reinstated.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1137-10\">. Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1955 makes punishable as a federal offense an \u201cillegal gambling business\u201d which is in violation of state law, involves five or more persons in its operation, and has been in business for 30 days or has gross revenue of $2,000 in any single day. Article 225 of New York\u2019s Penal Law prohibits the promotion of gambling and the possession of gambling records.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1137-11\">. Paragraph 6 of the Fifth Day Report stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1137-12\">\u201cOne particular conversation from telephone number 724-5301 was placed to telephone number 1-216-688-1827 at Munroe Falls, Ohio, in the vicinity of Akron, Ohio, where the speaker who had identified himself as \u2018RAY\u2019 discussed his line information from Akron, Ohio. In the conversation a fee was discussed of $135.00 a month or $25.00 a week. \u2018RAY\u2019 indicated he would purchase his line by the month at $135.00 a month and indicated that he would use the name \u2018RAY MILLS\u2019 when obtaining his line information from that Akron, Ohio telephone number. The speaker at the other end indicated that \u2018RAY\u2019 should send his money to Post Office Box 2705, Akron, Ohio, for this line information. As a result of the intercepts on 729-1401, fourteen new code names have been heard in use.
