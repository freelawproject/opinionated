While that rule provides that \u201cif an appeal is pending the court may grant the motion only on remand of the case,\u201d we hold, as we did with respect to civil cases in <em>First National Bank v. Hirsch, </em>535 F.2d 343, 346 (6th Cir. 1976), that the proper procedure for a party wishing to make a motion for a new trial while appeal is pending is to first file the motion in the district court. If that court is inclined to grant the motion, it may then so certify, and the appellant should then make a motion in the court of appeals for a remand of the case to allow the district court to so act. <em>E. g., United States </em>v. <em>Frame, </em>454 F.2d 1136, 1138 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>406 U.S. 925, 92 S.Ct. 1794, 32 L.Ed.2d 126 (1972); <em>Smith v. United States, </em>109 U.S.App.D.C. 28, 283 F.2d 607, 611 (1960); <em>accord, Knight v. United States, </em>213 F.2d 699, 702 (5th Cir. 1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-23\">Accordingly an order will be entered denying appellant\u2019s motion to remand, with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>out prejudice to the resubmission of the same in the event the district court shall indicate that it is inclined to grant such a motion and issues a certificate to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">In connection with its motion for remand, the appellant has moved for a stay of proceedings. Upon consideration, that motion is also denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
