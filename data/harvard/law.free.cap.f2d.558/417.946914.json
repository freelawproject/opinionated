The tank was being moved by a large crane, the boom of which came into contact with high tension electric power lines, resulting in the workman\u2019s electrocution. At the time the deceased was 28 years of age with a wife and four children. The plaintiff, his widow, as administratrix of his estate was awarded a jury verdict of $234,756. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-14\">The crane involved was owned by the Owen Equipment and Erection Company (hereafter \u201cOwen\u201d), and leased by Paxton &amp; Vierling Steel Company (hereafter \u201cPax-ton\u201d) for heavy lifting. The case was initiated by a bill of complaint filed by plaintiff, an Iowa citizen, against Omaha Public Power District (hereafter \u201cQPPD\u201d), a Nebraska corporation, and Paxton, also a Nebraska corporation. The course of the pleadings thereafter was long and involved and will be found in the Appendix hereto. We note here only that Owen was implead-ed as a third-party defendant by OPPD.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-16\">The relationship between defendant Owen and Paxton was somewhat involved. Paxton was engaged in the fabrication of structural steel and the manufacture of farm and similar products. It is a non-union plant. To avoid possible labor trouble in \u201cerecting steel on the outside, which is strictly a union proposition,\u201d it formed Owen, both corporations having the same headquarters and the same officers, Owen being 100% owned by Paxton. Owen owned two cranes, operated by Fred (father) and David (son) Morrow, both of whom were on Paxton\u2019s payroll. Both of them held union cards. It was David who was operating the crime at the time of decedent\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-17\">After Owen was organized it hired one Harry Flynn, a qualified crane operator and member of the crane operator\u2019s union, to be its erection superintendent. It was he who trained Fred Morrow in the use and upkeep of the cranes and it was Fred himself who trained his son on the job. Fred Morrow retired in 1969. Mr. Flynn retired shortly before the accident and was not replaced by a successor. David Morrow then remained the sole operator qualified to operate Owen\u2019s big outside cranes. When Paxton required the big cranes, the operators went with the crane and \u201cthey ran that crane.\u201d Mr. Owen, President of Owen, agreed in his deposition that it \u201cwouldn\u2019t do [Owen] a bit of good to own those cranes unless [Owen] had operators for them * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-18\">After long and involved pleadings, a summary of which, as we have noted, will be found in the Appendix, the parties had, by trial date, January 12,1976, been reduced to two: plaintiff Kroger, an Iowa citizen, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>defendant Owen, charged to be \u201ca Nebraska corporation,\u201d and consistently self-admitted in the pleadings to be such.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">So stood the description of the parties until noon on the third day of the trial. At this juncture, defendant Owen elicited from witness Petersen, Secretary of Owen, that Owen\u2019s principal place of business was in Carter Lake, Iowa. Having done so, defendant, the same afternoon challenged the jurisdiction of the court on the ground of lack of diversity.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">The court and the plaintiff were taken by surprise because of defendant\u2019s pleadings. Plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint, filed on November 9, 1973, some two years prior to trial, had unequivocally charged that \u201cOwen Equipment and Erection Co. is a Nebraska corporation with its principal place of business in Nebraska.\u201d Defendant had not denied this outright. It had utilized a qualified general denial. It \u201c[a]dmit[ted] that Owen Equipment and Erection Company is a corporation organized and existing under the Laws of the State of Nebraska,\u201d and \u201c[d]enie[d] each and every other allegation contained in said Amended Complaint * * * This form of answer was in violation of Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(b) which provides that \u201c[w]hen a pleader intends in good faith to deny only a part or a qualification of an averment, he shall specify so much of it as is true and material and deny only the remainder.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, defendant\u2019s admission of part of an averment and denial of the balance in a qualified general denial clearly does not meet the requirements of the Rule quoted. Nor, as also required by Rule 8(b), does it fairly meet the substance of the averment denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">Appellant finally admitted on oral argument to us, after close questioning, a point clear from the pleadings, namely, that it had not specifically challenged the diversity jurisdiction of the court at any time during the long course of the pleadings, and particularly had not done so in response to the plaintiff\u2019s amended bill of complaint, filed on November 9, 1973, charging Owen to be \u201ca Nebraska corporation with its principal place of business in Nebraska.\u201d Owen waited until near the close of the trial to make its challenge. The point had been concealed during the entire period of time since the filing of the amended complaint some two years theretofore. Under similar circumstances, the Third Circuit has held the allegation as to defendant\u2019s citizenship to be admitted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-12\">The District Court rejected the challenge to its jurisdiction, holding, in its Memorandum Opinion, that although no independent basis of jurisdiction existed as to Owen, nevertheless it had discretion under the Gibbs case,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to exercise its judicial power over the case. It held, in part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AyP\">The law in Nebraska is that an independent basis of jurisdiction need not exist in order for plaintiff to assert a claim against a third party defendant. See <em>Union Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>38 F.R.D. 486 (D.Neb. 1965); <em>Olson v. United States, </em>38 F.R.D. 489 (D.Neb.1965). Although this view was once the minority view, this Court believes it is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>Properly read, <em>United Mine Workers </em>[v. <em>Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. 715 [86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218] (1966)], reemphasizes the fundamental principle that a federal court has <em>jurisdictional power </em>to adjudicate the <em>whole case, </em>i. e., all claims, state or federal, which derive from a common nucleus of operative facts . . . [S]ince there is jurisdictional power to hear the whole case, the question is one of trial court discretion whether to exercise that jurisdiction, considering all the factors of economy and convenience in the context of federalism. 3 <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>\u00a7 14.27[1], 14-569 to 14-570.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-5\">This case is nevertheless novel, in that the third party plaintiff was dismissed. However, having determined that ancillary jurisdiction exists, it is only equitable that the Court now retain jurisdiction of this \u201cpendent\" claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendant waited until trial to present its motion to dismiss. Should the Court grant defendant\u2019s motion, plaintiff would be left without a cause of action, because the Iowa Statute of Limitations has run.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Despite the fact that defendant has exclusive possession of the knowledge of the extent of its own business in Iowa, it remained silent on this issue until more than two years subsequent to the filing of the amended complaint. No reason for the delay has been offered and undoubtedly plaintiff was lulled into believing defendant\u2019s principal place of business was in Nebraska. As the matter of sound policy and logic, ancillary jurisdiction existed once and, under the facts presented in this case, this Court must retain jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-13\">The problem presented arises in the area of ancillary and pendent jurisdiction. We start, of course, with the proposition that federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, under the developing doctrines of pendent and ancillary jurisdiction,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> there has been expansion of federal jurisdiction into areas which ordinarily do not come under the jurisdiction of the federal courts. The limits of this expansion are our immediate concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-14\">Modern analysis starts with the landmark decision in <em>United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. 715, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In this case, the plaintiff, a mining superintendent and hauling contractor, was prevented from the performance of his contract by a local union which had forcibly prevented the opening of the mine. Suit was brought in the federal court alleging violation of section 303 of the Labor Management Relations Act,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to which was joined a state claim for malicious interference with contract rights. Plaintiff prevailed on both claims, but upon motion for judgment n. o. v. the federal claim was held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>non-actionable and judgment entered on the state claim, with affirmation by the Court of Appeals following.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The Supreme Court affirmed the assumption of jurisdiction over the pendent state claim.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The significance of the <em>Gibbs </em>case for our purposes lies in its discarding of the test established in <em>Hurn v. Oursler, </em>289 U.S. 238, 246, 53 S.Ct. 586, 589, 77 L.Ed. 1148 (1933), for pendent jurisdiction, under which pendent jurisdiction was present when \u201ctwo distinct grounds in support of a single cause of action<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> [were] alleged, one only of which presented] a federal question,\u201d but not \u201cwhere two separate and distinct causes of action [were] alleged, one only of which [was] federal in character.\u201d In place of the <em>Hum </em>test, the Court held that pendent jurisdiction is present whenever the state and federal claims \u201cderive from a common nucleus of operative fact\u201d to the degree that a plaintiff would \u201cordinarily be expected to try them all in one judicial proceeding.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> If, the Court continued, the state claim is so related to the federal claim that there is \u201cbut one constitutional \u2018case\u2019,\u201d there is power to exercise pendent jurisdiction and it is \u201cunnecessarily grudging\u201d to limit the availability of pendent jurisdiction more narrowly than is constitutionally required.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-13\">Owen, as noted <em>supra, </em>was impleaded by OPPD as a third-party defendant pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 14(a).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The provisions of Rule 14(a) governing third-party practice are extremely broad, permitting the third-party defendant to assert against the plaintiff \u201cany claim * * * arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the plaintiff\u2019s claim against the third-party plaintiff,\u201d and the plaintiff to assert against the third-party defendant \u201cany claim * * * arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the plaintiff\u2019s claim against the third-party plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-14\">Rule 14, however, is silent as to whether independent jurisdictional grounds are required for such claims and thus arises our question. It is to be noted, however, that Rule 14(a) does not by itself extend the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>jurisdiction of the federal courts.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It is clear that many of the claims which Rule 14(a) permits to be joined with the main claim asserted by the plaintiff have been allowed without an independent basis of jurisdiction under the doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction. Professors Wright and Miller state that \u201c[t]he cases on point almost all hold that defendant\u2019s claim against a third-party defendant is within the ancillary jurisdiction of the federal courts,\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> even though there may be no diversity between these parties. <em>See, e. g., Waylander-Peter-son Co. v. Great Northern Ry. Co., </em>201 F.2d 408, 415 (8th Cir. 1953). The courts have also allowed, without an independent basis of jurisdiction, the third-party defendant\u2019s claim against the plaintiff, arising out of the same transaction as the plaintiff\u2019s main claim.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Since much of what we are about to write concerns diversity, we think it not inappropriate to point out that such action against the plaintiff has been held to be within the court\u2019s ancillary jurisdiction, even when the main claim is based upon diversity jurisdiction and both the third-party defendant and plaintiff are citizens of the same state.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Thus, in view of the breadth of Rule 14(a), combined with current ancillary and pendent jurisdiction doctrine it is not unusual for courts to adjudicate ancillary claims having no independent jurisdictional basis.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-12\">On the other hand, the great numerical majority of cases have held that if the plaintiff asserts a claim against the third-party defendant, as permitted 'by Rule 14(a), there must be independent grounds for jurisdiction.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The older, <em>pre-Gibbs, </em>cases, including one from our court,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> support the proposition with almost complete unanimity,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> as did the first edition of Prof. Moore\u2019s treatise.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-13\">After the landmark decision in <em>Gibbs, </em>however, the underpinnings of the restrictive rule were swept away. Prof. Moore\u2019s later edition, following the holding in <em>Gibbs, </em>submitted that the matter of accepting jurisdiction should be within the trial court\u2019s discretion, arguing trenchantly that: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>Properly read, <em>United Mine Workers </em>reemphasizes the fundamental principle that a federal court has <em>jurisdictional power </em>to adjudicate the <em>whole case, i. e., </em>all claims, state or federal, which derive from a common nucleus of operative facts. Thus it is now possible for lower federal courts to reach decisions allowing jurisdiction over some joined claims and parties, which previously would probably have been rejected for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. If <em>United Mine Workers </em>does signal such relaxation of the prohibitory rule as to original joinder of claims and parties, then, consequently its corollary rule forbidding ancillary jurisdiction of a claim by the plaintiff against the third-party defendant must also be relaxed.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">But regardless of jurisdictional developments under Rules 18 and 20, <em>United Mine Workers </em>can authorize an independent relaxation of the rule against ancillary jurisdiction over plaintiff\u2019s amended claims against the third-party defendant. At the outset, the question must be redefined. It should not be a question of pure law posing the choice \u201ceither there is an ancillary jurisdiction and the court must take it, or there is no ancillary jurisdiction, and the court cannot take it.\u201d Instead, since there is jurisdictional power to hear the whole case, the question is one of trial court discretion whether to exercise that jurisdiction, considering all the factors of economy and convenience in the context of federalism. Once this basic redefinition takes place, the traditional reasons given for supporting a rule of flat prohibition do not necessarily disappear. Instead they become factors for the trial court to consider in exercising its discretion.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>The solution to the problem presented as to the District Court\u2019s retention of jurisdiction in the case at bar is clearly outlined in <em>Gibbs. </em>That decision enunciated a two step process for the resolution of the ancillary-pendent jurisdiction problem: First, the determination of whether or not there is <em>power </em>in the federal courts to hear the whole matter. If there is, the Court continues, \u201cThat power need not be exercised in every case in which it is found to exist. It has consistently been recognized that pendent jurisdiction is a doctrine of discretion, not of plaintiff\u2019s right. Its justification lies in considerations of judicial economy, convenience and fairness to litigants * * *\"<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">At the time the plaintiff amended her complaint to assert a claim against Owen there is no question but that the court had jurisdiction over plaintiff\u2019s claim against OPPD and OPPD\u2019s third-party claim against Owen.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> But the question presented is whether the court also had power over the plaintiff-Owen claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Within the framework of the <em>Gibbs </em>decision, Kroger\u2019s claim against Owen arises out of the core of \u201coperative facts\u201d giving rise to both Kroger\u2019s claim against OPPD and OPPD\u2019s claim against Owen. All parties were before the court and it is both paradoxical and anomalous to hold in this situation that, although Kroger can go against OPPD which can go against Owen, and Owen may proceed against Kroger, Kroger cannot proceed against Owen. This result is not demanded by Rule 14 and has its origins in the midst of the precedents of earlier days and crystallized concepts that cannot stand the light of searching modern examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-11\">It is an over-simplification of the result we seek to cast the problem in terms of black and white, that is, jurisdiction or no jurisdiction. The matter is broader than that. Once the court has before it all of the parties to the controversy, sharing common and interrelated facts, it has power in the jurisdictional sense to dispose of the case. To say, in a modern court, under modern rules,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> that a third-party defendant may sue a plaintiff of the same state, but not the converse, is a monument to the triumph of rule over reason, \u201ca step backward to the time when piecemeal litigation, tactical maneuvering by procedural devices, inconvenience to litigants, duplication of litigation in different courts, and a resulting waste of judicial and litigant time and . resources were the hallmarks of formalistic rules of civil procedure.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>The judicial power is there. Whether or not to use it answers to no <em>ipse dixit. </em>The question is whether to exercise that power, \u201cconsidering all the factors of economy and convenience in the context of federalism.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AUf\">Thus remains the exercise of discretion. And it is for this reason, we are convinced, that we are warned, from the earliest cases to the latest, that there can be no blanket rule governing all cases, no per se dogma to serve as an easy substitute for thought.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Apfy\">As we indicated at the outset of this opinion, the question of pendent-party jurisdiction is \u201csubtle and complex,\u201d and we believe it would be as unwise as it would be unnecessary to lay down any sweeping pronouncement upon the existence or exercise of such jurisdiction.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AE7\">The factors governing the exercise of discretion were expressed in <em>Gibbs </em>to be \u201cjudicial economy, convenience, and fairness to litigants.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The satisfaction here of the first two requirements requires no exegesis. It is upon the element of fairness that we shall speak. The defendant before us has connived for himself an unfair advantage. But what he has overlooked in all of this is the court\u2019s exercise of discretion in terms of fairness. It is not without significance that well prior to <em>Gibbs </em>the discretion of the trial court was relied upon in denying belated challenges to jurisdiction in situations of oppression.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> In the <em>Di Frisehia </em>case, after a series of pleadings, preparations for trial, and a stipulation of diversity, a defendant sought to amend its answer on the eve of trial, once again bringing up the matter of jurisdiction. The District Court dismissed the action, but the Court of Appeals reversed, resting decision on the discretion vested in the trial court and stating that \u201c[a] defendant may not play fast and loose with the judicial machinery and deceive the courts.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>A situation similar in principle and with similar results in the retention of jurisdiction is found in <em>Murphy v. Kodz, </em>351 F.2d 163 (9th Cir. 1965). There the plaintiffs decedent was killed in a mid-air collision, plaintiff bringing action in state court against one Shupe and other parties. Mr. Shupe, alleging that he was an officer of the Forest Service acting in his official capacity at the time of the accident, had the case removed to the District Court, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442(a)(1). No head of federal jurisdiction was alleged as to the remaining defendants. The trial resulted in a judgment in favor of Shupe, but the jury was unable to agree on the liability of the other defendants. As to them, a new trial resulted in plaintiffs favor, whereupon defendants moved to remand the case to the state court, arguing that the federal court had lost further jurisdiction of the case upon entry of the judgment for Shupe, who was the sole party entitled to invoke that court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">The motions were denied by the District Court. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, finding an analogy \u201cin the penumbral area of federal jurisdiction, so-called ancillary or pendent jurisdiction,\u201d citing, among other cases, <em>Hurn v. Oursler, supra. </em>After a review of the authorities applicable to the particular area of jurisdiction at bar, which, as the court noted, has analogies to pendent and ancillary jurisdiction, the court stated that the District Court had discretion in the premises and concluded in language equally applicable to the case before us:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-9\">We need not rest our decision on any claim of judicial economy, for we are impressed that no opportunity for exercise of that discretion was accorded the District Court by motion to remand at the close of the federal facet of the case. That the District Court proceeded with the nonfederal claims does not, in this instance, afford a ground for reversal: Failure of the appellants to bring to the attention of the court considerations requiring an exercise of discretion estops them from asserting that privilege after decision on the merits. [Citing cases.] To hold otherwise would encourage litigants to wager on their success on the merits, and if they lost, permit them to call the contest a nullity.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">In the case before us, the District Court stood squarely upon its discretionary powers in the premises, relying on <em>Gibbs. </em>Defendant Owen attacks the applicability of this doctrine to the case at bar, asserting that the dismissal of the plaintiff\u2019s claim against OPPD before trial limits the discretion of the District Court. We do not so conclude. It is but one factor, among many others, to be considered.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>But beyond that, however, there are other considerations. By subtle and adroit pleading the defendant has gained a substantial advantage. If the trial goes well, it can keep the jurisdictional point hidden. If the trial seems to be going badly or, indeed, if it loses on the merits, it asserts that it can even then challenge jurisdiction and successfully, so it argues, since it insists that it is clear to all that jurisdiction may be challenged by anyone at any time.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">But plaintiff overlooks the application of the <em>Gibbs </em>doctrine to ancillary litigation. The District Court had judicial <em>power </em>over the case initially and we find no abuse of its discretion in the continued exercise of that power. But beyond that, whether the court\u2019s discretion was abused or not in its retention of the cause, defendant\u2019s conduct estops it from asserting abuse of discretion, not only under the teachings of <em>Murphy v. Kodz, supra, </em>but also under the most elementary considerations of judicial fairness. \u201cDespite the fact that defendant has exclusive possession of the knowledge of the extent of its own business in Iowa, it remained silent on this issue until more than two years subsequent to the filing of the amended complaint. No reason for the delay has been offered * * * <footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-12\">The doctrine of the perpetual availability of jurisdictional challenge furnishes no sanctuary to appellant in the light of such conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-13\">Proceeding to the merits, the case was submitted to the jury under, among others, the following instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-14\">A plaintiff may proceed in a case under more than one theory of law. In this case, plaintiff alleges two theories, as subsequently explained, only one of which he need prove in order to recover:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>1. That the crane supplied by defendant was unsafe for the purpose it was intended.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-4\">2. That the crane operator was in the employment of defendant and that defendant is therefore liable for the negligent acts of the crane operator.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">There was no error in this instruction. It is well established that the trial court has the duty to submit to the jury all issues raised by the pleadings which have evidentiary support. <em>Flentie v. American Community Stores Corp., </em>389 F.2d 80, 82 (8th Cir. 1968) (applying Iowa law); <em>Campbell v. Martin, </em>257 Iowa 1247, 136 N.W.2d 508, 511 (1965). In addition the court properly instructed the jury on the establishment of negligence, causation, and damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Here there was ample and controverted evidence submitted on each of the theories of the plaintiff. The first issue presented by the court in its instructions related to the safe or unsafe condition of the crane concededly owned by defendant Owen. On this issue plaintiff\u2019s expert testified, as to described safety devices, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-7\">Well, with these safety devices available, I just don\u2019t think it is right to put a product out anywhere for rent or use for anybody unless it is equipped with it. You cannot assume, for example, that whoever it goes to are necessarily trained in safety and are going to take all the precautions and when a safety device is available and is being used in the industry, it is my opinion that, these cranes and booms should be so equipped.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">One of the issues most vigorously argued at trial was whether the crane operator, David Morrow, was a servant of Paxton or of defendant Owen, loaned by Paxton to Owen for this particular job. What the court was faced with was thus the notoriously complex \u201cborrowed servant\u201d problem,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> that is, the problem of vicarious liability between the general employer, from whose employ the servant came, or the special employer, who was utilizing at the time the servant so obtained. On this issue, the trial court instructed the jury, essentially, that it must decide whether David Morrow was, at the time of the accident, acting as Owen\u2019s servant, and that the test of agency as between the general and the special employer was which had the right to control the manner of performance of the work being done. The evidence as to control, as well as other facets of the employment relation, was conflicting and presented a jury question. The instructions, read in their entirety in the light of the unique facts adduced as to Morrow\u2019s employment and duties, summarized <em>supra, </em>fairly presented the controlling issue to the jury and we find no error therein. <em>Bengford v.

Kroger, deceased, against the Omaha Public Power District (hereafter \u201cOPPD\u201d), a public corporation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>existing under the laws of the State of Nebraska, and having its principal place of business in Omaha, for negligence in the construction, maintenance and operation of its power transmission line alleged to have been the proximate cause of plaintiff\u2019s decedent\u2019s death. The Paxton &amp; Vierling Steel Company (hereafter \u201cPaxton\u201d), also a Nebraska corporation, was made a party defendant \u201cfor the sole and only purpose of determining its rights under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, if any * * * The parties agree that Paxton was dismissed out of this phase of the action, appellant stating, \u201cbecause of a jurisdictional defect.\u201d The order with respect thereto is not found in the record before us. OPPD thereafter filed a third-party complaint against Pax-ton and \u201cOwen Construction Co., Inc.\u201d (hereafter \u201cOwen Construction\u201d). Shortly thereafter, OPPD filed a motion for dismissal of Owen Construction, having ascertained that its proper corporate name was Owen Equipment and Erection Co. (hereafter \u201cOwen Equipment\u201d). The motion was granted and the court ordered that Owen Construction, \u201can Iowa corporation,\u201d be dismissed with prejudice and granted OPPD permission to file an \u201cAmended Third-Party Complaint naming Owen Equipment and Erection Co., a Nebraska corporation, as an additional Third-Party Defendant * * *OPPD\u2019s amended third-party complaint against Owen Equipment, \u201ca Nebraska corporation,\u201d was subsequently filed. This is the Owen corporation remaining in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Owen Equipment\u2019s answer to OPPD\u2019s amended third-party complaint stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-6\">1. Admits that Owen Equipment and Erection Company is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Nebraska.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-7\">2. Denies each and every other allegation contained in said Third-Party Complaint except those allegations which would be in the nature of admissions against the interest of the third-party plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">Plaintiff Kroger moved also for an order permitting her to add as a party defendant Owen Equipment, \u201ca Nebraska corporation.\u201d Plaintiff filed such amended complaint against Owen Equipment, on November 9, 1973, describing it as \u201ca Nebraska corporation with its principal place of business in Nebraska.\u201d Owen Equipment\u2019s answer thereto stated in pertinent part that it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-9\">1. Admits that Owen Equipment and Erection Company is a corporation organized and existing under the Laws of the State of Nebraska.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-10\">2. Denies each and every other allegation contained in said Amended Complaint, except those allegations which would be in the nature of admissions against the interest of the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">OPPD had moved for summary judgment on October 30,1973. On September 9,1975, this court ^affirmed the District Court\u2019s judgment in favor of OPPD against the plaintiff, dismissing OPPD, a Nebraska corporation, from the cause. <em>Kroger v. Omaha Public Power District, </em>523 F.2d 161 (8th Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-12\">Shortly thereafter, Owen Equipment\u2019s motion for summary judgment, which had been filed in September of 1974 was heard and denied by the court. This motion, by Owen Equipment, \u201ca Nebraska Corporation,\u201d raised no issue of jurisdiction, made no point as to lack of diversity, nor did it make any mention of where Owen Equipment\u2019s principal place of business might be. The motion was denied on November 14, 1975, and trial commenced on January 12, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-15\">On January 13, 1976, during the trial, Owen Equipment filed an answer asserting that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, but failing to specify lack of diversity as the reason therefor. On January 14, 1976, after having raised lack of diversity, Owen Equipment moved for leave to file another amended answer which like the answer of January 13, asserted lack of subject matter jurisdiction but failed to specify lack of diversity. The court denied Owen Equipment\u2019s motion for leave to file an amended answer.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b491-7\">. <em>See Kirby v.

Among them are that: (1) plaintiff should not be allowed, by an indirect route, to sue a co-citizen under diversity jurisdiction when he is not permitted to sue that party directly; (2) the majority rule prevents collusion between plaintiff and defendant to obtain federal jurisdiction over a party who would otherwise not be within the court\u2019s reach; (3) the rule which generally does not require diversity as between plaintiff and third-party defendant proceeds on the assumption that the plaintiff is seeking no relief against the third-party defendant; and (4) federal dockets are so overcrowded that the federal courts should not reach out for state law based litigation. [Footnotes omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ahp\">Professor Moore has incisively criticized these arguments in his treatise. <em>See </em>3 <em>Moore\u2019s </em>\u00b6 14.-27[1], at 14-570 to 572. <em>See also Morgan v. Serro Travel Trailer Co., supra, </em>69 F.R.D. at 702-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">In response to the argument that plaintiff should not be able to do indirectly what he cannot do directly, Professor Moore replies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIL\">[W]hy shouldn\u2019t A.B. [plaintiff] be able to do it indirectly? A.B. took his chance in suing C.D. [defendant] alone in the federal court. It was C.D.\u2019s choice, not A.B.\u2019s, to bring in E.F. [third-party defendant], and now that E.F. is before the court, judicial economy and convenience may dictate that the court dispose of the whole case by allowing all claims deriving from a common nucleus of operative fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-12\">3 <em>Moore\u2019s </em>fl 14.27[1] at 14-570 to 571 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-13\">The argument that the majority rule prevents collusion has been termed \u201cthe <em>raison d\u2019etre\u201d </em>of that rule; the other arguments being described as \u201clargely \u2018make-weights\u2019.\u201d <em>Morgan, supra, </em>69 F.R.D. at 702-03. Professor Moore states, and we agree, that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1359, which provides that \u201c[a] district court shall not have jurisdiction of a civil action in which any party * * * has been improperly or collu-sively made or joined to invoke the jurisdiction of such court,\u201d is an adequate answer to the specter of collusion. 3 <em>Moore\u2019s </em>fl 14.27[1], at 14-571. \u201cFears of collusion do not justify a wholesale denial of jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b495-14\">The third argument given in support of the majority rule rests on an overly narrow view of ancillary jurisdiction. Professor Moore puts it this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-15\">Ancillary jurisdiction is a much broader concept resting upon multiple reasons of economy and convenience. Thus, it is clearly established that ancillary jurisdiction allows jurisdiction over claims and counterclaims between C.D. [third-party plaintiff] and E.F. [third-party defendant] even though those claims lack diversity and jurisdictional amount and could not have been brought as original law suits. The same broad principle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>and result should not be offensive when applied to ancillary jurisdiction between A.B. [plaintiff] and E.F. If E.F. had voluntarily entered the suit as a non-indispensable defendant by intervention under Rule 24(a), there clearly can be ancillary jurisdiction over the claims between E.F. and A.B. The same result should be obtained whether E.F. enters voluntarily under Rule 24 or involuntarily by C.D.\u2019s impleader under Rule 14. In brief, there should be no rule forbidding building one ancillary jurisdiction on another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8G\"><em>Id. </em>at 14-571 to 572 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">The fourth argument in support of the majority rule, that federal courts are too busy to \u201creach out for state law based litigation,\u201d rests upon a parochial view of federalism. \u201cIf federal courts refuse to use conceptual tools to dispose of all related claims with the greatest economy and convenience, the federal courts then add to the total ineconomy and inconvenience which litigants must suffer to obtain justice on the merits of their claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 14-572 (footnote omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b496-9\">. 383 U.S. at 726, 86 S.Ct. at 1139 (footnote omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b496-12\">.

In <em>Young v. Handwork, </em>7 Cir., 1949, 179 F.2d 70, 16 A.L.R.2d 825, certiorari denied 1950, 339 U.S. 949, 70 S.Ct. 804, 805, 94 L.Ed. 1363, we have a similar state of facts, for after raising the question of lack of diversity in its answer the defendants omitted such question from their amended motion and in open court admitted the facts in plaintiff\u2019s complaint. Following determination by the court on the merits, the defendant once again attempted to raise the issue, but the court denied leave to file the amendment and the action was sustained by the court of appeals. Similarly, in the instant case the defendant had its opportunity to have the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>issue heard and to present its position but chose to admit the allegations of plaintiffs complaint. Thereafter it fully participated in the appropriate discovery and pretrial procedures preparatory to trial of the action on the merits. Having done so, a further attempt to amend its answer to return to its previous defense of lack of diversity could certainly not be made as of right. Allowance of such an amendment under the circumstances would be an abuse of discretion. Cf. <em>Klee v. Pittsburgh &amp; West Virginia Railway Co., </em>D.C. W.D.Pa.1958, 22 F.R.D. 252.

Consider also the comments of the distinguished American Law Institute reflecting the disturbance, not of only of distinguished scholars, but of many courts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-10\">At the present time and throughout the history of the federal judicial system, it has been possible for either party to raise, or for the court on its motion to consider, a question of jurisdiction over the subject matter at any stage in the course of litigation. <em>See, e. g., Mansfield, Coldwater &amp; Lake Mich. Ry. v. Swan, </em>111 U.S. 379 [4 S.Ct. 510, 28 L.Ed. 462] (1884). Even the party who has invoked jurisdiction may subsequently challenge it if the result of a trial on the merits is unfavorable. <em>See, e. g., American Fire and Cas. Co. v. Finn, </em>341 U.S. 6 [71 S.Ct. 534, 95 L.Ed. 702] (1951). And a wily defendant may conceal a known jurisdictional defect until the period of the statute of limitations has run, then obtain dismissal, and achieve total immunity from suit. Some decisions indicate that he may even do this by controverting jurisdictional facts previously alleged or admitted. <em>E. g., Page v. Wright, </em>116 F.2d 449 (7th Cir. 1940) [Ramsey <em>v. Mellon Nat\u2019l Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>350 F.2d 874 (3d Cir. 1965)]. <em>But see Di Frischia v. New York Cent. R.R., </em>279 F.2d 141 (3d Cir. 1960).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-16\">As many commentators have noted, e. <em>g., </em>1 <em>Moore Federal Practice </em>\u00b6 0.60(4) (2d ed. 1948), this fetish of federal jurisdiction is wholly inconsistent with sound judicial administration and can only serve to diminish respect for a system that tolerates it.

Congress made clear that for purposes of diversity jurisdiction, a corporation \u201cshall be deemed a citizen of any State by which it has been incorporated and of the State where it has its principal place of business.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">I do not believe that the holding in <em>United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. 715, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966), can be said to authorize the exercise of jurisdiction over a claim made by a plaintiff against an impleaded third-party defendant without diversity between the parties. In <em>Gibbs, </em>the district court already possessed subject matter jurisdiction over a federal claim between the two parties, so it was appropriate and within the federal court\u2019s judicial power to resolve a state claim appended to the federal claim. Here, the threshold question is whether ancillary jurisdiction supports Kroger\u2019s claim even though she has no claim against Owen with an independent jurisdictional basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">I believe that the Supreme Court\u2019s pronouncements in <em>Aldinger v. Howard, </em>427 U.S. 1, 96 S.Ct. 2413, 49 L.Ed.2d 276 (1976), and cases such as <em>American Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Finn, </em>341 U.S. 6, 71 S.Ct. 534, 95 L.Ed. 702 (1951), require that we dismiss the case for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\"><em>Aldinger </em>was an action brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3) and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against several county officials. The plaintiff attempted to join state law claims against the county itself arising out of the same facts on a theory of pendent or ancillary jurisdiction. The Supreme Court rejected that attempt and with it the sort of reasoning found in the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">In response to arguments that \u201cpendent party\u201d jurisdiction over a state law claim should be allowed even in the absence of another claim between the same parties with an independent jurisdictional base, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-10\">Prom a purely factual point of view, it is one thing to authorize two parties, already present in federal court by virtue of a case over which the court has jurisdiction, to litigate in addition to <em>their </em>federal claim a state-law claim over which there is no independent basis of federal jurisdiction. But <em>it is quite another thing to permit a plaintiff, </em>who has asserted a claim against one defendant with respect to which there is federal jurisdiction, <em>to implead an entirely different defendant on the basis of a state-law claim over which there is no independent basis of federal jurisdiction, </em>simply because his claim against the first defendant and his claim against the second defendant \u201cderive from a common nucleus of operative fact.\u201d <em>[Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. at 725, 86 S.Ct. 1130]. True, the same considerations of judicial economy would be served insofar as plaintiff\u2019s claims \u201care such that he would ordinarily be expected to try them all in one judicial proceeding . . .\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>But the addition of a completely new party would run counter to the well-established principle that federal courts, as opposed to state trial courts of general jurisdiction, are courts of limited jurisdiction marked out by Congress. We think there is much sense in the observation of Judge Sobeloff, writing for the Court of Appeals in <em>Kenrose Mfg. Co. v. Fred Whitaker Co., </em>512 F.2d 890, 894 (CA 4 1972):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-12\">\u201cThe value of efficiency in the disposition of lawsuits by avoiding multiplicity may be readily conceded, but that is not the only consideration a federal court should take into account in assessing the presence or absence of jurisdiction. Especially is this true where, as here, the efficiency plaintiff seeks so avidly is available without question in the state courts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-13\">[ 427 U.S. at 14-15, 96 S.Ct. at 2420 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>The situation is the same here. That the same facts may have been involved in Kroger\u2019s claim against Owen as those in Kroger\u2019s claim against the Omaha Public Power District is not by itself sufficient basis for ancillary or pendent jurisdiction over the claim against Owen. Had Kroger wished to sue both Owen and the Power District in a single forum, she could have done so in a state court. <em>See Fawvor v. Texaco, Inc., </em>546 F.2d 636, 640-41, 643 (5th Cir. 1977). <em>Aldinger\u2019s </em>reliance on <em>Kenrose Mfg. Co. v. Fred Whitaker Co., supra, </em>512 F.2d 890, which also involved an attempt by a plaintiff in a diversity case to assert state law claims against a nondiverse third-party defendant is especially instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">The majority in distinguishing <em>Aldinger </em>fails to address the rationale for disclaiming federal jurisdiction presented in <em>Aldinger:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATi\">Before it can be concluded that such jurisdiction exists, a federal court must satisfy itself not only that Art. III permits it, but that Congress in the statutes conferring jurisdiction has not expressly or by implication negated its existence. <em>[Id. </em>at 18, 96 S.Ct. at 2422.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">As <em>Aldinger </em>makes clear, 427 U.S. at 15-16, 96 S.Ct. 2413, <em>United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. 715, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966), explicates the federal courts\u2019 power under article III in the face of congressional silence. <em>See also </em>Comment, <em>Aldinger v. Howard and Pendent Jurisdiction, 77 </em>Colum.L.Rev. 127, 128-30, 140-42 (1977). <em>Gibbs </em>does not deal with the issue before us, for here the Congress expressly limits by statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332, the parties to which diversity jurisdiction extends.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Since <em>Strawbridge v. Curtiss, 7 </em>U.S. (3 Cranch) 267, 2 L.Ed. 435 (1806), it has been the rule that general diversity jurisdiction over a state law claim requires <em>complete </em>diversity between plaintiffs and defendants. The parties to this claim do not satisfy this requirement. Congress has commanded that diversity jurisdiction not extend to claims involving parties such as these. <em>See Fawvor v. Texaco, Inc., supra, </em>546 F.2d at 638-39; Comment, <em>supra, 11 </em>Colum.L.Rev. at 147.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> As Judge Smith correctly observes, <em>supra </em>at 422 and 423 n. 25, citing <em>Fawvor v. Texaco, Inc., supra, </em>546 F.2d 636, and <em>Kenrose Mfg. Co. v. Fred Whitaker Co., supra, </em>512 F.2d 890, the majority of federal courts support the view that an independent basis of jurisdiction is necessary to support a plaintiff\u2019s action against a third-party defendant. It also appears that we are the first court of appeals to rule to the contrary. In addition to the cases cited by the majority, <em>see Saalfrank v. O\u2019Daniel, </em>533 F.2d 325 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Saalfrank v. Parkview Mem. Hosp., </em>429 U.S. 922, 97 S.Ct. 319, 50 L.Ed.2d 289 (1976); <em>Rosario v. American Export-Isbrandtsen Lines, Inc., </em>531 F.2d 1227, 1233 &amp; n.17 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Rosario v. United States, </em>429 U.S. 857, 97 S.Ct. 156, 50 L.Ed.2d 135 (1976). Thus, I would conclude that Congress did not intend that federal courts take jurisdiction over a plaintiff\u2019s claim against a third-party defendant, in the absence of independent jurisdictional grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">I agree with Judge Smith\u2019s critical comments relating to Owen\u2019s concealment of the facts concerning diversity until well into the trial. However, it is well settled that a party cannot by his conduct be precluded through laches, waiver, or estoppel from raising a lack of federal subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See, e. g., American Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Finn, </em>341 U.S. 6, 71 S.Ct. 534, 95 L.Ed. 702 (1951) (party who removed case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>to federal court, and successfully resisted plaintiffs attempts to have it remanded, can raise want of jurisdiction after verdict for plaintiff); <em>Mitchell v. Maurer, </em>293 U.S. 237, 55 S.Ct. 162, 79 L.Ed. 338 (1934) (party never raised lack of jurisdiction in any court); <em>Mansfield, C. &amp; L. M. Ry. v. Swan, </em>111 U.S. 379, 4 S.Ct. 510, 28 L.Ed. 462 (1884) (same as <em>Finn, supra). </em>That counsel for defendant played fast and loose with the court calls for sanctions by the court against the responsible parties, not the exercise of jurisdiction which the federal court does not otherwise possess. See <em>Mansfield, C. &amp; L. M. Ry. v. Swan, supra, </em>111 U.S. at 386-89, 4 S.Ct. 510; <em>Basso v. Utah Power &amp; Light Co., </em>495 F.2d 906, 910 (10th Cir. 1974); <em>Page v. Wright, </em>116 F.2d 449, 454-55 (7th Cir. 1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">When a litigant\u2019s attorney has intentionally misled the court as to the jurisdictional facts and thus \u201csandbags\u201d his opponent and the district judge, as appears to be the case here, the court possesses ample power to impose appropriate sanctions against the malefactor. Under somewhat similar circumstances, the Tenth Circuit dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s cause for lack of diversity, but directed that \u201call reasonable costs and expenses should be assessed against defendant including a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee for work on this appeal.\u201d That court also noted the existence of a state \u201csavings statute\u201d which would permit the plaintiff to pursue a remedy in state court after the federal dismissal, despite the passage of the usual limitations period for the type of action involved. <em>Basso v. Utah Power &amp; Light Co., supra, </em>495 F.2d at 910-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Similarly, I would remand this case to the district court with directions to dismiss the action for want of subject matter jurisdiction, leaving plaintiff free to pursue her remedy in the Iowa state courts.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Moreover, on remand, I would direct the district court to conduct a hearing relative to imposing sanctions against defendant or defendant\u2019s counsel, or both. If found appropriate, those sanctions may include all costs and expenses incurred by plaintiff, Geraldine Kroger, in pressing the action against Owen Equipment and may include a reasonable sum for attorneys\u2019 fees for services, pretrial, trial, and on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">In sum, while I disagree with the majority\u2019s disposition of this appeal, I emphatically agree that a drastic remedy is necessary to deter other litigants from engaging in concealment and delay in presenting known jurisdictional facts to the court by the party in possession of those facts in order to obtain an advantage in the conduct of litigation at the expense, not only of the opposing party, but of the court itself. Such conduct substantially hinders the proper and efficient administration of justice and wastes the time of judges, court personnel, and juries in the already overburdened federal courts. This dissenter suggests that such sanctions may be a more appropriate remedy for the abuse practiced in this case than opening the door to even more diversity cases than those already competing for judicial attention on the crowded dockets of the federal courts, particularly when state courts can dispose of all the state law claims involved in such cases. <em>See Ayoub v. Helm's Express, Inc., </em>300 F.Supp. 473 (W.D. Pa.1969).</p>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b503-8\">. A congressional intent to negate pendent jurisdiction cannot be inferred from the majority of jurisdictional statutes, which are intended as affirmative grants of jurisdiction only. Some jurisdictional statutes, however, evince a congressional decision that certain claims should not be heard in federal court. The federal question and diversity statutes, in particular, require that the claims exceed $10,000, and, in the diversity statute, that the parties be of diverse citizenship. The policies which called for the exclusion of claims not meeting these requirements also seem to demand that they not be heard through the exercise of pendent jurisdiction. Since Congress excluded these claims from federal jurisdiction, their adjudication through pendent jurisdiction seems clearly to frustrate congressional intent. [77 Colum.L. Rev. at 147 (footnotes omitted).]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"42\">\n<p id=\"b504-6\">.
