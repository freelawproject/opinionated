BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-6\">The trial in the case of <em>United States v. Edward J. Gurney, et al., </em>began on February 25, 1975. The case involved an incumbent United States senator at the time of indictment and generated considerable pub- \u25a0 lie interest. The proceedings were the subject of extensive news coverage. Several accommodations were made by the trial judge for representatives of the news media. Provisions were made for a telephone room for wire service representatives, reserved seating was secured for the press, and convenient but inconspicuous seating was furnished to a newspaper sketch artist.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-7\">The district judge discussed jury management questions with counsel before the trial began. Sequestration was considered, but defense counsel chose not to request such action in view of other measures adopted to insulate the jury. The judge admonished the jurors daily not to discuss the case, not to read any newspapers other than those cleared by counsel and given to the jurors by the Clerk, and not to listen to or view broadcasts concerning the trial. The attorneys were informed that the district judge expected to grant appropriate requests to conduct some of the proceedings ancillary and preliminary to the reception of evidence out of the hearing of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-8\">After the trial got under way and the government began putting on its case in chief, consisting in large part of documentary proof, the appellant newsmen sought to inspect various documents and exhibits, some of which were in evidence and some of which were only identified. The Clerk refused access to many of these items pursuant to oral directions of the district judge. Appellants then filed their \u201cPetition for Hearing and for Vacation of Restrictions on Press and Other News Media\u201d directed to the district court\u2019s denial of access. In this petition, the newspapers and reporters asked the trial court to remove the restrictions on their access to: (1) exhibits offered at trial for identification but not yet admitted; (2) exhibits admitted but not yet read to the jury; (3) exhibits offered but rejected; (4) the transcript of the grand jury testimony of Senator Gurney; (5) the witness list; (6) names and addresses of the jurors; and (7) defense exhibit # 79, a copy of a purported statement of a witness, Larry Williams, to the F.B.I., which had been received in evidence. The petitioners asked further that the judge vacate any prior rulings entered during the trial as to such matters and that he reduce to writing those rulings not vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-14\">On July 1, 1975, after conducting a hearing, the district judge entered a written order permitting: (1) inspection of exhibit # 79; (2) inspection of a list of witnesses; and (3) examination by petitioners of exhibits received in evidence, subject to the availability of the Court\u2019s trial clerk. He denied: (1) unlimited disclosure of Senator Gurney\u2019s grand jury testimony;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (2) disclosure of the names and addresses of the jurors; (3) access to the bench conferences with counsel;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and (4) access to exhibits identified but not received into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-15\">On July 16, 1975, the district judge orally denied appellants\u2019 further request for access to the transcript of a proffer of testimony received by the judge <em>in camera </em>at a bench conference. On July 30, 1975, after the jury was sequestered during its deliberations, appellants asked for leave to inspect a written communication to the judge from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>the jury. A similar request was made on July 31, as to a communication from the trial judge to the jury. The district court orally denied both requests.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellants seek reversal of the district court\u2019s rulings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1278-4\">Appellants\u2019 primary claim is that the district judge violated their First Amendment rights when he denied the press access to various exhibits and transcripts, the jury list, and the written communications between the judge and the jury. Also at issue is whether the district judge violated the First and Fifth Amendments by failing to: (1) hold a'hearing and (2) issue a \u201cspecial order\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> regarding each of the appellants\u2019 requests to view materials. After careful consideration of the issues presented, we find that the district court\u2019s actions did not violate appellants\u2019 First or Fifth Amendment rights. Thus, we affirm the district judge\u2019s rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-5\">II. JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-6\">We must consider at the outset the jurisdictional questions of standing, finality, and mootness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-12\">The appellee United States concedes that the reporters and their respective newspapers have standing to challenge the district court\u2019s decisions regarding appellants\u2019 claimed right of access to the various trial documents. The appellants were the direct targets of the district court\u2019s rulings. The two requirements for establishing standing have been met \u2014 i. e. (1) there is a claim of injury in fact; and (2) the interest sought to be protected is arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute or constitutional guarantee in question. <em>Data Processing Service v. Camp, </em>397 U.S. 150, 153-54, 90 S.Ct. 827, 830, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970). Appellants have arguably suffered an injury with respect to newsgathering. Moreover, the district court\u2019s determinations arguably affected appellants\u2019 rights under the First Amendment. See <em>Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Young, </em>522 F.2d 234, 237-38 (6th Cir. 1975). We conclude that appellants\u2019 standing is established.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-13\">The government contends that, although the July 1, 1975, written order was final and appealable, the three subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>oral rulings (July 16, 30, and 31) were not final orders, but merely incidental, non-reviewable regulations of trial management.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-5\">Title 28, U.S.Code \u00a7 1291 provides that \u201c[t]he courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts . . .\u201d The desire for judicial economy and the avoidance of unnecessary piecemeal appeals underlie the final judgment rule. See C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure: Jurisdiction, \u00a7 3911 (1976); 9 J. Moore, Federal Practice H 110.07 (2d ed. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-7\">The \u201ccollateral order\u201d doctrine established by the Supreme Court in <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949), provides an expansive interpretation of the finality requirement. A \u201ccollateral order\u201d is one which finally determines a claim of right \u201cseparable from, and collateral to, rights asserted\u201d in the main cause of action. Cohen, <em>supra, </em>337 U.S. at 546-47, 69 S.Ct. at 1225-1226. Four basic requirements generally must be satisfied before a matter is reviewable under the collateral order doctrine. First, the matter must have been finally disposed of by the district court. But, if there is a \u201cplain prospect that the trial court may itself alter the challenged ruling, there is little justification for immediate appellate intrusion. It is enough that no further consideration is contemplated\u201d. Wright, Miller and Cooper, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 3911 at 470. Second, the matter reviewed must be \u201cseparable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the action\u201d. Cohen, <em>supra, </em>337 U.S. at 546-47, 69 S.Ct. at 1225-1226. Finally, if denial of review entails the risk of \u201cirreparable injury\u201d, and the case involves \u201ca serious and unsettled question\u201d, the appeal should be granted. See Wright, Miller and Cooper, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 3911 at 470-71; Moore, <em>supra </em>\u00b6 110.10 at 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-8\">In view of the underlying purpose of the final judgment rule and the particular facts in this case, we believe that the district judge\u2019s four rulings in question had sufficient finality to permit appeal. Although the three oral rulings may have lacked procedural formality, the appeal can be justified in light of: (1) the improbability of further consideration by the trial court; (2) the close similarity of issues disposed of by the written order and the oral rulings; and (3) the general importance of the rights involved. Moreover, the questions presented here could affect many other cases. See Wright, Miller and Cooper, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1279-12\">Mootness presents the final procedural hurdle. Appellee concedes that the appeal here is not moot. We agree. Despite the conclusion of the <em>Gurney </em>trial, the specific issues presented by the appellants are of a continuing nature. A case such as this one presents a controversy \u201ccapable of repetition yet evading review\u201d, <em>Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, </em>219 U.S. 498, 515, 31 S.Ct. 279, 283, 55 L.Ed. 310 (1911); <em>Roe v. Wade, </em>410 U.S. 113, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973), because \u201cthe underlying criminal proceeding would almost always terminate before the appellate court hears the case\u201d. <em>United States v. Schiavo, </em>504 F.2d 1, 5 (3rd Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 1096, 95 S.Ct. 690, 42 L.Ed.2d 688. See also <em>Nebraska Press Assn. v. Stuart,, </em>427 U.S. 539, 96 S.Ct. 2791, 49 L.Ed.2d 683 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-13\">We proceed to the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-14\">III. FIRST AMENDMENT CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-15\">The critical issue in this case is whether the trial court\u2019s rulings violated appellants\u2019 First Amendment freedoms. The district judge denied appellants access to (1) exhibits not yet admitted into evidence; (2) transcripts of bench conferences held <em>in camera; </em>(3) written communications between the jury and the judge; (4) list of names and addresses of jurors; and (5) Mr. Gurney\u2019s grand jury testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-16\">The question of media First Amendment newsgathering rights in the face of court or government restrictions has been the subject of much discussion but remains largely unsettled.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is clearly established, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1208\">*1208</page-number>however, that \u201c[a] trial is a public event\u201d. <em>Craig v. Harney, </em>331 U.S. 367, 374, 67 S.Ct. 1249, 1254, 91 L.Ed. 1546 (1947). Members of the media are thus free to report whatever occurs in open court. <em>Estes v. Texas, </em>381 U.S. 532, 541\u201442, 85 S.Ct. 1628, 1932, 14 L.Ed.2d 543 (1965); <em>United States v. Dickinson, </em>465 F.2d 496, 509 (5th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-4\">The First Amendment guarantees \u201cspecial protection against orders that prohibit the publication or broadcast of particular information or commentary \u2014 orders that impose a \u2018previous\u2019 or \u2018prior\u2019 restraint on speech\u201d. <em>Nebraska Press Assn. v. Stuart, supra, </em>427 U.S. at 556, 96 S.Ct. at 2801, 49 L.Ed.2d 683. Generally, orders proscribing publication of matters transpiring in open court are constitutionally infirm, absent some compelling justification. <em>Id.; Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Young, </em>522 F.2d 234 (6th Cir. 1975); <em>United States v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., </em>497 F.2d 102 (5th Cir. 1974). But the trial judge here did not resort to the use of prior restraints despite the case being much publicized. \u201cA prior restraint ... by definition, has an immediate and irreversible sanction\u201d. <em>Nebraska Press Assn., supra, </em>427 U.S. at 559, 96 S.Ct. at 2803. No such restriction \u201cfreezing\u201d, <em>id., </em>speech was imposed. The district judge merely refused to allow the appellants to inspect documents not a matter of public record. Appellants were free to obtain whatever information they desired from any source except from the district court and its supporting personnel.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1280-8\">The Supreme Court has recognized that newsgathering warrants some degree of First Amendment protection. \u201c[WJithout some protection for seeking out the news, freedom of the press could be eviscerated\u201d. <em>Branzburg v. Hayes, </em>408 U.S. 665, 681, 92 S.Ct. 2646, 2656, 33 L.Ed2d 626 (1972). The extent of such protection has remained uncertain, but it is clear that it is not without bounds. \u201cThe right to speak and publish does not carry with it the unrestrained right to gather information\u201d. <em>Zemel v. Rusk, </em>381 U.S. 1, 17, 85 S.Ct. 1271, 1281, 14 L.Ed.2d 179 (1965). The First Amendment right to gather news has been defined in terms of information available to the public generally.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Pell v. Procunier, </em>417 U.S. 817, 94 S.Ct. 2800, 41 L.Ed.2d 495 (1974); <em>Branzburg, supra; Garrett v. Estelle, </em>556 F.2d 1274 (5th Cir. 1977) [decided August 3, 1977].</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-9\">The press cannot be denied access to any information already within the public domain. Cox <em>Broadcasting Corp. </em>v. <em>Cohn, </em>420 U.S. 469, 95 S.Ct. 1029, 43 L.Ed.2d 328 (1975). Yet,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1280-10\">\u201c[t]he Constitution does not require government to accord the press special access to information not shared by members of the public generally. . It is one thing to say that a journalist is free to seek out sources of information not available to members of the general public, that he is entitled to some constitutional protection of the confidentiality of such sources and that government cannot restrain the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1209\">*1209</page-number>publication of news emanating from such sources. . . . It is quite another thing to suggest that the Constitution imposes upon government the affirmative duty to make available to journalists sources of information not available to members of the public generally. That proposition finds no support in the words of the Constitution or in any decision of this Court\u201d, (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1281-6\">Pell, <em>supra, </em>417 U.S. at 834-35, 94 S.Ct. at 2810. In <em>Pell, </em>the Court found that the press was not denied access to sources of information available to the public, and therefore, no violation of First Amendment rights occurred.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court has suggested that, if there are other important interests to be protected in judicial proceedings, such protection may be accomplished \u201cby means which avoid public documentation . . . .\u201d <em>Cox Broadcasting Corp., supra, </em>420 U.S. at 496, 95 S.Ct. at 1047.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-8\">The documents sought by appellants were not part of the public record.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In keeping with present Supreme Court guidelines, we do not think that the press had any First Amendment right of access to those matters not available to the public. See <em>Garrett v. Estelle, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1281-9\">There are many areas to which the public, and accordingly the press, traditionally have had no right of access. Denials of access to such proceedings are generally based upon fundamental governmental interests and protections of other rights which override the concerns of the public. For example, the press and the public have historically been excluded from sensitive governmental activities such as grand jury proceedings, judicial conferences, see <em>Branzburg, supra, </em>408 U.S. at 684, 92 S.Ct. at 2658, and <em>in camera </em>inspections of evidence. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Nixon, </em>418 U.S. 683, 714, 94 S.Ct. 3090, 3110-3111, 41 L.Ed.2d 1039 (1974). Admittedly, such denials of access hamper newsgathering. Any burdens, however, are generally incidental in view of the strong governmental interests involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-13\">The right of access to criminal proceedings becomes a highly controversial issue when First Amendment questions must be analyzed in conjunction with competing Sixth Amendment considerations. \u201cA heavy obligation rests on trial judges to effectuate the fair-trial guarantee of the Sixth Amendment\u201d. <em>United States v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., </em>497 F.2d 102, 104 (5th Cir. 1974). \u201cGiven the pervasiveness of modern communications and the difficulty of effacing prejudicial publicity from the minds of the jurors, the trial courts must take strong measures to ensure that the balance is never weighed against the accused.\u201d <em>Sheppard v. Maxwell, </em>384 U.S. 333, 362, 86 S.Ct. 1507, 1522, 16 L.Ed.2d 600 (1966). In a widely publicized case, \u201cthe right of the accused to trial by an impartial jury can be seriously threatened by the conduct of the news media prior to and during trial\u201d. Report of the Committee on the Operation of the Jury System on the \u201cFree Press-Fair Trial\u201d Issue, 45 F.R.D. 391, 394 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-14\">Thus, it is the trial judge\u2019s primary responsibility to govern judicial proceedings so as to ensure that the accused receives a fair, orderly trial comporting with fundamental due process. The trial judge is therefore granted broad discretion in ordering the daily activities of his court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1210\">*1210</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 401. \u201c[A] trial judge should have the authority to adopt reasonable measures to avoid injury to the parties by reason of prejudicial or inflammatory publicity\u201d. <em>Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. </em>v. <em>Young, supra, </em>522 F.2d at 241. See also, <em>United States v. Schiavo, supra, </em>504 F.2d at 6; <em>United States v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., supra, </em>497 F.2d at 106-07. Within this discretion, therefore, the district judge can place restrictions on parties, jurors, lawyers, and others involved with the proceedings despite the fact that such restrictions might affect First Amendment considerations. Sixth Amendment rights of the accused must be protected always. <em>United States v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., supra; United States v. Schiavo, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1282-4\">The trial judge in this case did not abuse his discretion in imposing the challenged restrictions on press access to documents. The refusal to direct that the names and addresses of the jurors be publicly released<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> was well within the bounds of such discretion. See \u201cFree Press-Fair Trial\u201d, <em>supra, </em>45 F.R.D. at 410. Similarly, the trial judge had the duty of determining which exhibits were entitled to come into evidence. The press has no right of access to exhibits produced under subpoena and not yet admitted into evidence, hence not yet in the public domain. When exhibits were received into evidence and the subject of scrutiny by press and public it was reasonable for the court to condition their examination by the press upon the Clerk\u2019s availability.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1282-7\">Bench conferences between judge and counsel outside of public hearing are an established practice, \u201cFree Press-Fair Trial\u201d, <em>supra, </em>45 F.R.D. at 403, and protection of their privacy is generally within the court\u2019s discretion.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> No abuse of discretion with respect to the conduct of the bench conferences is demonstrated by the appellants. Such conferences are an integral part of the internal management of a trial, and screening them from access by the press is well within a trial judge\u2019s broad discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-8\">The district judge committed no error in denying access by appellants to Senator Gurney\u2019s grand jury testimony, and to the written communications between the judge and the jury. Gurney\u2019s grand jury testimony was not read to the jury in its entirety. The portion not published remained under the cloak of secrecy imposed by Rule 6(e), F.R.Crim.P. The judge permitted the appellant newsmen to obtain a transcript of that portion of the testimony read to the jury. It was proper to refuse to require the Clerk to blank out the unread portions of the grand jury testimony and deliver the transcript so excised to the news media.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-9\">The press clearly has no constitutional right of access to the written communications between judge and jury. Compelling governmental interest in the integrity of jury deliberation requires that the priva<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1211\">*1211</page-number>cy of such deliberations and communications dealing with them be preserved. Confidentiality is a shield against external considerations entering into the deliberative process. Such a shield prevents undermining of the integrity of the jury system. Juries must be permitted to deliberate fully and freely, unhampered by the pressures and extraneous influences which could result from access by the press to the deliberative process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-5\">The First Amendment does not protect against whatever incidental burdens on newsgathering occurred in this case. The trial judge employed reasonable \u201cremedial measures\u201d, far short of prior restraints, to prevent possible prejudice and maintain an orderly trial. See <em>Sheppard, supra, </em>384 U.S. at 362, 86 S.Ct. at 1522. The appellants were in no way prevented from investigating the other available sources to obtain the desired information. The district court\u2019s rulings denying press access implemented a legitimate governmental interest in securing for the accused the fair trial guaranteed them by the Sixth Amendment. The court\u2019s actions bore a reasonable relation to the achievement of that .purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-6\">Finally, we find no error in the district court\u2019s failure to hold hearings and issue special orders regarding the appellants\u2019 requests for information. The oral rulings of the district judge specifically stated what was being withheld from the appellants. At the June 20, 1975, hearing and in his written order, the trial judge sufficiently explained his reasons for denying appellants access to documents. The subsequent requests were substantively identical to the requests considered at the June 30, 1975 hearing, and disposed of in the July 1 order. The terms of the orders and the reasons therefore were clearly stated.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1283-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s rulings appealed from are each</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1277-9\">. The trial in question was the criminal trial of former Senator Edward J. Gurney and others. <em>(United States v.

In their petition, appellants did not seek direct access to bench conferences as such.

Alternative sources of information were available to appellants: the parties, the witnesses, the attorneys and members of the public generally. Appellants\u2019 attempt to analogize the instant case to <em>Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Young, </em>text, <em>supra, </em>fails. In <em>Young </em>CBS sought mandamus from the Sixth Circuit against the judge (District Judge Don J. Young) who was about to try a number of civil cases arising from the Kent State shootings on the campus of that University on May 4, 1970. There was widespread attendant publicity, and Judge Young had entered a \u201cgag\u201d order restraining everyone remotely concerned with the cases, including counsel, parties, court personnel, relatives, friends and associates, from discussing the cases with the media or members of the public. Of course no such sweeping order is involved here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1280-13\">. \u201cWhen representatives of the communications media attend trials they have no greater rights than other members of the public\u201d. <em>Estes v. Texas, </em>381 U.S. 532, 584, 85 S.Ct. 1628, 1654, 14 L.Ed.2d 543 (1965) (Warren, J\u201e concurring).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1281-10\">. It appears that the logical extension of the media\u2019s right of access analysis is to determine what right of access the public has. The public right of access, however, has yet to be defined by the Supreme Court. Such a broad determination is not required by the limited questions presented for review here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-11\">It is interesting to note, however, that in recent years rights of public access to government information have been established through legislative action, on the federal level for instance by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, The Freedom of Information Act (as Amended 1974). This statute has served as the model for similar legislation by many of the states.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1281-16\">. Appellants complain that their access to exhibits which were part of the public record was also unconstitutionally restricted. The trial judge permitted such access, but it was conditioned on his Court Clerk\u2019s availability. The reasonableness of this action is discussed <em>infra, </em>Note 13 and accompanying text.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1282-5\">. During the jury selection process, the names of the persons selected and other jurors being examined were called in open court. The district court imposed no restriction on publication of the names called in open court. But the judge was following a well-established practice when he refused to publicly release the jury list, which included the names, addresses, and other personal information about the jurors. Such protection of the privacy of the jurors was clearly permissible, and certainly appropriate in a trial which attracted public attention as this one did.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1282-6\">. In the hearing held on appellants\u2019 Petition, the district judge pointed to his trial Clerk\u2019s other taxing duties and the large number of exhibits involved as the basis for this restriction. There were several hundred exhibits in tes case. The Clerk must account strictly for all exhibits in his safekeeping. Thus, it is of utmost importance for him to maintain them in systematic order, available when called for by court or counsel. These factors made it necessary to limit examination by the press to such times as the Clerk was available.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1282-10\">. \u201cIt is elementary that <em>in camera </em>inspection of evidence is always a procedure calling for scrupulous protection against any release or publication of material not found by the court, at that stage, probably admissible in evidence and relevant to the issues of the trial for which . it is sought.\u201d <em>United States v. Nixon, supra, </em>418 U.S. at 714, 94 S.Ct. at 3110-3111.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1283-7\">. Appellants rely on <em>United States v. Schiavo, supra, </em>to establish the requirement to hold hearings and issue special orders. In that case, however, the oral order: (1) gave no indication of the reasons for the order; and (2) failed to state specifically what conduct was being restrained. No such deficiencies are present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-8\">Moreover, it is unreasonable to require a district judge to hold hearings and to issue special orders with respect to every request he is presented with by the press during the course of a long trial. The later requests here were oral and informal. The judge responded in kind. It is the trial court\u2019s responsibility to decide which documents will be placed in the public domain, and which are entitled to privacy and confidentiality. These decisions are discretionary, numerous, and form an integral part of trial management. The efficient administration of the trial courts would be significantly impaired should we require hearings and special orders for each such decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
