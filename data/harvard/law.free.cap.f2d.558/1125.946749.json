Mullens, </em>2 Cir., 536 F.2d 997, 998 n. 1 (1976), and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Faruolo, </em>2 Cir., 506 F.2d 490, 491 n. 1 (1974), Lawrence Friedman appeals from a judgment of conviction in the Southern District, entered upon his plea of guilty on March 4, 1977 to conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute methaqualone capsules, a controlled substance, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 812 and 841. Friedman seeks reversal of his conviction principally on two grounds: that his incriminatory statements to the federal agents at the Drug Administration Offices following his arrest in Clifton, New Jersey on September 24, 1975 were coerced; and, that he had been promised immunity by the Assistant United States Attorney.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1198-16\">Friedman was arrested by federal agents after he delivered 10,000 capsules of metha-qualone to Joseph Pollini, an undercover New York City Police Officer, with the expectation of receiving $15,000 therefor. Following this, Friedman\u2019s wife, who earlier had taken part in arranging the sale, was arrested. Thereafter, both Friedmans cooperated with the government in disclosing the source of the methaqualone. Mrs. Friedman was not prosecuted. Judge Lasker suspended imposition of sentence on Friedman and placed him on probation for 18 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-17\">Judge Lasker held a hearing on appellant\u2019s claims at which Friedman, Mrs. Friedman, three government agents who participated in the Friedmans\u2019 arrests, and Assistant United States Attorney Flynn testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-18\">Judge Lasker found that Friedman voluntarily decided to cooperate when he learned from his wife that she had already decided to do so. Judge Lasker found that both Friedman, then a law student, and his wife, a teacher, were \u201cmature, knowing citizens,\u201d who \u201cknew entirely what they were doing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-19\">Judge Lasker also rejected the claim that Assistant United States Attorney Flynn had promised Friedman immunity. The court found that Mr. Flynn had made it clear to Friedman that he could not promise that he would not be prosecuted and that, in fact, Flynn had repeatedly stated that he could not guarantee what the outcome of the proceedings would be. Further, the court noted that Friedman was \u201cextremely dilatory in asserting . . . that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1127\">*1127</page-number>subsequent indictments were barred by Mr. Flynn\u2019s promises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-5\">Examination of the record fully supports Judge Lasker\u2019s conclusions; there is no reason to believe that his findings were clearly erroneous. See, e. g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lucchetti, </em>533 F.2d 28, 36 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 849, 97 S.Ct. 136, 50 L.Ed.2d 122 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-6\">Convictions affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1198-12\">. Appellant\u2019s third argument on appeal, that the statutory scheme empowering the Attorney General to classify, reclassify, and declassify drugs is unconstitutional, was disposed of by this court\u2019s opinion in <em>United States v. Pastor, </em>557 F.2d 930, 939 - 942 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
