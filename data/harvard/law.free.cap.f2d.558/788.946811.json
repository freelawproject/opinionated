We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>Facts disclosed at the plea proceedings adequately established that the assaults were committed on Lackland Air Force Base, within exclusive federal jurisdiction. The crime was not service connected, and the district court, rather than the military courts, properly exercised jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">The court\u2019s conclusion from the plea proceedings that there was an adequate factual basis for the plea was not erroneous. Nor did it commit any error in determining on the record before it that the plea was voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">Imposing consecutive 5-year sentences for the two assaults was lawful in the circumstances. Nor can appellant complain of the confiscation of the gun used in the assaults. Appellants claim of selective prosecution, excessive bail, and undue delay in bringing him before a magistrate are also meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">The disposition of \u00a7 2255 petitions filed by appellant subsequent to the taking of this appeal is not properly before us for review. Nor is his parole status. Similarly, we will not consider on direct appeal appellant\u2019s allegation of an unfulfilled representation by defense counsel that, probation would be granted. <em>See United States v. Coronado, </em>554 F.2d 166, 170-71 n. 6 (5th Cir. 1977). Limiting our consideration to only the formal filings, the rule 11 transcript, and the sentencing transcript, which constitute the complete record before us, we find no ineffectiveness of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
