The sole issue on appeal is whether 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 659 authorizes the garnishment of wages payable by the United States in order to enforce a judgment for attorney\u2019s fees awarded in connection with a judgment for alimony and child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-21\">Wanda Murray obtained a judgment from the Circuit Court of Jackson County, Missouri, dissolving her marriage and directing her former husband, Johnnie Lee Murray, to pay child support and alimony. Johnnie Lee Murray was also directed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1341\">*1341</page-number>pay appellant\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees to the attorney. Approximately one month later, the state court ordered on its own motion that the attorney\u2019s fees be awarded to Mrs. Murray instead of her attorney. In September 1975, appellant Murray served a summons of garnishment, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 659, on the United States (which employs Mr. Murray) seeking unpaid child support, alimony, and attorney\u2019s fees. The garnishment action was subsequently removed to the United States District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-5\">The relevant statute reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1413-6\">\u00a7 659. Consent by United States to garnishment and similar proceedings for enforcement of child support and alimony obligations</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1413-7\">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, effective January 1, 1975, moneys (the entitlement to which is based upon remuneration for employment) due from, or payable by, the United States (including any agency or instrumentality thereof and any wholly owned Federal corporation) to any individual, including members of the armed services, shall be subject, in like manner and to the same extent as if the United States were a private person, to legal process brought for the enforcement, against such individual of his legal obligations to provide child support or make alimony payments. [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 659.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1413-8\">The district court determined that federal law, not state law defining alimony and child support, controls in interpreting \u00a7 659. The court discussed the applicable federal law as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1413-9\">It is settled that \u201c[t]he United States, as sovereign, is immune from suit save as it consents to be sued.\u201d <em>United States v. Sherwood, </em>312 U.S. 584, 586, 61 S.Ct. 767, 85 L.Ed. 1058 (1941). Waivers of sovereign immunity must be construed strictly and in accordance with the principle that \u201csuit may not be maintained against the United States in any case not clearly within the terms of the statute by which it consents to be sued.\u201d <em>United States v. Michel, </em>282 U.S. 656, 659, 51 S.Ct. 284, 75 L.Ed. 598 (1931). Under these principles, the scope of a waiver of immunity must be defined by the specific language of the statute in question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1413-11\">In the instant case the language of \u00a7 659 is clear. The statute subjects the United States to suit for the enforcement only of \u201clegal obligations to provide child support or make alimony payments.\u201d The statute does not by its terms grant permission to enforce a judgment for attorneys\u2019 fees and, under the rule of strict construction applicable in cases of this nature, the Court cannot infer such permission where the statute does not plainly so provide. Therefore, garnishee\u2019s motion for summary judgment will be granted and petitioner\u2019s motion for summary judgment will be denied as to the claim for attorneys\u2019 fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1413-12\">Subsequent to the decision of the district court, Congress amended and \u201cclarified\u201d \u00a7 659. The new provisions read, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1413-13\">SEC. 501. CLARIFICATION OF GARNISHMENT PROVISIONS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1413-15\">(d) DEFINITIONS. \u2014 Part D of title IV of such Act is further amended by adding after section 461 (as added by subsection (c) of this section) the following new section:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1413-16\">\u201cDEFINITIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1413-17\">\u201cSEC. 462. For purposes of section 459 [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 659]\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1413-19\">\u201c(b) The term \u2018child support\u2019, when used in reference to the legal obligations of an individual to provide such support, means periodic payments of funds for the support and maintenance of a child or children with respect to which such individual has such an obligation, and (subject to and in accordance with State law) includes but is not limited to, payments to provide for health care, education, recreation, clothing, or to meet other specific needs of such a child or children; <em>such term also includes attorney\u2019s fees, </em>inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1342\">*1342</page-number>est, and court costs, when and to the extent that the same are expressly made recoverable as such pursuant to a decree, order, or judgment issued in accordance with applicable State law by a court of competent jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1414-4\">\u201c(c) The term \u2018alimony\u2019, when used in reference to the legal obligations of an individual to provide the same, means periodic payments of funds for the support and maintenance of the spouse (or former spouse) of such individual, and (subject to and in accordance with State law) includes but is not limited to, separate maintenance, alimony pendente lite, maintenance, and spousal support; <em>sueh term also includes attorney\u2019s fees, </em>interest, and court costs when and to the extent that the same are expressly made recoverable as such pursuant to a decree, order, or judgment issued in accordance with applicable State law by a court of competent jurisdiction. Such term does not include any payment or transfer of property or its value by an individual to his spouse or former spouse in compliance with any community property settlement, equitable distribution of property, or other division of property between spouses or former spouses.\u201d [Tax Reduction Act of 1977; Pub.L. No. 95-30, \u00a7 501, 91 Stat. 157 (May 23, 1977) (to be codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 662) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1414-5\">The above-quoted definitions of the terms \u201cchild support\u201d and \u201calimony,\u201d which the Government in its supplementary brief concedes should be applied to this appeal, now become dispositive of the issues presented in this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The judgment of the district court is therefore vacated, and the case is remanded to the district court for disposition and the entry of an appropriate judgment in light of the recent clarifying amendments.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1414-8\">Appellant is entitled to costs on appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1414-6\">. The Government\u2019s brief recites that \u201cpractical considerations warrant application of the new law in this particular case in order to avoid the inconvenience of forcing plaintiff to pursue unnecessary formalities.\u201d [Response of United States, filed June 29, 1977.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1414-19\">. The Government has filed a recent motion to now dismiss the appeal as moot because Johnnie Lee Murray has allegedly terminated his military service. We deny the motion without prejudice to its resubmission to the district court on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
