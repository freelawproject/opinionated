The application asserted first use of the mark on June 1, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Registration was opposed by Roux Laboratories, Inc. (Roux), which asserted prior and continuing use of the trademark WHITE MINX for hair coloring preparations; ownership of a Supplemental Registration of WHITE MINX for hair coloring preparation in the nature of a rinse;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and prior use of ultra WHITE MINX for hair coloring preparations. As testified on direct-examination by Roux\u2019s witness, Mr. Kuchinski, the management of Roux believed that: (1) in view of Roux\u2019s long and continued use of WHITE MINX and its use of ultra WHITE MINX, these marks were so similar to ULTRA MINK as to be likely, when La Cade\u2019s mark is applied to its goods, to cause confusion, inasmuch as MI-N-K is pronounced the same way as MI-N-X, and (2) since La Cade disclaimed the word MINK in its application, it was attempting to register for its exclusive use the <em>merely descriptive </em>word ultra. Accordingly, Roux pleaded two causes of action in its notice of opposition: (1) likelihood of confusion when the respective marks of the parties are applied to the respective goods of the parties, based on section 2(d) of the Trademark Act,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and (2) mere descriptiveness of La Cade\u2019s mark, based on section 2(e)(1) of the Trademark Act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">In the board\u2019s view, however, the issues were significantly narrowed by Roux\u2019s voluntary statements made during the cross-examination of Mr. Kuchinski by La Cade\u2019s counsel. In the course of cross-examination, said the board, Roux\u2019s counsel withdrew and abandoned the cause of action based on likelihood of confusion and stated that the only issue in the case was the descriptiveness of La Cade\u2019s mark. The board decided the case on that basis. It found that ULTRA MINK is not merely descriptive and dismissed the opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">\n<em>Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b106-11\">The sole issue is whether the board erred in finding that Roux had abandoned the cause of action pleaded in its notice of opposition under section 2(d) of the Trademark Act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This is an issue of first impression before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-12\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b106-13\">We are in substantial agreement with the board\u2019s view of this case. Since the facts speak for themselves, the following colloquies between counsel for Roux, Mr. Sullivan, and counsel for La Cade, Mr. Brezina, are reproduced from the cross-examination of Roux\u2019s witness, Mr. Kuchinski (our emphasis supplied):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-14\">XQ98 * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-15\">When did your company first have knowledge of any use of Blue Mink and hair shampoo by Lawrence Pharmaceuticals?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-16\">MR. SULLIVAN: I object to this line of questioning on the grounds that it is entirely irrelevant. <em>The only issue herein involved is whether or not the applicant is entitled to use \u201cultra\u201d as a trademark.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-17\">\n<em>We are not involved with the question involving the Trademark M-i-n-k, which has been disclaimed by the applicant.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-18\">\n<em>Our objection is based solely on applicant\u2019s use of \u201cultra.\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>XQ109 I show you Applicant\u2019s Exhibit 2, which is a principal registration for \u201cBlue Mink\u201d for liquid spray for style setting of hair issued to James V. Freeman, Incorporated, doing business as James V. Freeman, Inc., of Jacksonville, Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">First of all, are you familiar with that mark as used on that product?</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-5\">MR. SULLIVAN: Excuse me. I object to this line of questioning on the grounds that it is immaterial0 as to whether or not there are existing registrations which include \u201cmink,\u201d m-i-n-k or m-i-n-x in the name of other than the opposer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-6\">\n<em>The only issue involved here is whether or not the applicant is entitled to obtain a registration of the term \u201cultra\u201d as a trademark so as to preclude competitors from using it properly as a descriptive term.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-7\">A continuing objection to all of these registrations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">XQ121 Is there any agreement with Leon Products about their use of the term \u201cMink\u201d with other prefixes other than \u201cWhite\u201d?</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-10\">MR. SULLIVAN: I would like to renew my running objection that <em>the only question involved here is the applicant's right to use the descriptive term \u201cultra.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-11\"><em>We do not object to its use of the term \u201cMink,\u201d which has been disclaimed by applicant. </em>Neither have we objected to the use of others using the term \u201cMink,\u201d but <em>we are objecting to the use of the descriptive term \u201cultra\u201d </em>which we had adopted and used as part of the \u201cultra White Minx\u201d trademark but using \u201cultra\u201d merely in its descriptive connotation, <em>and that is the whole substance of this opposition.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-21\">RXQ179 Does Roux in this case contend that there is confusing similarity between marks containing the suffix \u201cMink\u201d and \u201cMinx,\u201d M-i-n-x.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-22\">MR. SULLIVAN: The record will show, the notice of opposition will show, that Roux maintains that the applicant has disclaimed the word \u201cMink\u201d and the only word remaining in its registration not disclaimed is the descriptive term \u201cultra\u201d; and if ultra has any trademark connotation, it was used previously to the first use of applicant by opposer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-23\">RXQ180 Do you adopt that as an answer to my question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-24\">A Definitely.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-25\">We agree with the board that the unequivocal meaning of Mr. Sullivan\u2019s statements is that Roux from that point on relied on the cause of action pleaded under section 2(e)(1) of the Act only, having abandoned the cause of action pleaded in the notice of opposition under section 2(d) of the Act. Roux\u2019s main argument is that 37 CFR 2.116(a)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> makes the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure applicable to inter partes proceedings. Roux urges that the Federal Rules, specifically Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(e) and 8(f),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> provide for alternative pleadings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>which shall be so construed as to do substantial justice. We fully agree. The point is, however, that in this proceeding Roux expressly abandoned the cause of action pleaded under section 2(d). That Roux was entitled to set forth alternative causes of action in its notice of opposition is- not controverted. However, Roux here urges an altogether different proposition, viz., that it was entitled to make statements during the testimony period expressly abandoning one of the causes of action and that it should not be bound by those statements now. On the contrary, we believe that Roux\u2019s statements necessarily gave rise to an equitable estoppel which prevents Roux from now asserting that likelihood of confusion is an issue. It seems clear to us that any other ruling would have a negative effect on the orderly administration of inter partes proceedings before the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Roux further argues that \u201ccounsel\u2019s statement[s] made in objecting to cross-examination, which is directed at any given moment to a highly specific set of circumstances, are not being carefully thought out in the sense of preparation of a complaint or answer thereto * * However, while Mr. Sullivan\u2019s statements may not have been \u201ccarefully thought out,\u201d his adversary relied on those statements during the testimony period by neither pursuing cross-examination nor filing exhibits relating to the issue of likelihood of confusion. Such reliance was reasonable in view of Mr. Sullivan\u2019s repeated statements that the only issue in the case was descriptiveness, and Roux cannot now resurrect an issue which it has \"affirmatively stated was not an issue on this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">In conclusion, we hold that the board did not err in finding that Roux had abandoned the cause of action pleaded in its notice of opposition under section 2(d) of the Trademark Act. The decision of the board is, accordingly, <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b105-16\">. 192 USPQ 458 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b105-17\">.
