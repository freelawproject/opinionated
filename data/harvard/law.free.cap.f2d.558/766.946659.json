The legal issue is a variation of that decided in favor of the Government in <em>United States v. Bender Welding &amp; Machine Co., </em>- F.2d -, Docket Nos. 76-1770 and 76-1916, with which this case was consolidated. In those cases the employees were covered by the federal Longshoremen\u2019s compensation act, here by a state compensation act. The result, rationale, and holding of cases are the same. We treat this case separately only to more easily discuss the issue in the state compensation act context. Here the state board directed the compensation carrier to pay the cost of medical care provided by the V.A. hospital. The district court set aside that part of the award. We reverse the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-18\">Adams, a veteran, was injured in the course of his employment with Affiliated Foods, Inc., a company subject to the Texas Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. He was admitted to the Veterans Administration hospital, but transferred immediately to a private hospital for surgery. A few days later he returned to the V.A. hospital where he remained until his discharge two weeks later.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-19\">Adams had been admitted to the V.A. hospital only after the Veterans Administration had determined, in accordance with 38 U.S.G.A. \u00a7 610(a)(1)(B), that he was a veteran with a non-service-connected disability, and was \u201cunable to defray the expenses of necessary hospital or nursing home care.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Subsequent to his release, Adams filed a claim for state workmen\u2019s compensation. The Veterans Administration then obtained an assignment of all workmen\u2019s compensation claims that he might have for medical services rendered by the Veterans Administration, and billed him for the cost of these services.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-20\">The Texas Industrial Accident Board approved a \u201ccompromise settlement\u201d between Adams and Texas Employers\u2019 Insurance Association, which included \u201call accrued hospital and medical expenses resulting from [Adams\u2019] injury \u2014 no exception.\u201d The carrier paid the private hospital bill but refused to pay the Veterans Administration\u2019s claim. The Board then ordered payment. On the carrier\u2019s petition for review, removed by the Government from the state court, the district court entered judgment for the carrier. The Government\u2019s appeal to this Court ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>The Texas Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 8306, \u00a7 7 (Vernon Supp. 1976-1977),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> provides that an employee shall have the sole right to select or choose the persons or facilities to furnish medical aid, chiropractic services, hospital services, and nursing in connection with a job-related injury covered by the Act, \u201cand the Association shall be obligated for same.\u201d The clear import of the statute is that the employer shall be liable to the employee for medical expenses incurred in the treatment of a compensable injury. There is no question in the instant case regarding the Act\u2019s coverage of the injury in question. Nor is there any question as to the private hospital\u2019s entitlement to the costs incurred for surgery and treatment. The Texas courts, discussing the predecessor statute, have held that a private physician and hospital that render medical services to an injured employee have a right to recover the costs incurred from the compensation carrier. <em>Maryland Casualty Co. v. Hendrick Memorial Hospital, </em>169 S.W.2d 965 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014Eastland 1942), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>141 Tex. 23, 169 S.W.2d 969 (1943); <em>Texas Employers\u2019 Insurance Ass\u2019n v. Herron, </em>29 S.W.2d 524 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014Waco 1930, <em>writ dismissed).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">The only questions presented here are whether the employee can recover the cost of medical care that would have been furnished free by the V.A. hospital, but for the compensation coverage; and, if so, whether the Government is entitled to subrogation to the employee's rights, having taken an assignment pursuant to 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 17.48(d) (1976).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Based on the general purpose of the Texas Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, which is not unlike the purpose of the federal Longshoremen\u2019s compensation act, and our opinion in <em>United States v. Bender Welding v. Machine Co., </em>558 F.2d 761, Docket Nos. 76-1770, 76-1916, decided with this case, we hold that the Government should be reimbursed by the compensation carrier for the medical expenses incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-12\">Motivating the enactment of the Texas Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act was the broad economic theory that industrial accident costs should be chargeable to the industries as part of their overhead expenses. <em>Southern Surety Co. v. Inabnit, </em>1 S.W.2d 412 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014Eastland 1927, <em>no writ); Employers Mutual Liability Insurance Co. v. Konvicka, </em>197 F.2d 691 (5th Cir. 1952). The Texas courts have consistently held that the compensation laws should be liberally construed to further the remedial purposes for which they were enacted. <em>Travelers Insurance Co. v. Adams, </em>407 S.W.2d 282 (Tex.Civ.App.-Texarkana 1966, <em>writ ref\u2019d n. r. </em>e.).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-13\">The Veterans\u2019 Benefits Act, on the other hand, was intended to authorize free hospital care for non-service-connected injuries only to those veterans unable to defray the necessary medical costs. The Act was not intended to relieve an employer of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>statutory duty of compensating an injured employee for the expenses incurred in the treatment of a job-related injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">Effectuation of the purposes of both statutes requires a holding that the injured employee should be able to recover from the compensation carrier the costs of medical care furnished by the Veterans Administration. A contrary holding would be a windfall to the insurance carrier merely because the employee was a veteran able to obtain care at a V.A. hospital, and would be inconsistent with the right of recovery afforded a private hospital. No valid reason appears for drawing a distinction between the two, where the employee has been billed. Nor does a valid reason appear for burdening the Government with the costs of a job-related injury, which should more appropriately be borne by the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b839-13\">.
