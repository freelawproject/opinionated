We agree with the state that petitioner suffered no constitutional deprivation at his trial, and therefore we reverse the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-10\">At petitioner\u2019s trial for armed robbery, the state introduced evidence that petitioner stated to the arresting officer, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my idea.\u201d Petitioner claims that the statement was elicited by a question asked by the officer, prior to giving <em>Miranda </em>warnings. The state claims that the petitioner\u2019s statement was made prior to any question asked by the officer. Unfortunately, the officer\u2019s testimony at trial is ambiguous and inconclusive.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, in the state appellate proceedings in this case, found that the statement was made in response to the officer\u2019s question, but was admissible as <em>res gestae. Beam v. State, </em>500 S.W.2d 802, 804 (Tex.Cr.App. 1973). That court affirmed the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-21\">The federal district court in the federal <em>habeas corpus </em>action followed the Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019 determination that the statement was made in response to a question, but held the admission of the statement to be error as a violation of <em>Miranda, </em>since state evidence law (the <em>res gestae </em>argument) does not override federal constitutional law. The court then held the admission of the statement not to be harmless error, and granted the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>But in <em>Pilcher v. Estelle, </em>528 F.2d 623 (5 Cir. 1976), the Fifth Circuit, reviewing the same state court transcript as involved in this case,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> held that the statement in question was volunteered, and was made prior to any police questioning. 528 F.2d at 624. While the district court\u2019s finding in this case that the statement followed a police question could not be termed clearly erroneous, the district court is bound to follow the Fifth Circuit\u2019s view of the law and the evidence. Our panel, also, must follow the decisions of earlier panels. The Fifth Circuit views this evidence as a volunteered statement. As such, it does not violate <em>Miranda.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b855-11\">. The federal <em>habeas </em>petition as originally filed contained a claim that was not included in the state <em>habeas </em>petition and thus was not exhausted. This claim asserts denial of a constitutional right to self-representation on appeal. At the hearing on the federal <em>habeas </em>petition, however, the petitioner took the stand and waived the claim. The court questioned him closely before accepting the waiver. <em>See </em>R. Vol. Ill at 23-26. Subsequently, however, petitioner apparently sent a letter to Judge Rives of this Court, in which he objected to what he considered to be counsel\u2019s improper waiver of the pro <em>se </em>appeal claim. In his brief and in oral argument before this Court, however, petitioner\u2019s counsel stated his belief that petitioner knowingly and intelligently waived the unex-hausted claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-12\">The petitioner\u2019s waiver of the unexhausted constitutional claim at the evidentiary hearing on his <em>habeas </em>petition is valid and binding. Therefore, the exhaustion problems of that claim evaporate. It is as though the federal <em>habeas </em>petition never raised the claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b855-13\">.

Yes, sir, he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-15\">Q. What did he say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-16\">A. He said, \u201cIt was not my idea.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-17\">Q. Did he say anything else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-18\">A. No, sir, that\u2019s all he would say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-19\">Q. Officer Schwebel, you say this was about a minute and a half after you first arrested these Defendants?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-22\">A. Yes, sir, I would say, approximately.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-23\">Q. Where were they when this conversation took place?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAH\">A. Seated in the squad car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-25\">Q. They were both inside your car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-26\">A. Yes, sir, they were.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-27\">Q. And did you ask them any questions at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-28\">A. Well, I only asked him if they wanted to tell me what the story was. Mr. Beam, he stated that he wasn\u2019t involved either, that\u2019s all he would keep saying and I said, \u201cWell, who\u2019s idea was it,\u201d and he never would say, so\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-29\">Q. So what Mr. Beam said, then, was in response to a question you asked him about what the story was, wasn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-30\">A. I don\u2019t believe I asked him anything, he sat in the car and I proceeded to place Mr. Pilcher back and then I went and sat down under the steering wheel of the car and then the man stated to me, \u201cIt was not my idea,\u201d before any questioning had been done on my part.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-31\">Q. I believe you told us just a little while ago that you had asked him some questions about if they wanted to tell you what happened and he said, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my idea;\u201d now, which time do you think was correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-32\">A. Well, the man made a statement to me before I had asked him any questions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b855-33\">R. at 300-02.
