The Government says that the decision does not preclude it, arguing that the board\u2019s ruling was purely advisory and therefore not binding on it under <em>S &amp; E Contractors, Inc. v. United States, </em>406 U.S. 1, 92 S.Ct. 1411, 31 L.Ed.2d 658 (1972). We conclude that on the peculiar facts of this case, the Government must abide by what the board held.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-13\">The controversy on which the board ruled had its genesis in contract NObsr-77628, a cost-plus-fixed-fee research and development contract entered into between plaintiff and the Government, acting through the Department of the Navy, on June 16, 1959. The contract called for plaintiff to design and furnish experimental, mock-up, and developmental models of a single sideband radio set and a single sideband portable transceiver. The Patent Rights clause of the contract<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> granted the Government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>an irrevocable, nonexclusive, nontransferable, royalty-free license in all inventions (whether patentable or not) \u201cconceived or first actually reduced to practice\u201d in the performance of research and development work under the contract. Some nine patented inventions held by plaintiff were ultimately identified as useable for performance of the contract, by agreement of plaintiff\u2019s and the Navy\u2019s representatives during a conference in May 1964. However, at that time, and continuing down to the present, plaintiff conceded that only four of the inventions were licensed to the Government under the Patent Rights clause. The other five, according to plaintiff, were conceived and reduced to practice during plaintiff\u2019s own, independent project to develop a single sideband transceiver, called the SC900A, prior to the award of contract NObsr-77628, and thus were not licensed to the Government under that contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-4\">Less than 1 year after this conference, in March 1965, plaintiff informed the Navy that the latter\u2019s then-intended procurement of single sideband radios from another contractor would infringe the five patents. The Navy responded that it was licensed to practice those inventions under the Patent Rights clause of the parties\u2019 contract, on the theory that they had first been conceived or reduced to practice in the course of performing the contract. Plaintiff refused the Navy\u2019s request to execute confirmatory licenses for the Government to practice the inventions, but did not again raise its infringement claim until February 1968, after the procurement from the other contractor was completed. In March 1968 the Navy repeated its original response, having concluded that plaintiff\u2019s submission of additional data in February in support of its position did not prove actual reduction to practice prior to the contract award. Following further exchange of correspondence, the contracting officer for NObsr-77628 rendered a \u201cfinal decision\u201d determining that the Government was licensed to practice the five inventions, and informed plaintiff that \u201c[decisions on disputed questions of fact and on other questions that are subject to the procedure of the Disputes clause [of the Government contract] may be appealed in accordance with the provisions of the Disputes clause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-7\">Plaintiff appealed the contracting officer\u2019s decision to the board, where the parties presented evidence and made arguments on the license issue. Neither party suggested at any time before the board\u2019s decision was rendered that the board lacked jurisdiction to decide the matter under the Disputes clause, nor was lack of jurisdiction raised by the board. Plaintiff prevailed in the proceeding, the board finding that the five inventions had been conceived and actually reduced to practice prior to the award of the research and development contract. <em>General Dynamics Corp., Electronics Div., </em>ASBCA No. 14466, 73\u20141 BCA \u00b6 9960 (Mar. 22, 1973). This decision, however, though favorable to plaintiff, did not by any means end plaintiff\u2019s infringement problem. To the contrary, when plaintiff again brought its claim to the Navy, this time for infringement of four of its patents, the patent counsel for the Navel Electronic Systems Command made use of the board\u2019s findings to conclude that two of plaintiff\u2019s patents, Nos. 3,054,057 and 3,151,301, were invalid, and therefore that the inventions could be practiced by the Government without infringement. In a letter to plaintiff in May 1975, the patent counsel relied on the board\u2019s findings of actual reduction to practice prior to the contract award to determine that the two inventions had been on sale, sold, or in public use more than 1 year prior to the filing of the patent applications, and so barred from being patented by 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b) (1970). The letter further held that the other two inventions, patent Nos. 3,060,329 and 3,132,310, were not patentable over the prior art, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 102 and 103, making the patents invalid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>and absolving the Government\u2019s use from the claimed infringement. The Government then practiced plaintiff\u2019s four inventions without payment of royalties therefor, leading plaintiff to file this action for reasonable and entire compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-4\">When the Government answered plaintiff\u2019s petition in this court, it pleaded as a defense that it enjoyed a license to practice plaintiff\u2019s inventions by virtue of the Patent Rights clause of the research and development contract. Plaintiff thereafter moved to strike that defense, claiming that its assertion is barred by the board\u2019s decision that the Government had no such license. We treat plaintiff\u2019s motion as one for partial summary judgment. <em>Cities Service Helex, Inc. v. United States, </em>543 F.2d 1306, 1312, 211 Ct.Cl. 222, 233 (1976). Defendant filed its opposition to this motion, saying that the board lacked jurisdiction to make the decision and concluding that it must be treated in this court as a nullity. Defendant also, as an alternative, moved for partial summary judgment, claiming that if the board\u2019s findings are made applicable to this action, it is as a matter of law entitled to a ruling that the patents \u2019057 and \u2019301, which the Navy\u2019s patent counsel found invalid because of the board\u2019s decision that they had previously been reduced to practice, are indeed invalid as barred by 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b). This contention plaintiff counters with the argument that the sales or uses of the inventions prior to the filing of patent applications therefor were either solely for experimental purposes, or accomplished in less than 1 year before the applications were filed, thus escaping the statute\u2019s on-sale bar. Obviously, plaintiff seeks a trial to establish this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-5\">Defendant\u2019s position that the board lacked jurisdiction to decide the licensing dispute, and consequently that the facts which it found in rendering its opinion are not binding on the Government in this proceeding, lies at the heart of the controversy presently before us. Where the board\u2019s findings are made in a case within its jurisdiction, the reasoning of <em>S &amp; E Contractors, Inc. v. United States, supra, </em>and <em>United States v. Utah Constr. &amp; Min. Co., </em>384 U.S. 394, 86 S.Ct. 1545, 16 L.Ed.2d 642 (1966), mandates that they be applied in any collateral proceeding where the same facts are in issue, and that they be so applied without challenge on the Government\u2019s part. On the other hand, where the board conducts a proceeding beyond its jurisdiction, its findings of fact therein are advisory only, see <em>United States v. Utah Constr. &amp; Min. Co., supra, </em>384 U.S. at 409-11, 86 S.Ct. 1545. The contours of the board\u2019s jurisdiction are fixed by the agreement of the parties, typically expressed in the language of their contract. Thus, \u201cto the extent complete relief is available under a specific provision of the contract, a controversy is regarded as being within the standard Disputes clause,\u201d meaning that the board has jurisdiction. <em>Edward R. Marden Corp. v. United States, </em>442 F.2d 364, 366-67, 194 Ct.Cl. 799, 804 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-7\">Defendant makes a very persuasive argument from the terms of the parties\u2019 contract that the board had no authority to decide the licensing issue, save in an advisory sense. The Patent Rights clause, the \u201cspecific provision of the contract\u201d to which we must look to see if \u201ccomplete relief is available\u201d from the board under the contract, makes reference only to a remedy of the contracting officer, namely, his right to withhold part of the payment due the contractor if a license is thought to belong to the Government but the contractor refuses to disclose the invention to the Government. This penalty device hardly amounts to the provision of complete relief, either for the Government or the contractor. In any event, it is not involved here, for no part of plaintiff\u2019s payment was withheld on account of the licensing dispute, so far as appears from the record before us. If the board\u2019s declaration of the parties\u2019 rights in the patents was intended to be the complete relief available, this is nowhere spelled out in the Patent Rights clause, or in any other clause of the contract. Though the board has for many years heard and decided li<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>censing controversies,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> this may well have occurred under its charter to make advisory rulings in support of the administrative settlement of claims. We have been apprised of no case where the board has been confronted with a challenge to its jurisdiction of a Patent Rights clause dispute, and has undertaken to rule on it. From this it would be difficult to say that the Secretary of Defense has acquiesced, from a longstanding practice, in an interpretation of the Patent Rights clause according such specific and complete relief in disputes arising thereunder as to give the board mandatory jurisdiction. Thus, if we were to look only to the terms of the parties\u2019 contract and interpretation thereof by the Government over the years, we might well be constrained to sustain defendant\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-4\">We think that we need not rule on the scope of the relief available under the Patent Rights clause, however, along with its implications for the board\u2019s mandatory jurisdiction, for another ground appears that supports the board\u2019s binding jurisdiction of the license controversy. As we said just above, the board\u2019s jurisdiction is established by the agreement of the parties. \u201c[T]he coverage of the disputes clause is a matter susceptible of contractual determination, <em>United States v. Moorman, </em>388 U.S. 457, 70 S.Ct. 288, 94 L.Ed. 256 [1950],\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Utah Constr. &amp; Min. Co., supra, </em>384 U.S. at 413, 86 S.Ct. at 1555, and so, for this very reason, the board\u2019s jurisdiction grows out of what the parties intended, <em>id. </em>at 407, 86 S.Ct. 1545, in mutually writing and administering their contract. By their agreement the contracting parties may expand or lessen the kinds of controversies over which the board has mandatory cognizance. This is very different from the situation of the courts. It has been long held and repeatedly said that the parties may not collude to vest jurisdiction in a court, in a case over which its jurisdiction is otherwise lacking, simply by failing to raise the jurisdictional defect. Judicial jurisdiction, of course, depends upon constitutional and statutory grants, which obviously cannot be altered by litigants. <em>See, e. g., Louisville &amp; Nashville R.R. </em>v. <em>Mottley, </em>211 U.S. 149, 29 S.Ct. 42, 53 L.Ed. 126 (1908); <em>Mansfield, Coldwater &amp; Lake Michigan Ry. v. Swan, </em>111 U.S. 379, 4 S.Ct. 510, 28 L.Ed. 462 (1884); Ct.Cl. Rule 38(h). The contracting parties\u2019 agreement to enlarge the mandatory jurisdiction of the board in no way expands the jurisdiction of the court, reviewing the board\u2019s action or applying it, but simply alters the kind of proceeding that takes place in that court, from one of plenary consideration to one of limited review of the administrative record and determination, <em>United States v. Carlo Bianchi &amp; Co., </em>373 U.S. 709, 83 S.Ct. 1409, 10 L.Ed.2d 652 (1963), or of unreviewed application, <em>S &amp; E Contractors, Inc. v. United States, supra. </em>The agreement to give the board cognizance of a new kind of controversy is no different than the agreement granting it power to determine those disputes that all sides concede it already had authority to decide, such as claims for additional costs caused by a change order. Such an agreement was specifically approved in <em>United States v. Moorman, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1062-9\">Those who enter a contract may take steps at any time after its execution to modify it. They may modify not only its substantive provisions but its prescribed procedures, including the procedures for the resolution of disputes. Thus, this court said in <em>Jefferson Constr. Co. v. United States, </em>392 F.2d 1006, 1010, 183 Ct.Cl. 720, 725, <em>cert. denied, </em>393 U.S. 842, 89 S.Ct. 122, 21 L.Ed.2d 113 (1968), \u201cthe parties may, by a waiver agreement, submit a controversy for initial resolution by the court and thereby modify the contractual agreement to proceed before an administrative board.\u201d In <em>Jefferson </em>the contractor appealed to the GSA Board of Contract Appeals a decision of the contracting officer awarding it $17,-000 and a 21-day extension of time to compensate for construction delays caused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>when it encountered unexpected subsoil conditions. The GSABCA upheld the contracting officer\u2019s award but denied the contractor\u2019s claim for additional damages due to the delay, concluding that the claim was actually one for breach of contract over which it had no jurisdiction. The claim was then tried de novo by the court, on agreement of the parties to do so, the court noting that its conduct of the trial in the first instance did not amount to the \u201cduplicative litigation specifically prohibited by <em>United States v. Utah Construction &amp; Mining Co., supra, </em>whereby a dispute is tried before the administrative agency as a claim subject to the contract and then retried before the court as a dispute giving rise to a breach claim.\u201d 392 F.2d at 1010, 183 Ct.Cl. at 726. Thereafter the court said it would take and decide the claim and award any relief due, whether it arose under the contract or was purely for breach, since the GSABCA had removed itself from the controversy, no other policy conflicted with the court\u2019s assumption of jurisdiction, and the parties had effectively modified their contract to permit this. \u201cWhere, as in this case, the Board itself has denied jurisdiction over a claim and the parties have agreed to a trial de novo, the court will decide whether or not the particular dispute is or is not within the scope of the contract and, in either case, give the appropriate relief to which the contractor is entitled.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1063-5\">That the parties to a contract may, at the outset of litigation over the contracting officer\u2019s decision, modify their contract\u2019s provisions on the resolution of disputes, changing the agreed fact finder from one forum to another, is confirmed not only by <em>Jefferson </em>and the reasoning of <em>United States v. Moorman, supra, </em>but as well by other prior cases in this court. <em>Stein Bros. Mfg. Co. v. United States, </em>337 F.2d 861, 162 Ct.Cl. 802 (1963), <em>partially overruled on other grounds, United States v. Anthony Grace &amp; Sons, </em>384 U.S. 424, 430 n. 6, 86 S.Ct. 1539, 16 L.Ed.2d 662 (1966), decided just after <em>United States v. Carlo Bianchi &amp; Co., supra, </em>upheld the receipt of additional evidence and fact-finding thereon by the court, where the Government did not object at the time to a de novo proceeding, despite the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Bianchi </em>that the court\u2019s review under the Wunderlich Act must be confined to the administrative record. The court considered the parties\u2019 choice of forum \u2014 in that instance the choice to proceed before several tribunals \u2014 as a procedural matter governed by principles of contract, capable of rearrangement at any time by agreement of the parties, even in the course of litigation. The <em>Stein Bros, </em>case was cited by the court in <em>C. J. Langenfelder &amp; Son v. United States, </em>341 F.2d 600, 169 Ct.Cl. 465 (1965), in support of the proposition that the parties, at the outset of trial, could agree to bypass the board and have the quantum of damages fixed by the court, even though their contract and the then-recent decision of the Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Anthony Grace &amp; Sons, supra, </em>placed such a determination in the board. <em>Stein Bros., </em>and <em>Langenfelder </em>were cited, in turn, by the <em>Jefferson </em>opinion. <em>Accord, Nager Elec. Co. v. United States, </em>396 F.2d 977, 982-83, 184 Ct.Cl. 390, 401 (1968); <em>National Line Co. v. United States, </em>Ct.Cl. No. 39-76 (order, June 21, 1977). In <em>H. R. Henderson &amp; Co. v. United States, </em>169 Ct.Cl. 228, 245 (1965), where at the contractor\u2019s instance, a number of time-consuming proceedings were conducted at the administrative level for relief under the contract, the court would not hear any assertion by the contractor that the administrative fact-finding was outside the Disputes clause and unauthorized. The court concluded that the contractor was estopped.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-7\">Under the foregoing precedents, we believe that there is no good reason why the Government\u2019s challenge to the finality of the board\u2019s determination in this court should succeed, and ample reason why the Government should not be permitted to escape the results of the administrative proceeding in which it participated without objection. Just as the Government\u2019s attorney in <em>Jefferson </em>could agree with the contractor to change the dispute-resolving terms of the contract, or in <em>Stein Bros. </em>could waive the restrictions of the Disputes clause (in consonance with the contractor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>wishes), so could he agree to modify the contract\u2019s provisions in the present case, when it first came up before the board. If the parties\u2019 contract, as originally drawn, did not specify in the Patent Rights clause the availability of such specific administrative relief as to bring a licensing controversy developing out of that clause within the board\u2019s mandatory jurisdiction, in accordance with <em>United States v. Utah Constr. &amp; Min. Co., supra, </em>there is no reason that the Government\u2019s attorney before the board could not agree to a modification which would cure that jurisdictional defect. This he could do, as the attorneys did in <em>Stein Bros, </em>and <em>Henderson, </em>simply by going forward with the litigation without objecting to the propriety of the forum. We think that the Government\u2019s counsel at the board proceeding did so implicitly agree to enter into a contractual modification with plaintiff, vesting the board with all necessary authority to hear and decide the parties\u2019 licensing dispute with all the finality of the Wunderlich Act as interpreted in <em>S &amp; E Contractors, Inc. v. United States, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1064-4\">The Government\u2019s agreement to modify the parties\u2019 contract, removing all doubt from the board\u2019s right and duty to resolve the license issue, is assuredly authorized by the essentially contractual nature of the board\u2019s mandatory jurisdiction, and its enforcement in this action is perfectly in keeping with the policy against duplicative litigation. Were we to accede to the Government\u2019s argument and grant yet a new hearing, going over the same facts and engaging in fact-finding already once performed, we would violate that policy. To cast aside the administrative record and disposition of the license dispute and require a de novo proceeding in this court would be a wasteful exercise, particularly in light of the fact that the parties were completely satisfied to go before the board at the time. It would also contravene their agreement, which the prior cases say they could make. Accordingly, based upon the precedents, we hold that the modification of the contract, affirming the board\u2019s authority to pass upon the parties\u2019 license dispute, is to be enforced in this action, meaning that the facts as found by the board are binding on defendant within the Supreme Court\u2019s rulings in <em>United States v. Utah Constr. &amp; Min. Co., supra, </em>and <em>S &amp; E Contractors, Inc. v. United States, supra. </em>Though defendant claims, as part of its contention that the Patent Rights clause as originally written in the parties\u2019 contract afforded no basis for the board\u2019s mandatory jurisdiction, that the proceeding in the board was purely an advisory one, it has pointed to no differences between that proceeding and those in which it acknowledges that the board has binding jurisdiction, as concerns the manner of presenting evidence, cross-examining witnesses, finding facts, and so forth. Absent some demonstration that the proceeding was defective, substantially prejudicing defendant\u2019s ability to present its case fully and fairly, precisely because it was a Patent Rights clause proceeding, in keeping with the usual manner in which the board conducted such cases, we have no hesitation to adhere to our holding without qualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-6\">The rule which we derive by analogy from the precedents and which we apply to reach our holding, that the board\u2019s lack of jurisdiction is a defense that may in effect be waived by failure to object in a timely fashion in that forum, is entirely consonant, as already said, with the contractual nature of the board\u2019s authority. This rule is distinguishable from the contrary principle, operating in the courts, that objection to jurisdiction may not be waived, for reasons explained above. Defendant says, however, that application of this rule should not defeat its position. It adheres to its contention that the board\u2019s findings should not be accorded finality, within the meaning of <em>S &amp; E Contractors, Inc. v. United States, supra, </em>because plaintiff\u2019s opposition to defendant\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment supposedly amounts to an attack on those findings, bringing the case under <em>Rocoe-Ajax Constr. Co. v. United States, </em>499 F.2d 639, 204 Ct.Cl. 726 (1974). Defendant makes the argument that plaintiff\u2019s refusal to agree that the facts as found by the board suffice to allow a determination on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>the validity of patents \u2019057 and \u2019301 under the on-sale bar of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b) effectively appeals the board\u2019s findings, permitting defendant to reopen the dispute as well.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1065-5\">We find no merit in this contention. First of all, plaintiff is not in fact appealing any part of the board\u2019s decision. It is content to rely on the facts the board found and on the result the board reached; it proposes, in further proceedings to determine the validity of its patents, to seek no fact-finding contrary to what the board said. <em>See Jefferson Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>392 F.2d at 1010, 183 Ct.Cl. at 726. Secondly, plaintiff can properly accept the board\u2019s fact-finding on the license issue and still ask for a trial to take additional evidence on the validity dispute. Plaintiff asserts that whatever public use it made of its inventions prior to the critical dates, <em>i. e., </em>1 year before the filing of the patent applications, was purely experimental in nature and thus excepted from the statute\u2019s on-sale bar, <em>Sauquoit Fibers Co. v. Leesona Corp. (In re Yarn Processing Patent Validity Litigation), </em>498 F.2d 271 (5th Cir. 1974). The parties\u2019 license and validity disputes concern very different legal questions, and plaintiff\u2019s experimental use claim not surprisingly can, as it does, raise genuine issues of material fact not decided by the board in the license litigation. Plaintiff, then, is not attacking the board\u2019s decision, but is merely asking for a trial to complete the taking of evidence on a matter not before the board. <em>Roscoe-Ajax </em>does not apply, and so defendant may not question the board\u2019s license determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-6\">Defendant additionally points out that giving res judicata effect to the board\u2019s ruling violates, in defendant\u2019s view, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2386 (1970) and 28. U.S.C. \u00a7 1498 (1970), which it says together vest exclusive jurisdiction of patent infringement claims against the Government in this court. Defendant decries the fragmented litigation of plaintiff\u2019s infringement claim, which it says is plaintiff\u2019s fault, and contends that the claim should finally be disposed of in a single proceeding here. We cannot disagree with the wisdom of having a claim such as plaintiff\u2019s resolved without a multiplicity of proceedings in diverse forums, but we think that this argument of defendant should not affect the result in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-9\">In the first place, the fragmentation of this litigation was defendant\u2019s own doing, not plaintiff\u2019s. Defendant\u2019s contracting officer issued the \u201cfinal decision\u201d on the license dispute, including in it language which suggested that an appeal to the board would be appropriate if plaintiff disagreed with his determination. Defendant\u2019s board heard and disposed of the case, without any objection from defendant\u2019s attorney there as to the propriety of proceeding with the litigation in that forum. Next, we do not see how it is, on the basis of the information defendant has provided us in its briefs, that the statutes cited above compel a discarding of the board\u2019s decision. It is true that this court has been given exclusive jurisdiction over patent infringement claims brought against the Government, but that vesting of jurisdiction is no more exclusive than that granted the court over contract claims in excess of $10,000. Nonetheless, the boards every day hear and determine in the first instance claims for equitable adjustments in excess of $10,000. Had the parties not agreed to the board\u2019s authority to do so in their contract, those very claims would of course originally be prosecuted in this court. The court\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction of the claims has not precluded the parties to a contract from agreeing to have the facts found in another tribunal, and to have that fact-finding applied by this court. This is not different from what has happened here. Nothing we say here should be construed, however, as indi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>eating that we think it is inevitably appropriate to do so rather than to have a genuine de novo court proceeding throughout trial to appeal. It may be that in another case, where a direct attack on the board\u2019s jurisdiction under the Patent Rights clause (for the reasons suggested above) is entertained because objection was not waived, the court will consider the purpose of the cited statutes in interpreting the clause\u2019s provisions, but defendant\u2019s weak showing in its papers regarding those statutes suggests that this case would be an inappropriate vehicle to conclude the matter in defendant\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-4\">Defendant\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment asks that patents \u2019057 and \u2019301 be declared invalid, relieving the. Government from liability for infringement, because granted in violation of the on-sale bar as determined from facts found by the board. Since a genuine dispute exists over the facts material to the invalidity defense, as discussed above, resolution of the matter on summary judgment is obviously not possible. Ct.Cl. Rule 101. Both sides are in agreement that a trial is needed to resolve the infringement claims on the other two patents, Nos. \u2019329 and \u2019310.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-5\">Accordingly, in view of the foregoing, plaintiff\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment is granted, defendant\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment is denied, and the case is remanded to the Trial Division for further proceedings not inconsistent herewith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1059-5\">.
