Bracken and David L. Taplin appeal from their convictions for violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 662 (buying, receiving or concealing stolen personal property).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Both of them contend that, if they were guilty of any crime, it was that of stealing property in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 661 (stealing personal property).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> They argue that one who steals property cannot be guilty of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>receiving stolen goods, i. e., that a thief cannot receive stolen property from himself. We find there was ample evidence to support a conviction for receiving stolen property on the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Three articles of personal property, worth less than $100, were stolen from a veterans\u2019 administration hospital on February 9,1976. Bracken and Taplin were seen in the area of the thefts. Shortly thereafter, officers saw some of the missing articles in a vehicle next to which the two men had been seen earlier. Bracken was arrested after a chase. Taplin was arrested after he was located in one of the hospital buildings. All of the stolen articles were recovered from the vehicle after a consent search. After a jury trial, the appellants were found guilty on the one-count information, in which both of them were charged with violating 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 662.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">The cases indicate that a thief can be charged with both the stealing and the receiving of the stolen property. As a general rule, however, he can be convicted and punished for only one offense. <em>United States v. Gaddis, </em>424 U.S. 544, 96 S.Ct. 1023, 47 L.Ed.2d 222 (1976); <em>Milanovich v. United States, </em>365 U.S. 551, 81 S.Ct. 728, 5 L.Ed.2d 773 (1961); <em>Heflin v. United States, </em>358 U.S. 415, 79 S.Ct. 451, 3 L.Ed.2d 407 (1959). In this case, the Government had the power to choose whether to prosecute either under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 661, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 662, or under both. <em>United States v. O\u2019Brien, </em>391 U.S. 367, 380, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968). As soon as it chose to charge appellants with a violation of \u00a7 662 alone, it was obligated to prove beyond a reasonable doubt only the elements of that crime, \u201cand the identity of the participant or participants in the robbery or theft [was] irrelevant to the issue of the defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d <em>United States v. Gaddis, </em>424 U.S. at 550 n. 15, 96 S.Ct. at 1027. The evidence shows that the Government established sufficient proof to support a finding of guilt of the crime charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b616-19\">.
