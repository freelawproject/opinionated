Wolfson. The first charged violations of section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77e, in connection with the sale of unregistered stock of Continental Enterprises (\u201cContinental\u201d). The second charged, among other things, fraud in the purchase and sale of stock of Merritt-Chapman &amp; Scott Corporation (\u201cMerritt-Chapman\u201d). Thus began a series of trials and appeals that have spanned more than a decade and have now involved six decisions by panels of this court alone. This appeal stems from the denial by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Edmund L. Pal-mieri, J., of Wolfson\u2019s petition for a writ of error coram nobis and his motion for the recusal of Judge Palmieri. The background of the coram nobis petition is extensive, but for the purposes of this appeal, we need present it only in summary form.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-16\">Wolfson was found guilty on all counts in the Continental case after a three-week jury trial presided over by Judge Palmieri.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This conviction was affirmed, 405 F.2d 779 (2d Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 394 U.S. 946, 89 S.Ct. 1275, 22 L.Ed.2d 479 (1969), as was a later denial of a motion for a new trial. 297 F.Supp. 881 (S.D.N.Y.1968), aff\u2019d, 413 F.2d 804 (2d Cir. 1969). Judge Palmieri was also assigned to preside over the trial of the Merritt-Chapman case, and Wolfson unsuccessfully sought to have the judge disqualified. <em>Wolfson v. Palmieri, </em>394 F.2d 7 (2d Cir. 1968) (motion dismissed for lack of jurisdiction); <em>id., </em>396 F.2d 121 (2d Cir. 1968) (motion dismissed on the merits). After-wards, the jury found Wolfson guilty, but the conviction was reversed on appeal. 437 F.2d 862 (2d Cir. 1970). Two retrials were held before Inzer B. Wyatt, J., but neither jury could reach a verdict, and Wolfson eventually pleaded nolo contendere to a felony.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-17\">In 1975, Wolfson filed a voluminous cor-am nobis petition which raised many points touching on both the Merritt-Chapman and the Continental cases.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The petition was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>assigned to Judge Palmieri, and Wolfson moved for his recusal, primarily on the ground that the judge might be called as a witness during the coram nobis proceedings. The motion was denied. Wolfson then moved for reconsideration, this time emphasizing bias and prejudice as a ground for recusal. Reconsideration was granted, but the motion was denied. Subsequently, Judge Palmieri ruled against Wolfson on the merits of his coram nobis petition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Wolfson now appeals from the denial of his coram nobis petition and his recusal motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">\n<em>The Recusal Motion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">As the preceding chronology indicates, Wolfson unsuccessfully sought recusal of Judge Palmieri before the Merritt-Chapman trial began, and many of the issues then raised and considered by this court have surfaced again on this appeal. As before, Wolfson supports his claim of bias by pointing to various rulings and comments made by the judge during the Continental trial and to the sentence and high bail set in that case. See 396 F.2d at 125. He also points to evidence of alleged bias not previously presented, such as the judge\u2019s failure to postpone the sentencing date in the Merritt-Chapman case despite the fact that Mrs. Wolfson was fatally ill at the time, and the judge\u2019s conduct of the proceedings on this coram nobis petition \u2014 in particular, his requirement that Wolfson\u2019s counsel file an affidavit indicating, among other things, the issues in the petition that had not been previously litigated. According to Wolfson, the antagonism between himself and Judge Palmieri is exemplified by a telegram Wolfson sent to the judge after the Merritt-Chapman sentencing, in which he pledged \u201cto do everything to have you [Judge Palmieri] removed from the bench</p>\n<p id=\"b133-15\">. .\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> During the course of this cor-am nobis proceeding, Wolfson wrote a similar letter to the New York Times which accused the judge of participating in a \u201cscheme to frame\u201d him. The letter was never published, but Wolfson sent a copy of it to the judge. Wolfson argues that this evidence, considered as a whole, shows that Judge Palmieri, whether justifiably provoked or not, \u201chas lost the objectivity which must be maintained by a court.\u201d At the least, he claims that it raises a reasonable question of the judge\u2019s bias and that recusal is therefore required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-16\">Recusal of federal court judges is governed by two statutes, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 144 and 455.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Section 144, reproduced in the margin,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> deals with the recusal of district court judges for \u201cpersonal bias or prejudice\u201d and sets forth detailed procedural requirements, such as the timely filing of an affidavit of prejudice, that must be followed in order to bring the recusal motion before the court. See <em>Wolfson </em>v. <em>Palmieri, </em>supra, 394 F.2d 7. Section 455 is more comprehensive, and was amended by Congress in 1974 to \u201cbroaden and clarify the grounds for judicial disqualification.\u201d Pub.L. No. 93-512, Preamble. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>As amended, \u00a7 455 closely follows the provisions of Canon 3C of the American Bar Association\u2019s Code of Judicial Conduct,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and contains a general, objective standard requiring a judge to disqualify himself \u201cin any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d 28 U.S.C. 455(a).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Unlike its predecessor, the new \u00a7 455 deals directly with disqualification due to personal bias. Id. \u00a7 455(b)(1). As a result, \u00a7 455 now subsumes the subject matter of \u00a7 144, and the interaction between the two statutes is as yet unclear.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> For instance, in this case the Government argues that the procedural requirements of \u00a7 144 apply to a claim of bias under \u00a7 455 and that Wolf son has not complied with them.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We need not reach those issues, however, for even if we assume arguendo that Wolf son\u2019s claim of bias is properly before us under \u00a7 455, the claim fails even under the standards of that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Both \u00a7\u00a7 455(b)(1) and 144 refer to <em>\u201cpersonal </em>bias\u201d as triggering the requirement of recusal. (Emphasis supplied). And the cases construing both these sections have consistently held that for an alleged bias to be \u201cpersonal,\u201d it \u201cmust stem from an extrajudicial source . . . .\u201d <em>United States v. Grinnell Corp., </em>384 U.S. 563, 583, 86 S.Ct. 1698, 1710, 16 L.Ed.2d 778 (1966) (interpreting \u00a7 144); accord with respect to \u00a7 455, <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Board of School Commissioners of Mobile County, </em>517 F.2d 1044, 1051-52 (5th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 944, 96 S.Ct. 1685, 48 L.Ed.2d 188 (1976); <em>Lazofsky v. Sommerset Bus Co., </em>389 F.Supp. 1041, 1044-45 (E.D.N.Y.1975). Here, all of Wolf-son\u2019s charges <em>of </em>bias against Judge Palmieri arise out of the judge\u2019s conduct of the legal proceedings before him. The only exceptions to this are the telegram and letter sent by Wolf son after his sentencing in the Merritt-Chapman case and during the cor-am nobis proceedings. But these only establish Wolfson\u2019s feelings towards Judge Palmieri, not the reverse. Cf. <em>In re Union Leader Corp., </em>292 F.2d 381, 389 (1st Cir. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>Moreover, a prior panel of this court has extensively examined Judge Palmieri\u2019s conduct of the Continental case, including the allegedly excessive bail and sentence, and found \u201cnothing to suggest bias or prejudice\u201d or proper \u201cgrounds for disqualification.\u201d 396 F.2d at 125. True, Wolfson now rests his claim on bias in part on events never considered by the prior panel. As to those events stressed before us, the record shows that Judge Palmieri\u2019s timing of the sentencing in the Merritt-Chapman case was based on the report of Mrs. Wolfson\u2019s doctor that Mrs. Wolfson\u2019s condition had improved somewhat. Similarly, Judge Pal-mieri\u2019s order requesting clarifying affidavits in the coram nobis proceedings was not unreasonable in light of the lengthy and complex history of the case and a significant error in the coram nobis papers.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">Wolfson argues that the new \u00a7 455(a) is meant to make it easier to disqualify a judge whenever his \u201cimpartiality might be reasonably questioned.\u201d See 13 Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure: Jurisdiction \u00a7 3542 at 346 (1975 ed.). We recognize that \u00a7 455(a) is designed to negate the \u201cduty to sit\u201d notion <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and to allow \u201ca greater flexibility in determining whether disqualification is warranted in particular situations.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ritter, </em>540 F.2d 459, 462 (10th Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 951, 97 S.Ct. 370, 50 L.Ed.2d 319 (1976). Also, we do not read the authorities referred to above as holding that a judge\u2019s conduct of proceedings before him can <em>never </em>form a basis for finding bias. See <em>Wolfson v. Palmieri, </em>supra, 396 F.2d at 124-25; 13 Wright, supra, at 352-53. But having said all that, we do not in good conscience think that Judge Palmieri had to disqualify himself on the coram no-bis petition. We cannot disregard the action of the prior panel on the same claim based in large part on the same record, even though the standard for recusal has since changed. There is a broad reference to the \u201cduty to sit\u201d idea in the prior panel\u2019s decision, 396 F.2d at 124 (quoting <em>Rosen </em>v. <em>Sugarman, </em>357 F.2d 794, 797-98 (2d Cir. 1966)). That was not the basis of the decision, however, and there is no indication that the prior panel felt compelled because of the old law\u2019s more restrictive test to deny recusal. Wolfson would undoubtedly rejoin that he is not asking us to reverse the prior decision, but only to take the prior record into account in connection with the recusal motion addressed to the coram nobis petition years later. We have done so to the extent we think appropriate. But as indicated, we do not believe that the change in standards would have affected the prior decision, and the determination of that panel on the record before it, therefore, carries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>great weight with us.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> And for the reasons given above, the later events simply do not afford a reasonable basis for suspecting bias.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">We understand that regardless of a court\u2019s fairness, a defendant who has undergone two lengthy trials before the same judge, both of which ended in guilty convictions, may come to consider that judge as biased against him. These suspicions are understandable, but, without more, they do not provide a reasonable basis for questioning a judge\u2019s impartiality. On oral argument, appellant pointed to the \u201cgeneral rule\u201d of the First Circuit of assigning certain categories of \u00a7 2255 petitions automatically to other judges. See <em>Halliday </em>v. <em>United States, </em>380 F.2d 270 (1st Cir. 1967), aff\u2019d on other grounds, 394 U.S. 831, 89 S.Ct. 1498, 23 L.Ed.2d 16 (1969); but cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cowden, </em>545 F.2d 257 (1st Cir. 1976). Whatever the overall merits of this approach, and we do not underestimate them, see generally 2 Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure, supra, \u00a7 600 at 631-32 (1969 ed.) and at 276 (1976 supp.), we do not believe that \u00a7 455(a) requires such a rule for \u00a7 2255 or coram nobis petitions where there is a claim of bias. Cf. <em>United States v. Cowden, </em>supra. It may well be that such a rule, or something similar but more limited,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> would be useful in the future. Such a practice would, at the very least, render unnecessary the considerable time and effort expended by the district court and by this court on the issue here and allow all concerned to focus exclusively on the merits of the collateral attack.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> But in the absence of such a pre-existing practice, there is no sound basis for reversal here. In short, we conclude that there is nothing in Judge Palmieri\u2019s conduct in the Continental, Merritt-Chapman and coram nobis proceedings to give rise to a reasonable suspicion of bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">Having decided that Judge Palmieri could properly deal with the coram nobis proceeding, we turn to the claims presented in the coram nobis petition itself. On appeal, Wolfson has pressed only three of these claims, one of which \u2014 a <em>Brady </em>claim \u2014 he has since abandoned.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Both remaining claims allege violations of Wolf-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>son\u2019s right to effective assistance of counsel. Appellant contends that he was deprived of effective counsel because his personal counsel appeared before the grand jury that indicted him and because his lead counsel at the Continental trial was the subject of an alleged Government criminal investigation into that lawyer\u2019s stock activities. The district court rejected these claims, as well as the others presented by the petition, on the merits and on the ground that the petition should be dismissed with prejudice pursuant to Fed.R. Civ.P. 41(b) for failure to follow the court\u2019s directions. See note 12, supra. Since we find that dismissal of the petition under Rule 41(b) was, under the circumstances, too severe a sanction, see <em>International Building Materials, Inc. v. Interchemical Corp., </em>437 F.2d 1336, 1338-39 (9th Cir. 1970); 5 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, \u00b641.12 (1976-77 Supp.), we must review the merits of the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">With respect to Wolfson\u2019s argument that he was denied effective counsel because of Government investigation involving his lead counsel at trial, the coram nobis papers alleged only that Wolfson \u201chas reason to believe\u201d that there was a criminal investigation against that attorney.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Appellant presented no evidence that the attorney was aware of such an investigation, if it in fact existed. No affidavit from the attorney was submitted, nor was there any explanation of why one was unavailable. In short, appellant\u2019s petition presented little, aside from his own speculations, in support of the claim, and on this record he was not entitled to a hearing on the issue. See <em>United States v. Tribote, </em>297 F.2d 598, 601 (2d Cir. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Appellant\u2019s argument concerning the appearance of his personal counsel before the grand jury that indicted him requires more discussion. Although this claim was raised below, it was not emphasized or phrased in the same terms in the coram nobis petition, and the district court treated it as part of Wolfson\u2019s general complaint over the ineffectiveness of his counsels\u2019 strategic decisions.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> As more fully explicated on appeal, Wolfson\u2019s assertion is that \u201cthe Fifth and Sixth Amendments protect a criminal defendant from grand jury inquiry into the work of defense counsel,\u201d and that violation of that principle should result in the dismissal of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">We are sensitive to the grave dangers posed when counsel appears before the same grand jury that indicted defendant. See <em>In re Terkeltoub, </em>256 F.Supp. 683 (S.D. N.Y.1966); <em>United States v. Colacurcio, </em>499 F.2d 1401, 1404 (9th Cir. 1974). We also recognize that the potential disclosures \u201ctouch upon a vital center in the administration of criminal justice, the lawyer\u2019s work in investigating and preparing the defense of a criminal charge.\u201d <em>In re Ter-keltoub, </em>supra, 256 F.Supp. at 684. See also <em>United States v. Nobles, </em>422 U.S. 225, 237, 95 S.Ct. 2160, 45 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975), quoting <em>Hickman v. Taylor, </em>329 U.S. 495, 510-11, 67 S.Ct. 385, 91 L.Ed. 451 (1947). Nevertheless, on this record, we cannot hold that the judge erred in denying a hearing on this issue. Although we have cautioned against the abuses that may result, cf. <em>Matter of Doe, </em>546 F.2d 498, 502 (2d Cir. 1976), the Government has the right to call an attorney before the grand jury and question him on unprivileged matters. See <em>Blair v. United States, </em>250 U.S. 273, 39 S.Ct. 468, 63 L.Ed. 979 (1919); <em>In re Grand Jury Subpoena Served Upon Doe, </em>551 F.2d 899 (2d Cir. 1977); <em>In re Kinoy, </em>326 F.Supp. 400 (S.D.N. Y.1970). In this case, the lawyer was not only the personal attorney of defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>but also general counsel to some of the corporations involved in the grand jury investigation.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Cf. <em>In re Grand Jury Investigation, </em>412 F.Supp. 943 (E.D.Pa.1976). Furthermore, the ordinary presumption that a lawyer is competent to protect his client\u2019s confidential interests before the grand jury, see <em>Kinoy, </em>supra, 326 F.Supp. at 402; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mackey, </em>405 F.Supp. 854, 865 (E.D.N.Y.1975), is even stronger in a coram nobis proceeding where the petitioner bears the burden of overcoming the presumption of regularity in the challenged proceedings. See <em>United States v. Morgan, </em>346 U.S. 502, 512, 74 S.Ct. 247, 98 L.Ed. 248 (1954). Here, according to the coram nobis petition,. Wolf-son\u2019s counsel claimed to have \u201cinvoked the attorney-client privilege where appropriate,\u201d and there is nothing to indicate that this is not so. And even if there were a violation of the attorney-client privilege, appellant concedes that he is unable to find any case in which such a violation has resulted in dismissal of an indictment or even in a new trial. Nor are we aware of any such case.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> See the thorough opinion of Judge Weinstein in <em>United States v. Mack-ey, </em>supra, 405 F.Supp. at 860-67. In short, appellant\u2019s claim on this issue had insufficient factual support or likelihood of ultimate success, and the district court did not err in denying a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">Finally, we turn to the remaining claims in the coram nobis petition that have not been pressed on appeal, including arguments that the grand jury was biased against petitioner<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and that the trial was tainted by prosecutorial misconduct.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> These claims were carefully considered in Judge Palmieri\u2019s thorough opinion, and we need not review them in any detail. We note, as did Judge Palmieri, that many of the claims have been previously raised in this or similar form by the petitioner and considered by this court,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and we agree with the disposition of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">The judgment of the district court is, accordingly, affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b132-12\">. Wolfson received concurrent one year sentences, was fined $100,000, and the costs of prosecution were imposed upon him. He completed his sentence in 1970. Coram nobis is, however, available to test the validity of sentences completely served. See <em>United States v. Morgan, </em>346 U.S. 502, 74 S.Ct. 247, 98 L.Ed. 248 (1954).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b132-19\">.

See also Frank, Disqualification of Judges: In Support of the Bayh Bill, 35 Law &amp; Contemp. Problems 43 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b134-15\">. Section 455 is a self-enforcing provision that is directed towards the judge, but may be raised by a party. See <em>Davis v. Board of School Commissioners of Mobile County, </em>517 F.2d 1044, 1051-52 (5th Cir. 1975); 13 Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure: Jurisdiction \u00a7 3550 (1975 ed.). Unlike \u00a7 144, \u00a7 455 does not require that an affidavit of'bias be filed as a procedural prerequisite; in fact, \u00a7 455 is \u201cwholly silent about procedure . 13 Wright, supra, at \u00a7 3550. The Government argues that if \u00a7 455 may be raised by a party to assert a claim of personal prejudice cognizable under \u00a7 144 without filing an affidavit of prejudice, then \u00a7 144 will be effectively overruled. As yet, no appellate court has squarely faced this issue, although there are some cases lending support to the Government\u2019s position that an affidavit of bias must be filed where \u00a7\u00a7 455 and 144 overlap. Cf. <em>Samuel v. University of Pittsburgh, </em>395 F.Supp. 1275, 1277 (W.D.Pa.1975); <em>Harley v. Oliver, </em>400 F.Supp. 105, 110 (W.D.Ark. 1975); but see Fordham Note, supra, at 153-54. Wolfson argues that even if an affidavit is required, he has complied since his verified petition is the equivalent of an affidavit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b135-5\">. The coram nobis petition claimed that Judge Palmieri impaneled the grand jury that indicted petitioner and that Judge Palmieri selected a personal acquaintance of his as foreman of the jury. The petition then asked whether Judge Palmieri \u201cnormally act[ed] as trial judge on cases that arose out of indictments handed down by \u2018his\u2019 grand juries?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">In fact, Judge Palmieri did not impanel the grand jury, and the judge took this significant error as a sign that counsel, who had not represented Wolfson during the previous proceedings, had prepared the coram nobis petition, \u201cwith little familiarity\u201d with the documents in the case. Given the complexity of the case and the lengthy coram nobis petition, which raised many issues that had been previously litigated, see note 25, infra, the judge\u2019s order requesting affidavits indicating which issues in the petition were being litigated for the first time was not unreasonable. The order, and its subsequent revision by the judge in which he required that counsel indicate what documents were missing from the clerk\u2019s files and why, certainly imposed a considerable burden on counsel, but were not sufficiently demonstrative of any personal bias on the judge\u2019s part. In this connection, it is apparent from the record that a moderate amount of friction developed between the court and Wolfson\u2019s counsel on the coram nobis petition, stemming in large part from the order to clarify the issues presented in the petition. We do not believe that such friction was indicative of any personal bias against Wolfson.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b135-9\">. Subsection (a) of the amended section 455 contains the general, or catch-all, provision that a judge shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which \u201chis impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d . . . The language also has the effect of removing the so-called \u201cduty to sit\u201d which has become a gloss on the existing statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">H.R.Rep. No. 93-1453, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b136-5\">. On this appeal, Wolfson has relied on this court\u2019s ruling in <em>United States v. Simon, </em>393 F.2d 90 (2d Cir. 1968), as providing a rationale for recusal. This same argument was made to the prior panel, and we agree with their determination that <em>Simon </em>is not controlling on these facts. See 396 F.2d at 126.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b136-6\">. We would reach this conclusion whether we judged the reasonableness of the suspicion from the perspective of the litigant himself or from that of a reasonable man. See <em>Parrish v. Board of Commissioners of Alabama State Bar, </em>524 F.2d 98 (5th Cir. 1975) (en banc), cert. denied, 425 U.S. 944, 96 S.Ct. 1685, 48 L.Ed.2d 188 (1976); <em>United States v. Cowden, </em>545 F.2d 257 (1st Cir. 1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b136-7\">. Cf. <em>Grinnell, </em>supra, where Judge Wyzanski referred a recusal motion to Chief Judge Wood-bury of the First Circuit; after decision on that motion, 384 U.S. at 582-83 n. 13, 86 S.Ct. 1698, Judge Wyzanski then tried the case. See generally Note, Disqualification of Judges for Bias in the Federal Courts, 79 Harv.L.Rev. 1435, 1439 (1966); Fordham Note, supra, at 159 and n. 141; Comment Disqualification of Federal District Judges \u2014 Problems and Proposals, 7 Seton Hall L.Rev. 612, 636-38 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b136-11\">. Moreover, it is always open to a judge, as we pointed out in <em>Wolfson v. Palmieri, </em>supra, 396 F.2d at 125, to step out voluntarily. This advice is even more practical now, since the duty to sit notion has been removed from the statute, see note 13, supra, and no opprobrium should result from a judge who in good conscience chooses not to sit, even though the claim of bias is legally insufficient. See ABA Standards Relating to Post-Conviction Remedies \u00a7 1.4(c). We do not suggest that there should be further proceedings in this case, but if they do occur, the preceding advice should apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-12\">We do not now face the question whether, pursuant to our supervisory powers, we should adopt a rule preventing the same judge from presiding over a criminal trial where the defendant has already been convicted on other charges in a trial before the same judge. Cf. <em>United States v. Robin, </em>553 F.2d 8, 9 and n. 1 (2d Cir., 1977) (en banc).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b136-13\">. Wolfson argued that portions of the testimony given by John Morley before the Securities and Exchange Commission were not turned over to the defense. He now concedes that this material was made available to counsel at the appropriate time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b137-7\">. In this court, appellant\u2019s counsel relies on information given to counsel by an unnamed Department of Justice attorney. Defendant-Appellant\u2019s Brief at 21. The Government points out that \u201cnot even this slim foundation to the charge\u201d was included in the petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b137-8\">. Wolfson\u2019s coram nobis petition contains a general claim in the section dealing with ineffective assistance of counsel that his counsels' preparation and conduct of his case were \u201cgrossly negligent.\u201d In this connection we note that, at the time of the Continental trial, Wolfson was aware that his attorney had appeared before the grand jury, and yet this is apparently the first time this issue has been raised in almost ten years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b138-4\"><em>. </em>Counsel was also an unindicted co-conspirator in the Merritt-Chapman case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b138-5\">. The cases raising the issue of defense attorney\u2019s appearance before a grand jury have arisen either in the context of a claim of privilege first raised during the grand jury proceedings, see <em>In re Terkeltoub, </em>supra, or prior to trial, see <em>United States v. Colacurcio, </em>supra; <em>United States v. Colasurdo, </em>453 F.2d 585, 595-96 (2d Cir. 1971); Wolfson argues that in those cases the court could protect the defendant\u2019s rights through means less drastic than the dismissal of the indictment; e. g., by ruling that counsel need not testify or that the evidence obtained from counsel be suppressed. But in this case, he argues, dismissal of the indictment may be the only appropriate relief. We believe, however, that Wolfson\u2019s argument here misconceives the fundamental distinction between the \u201cstatus of the [attorney-client] privilege at trial and before the grand jury . . . <em>United States v. Mackey, </em>supra, 405 F.Supp. at 861; see also <em>United States v. Colasurdo, </em>supra. As the Supreme Court has indicated, the fact that a witness may be able to assert a testimonial privilege before the grand jury does not lead to the conclusion that a violation of the privilege may be grounds for dismissing the indictment. See <em>United States v. Calandra, </em>414 U.S. 338, 345, 94 S.Ct. 613, 38 L.Ed.2d 561 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b138-12\">. The allegations of grand jury partiality were based primarily on the alleged friendship between the foreman of the grand jury and the United States Attorney, and the Assistant United States Attorney on the case. In response, the Government submitted affidavits from the foreman and from the United States Attorneys involved, indicating the very limited nature of their acquaintance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b138-13\">. On the issue of prosecutorial misqonduct, the petition claims, among other things, that the Government threatened witnesses, that it knowingly used perjured testimony, that it assigned Judge Palmieri\u2019s former law clerk to the prosecution staff, creating a conflict of interest, and that it discriminatorily prosecuted petitioner on the basis of an SEC \u201cenemies\u201d list.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b138-14\">.

Also, in an attachment to his affidavit of November 7, 1975, Wolfson\u2019s counsel on this coram nobis petition stated that he \u201cbelievefd]\u201d that the issues of discriminatory prosecution and the intimidation of witness Henry Steeger had been previously litigated.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
