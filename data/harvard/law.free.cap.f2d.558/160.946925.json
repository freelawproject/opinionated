The first order directs Eagle to cease and desist from unfair labor practices in violation of section 8(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1) (1970), to recognize and bargain with the International Union of Operating Engineers (\u201cthe Union\u201d) as the exclusive bargaining representative of Eagle\u2019s service mechanics, and to restore the <em>status quo ante </em>with respect to certain changes made unilaterally by the employer following a representation election. The second order requires Eagle to cease and desist from unfair labor practices in violation of sections 8(a)(3) and 8(a)(5), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(3), (5) (1970), to reinstate four employees discharged in violation of section 8(a)(3), and, upon request, to bargain with the Union. Although we cannot sustain the 8(a)(5) violation, we conclude that substantial evidence in the record supports the Board\u2019s findings that Eagle engaged in unfair labor practices in violation of sections 8(a)(1) and 8(a)(3) of the Act, and that the remedies imposed did not exceed the Board\u2019s discretion. We therefore grant the Board\u2019s petitions for enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">Eagle, a subsidiary of Somerset Tire Service, Inc. (\u201cSomerset\u201d), is engaged in the purchase, sale, and servicing of forklift trucks and related products. While attending a prearranged organizational meeting on January 11, 1975, five of Eagle\u2019s six service mechanics signed valid authorization cards on behalf of the Union\u2019s Local 825. Two days later, the Union filed a representation petition with the Board, a copy of which was served on the employer; on January 24 an agreement for a consent election to be held on February 6 was executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Prior to the election, Eagle\u2019s president, John Apgar, scheduled and conducted several meetings with the service mechanics. At the first meeting, held on January 20, Apgar asked what problems had prompted the employees to seek union representation. The mechanics related various complaints, including the insufficiency of wages and benefits and dissatisfaction with Service Manager Frank Veronsky. Apgar informed the employees at a second meeting, held a day or two later, that Veronsky was no longer with the company. In response to the president\u2019s inquiries at either the same or a subsequent session, the mechanics detailed the basic benefit package offered by the Union and discussed the comparable benefits provided by other forklift companies in the vicinity. Apgar explained that none of these benefits was \u201cout of reach,\u201d and told the employees not to \u201cunderestimate Somerset Tire.\u201d He said that he would match or exceed the benefits provided by other companies, and that he would in time give the employees a benefit package that would be \u201cthe Cadillac of the industry.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">Eagle held an evening meeting, attended by all six service mechanics, within three days of the election. This session also involved a discussion of wages, union benefits, the employees\u2019 reasons for wanting a union, and problems that could and would be rectified. An additional meeting was conducted shortly before the election, attended by three employees and two company officials, including Apgar.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The employees expressed their concern that unless they voted for and won union representation, they might be fired or might not receive any improved benefits. Apgar said that he could alleviate their uneasiness. He began drafting a letter stating that no one would be fired for any reason during the next year, enabling the employees to have another election if they were dissatisfied, and that if an employee were discharged during that period that the company would pay a financial penalty. While Apgar and the employees were discussing the penalty, a company supervisor entered and informed Apgar that a lawyer had advised him of the illegality of the letter. Apgar thereupon destroyed the letter, wrote another saying that the employees would not be discharged for union activities, and promised that he would rewrite the original letter immediately after the election.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">Approximately one week prior to the February 6 election, two company supervisors, Paul Desnoyers and James Schactele, had a conversation about five feet from where a service mechanic was working. Schactele was at the time in the process of lettering Eagle trucks, which were used both to deliver new forklifts and by the mechanics in making service calls. Desnoy-ers told him to defer lettering the trucks, because they might be used elsewhere in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>the company if the Union won the election.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Shortly thereafter, in response to the service mechanic\u2019s inquiry, Schactele confirmed that the mechanic had heard the conversation correctly, but said that he was going to have the trucks lettered anyway.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The Union lost the election, 4 votes to 2, and filed timely objections. After the election, the company instituted the following changes in the employment conditions of the service mechanics:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-6\">(1) Paid vacation was increased from one to two weeks per year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-7\">(2) Employees were uniformly granted three sick days per year, in place of a prior practice that left sick pay within the discretion of the manager.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-8\">(3) Employees were granted three additional paid holidays per year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-9\">(4) As of approximately March 1, 1975, the company eliminated an existing plan whereby the service mechanics shared a three percent monthly commission on parts sales and labor bills. In its stead the company introduced another program, vaguely described by employee witnesses who did not fully understand it as a \u201c40 percent plan,\u201d and characterized by Apgar as a superior benefit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-10\">(5) As of April 1, 1975, Eagle began paying the full cost of the employees\u2019 hospitalization. The employer had previously paid only one-half.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-11\">(6) As of August 1, 1975, the service mechanics were no longer allowed to keep company trucks at home to use for transportation to and from the plant or an outside job. The employees had been assured of this convenience as a condition of their hire.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-12\">On the basis of the facts described, the Board found that Eagle violated section 8(a)(1) when, in the period prior to the election, it solicited employee grievances, discharged Veronsky in response to employee complaints, threatened to move service equipment and work if the Union won the election, and promised the employees additional benefits and a written guarantee of continued employment \u2014 all in order to discourage employee interest in the Union. The Board further found that the company violated section 8(a)(1) by implementing changes in employee benefits and working conditions in fulfillment of its unlawful pre-election promises. Finally, the Board found that the union, having secured signed authorization cards from a majority of the employees, had attained majority status. The company\u2019s unfair labor practices, beginning on January 20,1975, and continuing through the election, said the Board, dissipated the Union\u2019s majority and precluded the holding of a fair election.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Board therefore concluded that the company had an obligation to bargain with the Union as of January 20, ordered Eagle to cease and desist from its unfair labor practices, and directed the restoration of the <em>status quo ante </em>with respect to those changes in benefits which were detrimental to the employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-17\">Our review of the order in this case entails a two-step inquiry. First, we must determine whether substantial evidence in the record as a whole supports the Board\u2019s findings of section 8(a)(1) violations. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e) (1970); <em>see Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951). Then, if the evidence supports the Board\u2019s findings, we must determine whether the remedy ordered was within the Board\u2019s broad discretion, keeping in mind that the order should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>not be disturbed \u201cunless it can be shown that [it] is a patent attempt to achieve ends other than those which can fairly be said to effectuate the policies of the [National Labor Relations] Act.\u201d <em>Virginia Electric &amp; Power Co. v. NLRB, </em>319 U.S. 533, 540, 63 S.Ct. 1214, 1218, 87 L.Ed. 1568 (1943). <em>Accord, Fibreboard Paper Products Corp. v. NLRB, </em>379 U.S. 203, 215-16, 85 S.Ct. 398, 13 L.Ed.2d 233 (1964); see 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(c) (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Eagle contends that its solicitation of employee grievances prior to the union election was simply an exercise of an employer\u2019s legitimate prerogative; the preelection discussions with the service mechanics, Eagle asserts, fell within the protection of section 8(c) of the NLRA.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We recognize that the mere solicitation of employee grievances prior to an election is not an unfair labor practice. <em>Landis Tool Co. v. NLRB, </em>460 F.2d 23, 25 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 915, 93 S.Ct. 237, 34 L.Ed.2d 177 (1972). As Judge Friendly has observed, \u201c[A]n organizational drive often comes as a rude shock to an employer, and a simple offer to hear any complaints the employees may have, or to set up machinery to that end, is a natural and non-coercive response.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Rollins Telecasting, Inc., </em>494 F.2d 80, 83 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 964, 95 S.Ct. 224, 42 L.Ed.2d 178 (1974). But when the employer\u2019s grievance solicitation is accompanied by promises of benefits contingent upon the employees\u2019 rejection of the union, such conduct constitutes an interference with the rights of employees guaranteed by section 7 of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157 (1970), and thereby violates section 8(a)(1), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1) (1970). <em>Landis Tool Co. </em>v. <em>NLRB, supra, </em>460 F.2d at 24-25. Furthermore, it is an unfair labor practice for an employer actually to grant benefits to employees shortly before a representation election in order to induce them to vote against the union. <em>See NLRB v. Exchange Parts Co., </em>375 U.S. 405, 84 S.Ct. 457, 11 L.Ed.2d 435 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">We believe that substantial evidence in the record as a whole supports the Board\u2019s conclusion that Eagle\u2019s solicitation of grievances carried an implied promise of benefits. This court has recognized that such promises need not be express to run afoul of section 8(a)(1). <em>Landis Tool Co. v. NLRB, supra, </em>460 F.2d at 24-25. <em>Accord, NLRB v. Rollins Telecasting, Inc., supra, </em>494 F.2d at 83-84. Moreover, the record also supports the Board\u2019s finding that the employer made explicit promises of benefits. Company president Apgar told a meeting of service mechanics that he would in time give them a benefit package that would be \u201cthe Cadillac of the industry\u201d ; in addition, he offered the employees a guarantee of continued employment. The Board could reasonably infer that the employees understood fulfillment of these express and implied promises to be dependent upon their rejection of the Union.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We conclude, therefore, that the promises \u2014 and the grievance solicitation that accompanied them \u2014 interfered with the section 7 rights of the employees, thereby violated section 8(a)(1), and fell outside the protection of section 8(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">The Board could also reasonably find that the company, in violation of section 8(a)(1), discharged supervisor Veronsky in order to induce the employees to vote against the Union. Although Apgar, Eagle\u2019s president, testified that the mechanics\u2019 complaints did not precipitate Veronsky\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>discharge, the Administrative Law Judge did not credit that testimony. We are not at liberty to disturb that credibility finding. <em>See </em>note 1 <em>supra. </em>Furthermore, the timing of Yeronsky\u2019s dismissal \u2014 prior to the election, and within a day or two after the meeting at which the service mechanics characterized him as the primary cause of their dissatisfaction \u2014 permitted the inference that the company fired Veronsky for the purpose of encouraging antiunion votes in the pending election.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">The record supports the Board\u2019s conclusion that the employer violated section 8(a)(1) by threatening to terminate its \u201coutside\u201d service work if the Union should win the election. <em>See NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., </em>395 U.S. 575, 618-20, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969); <em>Textile Workers v. Darlington Manufacturing Co., </em>380 U.S. 263, 274 n.20, 85 S.Ct. 994, 13 L.Ed.2d 827 (1965); <em>Mon River Towing, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>421 F.2d 1, 9-11 (3d Cir. 1969). With a service mechanic working within hearing distance, supervisor Desnoyers instructed supervisor Schactele to delay having Eagle\u2019s service trucks lettered because the vehicles might be used elsewhere in the company (presumably in the parent company, Somerset) if the Union won the election. The ALJ inferred, and reasonably so, that the supervisors knew that the employee could hear their conversation. The determination whether a supervisor\u2019s statement amounts to a threat is a matter peculiarly within the Board\u2019s expertise. <em>NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., supra, </em>395 U.S. at 620, 89 S.Ct. 1918; <em>Mon River Towing, Inc. v. NLRB, supra, </em>421 F.2d at 9; <em>NLRB v. Triangle Publications, Inc., </em>500 F.2d 597, 599 (3d Cir. 1974). Eagle does not suggest that the company was not responsible for the statement of supervisor Desnoyers, <em>see NLRB v. Dover Corp., </em>535 F.2d 1205, 1210 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 978, 97 S.Ct. 488, 50 L.Ed.2d 586 (1976), and the record supports the Board\u2019s conclusion that the remark implied a threat to move work from Eagle\u2019s plant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly, we sustain the Board\u2019s finding that the supervisor\u2019s statement violated section 8(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">We have somewhat more difficulty with the Board\u2019s finding that Eagle violated section 8(a)(1) by granting certain benefits after the representation election, but while objections to the election were pending before the Board. This circuit has not previously considered how such conduct fares under section 8(a)(1).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">Whether a post-election conferral of benefits constitutes an unfair labor practice depends, we believe, on the employer's purpose in granting the benefits. If the employer improves his employees\u2019 benefits after a representation election and while objections are pending in order to reward the employees for rejecting the union and to induce them to vote against the union in the event of a second election, his conduct violates section 8(a)(1). <em>NLRB v. Gruber\u2019s Super Market, Inc., </em>501 F.2d 697, 702-03 (7th Cir. 1974); <em>NLRB v. Furnas Electric Co., </em>463 F.2d 665, 669 (7th Cir. 1972); <em>Luxuray of New York v. NLRB, </em>447 F.2d 112, 117-19 (2d Cir. 1971). <em>But see Monroe v. NLRB, </em>460 F.2d 121, 125 (4th Cir. 1972); <em>NLRB v. Ambox, Inc., </em>357 F.2d 138, 141 (5th Cir. 1966). <em>See generally </em>Annot., 8 A.L.R. Fed. 103, 113 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number><em>NLRB v. Exchange Parts Co., supra, </em>which held that a preelection grant of benefits made to discourage collective employee activities violates section 8(a)(1), would appear to compel such a conclusion. A post-election conferral of benefits \u201cundertaken with the express purpose of impinging upon [employees\u2019], freedom of choice for or against unionization and . . . reasonably calculated to have that effect,\u201d <em>id. </em>375 U.S. at 409, 84 S.Ct. at 460, can interfere with the employees\u2019 section 7 rights just as much as the same conduct in a preelection context. To hold otherwise would be to reduce <em>Exchange Parts </em>to an easily evaded technical limitation on an employer\u2019s ability to interfere with his employees\u2019 rights by dispensing favorable treatment. <em>See Luxuray of New York v. NLRB, supra, </em>447 F.2d at 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Eagle\u2019s purpose in granting benefits after the election while objections were pending, then, determines the legality <em>vel non </em>of its actions. The Board inferred that the employer\u2019s intention was to discourage support for the Union. \u201cThe question on this review is not whether we would have interpreted the employer\u2019s intention as did the Board in the first instance, but whether the Board\u2019s resolution of this factual issue is supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 118. The Board\u2019s inference finds the requisite support in the record. Eagle\u2019s prior unfair labor practices demonstrate the company\u2019s propensity for interfering with the organizational rights of its employees, and suggest that its post-election grant of benefits was likewise improperly motivated. <em>See NLRB v. Georgia Rug Mill, </em>308 F.2d 89, 91 (5th Cir. 1962) (Wisdom, J.). Furthermore, the similarity between the benefits cited by the employees prior to the election in explanation of their desire for a union and the benefits conferred by the employer after the election is indicative of Eagle\u2019s intention to discourage union membership. Although the post-election benefits were apparently granted to all of Somerset\u2019s employees, and not just to Eagle\u2019s service mechanics, certain testimony suggested that the company-wide conferral was actually calculated to avoid the appearance of impropriety.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">In sum, we conclude that all of the unfair labor practices found by the Board are supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole. We turn now to the remedy ordered to cure the effects of those practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">The Board concluded that an order directing Eagle, upon request, to recognize and bargain with the Union as the exclusive bargaining representative of its service mechanics was \u201crequired to remedy [Eagle\u2019s] extensive unfair labor practices\u201d which had dissipated the majority status the Union once enjoyed. The Board\u2019s authority to issue such bargaining orders was sustained in <em>NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., supra. </em>Under <em>Gissel, </em>a bargaining order may issue (1) even without a showing that the union at one point had authorization cards from a majority of the employees, when the employer\u2019s \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201cpervasive\u201d unfair labor practices have eliminated the possibility of holding a fair representation election, <em>id. </em>at 613-14, 89 S.Ct. at 1940, or (2) in \u201cless extraordinary cases marked by less pervasive practices,\u201d when there is a showing that the union once had a card majority and when the Board concludes that the extensiveness of the employer\u2019s unfair labor practices has \u201cthe tendency to undermine majority strength and impede the election processes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 614, 89 S.Ct. at 1940.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-12\">In recognition of \u201cthe general and highly desirable practice in industrial relations of selecting bargaining representatives through traditional election processes,\u201d this court has adopted a rule requiring the Board to set forth a reasoned analysis justifying the imposition of a <em>Gissel </em>bargaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>order. <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Armcor Industries, Inc., </em>535 F.2d 239, 244 (3d Cir. 1976). The <em>Arm-cor </em>rule effectuates the three goals of ensuring informed judicial review of the Board\u2019s bargaining orders, contributing to the \u201cpredictability of this important area of labor law,\u201d and providing a \u201cprophylaxis against arbitrary exercise of the Board\u2019s power.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 245. Eagle submits that in the instant case the Board did not make \u201cspecific findings as to the impact of the unfair labor practices on the election process and clearly explicate the basis for its decision to issue a bargaining order,\u201d <em>id., </em>and that we must therefore remand to the Board for further proceedings. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">We have carefully examined the findings made by the Board in support of its decision to issue a bargaining order. In addition, we have looked to the findings made by the ALJ in support of his recommendation that the Board issue such an order; because the Board affirmed his findings, we deem it appropriate to consider them in determining whether we have a sufficient explication of the basis for the Board\u2019s decision to issue a bargaining order. <em>See generally NLRB v. Andrew Jergens Co., </em>175 F.2d 130, 136 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>338 U.S. 827, 70 S.Ct. 76, 94 L.Ed. 503 (1949); 2 K. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise \u00a7\u00a7 10.03-.04 (1958).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Although the findings before us do not display the specificity that we would ideally desire, and although the explication of the basis for the Board\u2019s decision to issue a bargaining order lacks the lucidity that we would prefer, we are unable to say that the findings and analysis fail to comply with Armcor.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The Board found that a bargaining order was necessary to remedy the employer\u2019s \u201cextensive unfair labor practices\u201d which had \u201cdissipated the Union\u2019s majority status\u201d as evidenced by signed authorization cards, and \u201cprecluded a fair election from being held.\u201d Clearly, the Board characterized this case as falling within the second <em>Gissel </em>category described above. Tbe Board detailed the unfair labor practices that it believed had undermined the possibility of \u201cholding a fair election in the near future, even after application of the Board\u2019s traditional remedies therefor.\u201d The ALJ noted that following the Union\u2019s filing of a representation petition, the employer had engaged in a series of actions \u201cdesigned to convince the employees that their demands [would] be met through direct dealing with [Eagle] and that union representation could in no way be advantageous to them.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4c\">Obviously such conduct must, of necessity, have a strong coercive effect on the employees\u2019 freedom of choice, serving as it does to eliminate, by unlawful means and tactics, the very reason for a union\u2019s existence. . . . [T]here is [no] conduct which would constitute a greater impairment of employees\u2019 basic Section 7 rights under our Act, especially since such conduct by its very nature has a long-lasting, if not permanent, effect on the employees\u2019 freedom of choice in selecting or rejecting a bargaining representative.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">Decision of Administrative Law Judge at 5, quoting <em>Teledyne Dental Products Corp., </em>210 N.L.R.B. 435, 435-36 (1974) (footnote omitted). The ALJ went on to observe that the pernicious effect of the employer\u2019s unfair labor practices was evident in the dramatic decline in union support between January 11, when five of the six service mechanics signed union authorization cards, and February 6, when the Union lost the election 4-2. He concluded that the employer\u2019s promises, threats, and grants of benefits \u2014 continuing into the post-election <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>period \u2014 were of such a nature as to have a long-range impact on freedom of choice within the small bargaining unit, making a fair rerun election highly improbable. Under the circumstances, he determined that the authorization cards reliably demonstrated the employees\u2019 representation desires and that a bargaining order was the only appropriate remedy.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">In light of these findings, which are supported by substantial evidence, we believe that the decision to issue a bargaining order was within the Board\u2019s discretion.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <em>NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., supra, </em>395 U.S. at 612 n.32, 89 S.Ct. 1918. Furthermore, the Board could properly direct that the bargaining obligation be deemed to have commenced as of January 20, 1975. <em>See Ann Lee Sportswear, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>543 F.2d 739, 744 (10th Cir. 1976). We also conclude that the other aspects of the remedy ordered, including the direction that Eagle restore the <em>status quo ante </em>with respect to changes made by the employer which were detrimental to the employees, were within the Board\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The alleged unfair labor practices underlying No. 77-1185 were committed shortly after the issuance of the ALJ\u2019s decision in No. 76-2256 <em>(\u201cEagle </em>I\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">In June and August of 1975, two of Eagle\u2019s six service mechanics resigned and were not replaced. Beginning in September, the company began to decrease its service work. Eagle adopted the practice of selling new forklifts without dealer preparation or a warranty and reduced the sales price to compensate for the eliminated service. Similarly, customers who rented forklifts paid a reduced charge and accepted responsibility for maintaining the vehicles themselves. In October, Eagle\u2019s office manager informed one of the service mechanics that the company would henceforth do repair work only on forklifts manufactured by Allis-Chalmers, Eagle\u2019s franchisor. After November 11, one service mechanic no longer had any \u201cpreventive maintenance\u201d work even though, he testified, Eagle previously had approximately twelve contracts to perform such work on some fifty to sixty forklifts.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">On November 7,1975, one week after the ALJ rendered his decision in <em>Eagle </em>I recommending a bargaining order, Eagle laid off two service mechanics. All four service mechanics were present when the company\u2019s general manager announced the layoffs, and they requested an explanation. The general manager replied that the layoffs were \u201cfor economic reasons.\u201d When one mechanic pointed out that there was plenty of work in the shop and that the employees were behind in their work, the manager responded, \u201cI didn\u2019t say that we were not busy.\u201d There was testimony regarding the quantity of work to be done in Eagle\u2019s shop, and evidence that some work formerly done by Eagle\u2019s service mechanics was transferred to Eagle\u2019s parent, Somerset Tire.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">On February 20, 1976, the company laid off its two remaining service mechanics. Eagle\u2019s office manager informed these employees that their layoffs were for economic reasons and that he would recall them if the work justified it. The two service mechanics testified that as of February 20 there were at least four repair jobs in the shop, and dealer preparation and warranty work to be done on new forklifts. Since February of 1976 the company has apparently discontinued all service and repair work on forklifts.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-12\">Based on these facts, the Board concluded that Eagle laid off its service mechanics in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>order to avoid bargaining with the Union as their representative, and therefore violated sections 8(a)(3) and (1) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 158(a)(3), (1) (1970). In addition, the Board found that although the company had an obligation to bargain with the Union as of January 20, 1975, when the company launched a campaign of unlawful conduct calculated to destroy the Union\u2019s majority status, it failed to give the Union any advance notice or opportunity to bargain about its changes in business practices or about the layoffs, and thereby violated sections 8(a)(5) and (1) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 158(a)(5), (1) (1970). The Board ordered Eagle to cease and desist from its unfair labor practices, to offer the laid-off service mechanics reinstatement to their former or equivalent positions with back pay, and, upon request, to recognize and bargain with the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">An employer violates section 8(a)(3) and (1) of the Act by discontinuing a part of its business and laying off persons employed therein if the action is motivated at least in part by antiunion considerations. <em>See NLRB r. Armcor Industries, Inc., supra, </em>535 F.2d at 243; <em>NLRB v. Townhouse T.V. &amp; Appliances, Inc., </em>531 F.2d 826, 828 (7th Cir. 1976); <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Princeton Inn Co., </em>424 F.2d 264, 265 (3d Cir. 1970). Conversely, an employer does not violate sections 8(a)(3) and (1) by discontinuing a part of its business and laying off employees if the action is motivated solely by economic considerations. <em>NLRB v. Townhouse T.V. &amp; Appliances, Inc., supra, </em>531 F.2d at 829. In this case, the Board was presented with evidence suggesting both economic and antiunion motivations for Eagle\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">The ALJ found that Eagle\u2019s opposition to the Union\u2019s attempt to organize its employees, and its prior unfair labor practices \u2014 including a threat to move service work \u2014 provided background material relevant to the determination of Eagle\u2019s motivation in laying off the service mechanics. All four of the laid-off mechanics, it should be noted, had signed union authorization cards during the organization drive. The first two discharges occurred within a week after the ALJ in <em>Eagle </em>I rendered his decision recommending that the Board issue a bargaining order to remedy the company\u2019s unfair labor practices. Some service mechanics testified that despite the assertion of Eagle\u2019s general manager that the layoffs were for economic reasons, there appeared to be considerable repair, maintenance, and preparation work available for them to perform. Furthermore, they said, some of the repair work formerly done in Eagle\u2019s shop was transferred to the parent company, Somerset Tire. There was similar testimony that service and repair work was also available in February 1976, when the last two service mechanics were laid off, allegedly for economic reasons. On the other hand, Eagle\u2019s general manager testified that business in the forklift industry fell off sixty to sixty-five percent in 1975, and that between February 1975 and February 1976 Eagle lost more than $150,000 before taxes. The company\u2019s escalating financial woes, he said, by February of 1976 compelled the elimination of Eagle\u2019s repair and service operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">The ALJ discredited the manager\u2019s testimony, and observed that Eagle had provided neither corroboration of the manager\u2019s generalized assertions nor data establishing the extent to which the service and repair portion of the company\u2019s business had declined. The ALJ found that the manager gave no adequate explanation of why Eagle\u2019s repair and service work was completely abandoned. In the absence of any evidence establishing economic justification for the layoffs, the ALJ concluded that Eagle had laid off the four service mechanics in order to avoid bargaining with the Union in violation of sections 8(a)(3) and (1) of the Act. The Board affirmed these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">Substantial evidence in the record as a whole supports the inference that anti-union considerations provided at least partial motivation for Eagle\u2019s decision to lay off the four service mechanics. Eagle\u2019s antiunion bias and demonstrated unlawful hostility provided \u201cproper and highly signif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>icant factors for Board evaluation in determining [the employer\u2019s] motive.\u201d <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Georgia Rug Mill, supra, </em>308 F.2d at 91. Furthermore, the timing of the first layoffs \u2014 one week after the decision of the ALJ recommending a bargaining order\u2014 supports the inference of antiunion motivation. <em>See NLRB v. Treasure Lake, Inc., </em>453 F.2d 202, 204 (3d Cir. 1971). Finally, the lack of any credible evidence<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> that Eagle had any economic justification for the layoffs, and the presence of evidence to the contrary, permitted the inference that Eagle\u2019s motive was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">The Board also found that because of the retroactive bargaining order issued in <em>Eagle </em>I, the company had an obligation to bargain with the Union as of January 20, 1975, and that Eagle violated sections 8(a)(5) and (1) of the Act by failing to bargain about its changes in business practices or about the layoffs after that date. We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">As we have pointed out above, the Board could in its discretion designate January 20, 1975, as the effective date of Eagle\u2019s bargaining obligation. Retroactive application of the bargaining order was, under the circumstances, a permissible means of restoring the status quo and dissipating the effects of the employer\u2019s unlawful conduct. <em>See Ann Lee Sportswear, Inc. v. NLRB, supra, </em>543 F.2d at 744. But as the Board itself recognized in <em>Eagle </em>I, retroactive application of the remedy does not, in the absence of a demand for recognition, transform the employer\u2019s unilateral changes in employment conditions after the effective date of the bargaining order into independent violations of section 8(a)(5). <em>See </em>note 4 <em>supra.</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The imposition of a bargaining order does nothing to alter the settled rule that a demand by the Union for recognition is a prerequisite to the finding of a section 8(a)(5) violation by the employer. <em>See NLRB v. Columbian Enameling &amp; Stamping Co., </em>306 U.S. 292, 297, 59 S.Ct. 501, 83 L.Ed. 660 (1939); <em>Steel City Trans port, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>389 F.2d 735, 739 (3d Cir. 1968); <em>Joy Silk Mills, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>87 U.S.App.D.C. 360, 185 F.2d 732, 741 (1950). In the absence of any evidence in this case that the Union made a demand upon the employer for recognition, we cannot sustain the 8(a)(5) violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">The facts of these cases illustrate the logical problems inherent in the Board\u2019s conclusion that Eagle violated section 8(a)(5) by failing to bargain about changes made after January 20, 1975. Apparently the union authorization cards from the service mechanics were not presented to Eagle prior to the election. The Union lost the election. In the next year, Eagle unilaterally made a number of changes in employment conditions and laid off all of the service mechanics who had not resigned voluntarily. Then, on June 21, 1976, the Board issued a bargaining order retroactive to January 20, 1975. The Board now urges that because of that bargaining order, all changes made unilaterally by Eagle after January 20, 1975, violated section 8(a)(5) even though the Union never requested recognition. What the Board overlooks is that the violations found must support the remedy ordered, not vice-versa; the Board\u2019s decision to fashion a retroactive remedy cannot <em>ipso facto </em>create violations where there would otherwise be none. There is a critical distinction between requiring Eagle to bargain, upon request, regarding changes made in the past \u2014 a legitimate exercise of the Board\u2019s remedial power \u2014 and finding 8(a)(5) violations in Eagle\u2019s failure to bargain about those changes when initially made.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">Despite our disagreement with the Board over the existence of an 8(a)(5) violation, we find that the remedy ordered in this case was within the Board\u2019s discretion. Reinstatement with back pay was an appropriate remedy for the violation of sections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>8(a)(3) and (1). <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(c) (1970). We note that the Board\u2019s order does not specifically require restoration of Eagle\u2019s service and repair operations, but rather directs that the laid-off employees be offered reinstatement \u201cto their former jobs or, if those jobs no longer exist, to substantially <em>equivalent positions.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.) <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Inasmuch as we have determined the bargaining order in <em>Eagle </em>I to be proper, we find it unnecessary to consider the appropriateness of the bargaining order in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The Board\u2019s petitions for enforcement will be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b234-6\">. Apgar denied using the quoted expression, but the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) credited employee witnesses who testified that Apgar used the phrase.
