There were no facilities to thoroughly search the vehicle and its load at Tecate, and the truck was allowed to proceed into the United States. On a private off-duty mission of his own, the Tecate Customs Inspector who had passed the truck through customs, saw it that same day about 10:15 a. m. headed for Chula Vista; not for Los Angeles. He later notified the Tecate Station of his observation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-10\">On August 5,1976, at 8:30 a. m., the same truck (easily identified) and the same driver, with a similar load of tin consigned to Los Angeles, came through Tecate again with 31,600 pounds of declared scrap tin. It was allowed to pass, but was placed under continuous surveillance as it drove away from Los Angeles and toward Chula Vista, until it entered a warehouse about 10:00 a. m., at Chula Vista. The warehouse\u2019s two front doors had previously been opened and remained open during part of that day. A wire fence surrounded a yard at one side of the warehouse (on which the open doors were located), and its wire gate was open during the entire day after 10:00 a. m.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-12\">About 10:15 a. m., two undercover Customs Inspectors, Mr. Pitt and Mr. Wise, drove their vehicle to the wire fenced, enclosed area, through its open gate, and parked their car near the double open doors, and entered into the warehouse on foot, about 50 or 60 feet. They saw the truck and trailer in the open, unpartitioned, otherwise unused 26,000 square-foot warehouse, and a U-Haul van parked near (Government\u2019s Ex. No. 7). The two inspectors talked to two of the several defendants about a possible rental of the warehouse. They saw that some tin scrap had been unloaded from the truck, and thereafter left the warehouse premises. The surveillance of the warehouse was continued from a distance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-13\">Thereafter, during the day, at least nine automobiles entered the yard, and four or five entered the warehouse. Of these three of them were rental vans (the blue Ford Econoline, Govs.Exs. 10 and 11; the PHd rental van, Gov.Ex. 6, which was later stopped; and the U-Haul van). Two others were pickup trucks, and three or four more were passenger cars. Counting the individuals who arrived on foot from cars parked outside the fenced area, approximately ten \u201capparently male Mexican workmen\u201d, also entered the warehouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-14\">A Drug Enforcement Administration (herein DEA) agent was called by the sur-veilling customs officers, and directed the proceedings thereafter. The officers decided to keep the warehouse under surveillance until one or more of the vehicles inside the warehouse, which were of a type that could conceal the contents of the vehicle, should leave the warehouse. At 5:17 such a vehicle (the PHd van) left the premises, was stopped for investigation 500 yards away, and when the driver opened the rear door, the customs officer could see and smell the marijuana contained therein, 498 kilos of it. The driver was then arrested. Almost immediately the officers entered the warehouse and arrested eight within it, and one outside it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>They saw the two other vans were loaded with kilos of marijuana, and two piles of kilos of marijuana stacked in corners, on the floor: a total of about 1,301 kilos. About one-half of the scrap tin was off the truck on the floor (Gov.Ex. 5), and the semi-truck was about one-third full of scrap tin (Gov.Ex. 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-5\">The foregoing evidence was introduced on the hearing of the motion to suppress evidence heard on September 20th and September 29th, 1976, before the Honorable Howard B. Turrentine; who, after hearing argument from all defendants, denied the motions to suppress, in a carefully thought out statement appearing at pp. 205 to 210 (C.T.).</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-6\">Judge Turrentine discussed the geographical factors present, the location of Tecate 30 miles east of Tijuana; its smallness as a commercial area and that port of entry station\u2019s lack of facilities for the inspection and search of commercial vehicles (as compared to the facilities at Tijuana). He commented on the unusual route to be taken by the two truck loads, ostensibly headed for Los Angeles. The judge mentioned the continuous surveillance of the second load from the border until it drove into the warehouse; mentioned and characterized the several \u201cFor Lease\u201d signs on and about the premises. \u201cAnd I note that none of these signs indicated, Do not Disturb Tenant; Call Real Estate Office, or Call for Appointment to View \u2014 merely said the building was for lease.\u201d He commented on the officers\u2019 morning entry through the open wire gate; and the open warehouse doors, and their seeing that the tin was being off-loaded at Chula Vista, not Los Angeles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-7\">At pp. 208-210 (C.T.), the Court then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-8\">\u201cNow, it\u2019s clear to me that the manner and method by which the building was occupied and used, that the occupiers and user had no reasonable expectation of privacy. One, if they\u2019d have wanted privacy they could have closed the gates and the door.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-9\">\u201cSecondly, they knew, at the time, that the building was for lease and they could have, at any time, expected people to call, or to come into the premises. And it\u2019s not entirely uncommon for people to walk into parking lots and into buildings just to look to see what\u2019s going on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-10\">\u201cWith this, it was pretty obvious that they were taking the scrap metal off, that something was wrong, the manifest showing Los Angeles, and the scrap tin is being unloaded in this warehouse in Chu-la Vista. People start coming and going, and the officers have a pretty good idea, by that time, what\u2019s in there, or should have, and they wait till they see a van, a U-Haul van goes in and comes out, and we know that most of the marijuana is hauled in rental cars, that\u2019s the way it is. People don\u2019t like to subject their own personal vehicles to seizure, so they go out to Kirby\u2019s and lease a car and use it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-11\">\u201cNo question in my mind that the officers had a right to enter the building for purposes for which they did. There\u2019s no question in my mind that they had a right to stop the van, as they did, at least, a founded suspicion to stop the driver of that car. And the Court made special inquiry this morning, as to the amount of marijuana in the truck, for a particular purpose, 400 and some odd kilos, and I\u2019ve always been leery of the officer that smelled the strong odor of marijuana, two or three kilos, but when there\u2019s 488 kilos, and a warm day in August, the probabilities are that smelled like a bale of alfalfa, hay in the field.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-12\">\u201cSo, the motion to suppress the evidence is denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1031-13\">III. <em>Participation in the Conspiracy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1031-14\">With the exception of defendant Jaime <em>Murillo </em>-Pacheco (who was driving the PHd van, with its 498 kilos of marijuana when arrested), all defendants arrested and charged were on the warehouse premises, and had been there inside the warehouse during the last four or five hours before 5:20 p. m. Some. 1,800 kilo packages of marijuana, easily recognized as such, had been first unloaded and next loaded again <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>in another vehicle, or placed in open piles, all in plain sight and obvious smell of any person within the one-room, non-partitioned space of the warehouse. It is a reasonable inference to conclude that all present were knowing participants in the possession of, and in a conspiracy to possess, marijuana, with the intent to distribute it within the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-4\">We are of the view that the combination of facts cited above, together with the inferences that could properly be drawn, supported the district court\u2019s decision, and that a conspiracy in fact existed. <em>Cf. United States v. Guerrera, </em>554 F.2d 987, 989 (9th Cir. 1977). We must keep in mind that the present three appellants do not contest the proof establishing a conspiracy to smuggle marijuana, but only dispute the fact that evidence existed connecting each of them with the conspiracy. \u201c[Their] argument fails to account for the lower standard of proof for the latter once the conspiracy has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Wood, </em>550 F.2d 435, 441 (9th Cir. 1976). Once a conspiracy is established to the satisfaction of the trier of fact, little evidence is required to connect one who is in contact with it (and particularly one who is an active, physical participant), even though he is but slightly involved in bringing the conspiracy to its attempted conclusion. <em>United States v. Costey, </em>554 F.2d 909, 910-911 (9th Cir. 1977), <em>cert. </em>denied, - U.S. -, 97 S.Ct. 2928, 53 L.Ed.2d 1065 (1977)\u2014(\u201cWe find that this constitutes the necessary slight evidence of participation. The evidence in the aggregate indicates that Costey intended to join and cooperate in the illegal venture. <em>Miller v. United States, </em>382 F.2d 583, 587 (9th Cir. 1967)\u201d); <em>United States v. Freie, </em>545 F.2d 1217, 1221-22 (9th Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-10\">In determining this issue, we must view any reasonable inference arising from the evidence in a light most favorable to the government, as the prevailing party. <em>United States v. Hood, </em>493 F.2d 677 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 852, 95 S.Ct. 94, 42 L.Ed.2d 84 (1974).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-11\">\u201cThe government does not have to prove that all of the defendants met together at the same time and ratified the illegal scheme. This just is not the nature of a conspiracy, especially a large narcotics smuggling and distribution organization as we have here. <em>See Blumenthal v. United States, </em>332 U.S. 539, 68 S.Ct. 248, 92 L.Ed. 154 (1947).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1032-13\"><em>United States v. Perry, </em>550 F.2d 524, 533 (9th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"aui-dedup-1\">IV. <em>The Warehouse Entry.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1032-15\">The denial of the motion to suppress the marijuana in the warehouse was proper. There was no expectation of privacy in the warehouse by the lessees at the time of the warrantless entry at 10:15 a. m. on August 5, 1977 by government agents. The lessees knew there were two other sets of keys in the hands of non-lessees; the one wire gate and several doors were standing open and unguarded; the lessee was instructed to welcome men and vehicles. No signs prohibited, or even indicated any attempt to restrict, the entrance by the public onto the premises. Indeed, the only one observed by the agents was a large \u201cFor Lease\u201d sign.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-16\">Further, the government agents seized nothing, and saw no contraband upon their entry.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1033-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>Y. <em>Further Facts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1033-5\">The second motion to acquit was heard by Judge Turrentine after the government had completed its case to the jury trial. Much of the evidence introduced on the motion to suppress was introduced again at the trial, as well as much new evidence. Included were (1) the two manifests as to the two loads declared, their size and their purported destination; (2) photographs of all defendants; (3) the lease of the warehouse; (4) the rental agreements for two of the vans<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (these two vans when seized contained 560 and 498 kilos of marijuana, respectively); (5) the government \u201carrest, search and seizure forms\u201d of the two vans listed in Note 3, as well as \u201cthe Chevrolet blue van\u201d (this van was seized in the warehouse and was found to contain 661 kilos of marijuana); (6) the details of the continuous surveillance; (7) the stop of the PHd van and, after the discovery of 498 kilos of marijuana inside, the arrest of Jaime Murillo-Pacheco (Gov.Ex. 20); and (8) it was stipulated that all confiscated kilos contained marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-23\">Finally, the government called a co-defendant (Castaneda) to testify. He stated that he was arrested at the warehouse on August 5, 1976, and that he was unloading a truck of tin scrap and marijuana that day. Castaneda testified that there were others involved in unloading the truck.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1034-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>The appellants then made a Rule 29 motion for a judgment of acquittal. After hearing argument, Judge Turrentine adequately and carefully explained why he would deny it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-4\">\u201cThe Court: Well, gentlemen, we have a large warehouse here, twenty-six thousand square feet. We also have just short of two thousand kilos of marijuana. We have five or six people in the warehouse. Those defendants are on trial here today were in the warehouse. We have a truck with thirty tons or thirty thousand pounds of metal, half of it unloaded. We have a U-haul which was loaded with five hundred kilos of marijuana. We have a blue van that had six hundred sixty-one kilos of marijuana. We have a hundred eighty kilos on the ground up in the northwest corner of the warehouse waiting to be picked up, I would guess. We have four hundred eighty-nine kilograms of marijuana that was picked up in the PHd.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-5\">\u201cCertainly, the Government wasn\u2019t inside there to see who loaded the truck, unloaded the truck and trailer, who moved the marijuana and who loaded it, but <em>I think a reasonable inference can be drawn that with nineteen hundred kilos of marijuana, that there people moved it from the truck to the various smaller conveyances, smaller truck, and that it was </em>\u2014 they <em>were a part of this conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute the marijuana involved in the case.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-6\">\u201cThe other charge, possession with intent to distribute, we\u2019ll just let the jury decide as to both of them. It may be arguable the government hasn\u2019t met the burden, but I think there is sufficient evidence to go to the jury, and the jury may draw from there inferences as may exist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-10\">\u201cMotion of acquittal on behalf of all the defendants is denied.\u201d [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1034-13\">(R.T. p. 262, 1. 24 to p. 264, 1. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-14\">We hold this ruling was not erroneous for the reasons hereinbefore stated as applicable to the first motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-15\">VI. <em>Testimony of Co-defendant Razo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1034-16\">Thereupon, counsel for Mr. Razo announced he was ready to open the defense for his client. The three counsel for the defendants now appealing (Gutierrez, Garcia and Martinez) rested their defense without the production of any evidence. For the record, the judge ordered a Rule 29 motion entered and denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-17\">Razo then testified. He admitted renting the warehouse, as had been previously testified to, but denied he had been present when the blue Chevy van was purchased, as testified by a previous witness. He stated that on August 4, 1976, he had received a phone call which he thought to be from co-defendant Olmos (compare R.T. 271-72 with R.T. 241) requesting him to open the warehouse early on August 5, 1976, which he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-18\">Razo was paid by Olmos and was urged to help unload the scrap tin. When Razo first testified that he suggested using a forklift to unload the scrap, Olmos replied: \u201cWhat are you talking about? The marijuana is inside and with the forklift it could hurt those packages.\u201d Olmos opportuned Razo to help unload, and Razo did so. Under cross-examination, Razo testified he asked Olmos:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-19\">\u201cQ Why don\u2019t you get one of those forklift so you can take that scrap metal off of it easier, you know?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1034-20\">And he says, \u201cAre you crazy? This is marijuana inside, and its covering the packages.\u201d (R.T. 311 and 313.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>Razo testified that this request made him \u201cunhappy.\u201d \u201cI wasn\u2019t feeling good \u2014 I feel like running away this minute, but I said they probably follow me or something. They know already they got marijuana, so I better keep my mouth shut and keep working.\u201d And he did (R.T. 275 and 313-14). It was Razo who talked to Officers Pitt and Wise within the warehouse earlier on the morning of August 5,1976. Razo had been told by Olmos previously there would be some cars and a semi-truck showing up at the warehouse, and to let them in the warehouse (R.T. 296). Razo identified appellant <em>Martinez </em>as the driver of the U-Haul van (Gov.Ex. 15) (R.T. 298), who sat in his van watching \u201cthe others,\u201d and reading (R.T. 303). Olmos and \u201ctwo others\u201d arrived as Officers Pitt and Wise left. They were Murillo (Gov.Ex. 20) and Garcia (Gov.Ex. 16) (R.T. 304).</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-5\">At first and before lunch, Razo and \u201cthe old man, the driver\u201d (non-defendant Rafael Vasquez) were unloading scrap tin. Then Olmos got lunch, and Razo and \u201call the rest of the guys ate lunch\u201d (R.T. 320), and <em>after </em>lunch, <em>Garcia </em>and <em>Murillo </em>helped unload \u201cup on the truck with me.\u201d Co-defendant Castaneda (Gov.Ex. 22) also helped unload, and co-defendant Espericueta (Gov.Ex. 21) was \u201creceiving the packages of marijuana\u201d and putting them on the vans, as was co-defendant Olmos (R.T. 314).</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-9\">The kilo packages were wrapped in transparent paper all around. (See Gov.Ex. 13) When the big packages were dumped off the truck onto the floor, Olmos opened some (but not all), to count the snialler kilo packages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-10\">Razo identified co-defendant Osomio as present and working during the unloading (Gov.Ex. 18, R.T. 328). He identified Ruben <em>Gutierrez </em>-Garcia, as present and \u201chelping everybody unload, pushing those bundles\u201d (Gov.Ex. 17, R.T. 328).</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-11\">Thus, there was specific testimony which, if believed, tied each appellant into the conspiracy, and established the substantive count of possession.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1035-12\">VII. <em>The Stop of the PHd Van.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1035-13\">The sole question on this phase of the appeal is whether the district court erred in denying the appellants\u2019 motion to suppress the contraband. We first question the standing of either of the three appellants to raise the question. None of them claim any ownership or possessory interest to the 640 kilos of marijuana in the PHd van.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We could, but need not, rely on the lack of standing in each of these three appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-14\">Entirely apart from the lack of standing, we conclude that both the stop of Murillo\u2019s van, and his subsequent arrest without a warrant, were each reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>and proper. Initially, concerning the stop of the van, it is noted that the events herein occurred near the border in an area with a high incidence of contraband smuggling. The suspicion of the Tecate Customs Inspector, who had five years of experience, was properly aroused when he observed the semi-tractor truck divert from its declared route to Los Angeles and take a smaller more winding road in a different direction towards Chula Vista. Likewise, that suspicion was strengthened when, a week later, the same driver in the same truck, after presenting papers to the same customs officer and making statements to the effect that the truck was travelling to Los Angeles, again took the same turnoff to Chula Vista. Maintaining a constant surveillance, the officers determined that the truck ultimately stopped at a warehouse, which, except for the truck, was entirely empty. Thereafter, there began a procession of automobiles, vans and small open trucks in and out of the warehouse facilities, with approximately a dozen individuals involved. At that point, the officers had a founded suspicion to believe that any one of the covered vans \u201cleaving the warehouse would contain contraband.\u201d Thus, they were entitled to make \u201can investigatory stop.\u201d <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>558 F.2d 522, 524 (9th Cir. decided June 27, 1977); <em>United States v. Larios-Montes, </em>500 F.2d 941, 943-44 (9th Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>422 U.S. 1057, 95 S.Ct. 2681, 45 L.Ed.2d 709 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-4\">We then turn to whether, after such stop, there was probable cause for Officer Maxwell to arrest Murillo. On the motion to suppress, a trial judge held there was probable cause for the arrest. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-5\">At the Motion to Suppress, Officer Maxwell testified at the time he <em>approached </em>the van he noticed a strong odor of marijuana coming from the van (R.T.M.,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> p. 150). On cross-examination, Maxwell was shown the report he made on August 6, 1976, with respect to his stopping the PHd van, and his arrest of the driver, co-defendant Murillo. He admitted the report did <em>not </em>state he smelled the marijuana when he <em>approached </em>the van (R.T.M., p. 164). However, it did state that he did smell the marijuana <em>after </em>the rear door had been opened. (R.T.M., p. 164). On direct examination at the trial, Maxwell said he noticed the smell of marijuana \u201cwhile talking to the driver,\u201d \u201ca strong, pungent odor of marijuana.\u201d (R.T., 243). This represents a conflict in the evidence on an important point, but the trial judge chose to believe the officer\u2019s testimony at the trial. However, none of the defendants at the trial cross-examined Maxwell on his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-9\">In addition to his statements regarding the marijuana odor, Officer Maxwell also testified at the hearing on the motion to suppress, that the second officer at the investigatory stop (Officer Kelly) had apparently looked into the rear window of the van and observed what seemed to be marijuana bricks. (R.T.M., p. 151).</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-10\">We have repeatedly held that, \u201c[i]f after a valid investigatory stop probable cause arises, the search may then be made\u201d, <em>United States v. Bugarin-Casas, </em>484 F.2d 853, 854 (9th Cir. 1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 1136, 94 S.Ct. 881, 38 L.Ed.2d 762 (1974). <em>See, e.g., United States v.

The detection of marijuana odor emanating from a vehicle has been held sufficient in such situations to give rise to probable cause to search. <em>See Russell, supra, </em>546 F.2d at 840; <em>United States v. Laird, </em>511 F.2d 1039, 1040 (9th Cir. 1975); <em>United States v. Ojeda-Rodriguez, </em>502 F.2d 560, 561 (9th Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>420 U.S. 910, 95 S.Ct. 830, 42 L.Ed.2d 839 (1975). Likewise, the observation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>what apparently is contraband material in plain view within a vehicle would also give rise to probable cause for a search. Here, there was testimony which, if believed, established both the sighting and smell of the marijuana during a valid investigatory stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-5\">In addition, it is also noted here that the investigatory stop took place <em>after </em>ordinary office hours of judicial officers to whom the government agents might have gone for a warrant. Prior to the exit from the warehouse of some vehicle which was suitable to carry contraband, the officers could merely surmise what was going on within the warehouse. The time of the day when the stop occurred was triggered by the defendant\u2019s conduct alone; not by that of the officers. The exigencies of all the existing circumstances authorized and required an investigatory stop. <em>United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, </em>422 U.S. 873-874, 95 S.Ct. 2574, 45 L.Ed.2d 607 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-6\">We hold it was lawful.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1037-7\">\u201cThe search made here- was proper under the moving vehicle exception. Under this exception all that is required to stop and search an automobile on the highway is probable cause to believe that it contains any kind of contraband. <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>403 U.S. 443, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 29 L.Ed.2d 564 (1971). The search is justified by exigent circumstances because \u2018the car is movable, the occupants are alerted, and the cars content may not be found again if a warrant must be obtained . . ..\u2019 <em>Chambers v. Maroney, </em>399 U.S. 42, 51, 90 S.Ct. 1975, 26 L.Ed.2d 419 (1970).\u201d <em>United States v. Abascal </em>(9th Cir., decided March 18, 1977).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1037-9\">VIII. <em>Instructions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1037-10\">With respect to Gutierrez\u2019 claim of error in instructions, he points to the trial judge\u2019s refusal to give the sole instruction offered by Gutierrez on the necessity of proof of specific intent to commit the offense, which was alleged to have been the object of a particular conspiracy. Instead, the trial court gave its own conspiracy instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-11\">Counsel for Gutierrez goes so far as to state that specific intent was <em>never </em>mentioned in the court\u2019s instruction (Gutierrez\u2019 Opening Brief, p. 8, lines 13-14). However, in addition to the court\u2019s own instruction objected to by Gutierrez (appearing at R.T. 342 to 344), the court had previously instructed on specific intent (R.T. 339, line 18, to 340, line 18). There, proof of specific intent was mentioned at least three times. There it was stated that the inference of intent may arise from surrounding circumstances, and that such intent may be proved by circumstantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-12\">In this portion of his instructions, the trial court also instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1037-13\">\u201cMere presence at the scene of the crime and knowledge that the crime is being committed are not sufficient to establish that the defendant committed the crime or aided and abetted the crime unless you find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was a participant and not merely a knowing spectator.\u201d (R.T. 340).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMi\">The instruction given, with slight changes, follows <em>Devitt &amp; Blackmore\u2019s </em>Instruction 13.03, 2d ed., p. 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-14\">Reading the instructions given by the trial judge \u201cas a whole,\u201d <em>Cupp v. Naughten, </em>414 U.S. 141, 147, 94 S.Ct. 396, 38 L.Ed.2d 368 (1973), (as the jury here was carefully instructed it must do \u2014 (R.T. 335)), and looking upon the evidence in the most favorable light to sustain the judgment of conviction, <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); <em>United States v. Ramirez-Rodriquez, </em>552 F.2d 883, 884 (9th Cir. 1977), we have no hesitation in concluding that the judge\u2019s total instuctions on specific intent was sufficient and adequate, and did not constitute error. A trial judge need not give an instruction proposed by counsel for either side, provided he gives adequate instructions on each element of the case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1037-15\">\u201cA party has no vested interest in any particular form of instructions . the language of the instructions is for the trial court to determine. If on the entire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>charges it appears that the jury has been fairly and adequately instructed, the requirements of the law are satisfied.\u201d Moore\u2019s Manual of Fed. Practice and Procedure, Vol. 5a, \u00a7 22.07(2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1038-4\"><em>See also Tucker v. United States, </em>151 U.S. 164, 170, 14 S.Ct. 299, 38 L.Ed. 112 (1893); <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>503 F.2d 838, 841 (9th Cir. 1974); <em>Amsler v. United States, </em>381 F.2d 37, 52 (9th Cir. 1967); <em>Rivers v. United States, </em>368 F.2d 362, 364 (9th Cir. 1966). There was no error in the instructions as given.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-5\">Finding no error in the conviction of each appellant, we <em>affirm </em>the convictions as to each.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1029-14\">. In each instance we refer to the three appel-lees by their <em>paternal </em>Mexican names, i. e., Ruben <em>Gutierrez </em>-Garcia, Alfonso <em>Garcia </em>-Sanchez, and Francisco <em>Martinez </em>-Martinez.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-15\">Gutierrez was sentenced to three years with six months in confinement and probation for the rest of the three years, each count to run <em>concurrently.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1029-16\">Martinez was sentenced to two years with three years probation, each count to run <em>concurrently.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1029-17\">Garcia was sentenced to the custody of the Federal Youth Corrections Act, each count to run <em>concurrently.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1029-28\">Appellants\u2019 primary contentions on appeal is that the evidence was insufficient to support the denial of the various Rule 29 motions for acquittal. Each appellant received a concurrent sentence on each of the two counts. Thus, if we affirm the conspiracy count, we need not consider the issues raised as to the possession count. <em>United States v. Costey, </em>9 Cir., 554 F.2d 909, <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 97 S.Ct. 2928, 53 L.Ed.2d 1065 (1977); <em>United States v.

The appellants also moved to suppress the marijuana hidden in the truck within the warehouse when the two customs officers (Pitt and Wise) entered the warehouse in the forenoon of August 5, 1975, about 10:15 a. m.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-8\">The only persons within the warehouse at 10:15 a. m. were defendants Martinez, Razo, and the non-defendant truck driver Vasquez. Defendants Olmos, Murillo and Garcia arrived just as Pitt and Wise left the warehouse (R.T. 104). Pitt and Wise saw no contraband while within the warehouse, nor any furtive or suspicious actions, and had no reason to reasonably believe there was any contraband therein when they left. And, of course, they neither <em>searched </em>nor <em>seized </em>any contraband.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-18\">Thus appellant defendants had no standing, automatic or actual, to move to suppress contraband based on the 10:15 a. m. entry. <em>Cf.
