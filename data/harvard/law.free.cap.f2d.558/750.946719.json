He claims he was injured by a fusillade of coconuts launched by young hooligans while he was patrolling a canal in a city vessel. He maintains that the vessel offered inadequate protection from such assault. Accordingly, he filed suit against the city and others in the district court, invoking its jurisdiction under the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 688, and general admiralty jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-11\">With only plaintiff\u2019s complaint and defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss before it, the district court dismissed the suit with prejudice. This was error. Plaintiff alleged that his employer\u2019s negligence had caused him injury while he was acting as a seaman in the course of his employment, explicitly invoking the Jones Act. The complaint stated a cause of action sufficient to withstand the motion to dismiss. The barebone pleadings here cannot resolve such issues as whether plaintiff will be able to bring himself within the definition of \u201cseaman\u201d or whether the canals of the city are navigable.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-14\">If plaintiff can prove himself entitled to Jones Act recovery, the exclusive remedy provisions of Florida\u2019s workmen\u2019s compensation statutes cannot oust the federal court of its jurisdiction. The related state proceedings that have taken place form no part of the record before us, so we have no cause to consider what, if any, res judicata or collateral estoppel effect they might have.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-15\">In short, the result reached by the district court may ultimately prove to rest on <em>terra firma. </em>At this stage of the proceedings, however, one simply cannot know. Consequently, Davey Jones must open his locker to make way for yet another \u201cBlue Cat\u201d. <em>See Barber v. Motor Vessel \u201cBlue Cat\u201d, </em>372 F.2d 626 (5th Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-16\">The judgment of the district court is REVERSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
