Pursuant to \u00a7 0.14 of the Rules of this court, this petition is being determined by Judges Lumbard and Meskill.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b187-5\">LUMBARD, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Household Finance Corporation appeals from a January 17, 1977 decision by Judge Neaher in the Eastern District which affirmed an order by Bankruptcy Judge P\u00e1rente granting judgment against Keith Danns, the bankrupt, for only a portion of his debt to HFC. Appellant maintains that a false financial statement submitted by a debtor in renewing a loan renders his entire debt nondischargeable under section 17 a(2) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 35(a)(2). We conclude that discharge should be barred only as to that portion of the loan regarding which the misrepresentation was material, and accordingly we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">On January 24, 1975, Danns, who was already indebted to HFC for $2019.37, obtained an additional loan of $483, and signed a new note for $3261.96 (which included finance charges) payable over 36 months.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the time Danns listed a debt of $50 to one Gerst as his only other indebtedness, although he actually owed some $14,000 to other creditors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A year later, when Danns filed for bankruptcy, his debt to HFC stood at $2622.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">Section 17 a provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-9\">A discharge in bankruptcy shall release a bankrupt from all of his provable debts . except such as . (2) are liabilities for obtaining money or property by false pretenses or false representations, <em>or for obtaining money or property on credit or obtaining an extension or renewal of credit in reliance upon a materially false statement in writing respecting his financial condition made . with intent to deceive .</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-17\"><em>11 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 35(a) (emphasis supplied). The italicized language was added by Congress in 1960.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-18\">Prior to 1960 a lender who advanced money based on a false financial statement could choose either to bar discharge of the bankrupt entirely under the then \u00a7 14 c(3) \u2014and thereby provide a windfall to all the other creditors \u2014 or to bar discharge of only the debt itself under \u00a7 17 a(2). Under the old \u00a7 17 a(2) where the debtor obtained an additional loan and signed a new note covering the old balance as well, state courts were split over whether discharge should be barred for the entire loan or only for the \u201cfresh cash.\u201d Compare cases cited in Townsend, <em>\u201cFresh Cash\u201d </em>\u2014 Another <em>Element of a Bankrupt\u2019s \u201cFresh Start\u201d?, </em>31 U.Miami L.Rev. 275, 281 n.39 (1977), with cases cited in id. at 281-82 n.40.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-19\">In 1960, Congress eliminated the old \u00a7 14 c(3) and enacted the amendment to \u00a7 17 a(2). State courts interpreted this as a compromise whereby the defrauded lender lost the right to bar the bankrupt\u2019s entire discharge, but was still to be entitled to a complete bar of discharge on his own claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, since Congress gave the federal courts exclusive jurisdiction over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>dischargeability questions in 1970, see 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 35(c)(1), a large majority of federal district courts and bankruptcy referees have concluded that only that portion of the credit obtained as a result of a fraudulent statement should be barred from discharge. See cases cited in Townsend, <em>supra </em>at 284 n.53.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Contra, In re Fields, </em>Nos. B-75-443, -444 (D.Conn. Mar. 21, 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">We think the proper construction of \u00a7 17 a(2) is unmistakable. The language of \u00a7 17 a(2) bars discharge only of \u201cliabilities for obtaining\u201d extensions of renewals of credit \u201cin reliance upon a materially false statement\u201d; this strongly implies that the creditor should be entitled to bar discharge only of that portion of his loan as was obtained fraudulently. There is nothing in the legislative history of the 1960 amendments to indicate a congressional intent that a bankrupt should be penalized for more than simply the consequences of his fraud.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nor does it seem equitable for a bankrupt to be deprived of discharge on all his indebtedness to a particular creditor simply because a small portion of it was procured dishonestly.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, since exceptions to discharge are to be narrowly construed, see <em>Gleason v. Thaw, </em>236 U.S. 558, 562, 35 S.Ct. 287, 59 L.Ed. 717 (1915), we read \u00a7 17 a(2) as barring discharge only to the extent that the creditor could actually have relied upon the debtor\u2019s misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">The burden is on the creditor to prove the exception. Here there was no evidence that the original loan was renewed in reliance on the false representation. Indeed, HFC seems to say that the original loan was renewed only because state law required that it be consolidated with the new loan of $483. This was not a true extension of the original loan: the record does not show that Danns\u2019 original obligations would have fallen due sooner had it not been for the refinancing. Thus, the only credit extended in reliance on Danns\u2019 misrepresentation was the additional amount loaned, and HFC can bar discharge only of the $483 plus finance charges thereon.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b187-13\">. New York Banking Law \u00a7 352(b) prohibits a small loan company from having more than one loan contract in effect with the same borrower at any one time. Hence HFC was obliged by law to consolidate the old loan of $2019.37 with the new one of $483 and make out a new note for the total amount, plus the finance charges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b187-14\">. The bankruptcy judge found that Danns had acted with intent to deceive when he supplied HFC with the incomplete list of his outstanding debts. This finding is not contested on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b187-21\">. See <em>HFC v. Walters, </em>8 Ariz.App. 114, 443 P.2d 929 (1968); <em>Budget Finance v.

See also Lee, <em>Leading Case Commentary, </em>46 Am.Bankr.L.J. 245, 248 (1972) (state courts\u2019 interpretation of \u00a7 17 a(2) was a \u201ccolossal error\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b188-6\">. Generally, the 1960 legislative history of \u00a7 17 a(2) simply tracks the statutory language. See S.Rep.No.1688, 86th Cong., 2d Sess., in 1960 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, p. 2956 (\u201c[an] obligation <em>incurred as a result of </em>[a false financial] statement to be nondischargeable\u201d (emphasis supplied)); 1960 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, p. 2957 (letter of J. Glassman to Sen. Eastland). The only support for appellant\u2019s interpretation is in testimony by a practicing lawyer, which was not acknowledged or acquiesced in by any members of Congress at the hearing. See Hearing on H.R. 106 Before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 85th Cong., 2d Sess. 102 (1958) (remarks of L. Chapman).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b188-13\">. The rule urged by HFC would encourage unscrupulous lenders making extensions on consumer loans to play down the importance of outstanding debts or even to suggest to the applicant that he write on the application form that he has no other debts. By inducing the naive debtor to make a false statement, the finance company might hope to protect itself against extinguishment of the debt in bankruptcy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b188-14\">. The district court failed to award HFC its finance charges on the $483 fresh cash. However, since the record does not enable us to determine what portion of the finance charges is attributable to the $483, and since HFC has not raised the point on this appeal, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment as it stands.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
