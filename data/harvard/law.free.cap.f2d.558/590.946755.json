Plaintiffs are defaulting mortgagors on Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insured mortgages claiming the difference between the price HUD paid for the properties at foreclosure sale and the fair market value of the properties. They present three alternative grounds for relief: (1) that the foreclosure sale was materially defective under Georgia law; (2) that under Georgia law they have the right to recover the difference between the sale price and fair market value; and (3) that the foreclosure sale constituted a taking without just compensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Upon careful consideration of all issues raised by plaintiffs, we hold for the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-15\">In 1948 plaintiffs mortgaged apartment house projects which they owned in Georgia. Prudential Insurance Company (Prudential) was the mortgagee, and the mortgages were insured by FHA. In 1968, after several debt rescheduling arrangements and other modifications, plaintiffs defaulted on the mortgages. Prudential, in order to collect the mortgage insurance, assigned the deeds securing the mortgages to HUD.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>Defendant then proceeded to foreclose on the mortgages, following, it believed, applicable Georgia procedure for sheriff\u2019s sales<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the power of sale provision contained in paragraph eleven of the mortgages.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">Prior to sale, defendant published separate Notices of Sale in the DeKalb County <em>New </em>Era<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on September 5,1968 and weekly thereafter through September 26, 1968, for each of the three properties. The Notices stated that the realty and personalty separately described (as required by Georgia law, <em>see Hinson v. First Nat'l Bank in Waycross, </em>221 Ga. 408, 144 S.E.2d 765 (1965)) would be sold at public auction \u201cby the Secretary of HUD, or his attorney, before the Courthouse door in Decatur, DeKalb County, Georgia, between the legal hours of sale on the first Tuesday in October, 1968.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">As the U. S. Attorney was reading the notice of sale on the morning of the appointed Tuesday, he was served at the Courthouse steps by plaintiffs\u2019 temporary restraining order (TRO) enjoining the sale. Defendant immediately acted to remove the suit from the local county court, where the TRO was obtained, to federal district court. Still on the same appointed Tuesday (October 1, 1968), the district court vacated the TRO and the sale was conducted that afternoon at 3 PM, admittedly within the legal hours of sale. Defendant was the only bidder. It purchased the property from itself at a price equal to about ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding indebtedness of the mortgages.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">On October 17, 1968, defendant brought suit to \u201cconfirm\u201d the sales, as required by Georgia law in order for a creditor to sue his debtor for any deficiency resulting from a resale. Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 67-1503, 67-1504. The federal district court refused to confirm the sales on the ground that the sale price of the properties \u201cwas considerably less than true market value.\u201d But the court in its discretion also refused to order a resale, in effect securing title in the Government. The district court decision was affirmed on appeal by the Fifth Circuit, <em>United States v. Golf Club Co., </em>Civ. No. 12163, 12164, 12165 (N.D.Ga., Dec. 31, 1969) <em>aff\u2019d </em>435 F.2d 9 (5th Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">On October 21, 1968, plaintiffs filed suit in federal district court to set aside the sales on the ground that the bidding on the sales was \u201cchilled.\u201d The district court refused plaintiffs\u2019 request, saying that any \u201cchilling\u201d that had occurred was due to plaintiffs\u2019 own action in obtaining a TRO. This decision was also affirmed on appeal by the Fifth Circuit. <em>Oglethorpe Co. v. Weaver, </em>Civ. No. 12131 (N.D.Ga., March 28, 1969), <em>aff\u2019d </em>420 F.2d 696 (5th Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>Plaintiffs then brought another suit against the Government (again in federal district court) seeking (1) to reinstate title in themselves and (2) to prevent defendant from disposing of the property. Plaintiffs alleged an unconstitutional taking of property. The federal district court again refused plaintiffs\u2019 requests, saying that <em>Oglethorpe Co. v. Weaver </em>had disposed of all the issues brought in this second suit, and, therefore, dismissed on the grounds of res judicata. <em>Oglethorpe Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>Civ. No. 16546 (N.D.Ga., Oct. 20, 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">After the conclusion of all these suits, plaintiffs were left, it appears, with but one avenue of possible relief \u2014 resort to the Court of Claims. They availed themselves of this avenue in June 1974, when a petition was filed seeking the difference between the purchase price paid by defendant and the fair market value of the properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">Plaintiffs present three principal arguments to the court. First, they claim that the original sale of the properties was materially defective. Second, they take the position that defendant breached the mortgage contract by failing to sell the properties at fair market value. With regard to this argument, plaintiffs explain that Georgia law allowing recovery from the mortgagee-seller of the difference between fair market value and the sale price should prevail over Federal law which prohibits HUD from bidding more than the amount of the indebtedness for property at a foreclosure sale. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1713(k) (1970).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As a final argument, plaintiffs put forward a Fifth Amendment<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> taking theory, claiming that defendant by purchasing the properties at less than fair market value, has \u201ctaken\u201d the properties without just compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-12\">Defendant counters each of plaintiffs\u2019 positions in turn. First, defendant states that plaintiffs\u2019 claim of \u201cmaterial defects\u201d in the original sale is barred by res judicata. Next the Government asserts that Federal law controls the amount that it can pay for properties at foreclosure sale and that under Federal law, plaintiffs have no claim. Finally, defendant takes the position that plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cFifth Amendment taking\u201d argument is wholly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-13\">We agree with defendant on each point and, therefore, hold against plaintiffs, dismissing their petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-14\">Turning first to plaintiffs\u2019 claim of \u201cmaterial defects\u201d in the sale of the properties, we find that the Government closely tracked the requirements for sheriff\u2019s sales <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>set forth in the Georgia laws. Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 37-607, 37-1101-08, 37-1201-06. Even with plaintiffs\u2019 delaying TRO, the sale was still conducted within the legal hours on the proper day. Any \u201cchilling\u201d effect was caused by' plaintiffs\u2019 own action, not those of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">This case, as <em>Oglethorpe Co. v. United States, supra, </em>\u201cappears to be a classic example for the application of res judicata,\u201d and therefore barred by the decision in <em>Oglethorpe Co. v. </em>Weaver, <em>supra. </em>The same parties and issues are present before this court as were before the district court in <em>Oglethorpe Co. v. </em>Weaver. It is not the function of this court to relitigate issues already fully aired before another court of competent jurisdiction. <em>Commissioner </em>v. <em>Sunnen, </em>333 U.S. 591, 597, 68 S.Ct. 715, 92 L.Ed. 898 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">As to issues concerning procedural defects in the sale not decided in <em>Oglethorpe Co. </em>v. Weaver, res judicata also bars their litigation in this lawsuit. Plaintiffs have had their day in court; they had their opportunity to raise all pertinent matters. In the instant case, we can find no factual issues that should not have been brought before the district court in <em>Oglethorpe Co. v. Weaver. Commissioner v. Sunnen, supra; McConnell v. Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>346 F.2d 219, 222 (5th Cir. 1965); <em>Oglethorpe Co. v. United States, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">We hold plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cmaterial defects\u201d claim totally barred by res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">Next we focus on the central issue of the case: whether federal or state law governs plaintiffs\u2019 rights following the foreclosure sale. Plaintiffs claim that Georgia law controls by the terms of the mortgage contracts and gives plaintiffs the right to recover the difference between the sale price and the fair market value from the Government as the <em>seller </em>of the properties. In this case, the difference could be as much as $3.0 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-12\">To evidence Georgia law, plaintiffs rely on cases such as <em>Buckhead Doctors Bldg., Inc. v. Oxford Finance Co., Inc., </em>115 Ga. App. 534, 154 S.E.2d 760 (1967) and <em>Langley v. Stone, </em>112 Ga.App. 237, 144 S.E.2d 627 (1965). We need not decide whether plaintiffs\u2019 statement of Georgia law is correct. By the statutes and case law of that State, plaintiffs, in another setting, may have the right to recover the difference between the sale price and the fair or \u201ctrue\u201d market value from the vendor of the property. <em>See Aaron v. Life Ins. Co. of Ga., </em>138 Ga.App. 286, 226 S.E.2d 96 (1976) (For a discussion equating \u201cfair\u201d and \u201ctrue\u201d market value, see the special concurrence of Judge Clark, 226 S.E.2d at 97-98).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-13\">But the instant case does not present the usual situation of an aggrieved Georgia mortgagor suing a private mortgagee for damages. It is a suit against the Federal Government. The issue, therefore, is whether the Federal Government is subject to Georgia law under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-14\">In the case at bar it is clear that the federal interest involved overrides Georgia law. From the terms of the mortgage contracts, we cannot say that HUD agreed to be bound by Georgia law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This is particularly so when Congress has specifically limited the amount the Secretary of HUD can spend for the acquisition of property at foreclosure sale by section 207 of the National Housing Act, codified at 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1713(k) (1970):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aky-dedup-0\">* * * The Secretary at any sale under foreclosure may, in his discretion, for the protection of the General Insurance Fund, <em>bid any sum up to but not in excess of the total unpaid indebtedness secured by the mortgage, * * * </em>and may become the purchaser * * * at such sale. * * *. (emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-16\">Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that \u00a7 1713(k) only limits the Government as <em>buyer </em>and, therefore, does not apply to the Government as <em>seller </em>is without merit. The obvious intent of \u00a7 1713(k) is to place a <em>ceiling </em>on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>amount the Government can pay for property obtained at foreclosure sale (i. e., \u201cnot in excess of the total unpaid indebtedness\u201d). To follow plaintiffs\u2019 reasoning, which we decline to do, would create an artificial distinction and improperly circumvent clear congressional directive.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">In addition, it is well established that the National Housing Act is a program that must be \u201cuniform in character throughout the Nation\u201d and, therefore, not subject to the vagaries of state law\u2014e. <em>g., United States v. Merrick Sponsor Corp,, </em>421 F.2d 1076, 1078-79 (2d Cir. 1970) (quoting from <em>United States v. Yazell, </em>382 U.S. 341, 354, 86 S.Ct. 500, 15 L.Ed.2d 404 (1966)); <em>Clark Investment Co. v. United States, </em>364 F.2d 7 (9th Cir. 1966); <em>United States v. Sylacauga Properties, Inc., </em>323 F.2d 487 (5th Cir. 1963); <em>United States v. Helz, </em>314 F.2d 301 (6th Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Plaintiffs, however, seek to distinguish these cases and rely on <em>United States v. Yazell, </em>382 U.S. 341, 86 S.Ct. 500, 15 L.Ed.2d 404 (1966), to support their contention that state law applies. We agree that each of the cases cited <em>supra </em>may be distinguished on the facts as each arose in a different context. But each evidences the overriding federal interest set forth in the National Housing Act. <em>See United States v. Stadium Apartments, Inc., </em>425 F.2d 358, 364 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 926, 91 S.Ct. 187, 27 L.Ed.2d 185 (1970); <em>United States v. Allgeyer, </em>466 F.2d 1195 (9th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\"><em>United States v. Yazell, supra, </em>is not to the contrary. Indeed, it supports defendant\u2019s position (and our conclusion). In Ya-<em>zell, </em>the Supreme Court held that the federal interest of the Small Business Administration in collecting a deficiency judgment on a disaster loan was insufficient to warrant overriding the Texas law of coverture. However, Mr. Justice Fortas, writing for the majority, carefully explained the scope of the Court\u2019s decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-8\">* * * We decide only that this Court, <em>in the absence of specific congressional action, </em>should not decree in this situation that implementation of federal interests requires overriding the particular state rule involved here. Both theory and the precedents of this Court teach us solicitude for state interests, particularly in the field of family and family-property arrangements. They should be overridden by the federal courts <em>only where clear and substantial interests of the National Government, which cannot be served consistently with respect for such state interests, will suffer major damage if the state law is applied, </em>(emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-13\"><em>United States v. Yazell, supra, </em>382 U.S. at 352, 86 S.Ct. at 507.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-14\">In this case, we have both \u201cspecific congressional action\u201d and a \u201cclear and substantial interests of the National Government\u201d and, therefore, hold that federal law governs plaintiffs\u2019 rights following the foreclosure sale. Under federal law, plaintiffs have no claim for damages under the plain meaning of \u00a7 1713(k), <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b667-15\">There remains only plaintiffs\u2019 claim that HUD, by selling the properties pursuant to valid mortgage contracts and by buying them in accordance with statutory directive, somehow engaged in a taking without just compensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Plaintiffs present two theories for recovery on this point. The first is based on the premise that Georgia law governs the parties\u2019 rights under the mortgage contracts. Plaintiffs take the position that since Georgia law requires the seller to pay the mortgagors (plaintiffs) the difference between the purchase price and fair market value, defendant\u2019s failure to tender this amount to plaintiffs is a taking. Because we have already decided that federal law controls, <em>supra, </em>plaintiffs\u2019 premise fails and we need not consider this argument further.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-16\">Plaintiffs\u2019 second theory is grounded on the proposition that, regardless of Georgia law, defendant has taken a constitutionally protected interest of plaintiffs in the properties. We fail to see what interest plaintiffs had that was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>As plaintiffs have admitted, under Georgia law title to the properties was in the Government as mortgagee from the date of assignment by Prudential. Absent title, plaintiffs point to their equities of redemption as giving them a constitutionally protected interest. Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the right of redemption is a constitutionally protected interest, \u2022 it is not an interest available to plaintiffs in this case. First, plaintiffs waived their rights of redemption in the mortgage contracts. Second, even if that waiver is not valid under state law, <em>United States v. Stadium Apartments, Inc., supra, </em>held the waiver valid in FHA mortgage situations. And, finally as admitted at oral argument, plaintiffs never sought to exercise a right of redemption. Having never sought to exercise this right prior to foreclosure sale, plaintiffs gave it up. <em>See Cummings v. Johnson, </em>218 Ga. 559, 129 S.E.2d 762 (1963). No Fifth Amendment taking is involved in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">In summary, we hold that each of the arguments expounded by plaintiffs fails. First, plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the sale of the property was \u201cmaterially defective\u201d is barred by res judicata. Second, their claim to the difference between the sale price and fair market value of the properties based on the application of Georgia law fails because Federal, not state law controls this case. Finally, plaintiffs\u2019 theories that defendant engaged in a Fifth Amendment taking fail because of preeminent Federal law and because plaintiffs have failed to show a constitutionally protected interest in the properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Accordingly, upon consideration of the briefs and submissions of the parties, and after hearing oral argument, defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is granted, plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment is denied, and the petition is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b663-11\">.
