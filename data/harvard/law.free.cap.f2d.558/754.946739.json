Britt takes this appeal from the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment for the defendant, Ken-nesaw Life Insurance Company. The defendant issued an insurance policy on the life of plaintiff\u2019s husband in 1962. The policy, naming plaintiff as beneficiary, provided for both ordinary death benefits and, by a rider, accidental death benefits. Another rider provided that in the event of the insured\u2019s total and permanent disability, each premium under the policy would be waived. In 1970 the insured filed an application and claim for total disability. The insurance company granted the claim and waived subsequent premiums. In 1971 the insured died accidentally.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-23\">Plaintiff, having collected from the insurer ordinary death benefits, now seeks to recover for her husband\u2019s accidental death. The sole issue is whether the accidental death rider was terminated when the defendant granted the insured\u2019s claim for permanent and total disability. The accidental death rider provided in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-24\">The insurance under this Rider shall automatically terminate: (a) if any premium on said Policy or on this Rider is not paid when due ... or (b) if any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>claim be allowed under the provisions of said Policy or of any Rider attached thereto and made a part thereof relating to total and permanent disability of the insured .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">The only possible point of contention between the parties is whether the insurance company\u2019s waiving the insured\u2019s premiums as a result of his 1970 claim for total and permanent disability constituted the allowance of a \u201cclaim . . . relating to total and permanent disability.\u201d If it did constitute allowing such a claim, the accidental death rider terminated prior to the insured\u2019s death in 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">Under the policy in question the only possible benefit arising from a claim for total disability was the waiver of premiums. The defendant granted this benefit. Under the circumstances we think plaintiff\u2019s argument that defendant\u2019s granting this benefit was not the allowance of a claim because it paid no benefits is clearly mistaken. Consequently we agree with the district court that the insured terminated the accidental rider policy in 1970. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b826-16\">. The concession that the insured\u2019s death was \u201caccidental\u201d came only after much judicial water had gone over the dam. <em>See Britt v. Travelers Insurance Co., </em>556 F.2d 336 (5th Cir. 1977); <em>Britt v. All American Assurance Co. of Louisiana, </em>333 So.2d 629 (Miss.1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
