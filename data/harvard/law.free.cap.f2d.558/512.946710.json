J. Ciccone, director of the United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners, Springfield, Missouri. Cognato, presently confined at the Medical Center claims that he is being deprived of proper medical treatment by being denied the medication \u201cTalwin\u201d to relieve his pain. The district court considered the petition as one alleging that prison authorities were subjecting Cognato to cruel and unusual treatment by failing to provide adequate medical treatment. The district court denied Cognato\u2019s petition and he brings this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-18\">Doctors at the United States Medical Center initially had prescribed intramuscular injections of the drug Talwin for treatment of Cognato\u2019s chronic pain.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On September 7, 1976, the medical staff at the hospital decided to discontinue the routine use of Talwin at the Medical Center, and substitute other pain killing drugs. A panel of Medical Center physicians then reviewed Cognato\u2019s case, and determined that Talwin should no longer be administered to him. Thereafter, Cognato brought this ha-beas corpus action challenging the decision of the medical staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-19\">A hearing was held in district court to determine \u201cwhether the [discontinuance of the administration of a pain relieving medicine known as Talwin to the petitioner constituted. inadequate medical treatment or cruel and unusual punishment.\u201d At his request, Cognato represented himself at the hearing, but an appointed counsel was present at all times and available to assist the petitioner. Cognato testified that he has been a paraplegic since 1969, and that for more than seven years he had been treated with the drug Talwin in private <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>hospitals and in state prison hospitals. Cognato testified that he suffers from chronic pain, and that Talwin provides greater relief from pain than other drugs. Cognato contended at the hearing that he had not been addicted to Talwin, but conceded that \u201cTalwin has been abused [by prisoners] throughout the institution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Dr. Webb, chief of medicine at the Medical Center, testified that the medical staff had unanimously voted to discontinue the use of Talwin at the Medical Center, because prolonged use of Talwin causes muscle fibrosis and atrophy, possible infection, and abscess formation. He said that petitioner Cognato had sustained some muscular damage as a result of using Talwin. Dr. Lieberwitz, Cognato\u2019s attending physician, stated that he agreed with the medical staff\u2019s decision, and that Cognato\u2019s pain medication needs could be satisfied with other drugs. Dr. Miller, orthopedic surgeon at the Medical Center, testified that drugs other than Talwin were best suited for treating Cognato\u2019s condition, and that Tal-win was possibly addictive.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">The district court denied Cognato\u2019s habe-as petition on the grounds that petitioner had produced no evidence that the decision of the medical staff to discontinue the use of Talwin was incorrect, except for his subjective statements about the superior pain relieving qualities of Talwin.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">We have carefully reviewed the record in this case. The evidence indicates that a panel of physicians, including Cognato\u2019s attending physician, unanimously arrived at a decision to change Cognato\u2019s medication in the interest of Cognato\u2019s own health. Cog-nato\u2019s disagreement with this medical opinion does not raise a claim entitling him to habeas corpus relief. <em>See Wilbron v. Hutto, </em>509 F.2d 621, 622 (8th Cir. 1975); <em>Cates v. Ciccone, 422 </em>F.2d 926 (8th Cir. 1970). Accordingly, the district court properly denied Cognato\u2019s petition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AUY\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b584-20\">. Cognato was admitted to the Medical Center on March 18, 1976.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b585-8\">. We do not suggest that the patient\u2019s subjective response to the pain relieving qualities of a medication is unimportant. Indeed, that response should be of particular importance and significance, particularly in a case such as this where the prisoner has no use of his legs. The evaluation of that response is a significant factor to be taken into account in the physician\u2019s medical decision. The petitioner\u2019s subjective response to the drug by itself, however, does not furnish a sufficient factual basis for the court to overrule the medical decision made in petitioner\u2019s case, which is otherwise supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
