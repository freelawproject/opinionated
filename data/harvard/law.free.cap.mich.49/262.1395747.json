J.</author>\n<p id=\"AeR\">The substantial question supposed to be raised by this record is this : Where one is carrying on a suit against another before a justice of the peace for the collection of a debt claimed by the plaintiff, is it competent for a third person claiming to be creditor of such plaintiff to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>garnish the defendant before another justice? The court below held that it is not and we agree with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">We are satisfied that no jurisdiction exists for such a proceeding. We held in <em>Sievers v. Woodburn Sarven Wheel Co. </em>43 Mich. 275 that a judgment before a justice could not be garnished in proceedings before another justice, and the reason applies with increased force when the subject-matter sought to be reached and controlled by the process from one justice is not an adjudged indebtedness, but is a thing in actual litigation among other parties before another justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The consequence of such proceedings would be that a stranger to the pending contention before one justice might, through the process of another justice, completely change the <em>status </em>of the litigants and also the ownership of the thing in controversy. The defendant, instead of continuing to be the plaintiff\u2019s debtor, would be converted into a debtor of the person so intruding, and the debt would cease to be a debt to the plaintiff, and become a debt to the garnishee.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">It would be futile to attempt to point out all the difficulties and incongruities. The right secured by the law of set-off and the doctrine of recoupment would frequently give rise to entanglements, and the embarrassments to justice would be insurmountable. No methods exist for carrying out such a jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">The result is right and the judgment is affirmed with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b282-8\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
