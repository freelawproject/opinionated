The court made the following finding:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-5\">That the said plaintiff is, and for five years last past has been, the owner in fee of the land described in said plaintiff\u2019s declaration, to wit: the north-west quarter of the southwest quarter of section thirty, in township nine north, of range fifteen west, in said county of Muskegon. That, in the spring of the year 1879, the said defendant entered upon said land, and cut down and carried off of the timber then \u2022standing, and growing upon said land, three oak trees making 3904 feet, board measure, eight pine trees making 12,000 feet, board measure, and eighteen white-ash trees making 15,000 feet, board measure. That the value thereof, standing upon said premises, was : for the oak, twenty-five .and 37-100 dollars ($25.37); for the pine, forty-two dollars ($42), and for the white-ash, one hundred and thirty-five dollars ($135); the actual value of all said timber, cut and removed by said defendant, was two hundred and two and \u202237-100 dollars ($202.37).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-6\">That the action of said defendant, in entering upon said land and cutting down and carrying off said trees and timber, was wilful, and without the leave of said plaintiff, the \u25a0owner thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-7\">I therefore find, that the said defendant is guilty of the several trespasses in the second count of said plaintiff\u2019s declaration mentioned, in manner and form as the said plaintiff hath, in the said second count of her declaration, complained against him, and assess the single damage of the said plaintiff by reason thereof, over and above her costs and charges by her about her suit in this behalf expended, at the sum of two hundred and two dollars and thirty-seven cents ($202.37).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-8\">And, in answer to the special requests of said defendant, I find:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-10\"><em>First. </em>That twelve thousand feet, board measure, of pine logs or timber was taken, during the spring of 1879, from' the premises described in said plaintiff\u2019s declaration, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>that the value thereof, standing at that time, was $3.50 per thousand feet.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-4\"><em>Second. </em>That 3904 feet, board measure, of oak logs and timber were taken, during the Spring of 1879, from the premises described in said plaintiff\u2019s declaration, and that the value thereof, standing at that time, was $6.50 per thousand feet.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-5\"><em>Third,. </em>That fifteen thousand feet, board measure, of ash logs were taken from the premises in question, during the Spring of 1879, and that the value thereof, standing at that time, was $9.00 per thousand feet.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-6\"><em>Fourth. </em>There was no evidence tending to show that any oak, pine, or ash trees were cut or removed from the premises in question, between the first day of January, 1879, and the commencement of tins suit, other than in the Spring of 1879.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A88\"><em>Fifth. </em>That the defendant did not, during the Spring of the year 1879, purchase the logs and timber, so taken from the land described in plaintiff\u2019s declaration, from John McEwing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-8\"><em>Sixth. </em>I find no purchase by-defendant from McEwing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-9\"><em>Seventh. </em>I find no such contract or purchase.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-10\"><em>Eighth. </em>I find no delivering to the defendant at Eruitport, but that the defendant had knowledge that the logs and timber were taken from the plaintiff\u2019s land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-11\"><em>Ninth. </em>The defendant, \u2019 at the time the square timber (oak and pine) was being got out, had knowledge that the same was being cut from the land of the plaintiff. \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-12\"><em>Tenth. </em>The said defendant directed Luther Cooper, who had drawn the square timber from the lands in question, to go upon the same land and cut and remove therefrom the white-ash, and contracted to pay him $3.00 per thousand therefor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-13\">The three workmen employed by the defendant were directed to go to McEwing, who was also in said defendant\u2019s employ, to be informed upon what land to work.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-14\"><em>Eleventh. </em>The persons who actually cut and removed the logs and timber from the plaintiff\u2019s land, were in the employ and under the direction of the defendant, except as they were directed by McEwing, as agent for the defendant where to work.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"A-V\">Fred J. Russell, Circuit Judge.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b414-16\"><em>F. W. OooTe, </em>for appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWy\">argued that when plaintiff goes to trial on a declaration containing two counts, one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>for single and the other for treble damages, and submits \u2022his case without electing which count he will rely on, the judgment or verdict can apply only to the count which claims single damages; and as a finding of facts stands in the place of a verdict the amount found cannot be trebled by the court.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b415-4\"><em>Smith, Nims, Hoyt c&amp; Erwi/n </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b415-5\">Marston, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AUQ\">We discover no error in the record in this case. If the case had been submitted to a jury and a general verdict rendered, then the position taken would have force. The court however found the facts and that the plaintiff was entitled to recover under the second count of the declaration. This was proper and justified the court in rendering judgment for treble damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The judgment must be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b415-7\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
