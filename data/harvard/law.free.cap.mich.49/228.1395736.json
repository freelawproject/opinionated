Mulvey </em>1 Sandford 95'; failure to prove his authority to1 act cannot be taken advantage of on special appeal, but a writ of certiorari must be resorted to: <em>Deitz v. Groesbeck, </em>32 Mich. 303; <em>McGraw v. Sturgeon </em>29 Mich. 426; only jurisdictional defects are open on special appeal, and the- proof of authority of attorney is not jurisdictional; it cannot be set up as a ground <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>for attacking the judgment collaterally: <em>Reed v.

It now appeal\u2019s that after that reversal she treated it as final and sued her claim over again and got a new judgment which is also removed by appeal now pending in the Wayne circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The judgment before us was reversed because the attorney who appeared for plaintiff in her absence did not prove his authority \u2014 the defendant as well as the plaintiff not appearing. This objection if properly taken was a good ground of reversal; and in our opinion it was. properly taken by special appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">The judgment of the circuit court must be affirmed with \u25a0costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b247-8\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
