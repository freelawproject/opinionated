J.</author>\n<p id=\"AFe\">This action was brought upon a bond made by the first defendant as principal and the second defendant as surety to the plaintiff, Supe, under the third subdivision of section 10 of chapter 141 of the Revised Statutes of 1846 for the punishment of fraudulent debtors. 2 Comp. L. ch. 230.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The plaintiff gave in evidence the bond and all the proceedings had before the commissioner under said chapter, and the circuit judge directed a verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The defendants claim that the showing on which the arrest was made and which was the foundation of the subsequent proceedings, including the bond in question, was not valid. The position is that the affidavits were destitute of facts and circumstances and that there was nothing on which the judgment of the commissioner could act in order to find that any ground for arrest existed under the statute. Hence, it is said the entire proceeding was void. <em>Swart v. Kimball </em>43 Mich. 443; <em>Badger v. Reade </em>39 Mich. 771 <em>De Long v. Briggs </em>47 Mich. 624; <em>Mosher v. People </em>5 Barb.</p>\n<p id=\"AYhs\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>575; <em>Cadwell v. Colgate </em>7 Barb. 253; <em>Vredenburgh v. Herdricks </em>17 Barb. 179; <em>Broadhead v. McConnell </em>3 Barb. 175. We might perhaps agree to this conclusion if we entertained the same view of the affidavits on which the commis.sioner issued his warrant. But we do not. They appear below<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> and they seem to us to have exhibited for the eon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>sideration of the commissioner a state of facts which had a legal tendency to make oat a case in all its parts under the. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number><em>third </em>subdivision of section four<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> <em>Johnson v. Maxon </em>23 Mich. 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Whether they were as cogent as they ought to have been is not a subject for present investigation. As the materials were sufficient to invest the commissioner with the power to decide in favor of issuing the warrant the proceedings were not void even though he may have erred in holding that the evidence was adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The further point is suggested but not pressed that the debtor\u2019s discharge having been successfully opposed by the plaintiff and other creditors the principle applies which saves an obligation in case the condition becomes impossible by the act of God.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">It is unnecessary to go into the objections to this view because the question is not raised by the assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">No error being shown the judgment should be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b288-9\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b285-7\">Comp.
