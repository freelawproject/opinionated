Hall </em>45 Mitch. 58; <em>Chase v. Welsh </em>45 Mich. 346; <em>Waldron v. Murphy </em>40 Mich. 668, 672; <em>Parks v. Allen </em>42 Mich. 482; <em>Tuthill v. Morris </em>81 N. Y. 94, 98 he should be made \u201cfairly and clearly-to understand the transaction as a then present, absolute and unconditional tender of the amount due upon the mortgage, not dependent upon first executing a receipt or discharge: \u201d <em>Potts v. Plaisted </em>30 Mich. 151; <em>Roosevelt v. Bulls Head Bank </em>45 Barb. 579; <em>Wood v. Hitchcock, </em>20 Wend. 48; <em>Storey v.

According to defendant\u2019s testimony complainant said more than that sum was due her, and that she would lose the whole rather than take what was offered. Complainant testifies on the other hand that while she was pulling weeds in her front yard defendant Burhans held out what he said was $300 to her and wanted a discharge; that she told him she thought considerably more was due to her, but wanted only what was just; that Burhans soon went away, and that she, after looking into the matter, went to him and told him she would rather lose the, most of her claim than have a fuss, and tried to get an understanding with him, or an offer of what he would do, but he evaded any definite reply. This last statement was corroborated by Burhans.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">We do not think a sufficient tender was shown. A woman engaged in her ordinary occupations is not bound at her peril to know at all fimes what is owing to her, and to be ready to determine forthwith, without opportunity for examination and computation, whether she will accept any particular sum that is tendered to her. She must have reasonable opportunity to satisfy herself what are her rights. <em>Waldron v. Murphy </em>40 Mich. 668. Besides, it now turns out the sum offered was insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">The decree must be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b46-9\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
