The plea was the general issue, and there was a -trial the result of which appears before us in a printed \u25a0record of one hundred and seventy pages.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The plaintiff does not aver that the levy on her property \u25a0was malicious, or that it was made with any purpose to \u25a0wrong her, but she relies for recovery upon the bare facts that the levy was made upon her lands, and that a purchaser to whom she had bargained it refused in consequence to complete the bargain. As the levy could create no lien on her land, or in any manner charge, endanger or affect her -title, it may well be questioned whether the alleged damage is the natural and proximate result of the act complained of. At most the act of the defendants amounted to no more than a formal assertion that the ownership of plaintiff\u2019s land was in John Walldey, and that they proposed to maintain that assertion in legal proceedings. But this assertion would not have justified a purchaser in throwing up his bargain. If he had previously entered into a valid contract the levy could not have excused his failure to perform it, and if he had only agreed by parol to take the land, the breaking off \u2022of the negotiations for a reason that would not have excused the performance of a valid contract can only be attributed to excess of caution, and certainly cannot be referred to an \u25a0act which in law was wholly inadequate to have caused it. \u00c1 purchaser who is not yet bound may make such an attack upon the title an excuse for breaking off negotiations, and \u25a0so a master may make the slander of his servant an excuse for discharging him from employment; but if he should do so the discharge could not be deemed a natural consequence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>of the slander. <em>Vicars v. Wilcocks </em>8 East 1; <em>Ward v. Weeks </em>7 Bing. 211; <em>Tutein v. Hurley </em>98 Mass. 211. The cases are analogous.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">. Nor is this action grounded on the principle that supports-an action for slander of title; for that is grounded on malice. <em>Malachy v. Soper </em>3 Bing. N. C. 371; <em>Walden v. Peters </em>2 Rob. (La.) 331. Here, as has been said, no malice is averred,, and it is presumable that the defendants in good faith supposed they might contest and disprove the plaintiff\u2019s title. The case therefore is without precedent, so far as we know,, and no authority is cited for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">When a sheriff levies hisjexecution on the personal property of one who is a stranger to the judgment, there is a\u00a1 positive wrong, because there is a positive interference with the owner\u2019s possession. There might also be a trespass in, the levy of execution on lands if the officer were to go upon the lands for the purpose; but it is not pretended that he did so in this case. Here the plaintiff finds her injury in the bare fact of levy; in other words, in the bare fact that, these two defendants without malice have asserted that another party owns the land. But in law this is not am actionable wrong. <em>Howeth v. Mills </em>19 Tex. 295.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">This fatal defect in the plaintiff\u2019s case was not pointed out by the defense until the case went to trial. The record, which now comes up contains fifty-nine assignments of error, and embraces all the evidence. Many of the assignments-were not argued, and for presenting the others so voluminous a record was not required. Embodying all the evidence-in the bill of exceptions without necessity, and cumbering-the record with assignments of error not relied \u00fapon, is art evil to which we have often called attention before. It' misleads the opposite party, and it imposes unnecessary labor on the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">In this case the judgment will be reversed with costs of both courts, but in taxing the costs the cost of the record will not be included.</p>\n<judges id=\"b394-8\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
