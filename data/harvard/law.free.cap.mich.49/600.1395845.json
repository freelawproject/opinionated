What took place between the parties shortly after the marriage is so remote in point of time, in view of their peaceable and on the whole harmonious life1 for so many years afterwards, that we can give it but little prominence. Some of the expressions relied upon are to say the least ambiguous^ dependent upon the smTounding circumstances to give them tone and character, and thus show whether in jest or otherwise, while others were made after the bill was filed and are not entitled to consideration. The charg\u00e9 of cruelty most strongly relied upon, we cannot safely say has not been magnified and made to appear in a worse light than a true narration would justify.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">We must therefore in view of all the facts reverse the decree and dismiss the bill. The. complainant will be allowed the sum of $500 for support during the pendency of this case and for expenses therein.</p>\n<judges id=\"b619-6\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
