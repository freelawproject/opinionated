The evidence that any such offence was committed was the respondent\u2019s admission. The medical and other evidence in the case tended very strongly to show that the admission was unfounded. The defendant on the trial' explained his story by saying that he invented it to get up a sensation by way of advertisement for a firm of sensational doctors. The explanation was extraordinary, but on the evidence it is more credible than the confession on which respondent was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">An unsupported confession should not be received as sufficient evidence of the- <em>corpus delicti.
