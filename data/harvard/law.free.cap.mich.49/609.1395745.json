Sold\u00e1n </em>5 Mich. 242; after a transcript of the justice\u2019s judgment has been filed in the circuit court the justice has no further control of the proceedings : 1 Green\u2019s Pr. 659-60 ; and the circuit judge can .mo longer grant an appeal: <em>Davison v.

Elliott </em>9 Mich. 252. Here the appeal had been taken in time, but the entry fee was not jmid and because thereof the appeal was dismissed. The-default in not paying wqs excused to the satisfaction of the-circuit judge, and the cause reinstated. This was we think within the discretion of the court and properly exercised. The fact that a transcript had been taken and filed in the circuit court and execution issued thereon, would not prevent, the remedy afforded. The case had been in the circuit, and, as-now appears, improperly dismissed, and in re-instating it, there was no act required to be performed by the justice, and in this, it differs from the case relied upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Writ denied with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b628-5\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
