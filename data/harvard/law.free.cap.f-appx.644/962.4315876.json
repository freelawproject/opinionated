Murphree is long-term employee with the Agency who, at the time of the events giving rise to this case, was a District Manager based in a field office in Gadsden, Alabama. In his complaint, Murphree alleged that he was not promoted to a Deputy Area Director (\u201cDAD\u201d) position in Alabama on the basis of his race and that he was retaliated against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>when he complained of such discrimination. He also alleged that he was discriminated and retaliated against when he was not considered for an opening for a DAD position in Tennessee. The district court found that Murphree failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with regard to the Alabama DAD position and that the Agency was entitled to summary judgment on the merits of the rest of his claims. After careful review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment, viewing the evidence and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. <em>Brooks v. Cnty. Comm\u2019n of Jefferson Cnty., Ala., </em>446 F.3d 1160, 1161-62 (11th Cir.2006). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). A genuine factual dispute exists if a jury could return a verdict for the non-moving party. <em>Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 1079, 1085 (11th Cir.2004). We may affirm the district court\u2019s summary-judgment decision on any basis supported by the record, even if that basis was not relied upon by the district court. <em>Feliciano v. City of Miami Beach, </em>707 F.3d 1244, 1252 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-8\">Murphree first argues that the district court erred in finding that he did not timely exhaust his administrative remedies for his race-discrimination claim based on his non-selection for the Alabama DAD position. The district court determined that Murphree had failed to initiate contact with an Equal Employment Opportunity (\u201cEEO\u201d) Counselor within 45 days as required by federal regulations, and that Murphree was not entitled to equitable tolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-10\">A federal employee must pursue and exhaust his administrative remedies before bringing suit in federal court under Title VII. <em>See Shiver v. Chertoff, </em>549 F.3d 1342, 1344 (11th Cir.2008); 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.105(a)(1). To exhaust his remedies, a federal employee \u201cmust initiate contact with [an EEO] Counselor within 45 days of the date of the matter alleged to be discriminatory or, in the case of personnel action, within 45 days of the effective date of the action.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.105(a)(1). \u201cGenerally, when the claimant does not initiate contact within the 45-day charging period, the claim is barred for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.\u201d <em>Shiver, </em>549 F.3d at 1344. The administrative deadlines are not jurisdictional prerequisites, however, and they are subject to equitable tolling. <em>Ross v. Buckeye Cellulose Corp., </em>980 F.2d 648, 660 (11th Cir.1993); 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.604(c). <em>But see Crawford v. Babbitt, </em>186 F.3d 1322, 1326 (11th Cir.1999) (\u201cA federal employee must pursue and exhaust her administrative remedies as a jurisdictional prerequisite to filing a Title VII action\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-12\">Here, Murphree admits that he did not seek formal EEO counseling until March 28, 2008, which was well over 45 days after the alleged discriminatory action on December 7, 2007. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.105(a)(1). Instead, Murphree claims that he satisfied the 45-day requirement because, within a week of his non-selection, he complained to Rose Mary Buehler and Claudia Harris that he felt he was not selected for the Alabama DAD position because of his race. Buehler was the Area Director and Murphree\u2019s primary supervisor. Harris was an acting DAD who at times assisted Buehler with supervision. Murphree contends that both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>Buehler and Harris were agency officials logically connected with the EEO process under the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Kraus v. Presidio Trust Facilities Division, </em>572 F.3d 1039, 1044-45 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">The EEO Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) has held that \u201cin order to establish EEO counselor contact, an individual must contact an agency official logically connected to the EEO process and exhibit an intent to begin the EEO process.\u201d <em>Duke v. Slater, </em>EEOC Dec. 01A02129, 2000 WL 732027, at *1 (E.E.O.C. May 22, 2000). In <em>Kraus, </em>the Ninth Circuit held that an \u201cEEO Officer\u201d of a federal employer was an agency official logically connected with the EEO process even though she did not have the title \u201cCounselor.\u201d 572 F.3d at 1044-45. According to <em>Kraus, </em>the EEOC understands agency officials \u201clogically connected with the EEO process\u201d to encompass EEO personnel with titles other than \u201ccounsel- or,\u201d such as EEO officers, as well as certain officials who are not EEO personnel, such as directors within the agency\u2019s office of civil rights. <em>Id. </em>at 1045; <em>accord Culpepper v. Schafer, </em>548 F.3d 1119, 1122-23 (8th Cir.2008) (U.S. Department of Agriculture employee\u2019s letter to the director of that agency\u2019s Office of Civil Rights satisfied administrative exhaustion).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">However, \u201cneither internal appealsf ] nor informal efforts to challenge an agency\u2019s adverse action\u201d amount to initiating contact with an EEO Counselor. <em>See Penn v. Geren, </em>EEOC Dec. 0120082927, 2008 WL 5479277, at *2 (E.E.O.C. Dec. 10, 2008) (stating that these actions do not toll the time to contact an EEO Counselor); <em>see also Johnson v. Henderson, </em>314 F.3d 409, 415 (9th Cir.2002) (\u201c[Tjhere is no basis in law to suggest that an employee\u2019s complaints to her supervisors satisfy the requirement that the aggrieved employee seek EEO counseling prior to filing a formal complaint or suing in court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-7\">Here, the district court did not err in concluding that Murphree failed to exhaust his administrative .remedies. Murphree\u2019s reliance on <em>Kraus </em>is unavailing, even if it were binding, which, of course, it is not. Buehler and Harris were managers within the Agency, not EEO personnel or officials in an office of civil rights or equivalent position. Even under <em>Kraus, </em>informal complaints to supervisors about discrimination do not amount to initiating contact with an EEO counselor. <em>See Kraus, </em>572 F.3d at 1046 n. 8 (citing <em>Johnson, </em>314 F.3d at 412-15). While Buehler and Harris may have had a general duty to respond to and address employee complaints about discrimination, in addition to their numerous other work responsibilities, that does not mean they were officials \u201clogically connected to the EEO process\u201d in the Agency. <em>Cf. Klugel v. Small, </em>EEOC Dec. 0120064105, 2006 WL 3473823, at *2 (E.E.O.C. Nov. 21, 2006) (\u201cAn administrative officer is not \u2018logically connected to the EEO process\u2019 as they would administer many office/agency-wide directives and policies.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-8\">The district court also found that Murphree did not exhibit an intent to begin the EEO process during his communications with Buehler and Harris. The only arguable reference Murphree makes to this finding is his assertion, buried within his argument regarding Buehler\u2019s and Harris\u2019s connection to the EEO process, that he \u201csaid enough to Buehler and Harris about race discrimination [regarding his non-selection] that they knew this required an EEO investigation.\u201d Such a passing reference is insufficient to raise the issue for appellate review. <em>Sapuppo v. Allstate Floridian Ins. Co., </em>739 F.3d 678, 682 (11th Cir.2014). In any case, whether Buehler and Harris believed, or should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>have believed, that an EEO investigation was warranted does not demonstrate that Murphree exhibited an intent to pursue . the EEO process.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">Finally, the district court did not err in concluding that Murphree was not entitled to equitable tolling. Tolling of a limitations period on equitable grounds is \u201can extraordinary remedy which should be extended only sparingly.\u201d <em>Justice v. United States, </em>6 F.3d 1474, 1479 (11th Cir.1993). The plaintiff bears the burden of showing that equitable tolling is warranted. <em>Id. </em>In general, the plaintiff must show that, despite exercising due diligence, an inequitable event prevented him from complying with the time limit. <em>See id. </em>at 1479-80; <em>see also Irwin v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>498 U.S. 89, 96, 111 S.Ct. 453, 457-58, 112 L.Ed.2d 435 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">Here, Murphree has not shown a basis for equitable tolling. Murphree claims that he is entitled to equitable tolling because Buehler discouraged him from pursing an EEO complaint by telling him to \u201cjust let it go\u201d and saying that he could not win against the Regional Commissioner, Paul Barnes, who allegedly made the discriminatory hiring decision. However, Murphree was a District Manager with training in and knowledge of EEO matters. Nothing about Buehler\u2019s comments would have misled Murphree about when or how to start the EEO process or prevented him from going to an EEO counsel- or. <em>See Justice, </em>6 F.3d at 1479 (\u201cThe interests of justice side with the defendant when the plaintiff does not file her action in a timely fashion despite knowing or being in a position reasonably to know that the limitations period is running[.]\u201d). Accordingly, Murphree is not entitled to equitable tolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">In sum, we affirm the district court\u2019s conclusion that Murphree\u2019s race-discrimination claim based on his non-selection for the Alabama DAD is barred for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-10\">Murphree next argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on his claim that the Agency retaliated against him for complaining about discrimination with regard to the Alabama DAD position. He contends that he established that the Agency\u2019s legitimate; non-discriminatory reasons for suspending him for one day and downgrading his yearly performance award were pretext for retaliation. He also asserts that the district court improperly applied the \u201cbut-for\u201d test from <em>University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar, </em>570 U.S. -, -, 133 S.Ct. 2517, 2534, 186 L.Ed.2d 503 (2013), when evaluating the propriety of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-13\">Title VII broadly prohibits an employer from retaliating against an employee for complaining about unlawful discrimination. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). While \u00a7 2000e-16, which prohibits employment discrimination by the federal government, does not specifically mention retaliation, we have noted that \u00a7 2000e-16 was intended \u201cto make Title VII applicable in the federal workplace to the same extent it was already applicable in the non-federal workplace.\u201d <em>Llampallas v. Mini-Circuits, Lab, Inc., </em>163 F.3d 1236, 1243 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-14\">We generally analyze claims based on circumstantial evidence under the burden-shifting framework of <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). <em>See Bryant v. Jones, </em>575 F.3d 1281, 1307 (11th Cir.2009). Under this framework, the plaintiff must first establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation by showing the following: (1) he engaged in a statutorily protected activity; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>(2) he suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) he established a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse action. <em>Id. </em>at 1307-08. Once a plaintiff establishes <em>aprima facie </em>case, the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. <em>Id. </em>at 1308. The plaintiff then has an opportunity to demonstrate that the defendant\u2019s proffered reason was' pretext for retaliation. <em>Id. </em>Ultimately, Title VII retaliation claims require proof that \u201c[the] protected activity was a but-for cause of the alleged adverse action by the employer.\u201d <em>Nassar, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2534.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">In evaluating pretext, we ask \u201cwhether the plaintiff has cast sufficient doubt on the defendant\u2019s proffered nondiscriminatory reasons to permit a reasonable factfin-der to conclude that the employee\u2019s proffered legitimate reasons were not what actually motivated its conduct.\u201d <em>Combs v. Plantation Patterns, </em>106 F.3d 1519, 1538 (11th Cir.1997) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). As long as the proffered reason is one that might motivate a reasonable employer, \u201can employee must meet that reason head on and rebut it, and the employee cannot succeed by simply quarreling with the wisdom of that reason.\u201d <em>Chapman v. AI Transp., </em>229 F.3d 1012, 1030 (11th Cir.2000) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>Murphree established a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation at to his one-day suspension and downgraded performance award, he has not shown that the Agency\u2019s legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for these actions were pretext for retaliation. The Agency articulated the same reasons for both the suspension and the downgrading of the award: namely, that an investigation team, prompted by an employee complaint of sexual harassment, found that Murphree did not adequately address inappropriate jokes and comments or other conduct issues in his office. For example, the team found it \u201cevident the [District Manager] allowed certain inappropriate behavior/conduct to occur by not immediately addressing issues/problems that permeated throughout\u201d the Gadsden office. The team recommended training in various areas and also made a general recommendation to \u201cconsider any additional corrective actions deemed necessary for the management staff\u2019 at Murphree\u2019s office. Based on the findings of the investigative team\u2019s report, Buehler suspended Murphree for one day and reduced his yearly performance award.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-7\">Murphree contends that these reasons were unworthy of credence because the investigatory team did not specifically recommend that he be suspended based on its findings, so \u201cit is hard to see how anything besides the training recommended by the team should reasonably be required.\u201d He also claims that he was unfairly punished for following the advice of a previous Area Director about how to handle inappropriate workplace comments. These contentions, however, do not show that the team\u2019s report was false or that the findings in the report were not the true reason for the employment decisions. <em>See Combs, </em>106 F.3d at 1538. It is not our role to second-guess the wisdom or fairness of the employer\u2019s decisions. <em>See Chapman, </em>229 F.3d at 1030.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-8\">In sum, Murphree has not rebutted the Agency\u2019s stated reasons and shown they were pretextual. Because Murphree\u2019s claims fail under the burden-shifting framework established well before <em>Nassar, </em>we need not address whether <em>Nassar </em>changed our analysis of retaliation claims at summary judgment. Though our reasoning may differ from the district court on these claims, we may affirm for any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>adequate reason. <em>See Feliciano, </em>707 F.3d at 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">iy.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">Finally, Murphree argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on his claims that he was denied the opportunity to compete for the Tennessee DAD position because of racial discrimination and retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-7\">Again, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Murphree established a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination and retaliation with regard to the Tennessee DAD position, he has not demonstrated that the Agency\u2019s use of a non-competitive selection process to fill the position was pretext for discrimination or retaliation. Undisputed evidence establishes that the person hired for the Tennessee DAD position, an African-American female, was selected on a noncompetitive basis at the request of the Tennessee AD, Liz Clevinger. The person hired had been working as an acting DAD in Tennessee, and Clevinger wanted her to fill the permanent DAD position when it opened up because sh\u00e9 was familiar with Tennessee and the two had worked well together. Clevinger\u2019s selection was approved by the Regional Commissioner, Paul Barnes.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-8\">Even if Murphree is correct that the position should have been filled competitively, he has not shown pretext. <em>See Springer v. Convergys Customer Mgmt. Grp. Inc., </em>509 F.3d 1344, 1349-50 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201c[E]ven where preselection violates corporate personnel policies, it does not necessarily indicate racial discrimination.\u201d). It is undisputed that Clevinger did not know of Murphree or his complaints of discrimination, so she could not have intended to retaliate against him. Nor is there evidence that Clevinger was racially motivated in her selection. The fact that Barnes arguably could have guessed that Murphree may have been interested in the DAD position is wholly insufficient to show that the reason Barnes approved Clevinger\u2019s request to fill the position on a noncompetitive basis was a pretext for racial discrimination or retaliation against Mur-phree. Accordingly, the district court properly granted summary judgment on these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-10\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-11\">For the reasons stated, the district court properly determined that Murphree\u2019s race-discrimination claim with regard to his non-selection for the Alabama DAD position was barred for failure to exhaust administrative remedies, and that summary, judgment was appropriate on Murphree\u2019s remaining claims of discrimination and retaliation. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
