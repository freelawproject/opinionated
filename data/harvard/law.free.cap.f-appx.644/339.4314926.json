California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (6th Cir.2011). Ademo-Miranda has not filed a response. We have reviewed counsel\u2019s briefs and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivo-lous issue for appellate review. However, the district court committed nonreversible error when it categorized Ademo-Miranda\u2019s Texas offense of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, which resulted in a sentence of deferred adjudication, as an aggravated felony for purposes of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). The judgment of the district court is therefore REFORMED to show that Ademo-Miranda was convicted and sentenced under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1). <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 367-69 (5th Cir.2009). Counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b366-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
