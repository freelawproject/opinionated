Ibarra-Rodriguez\u2019s valid and unconditional guilty plea waived the non-jurisdictional constitutional challenges he raises regarding his conviction. <em>See United States v. Scruggs, </em>714 F.3d 258, 261-62 (5th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">We review the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo and the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error. <em>See United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). A factual finding is not clearly erroneous and should be upheld as long as it is plausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Ibarra-Rodriguez challenges the district court\u2019s factual finding that a 2011 load of marijuana delivered to Chicago constituted relevant conduct for purposes of calculating his offense level. <em>See United States v. Ekanem, </em>555 F.3d 172, 175 (5th Cir.2009). In light of the unrebutted evidence in the presentence report concerning the similarities in the offenses and Ibarra-Rodriguez\u2019s involvement in those offenses, the district court\u2019s finding that the Chicago load was part of the same course of conduct or part of a common scheme or plan as the instant offense was plausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>See United States v. Alaniz, </em>726 F.3d 586, 619 (5th Cir.2013); <em>United States v. Rhine, </em>583 F.3d 878, 885-88 (5th Cir.2009); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3. As such, the district court did not clearly err in using the marijuana involved in the Chicago offense to calculate Ibarra-Rodriguez\u2019s offense level. <em>See Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d at 764.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">The district court\u2019s finding that Ibarra-Rodriguez was a leader or organizer of the offense is also a factual finding reviewed for clear error. <em>See United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 204 (5th Cir.2005). The unrebutted evidence in the presentence report established that Ibarra-Rodriguez coordinated a marijuana transporting operation and exercised decision-making authority by recruiting, directing, and paying his coconspirators, in a conspiracy that involved more than five people. <em>See Alaniz, </em>726 F.3d at 619; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.4). Because the district court\u2019s finding that Ibar-ra-Rodriguez was a leader or organizer of the conspiracy was plausible in light of the record as a whole, the district court did not clearly err by applying a four-level adjustment based on Ibarra-Rodriguez\u2019s role in the offense. <em>See Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d at 764.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b326-23\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir.
