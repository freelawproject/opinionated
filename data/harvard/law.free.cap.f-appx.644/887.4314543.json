A single judge of this Court granted a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on the issue of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-23\">Whether the district court erred by dismissing Thomas\u2019s <em>pro se </em>petition for a writ of habeas corpus, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, as untimely?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b901-26\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s determination that a \u00a7 2254 petition was time-barred. <em>Kearse v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>736 F.3d 1359, 1362 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-27\">The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) imposes a one-year statute of limitations for filing a \u00a7 2254 habeas petition, which begins to run following the latest of four events, including, \u201cthe date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). Section 2244(d)(2) provides that \u201c[t]he time during which a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending shall not be counted toward any period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>of limitation under this subsection.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">We may take judicial notice of facts that are \u201cnot subject to reasonable dispute,\u201d because they are \u201cgenerally known within the trial court\u2019s territorial jurisdiction\u201d or \u201ccan be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 201(b). We may take judicial notice on our own at any stage of a proceeding. <em>Id. </em>201(c)-(d). Despite our wide discretion to take judicial notice of adjudicative facts, the taking of judicial notice of facts is \u201ca highly limited process.\u201d <em>Dippin\u2019 Dots, Inc. v. Frosty Bites Distrib., LLC, </em>369 F.3d 1197, 1205 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation omitted) (\u201cThe reason for this caution is that the taking of judicial notice bypasses the safeguards which are involved with the usual process of proving facts by competent evidence in district court.\u201d). We may take judicial notice of another court\u2019s order for the limited purpose of recognizing the \u201cjudicial act\u201d that the order represents. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>29 F.3d 1549, 1553 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">The parties agree that the limitations period was tolled from March 5, 2007, the date on which Thomas filed a motion under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.850, until December 14, 2012, the date on which the mandate was issued affirming the denial of Thomas\u2019s Rule 3.850 motion. Further, the parties agree that the limitations period was not tolled after December 14, 2012 and that Thomas filed his \u00a7 2254 petition on November 21, 2013. Therefore, the parties agree that at least 342 untolled days passed from December 14, 2012 until Thomas filed his \u00a7 2254 petition on November 21, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">Thomas\u2019s conviction was affirmed on direct appeal on June 21, 2006. <em>Thomas v. State, </em>931 So.2d 920 (Fla.Ct.App.2006). During the 90 days in which Thomas could have sought <em>certiorari </em>review from the United States Supreme Court, Thomas filed a motion under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.800(c) on August 6, 2006. Although the State disputes that Thomas\u2019s Rule 3.800(c) motion was the type of application that tolled the AEDPA limitations period, resolving that issue is not necessary to determine the timeliness of Thomas\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Thomas\u2019s Rule 3.800(c) motion qualified to toll the AEDPA limitations period, the date on which Thomas\u2019s Rule 3.800(c) motion stopped tolling the limitations period determines whether Thomas\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-8\">The website of the Broward County, Florida Clerk of Courts shows that an order denying Thomas\u2019s Rule 3.800(c) motion was signed on December 14, 2006 and filed on January 2, 2007. <em>See </em>Broward County Florida Clerk of the Courts, http:// www.clerk-17th-flcourts.orgWeb2 (search Case Number for 04000646CF10A). We take judicial notice that the Broward County Circuit Court denied Thomas\u2019s Rule 3.800(c) motion no later than January 2, 2007, after which at least 62 untolled days passed before Thomas filed his Rule 3.850 motion on March 5,2007. Therefore, at least 404 untolled days passed before Thomas filed his \u00a7 2254 petition and Thomas\u2019s petition is untimely. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s conclusion that Thomas\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
