McCormick contends that his above-guidelines sentence procedurally and substantively is unreasonable. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-17\">In 2007, McCormick pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B)(iii). McCormick was sentenced to 108 months\u2019 imprisonment (which was later reduced to 78 months) followed by 5 years\u2019 supervised release. McCormick\u2019s term of supervised release began in March 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-18\">In April 2014, a probation officer petitioned the district court to revoke McCormick\u2019s supervised release. The petition charged McCormick with 18 violations including, among other things, possession of cocaine and marijuana, testing positive for marijuana, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, obstructing an officer, attempted arson, battery, false imprisonment, criminal trespass, and theft of an automobile. At the revocation hearing, McCormick admitted to one violation: possession of cocaine. Based on this violation, McCormick was subject to mandatory revocation of his supervised release. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(g)(1) (mandating revocation of supervised release when a defendant possesses a controlled substance in violation of the conditions of supervised release).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-19\">The district court calculated the advisory guidelines range of 12 to 18 months\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>imprisonment based on McCormick\u2019s original sentencing criminal history score of I and commission of a Grade A supervision violation. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 7B1.1(a)(1), 7B1.4(a). The district court then decided to vary up and sentenced McCormick to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">McCormick contends that his sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable because the district court (1) failed to explain, adequately the chosen sentence; (2) gave improper weight to the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors; and (3) relied improperly on disputed testimony about McCormick\u2019s lack of cooperation while on supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">We review a sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Velasquez Velasquez, </em>524 F.3d 1248, 1252 (11th Cir.2008). When reviewing for reasonableness, we apply a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (in the context of original criminal sentencing). We \u201cmust first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error\u201d such as \u201cfailing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain .the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">If a sentence is procedurally sound, we then evaluate whether the sentence is substantively reasonable in the light of the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>We may consider the extent of an upward variance, but \u201cmust give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on the whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The party challenging the reasonableness of the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in'the light of both the record and the section 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-8\">McCormick\u2019s 24-month sentence is both procedurally and substantively reasonable. The district court calculated properly the advisory guidelines range. After considering the guidelines range and the Chapter 7 policy statements, the district court concluded that a guidelines sentence would be \u201cinadequate\u201d and decided to vary up by six months. The resulting 24-month sentence is well within the statutory maximum sentence of 3 years. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-9\">The court explained that an above-guidelines sentence was necessary, among other things, to afford adequate deterrence and to protect the public from further crimes committed by McCormick. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B), (C). On this record, the district court stated sufficient reasons for imposing an upward variance. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005) (nothing \u201crequires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-10\">Some conflict exists on the record about McCormick\u2019s level of cooperation while on supervised release. At the sentencing hearing, McCormick\u2019s probation officer testified that McCormick was uncooperative while on supervised release and failed repeatedly to comply with the probation officer\u2019s instructions. In response, McCormick denied generally the probation officer\u2019s allegations and testified that he had attended the classes required of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-11\">We do not know from the record the extent to which \u2014 if at all \u2014 the district court relied on the probation officer\u2019s testimony in applying an upward variance. But even if we assume that the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>court considered the probation officer\u2019s testimony in determining McCormick\u2019s sentence, we see no abuse of discretion. The district court, as the fact-finder, was in the best position to make a credibility determination about whose testimony to believe. <em>See United States v. Ramirez-Chilel, </em>289 F.3d 744, 749 (11th Cir.2002). Because the probation officer\u2019s testimony was not <em>\u201cexceedingly </em>improbable\u201d or \u201cunbelievable,\u201d we defer to the district court\u2019s decision \u2014 if a decision was made \u2014 to credit the probation officer over McCormick. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Further, the district court\u2019s stated reasons are supported by the totality of the circumstances and the section 3553(a) factors. McCormick admitted that, less than a year and a half after completing his 78-month sentence for possession of cocaine, he possessed cocaine once again. Under these circumstances, the district court abused no discretion in determining that an above-guidelines sentence was necessary both to deter McCormick from committing future crimes and to protect the public. The weight to be afforded any given section 3553(a) factor \u201cis a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
