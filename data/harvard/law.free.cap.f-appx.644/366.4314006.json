(BANA) for alleged violations of the Fair Housing Act (FHA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3601 <em>et seq., </em>the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681 <em>et seq., </em>and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1691 <em>et seq. </em>She argues that summary judgment was inappropriate because: (1) she presented sufficient, direct evidence to show that BANA intentionally denied her equal and fair access to FHA loan information and credit because of her race; (2) the evidence showed that BANA willfully, knowingly, and negligently accessed her credit report without her consent, without a permissible purpose, and under false pretenses; and (3) the evidence showed that BANA intentionally failed to provide her with a statement of reasons for its adverse decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-21\">Generally, we review \u201cthe grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standards as the district court.\u201d <em>Dillon v. Rogers, </em>596 F.3d 260, 266 (5th Cir.2010) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>(italics omitted). However, we apply the plain error standard when the complaining party fails to object to-a report and recommendation of the magistrate judge under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) after having been \u201cserved with notice that such consequences will result from a failure to object.\u201d <em>Douglass v. United Servs. Auto. Ass\u2019n, </em>79 F.3d 1415, 1428-29 (5th Cir.1996) (en banc), <em>superseded by statute on other grounds, </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1). Here, Lampkin was warned that the failure to file written objections within 14 days from her receipt of the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation would bar her form attacking the factual findings and legal conclusions on appeal. She did not file timely objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and the district court did not conduct a de novo review of the record. As a result, the factual findings and legal conclusions adopted by the district court are reviewed for plain error. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Lampkin\u2019s conclusory allegations that BANA intentionally denied her equal and fair access to FHA loan information and credit because of her race are insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact. <em>See Jones v. Lowndes Cty., Miss., </em>678 F.3d 344, 348 (5th Cir.2012). She cites no authority supporting her contention that the term \u201cminority\u201d is a racial epithet or that BANA loan officer Scott G. Brown\u2019s use of the term in response to charges of racial discrimination was evidence of his racial animus. Further, BANA\u2019s knowledge that she was a member of a protected class is alone insufficient to prove intentional discrimination. <em>See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-03, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973); <em>Artisan/Am. Corp. v. City of Alvin, Tex., </em>588 F.3d 291, 295 (5th Cir.2009). Moreover, aside from conclusory allegations, Lamp-kin does not challenge the district court\u2019s determination that she failed to establish a fact issue regarding her qualification for a home loan or Harris County\u2019s Downpayment Assistance Program. Therefore, Lampkin has failed to show that the district court plainly erred in granting BANA a summary judgment on her FHA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">Lampkin has also failed to show that the district court plainly erred in granting BANA a summary judgment on her FCRA claims. The evidence established that Lampkin sought to enter into credit transactions with BANA and that the loan officers accessed her credit report for purposes of determining whether to extend credit to Lampkin. Because the FCRA permits users to obtain a credit report in such cases, Lampkin\u2019s consent was not required. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(a)(3)(A); <em>Dixon v. Shamrock Fin. Corp., </em>522 F.3d 76, 77 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">Aside from conclusory allegations that BANA intentionally violated the ECOA and the FCRA by failing to provide her with statements of reasons sufficient to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 1691(d)(3) and 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681m(a), Lampkin does not address the district court\u2019s finding that the loan officers provided her with written notice of the reasons for their adverse actions, nor does she allege why the notices were deficient. Lampkin has therefore abandoned these issues by failing to adequately brief them on appeal. <em>See Hughes v. Johnson, </em>191 F.3d 607, 613 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"AaVX\">Finally, Lampkin did not file an amended or separate notice of appeal following the district court\u2019s denial of her Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6) motion, and her appellate brief was not filed within the time specified by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4. Thus, to the extent Lampkin challenges the district court\u2019s denial of her Rule 60(b)(6) motion, we lack jurisdiction to review that order. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(B)(ii); <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>205, 214, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b392-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R, 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
