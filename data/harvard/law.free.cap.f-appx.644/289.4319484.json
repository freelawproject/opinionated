The district court sentenced Chavez-Suarez to 60 months of imprisonment and a four-year term of supervised release. Chavez-Suarez argues that the district court committed reversible error when it found that he was \u201cRamon Carrillo Franco,\u201d the individual convicted of the 2007 California offenses listed in the presen-tence report. He contends that the information contained in the report was nonspecific and unreliable. Chavez-Suarez asserts this error was not harmless because it rendered him ineligible for the safety valve reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2. The Government has filed a motion to supplement the record on appeal with documents related to the 2007 California convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">We review the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo, </em>and we review factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 202-03 &amp; n. 9 (5th Cir.2005). Facts used to determine a sentence must be supported \u201cby a preponderance of the relevant and sufficiently reliable evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Alaniz, </em>726 F.3d 586, 619 (5th Cir.2013). As long as a factual finding is plausible in light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly erroneous and should be upheld. <em>Id. </em>at 618.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">A presentence report typically \u201cbears sufficient indicia of reliability to be considered as evidence by the sentencing judge in making factual determinations.\u201d <em>United States v. Nava, </em>624 F.3d 226, 231 (5th Cir.2010). Mere objections to the facts in the presentence report do not qualify as competent rebuttal evidence. <em>Alaniz, </em>726 F.3d at 619. The defendant has the burden of presenting evidence to show that the facts in the report are inaccurate or materially untrue. <em>United States v. Cervantes, </em>706 F.3d 603, 620-21 (5th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">Chavez-Suarez has not established that the district court committed clear error when it found that Chavez-Suarez was the individual convicted of the California offenses. <em>See Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d at 202-03 &amp; n. 9. Chavez-Suarez\u2019s admitted use of the alias \u201cRamon Carrillo Franco,\u201d his concession to living in Redwood City, and the listing of that alias in the state case establish by a preponderance of the evidence that Chavez-Suarez committed the offenses. <em>See Alaniz, </em>726 F.3d at 619. In addition, the probation officer explained that a search of the National and California Crime Information Center revealed that the Franco alias had been used by Chavez-Suarez. Moreover, the felony complaint and abstract of judgment relied upon by the probation officer have been deemed by us as reliable sources for proving the fact of a prior conviction. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Alvarez, </em>781 F.3d 787, 794-96 (5th Cir.2015); <em>United States v. Moreno-Florean, </em>542 F.3d 445, 449 n. 1 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-11\">Moreover, Chavez-Suarez failed to provide any rebuttal evidence to the information presented in the presentence report. Outside of mere objections to the reliabili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>ty, accuracy, and prejudicial nature of the information, he did not submit any evidence to contradict the findings of the probation officer. These objections alone were insufficient to rebut the information and, thus, the district court was free to rely on the presentence report and its factual findings therein. <em>See Alaniz, </em>726 F.3d at 619.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">In light of the foregoing discussion, the motion to supplement the record on appeal is DENIED, as the records are irrelevant to the issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b316-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
