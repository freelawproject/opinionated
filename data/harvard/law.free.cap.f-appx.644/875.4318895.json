A jury convicted Price of aiding and abetting an attempt to possess with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(a)(1), b(1)(A) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Price first argues that insufficient evidence exists to support his conviction. We review <em>de novo </em>the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a conviction, viewing the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the government\u201d and \u201cresolving all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Farley, </em>607 F.3d 1294, 1333 (11th Cir.2010). \u201cWe will not reverse unless no reasonable trier of fact could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[W]e assume that the jury made all credibility choices in support of the verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Jiminez, </em>564 F.3d 1280, 1285 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">To sustain a conviction under an aiding and abetting theory, \u201cthe prosecution must show that \u2018the defendant associated himself with a criminal venture, participated in it as something he wished to bring about, and sought by his actions to make it succeed.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Pantoja-Soto, </em>739 F.2d 1520, 1525 (11th Cir.1984). The government may satisfy its burden through circumstantial evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">Sufficient evidence exists to support Price\u2019s conviction. Testimony at trial \u2014 when viewed in the light most favorable to the government \u2014 demonstrated that Price negotiated to purchase five kilograms of cocaine from Delvon Williams, provided Williams with over $100,000 in cash to buy the cocaine from Josias Reyes, and followed Williams to two meeting spots as Williams attempted to complete the drug purchase. This evidence was sufficient to show Price\u2019s intent to possess and distribute cocaine and, thus, his association with a criminal venture. <em>See United States v. Madera-Madera, </em>333 F.3d 1228, 1233 (11th Cir.2003) (a defendant\u2019s intent to distribute can be inferred from his possession of a large quantity of drugs). The evidence also demonstrates that Price took affirmative steps to make the purchase succeed. On this record, we cannot say that \u201cno reasonable trier of fact could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">We next address Price\u2019s argument that the district court erred in denying him a mistrial. Because the district court \u201cis in the best position to evaluate the prejudicial effect of a statement or evidence on the jury,\u201d we review the district court\u2019s denial of a mistrial only for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Newsome, </em>475 F.3d 1221, 1227 (11th Cir.2007). A mistrial is warranted when \u201cthe defendant\u2019s substantial rights are prejudicially affected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThis occurs when there is a reasonable probability that, but for the remarks, the outcome of the trial would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWe make this determination in the context of the entire trial and in light of any curative instruction.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b891-11\">Price first moved for a mistrial based on remarks made during the government\u2019s opening statement. Price contends that, by commenting about Price\u2019s expected theory of defense, the government shifted improperly the burden of proof onto Price. Nothing evidences that the government\u2019s opening statement prejudiced Price\u2019s substantial rights. First, the district court twice instructed the jury that the government had the burden of proving Price\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. We presume that the jurors obeyed the court\u2019s instructions. <em>See United States v. Stone, </em>9 F.3d 934, 938 (11th Cir.1993). Further, after commenting on Price\u2019s theory of defense, the government reminded the jury expressly that the government bore the burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-12\">Price also moved for a mistrial after the \u25a0 government displayed mistakenly an unre-dacted list of Price\u2019s convictions during its closing argument. The district court de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>nied the motion, concluding that the document was unmagnified and would have been difficult for the jurors to read. Price does not dispute the district court\u2019s factual determination that the improperly-displayed document was illegible. Price has failed to show that he was unduly prejudiced; the district court abused no discretion in denying Price\u2019s motions for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Price next challenges three of the district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings. We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>United States v. Eckhardt, </em>466 F.3d 938, 946 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">First, the district court abused no discretion in admitting two recorded conversations between Williams and Reyes. For a co-conspirator statement to be admissible under Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E), \u201cthe government must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that: (1) a conspiracy existed; (2) the conspiracy included the declarant and the defendant against whom the statement is offered; and (3) the statement was made during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\u201d <em>United States v. Reeves, </em>742 F.3d 487, 503 (11th Cir.2014) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">The evidence presented at trial was sufficient for the district court to find by a preponderance of the evidence that a conspiracy existed between Price, Williams, and Reyes. Among other things, the evidence demonstrated that Price and Williams attempted to purchase a large quantity of cocaine from Reyes, that Price gave Williams over $100,000 to buy the cocaine, and that Williams agreed to sell Price two kilograms of cocaine on credit. <em>See United States v. Burroughs, </em>830 F.2d 1574, 1581 (11th Cir.1987) (affirming a conspiracy conviction when evidence showed that a co-conspirator sold drugs on credit and, thus, that the co-conspirators were not involved in \u201cmere isolated sales\u201d). Price contends that the recorded statements were inadmissible because nothing evidenced that Price was involved in the conspiracy when the March 4 and March 14 conversations took place. This argument is without merit: our law is clear that a co-conspirator\u2019s statement \u201cis admissible against a co-conspirator, even one who may have joined the conspiracy after the statement was made.\u201d <em>See Reeves, </em>742 F.3d at 503.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-9\">Price next contends that the district court erred in admitting evidence of his other drug purchases. For evidence to be admissible under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b), (1) \u201cthe evidence must be relevant to an issue other than the defendant\u2019s character;\u201d (2) \u201cthe act must be established by sufficient proof to permit a jury finding that the defendant committed the extrinsic act;\u201d and (3) \u201cthe probative value of the evidence must not be substantially outweighed by its undue prejudice.\u201d <em>United States v. Delgado, </em>56 F.3d 1357, 1365 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-10\">The evidence of Price\u2019s earlier drug purchases satisfies each of these elements; the district court abused no discretion. First, evidence of Price\u2019s earlier drug purchases was pertinent to prove Price\u2019s knowledge and intent, particularly because Price put his intent at issue by pleading not guilty and by presenting a \u201cmere presence\u201d defense. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b892-11\">Second, the evidence presented at trial was sufficient for the jury to find that Price had in fact been involved in other drug purchases. Leonel Ruiz testified that, on five separate occasions, he sold Price one kilogram of cocaine. \u201c[T]he uncorroborated word of an accomplice provides a sufficient basis for concluding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>the defendant committed extrinsic acts admissible under Rule 404(b).\u201d <em>United States v. Dickerson, </em>248 F.3d 1036, 1047 (11th Cir.2001) (alteration omitted). Here, Ruiz\u2019s testimony was further corroborated by phone records, showing repeated calls between Ruiz and Price during the time of the alleged drug sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">About the third element, evidence of Price\u2019s other drug purchases was highly probative given that Price\u2019s intent was a central issue in the case, and given the similarities between the charged offense and Price\u2019s other drug purchases. And nothing evidences that Price suffered undue prejudice. <em>See Delgado, </em>56 F.3d at 1366 (\u201cextrinsic drug offenses do not tend to incite a jury to an irrational decision.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">The district court also abused no discretion in refusing to allow testimony to impeach Ruiz\u2019s credibility. Because Ruiz had already said on cross-examination that he hoped to receive a lower sentence in exchange for his testimony, Price\u2019s proposed witness testimony would have been needlessly cumulative. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">We reject Price\u2019s argument that the district court erred in denying his motion for a new trial. Sufficient evidence existed to sustain the jury\u2019s guilty verdict. And Price suffered no undue prejudice as a result of the government\u2019s opening statement or closing argument. Thus, Price has failed to demonstrate that this is an \u201cexceptional case\u201d warranting a new trial. <em>See United States v. Hernandez, </em>433 F.3d 1328, 1336-37 (11th Cir.2005) (because motions for new trial are not favored, \u201c[c]ourts are to grant them sparingly and with caution, doing so only in those really \u2018exceptional eases.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-9\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-10\">Price contends that his 262-month sentence is substantively unreasonable because it created unwarranted sentencing disparities. We evaluate the substantive reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The defendant bears the burden of establishing that his sentence is unreasonable in the light of both the record and the section 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-11\">As an initial matter, Price was sentenced well-below his guidelines range of 360 months to life imprisonment. We ordinarily expect a guidelines sentence to be reasonable. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b893-12\">Price has also failed to demonstrate that he is similarly situated to his- fellow co-conspirators who received lesser' sentences. First, Price was sentenced as a career offender; and nothing evidences that his co-conspirators qualified as career offenders. In addition, unlike his co-conspirators, Price pleaded not guilty, proceeded to trial, and provided no assistance to the government. Defendants who cooperate with the government are not similarly situated to those defendants who do not. <em>United States v. Docampo, </em>573 F.3d 1091, 1101 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-13\">Price\u2019s below-guidelines sentence was within \u201cthe range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
