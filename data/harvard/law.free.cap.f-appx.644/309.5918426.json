In this appeal, he challenges the district court\u2019s entry of a judgment under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) \u2014 which provides for a maximum sentence of 20 years for an alien whose prior removal was subsequent to a conviction for an \u201caggravated felo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>ny\u201d \u2014 arguing that the qualifying prior felony, a 2000 Florida conviction for robbery, did not .constitute an \u201caggravated felon/\u2019 because he was not sentenced to a term of imprisonment of at least one year in relation thereto. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1326(b)(2); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). Pineda-Oyuela asks this court to remand the case to the district court for reformation of the judgment to correctly reflect his conviction under \u00a7 1326(b)(1). The Government concedes that judgment was wrongly entered under \u00a7 1326(b)(2) for the reasons given by Pineda-Oyuela but contends that remand is unnecessary in light of this court\u2019s authority to reform the judgment. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Because Pinedar-Oyuela did not preserve this error in the district court, we review for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>484 F.3d 783, 792 (5th Cir.2007); <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). We agree that the district court committed clear or obvious error in entering judgment under \u00a7 1326(b)(2) because Pineda-Oyuela\u2019s Florida robbery conviction, which resulted in a sentence only of probation, did not constitute an \u201caggravated felony,\u201d as required for conviction under \u00a7 1326(b)(2). <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 368-69 (5th Cir.2009). Judgment should therefore have been entered under \u00a7 1326(b)(1). Nonetheless, because the district court\u2019s error did not affect the sentence he received, Pineda-Oyuela fails to show that the error affected his. substantial rights. <em>See id. </em>at 369; <em>Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Accordingly, Pineda-Oyuela\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED. We REMAND the case to the district court for the limited purpose of reforming the judgment to reflect Pineda-Oyuela\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 1326(b)(1).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b335-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
