In sentencing Eriza-Gomez, the district court concluded that his prior conviction under Florida\u2019s cocaine trafficking statute \u2014 Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.135(l)(b) \u2014 is a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Based on this finding, the district court imposed a 16-level sentencing enhancement on him pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2. On appeal, Eriza-Gomez argues that the district court erred in imposing this enhancement because his Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.135(l)(b) conviction is not a \u00a7 2L1.2 \u201cdrug trafficking offense.\u201d He also asserts that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. After reviewing the record and considering the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court did not commit reversible error in sentencing Eriza-Go-mez. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b935-9\">We review de novo whether a defendant\u2019s prior conviction constitutes a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>See United States v. Aguilar-Ortiz, </em>450 F.3d 1271, 1272 (11th Cir.2006). Section 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) increases the guideline range for a defendant by 16 levels if the defendant was removed after a conviction for a \u201cdrug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded 13 months\u201d of imprisonment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i). The Application Notes to \u00a7 2L1.2 define a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d as \u201can offense under federal, state, or local law that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of, or offer to sell a controlled substance ... or the <em>possession </em>of a controlled substance ... with <em>intent to </em>manufacture, import, export, <em>distribute, </em>or dispense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. 1(B)(iv) (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-12\">We hold that Eriza-Gomez\u2019s conviction for trafficking cocaine in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.135(l)(b) is a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2 because it is an offense that prohibits the \u201cpossession of a controlled substance ... with intent to ... distribute.\u201d <em>See id. </em>This is dictated by our decisions in <em>United States v. Madera-Madera, </em>333 F.3d 1228 (11th Cir.2003) and <em>United States v. James, </em>430 F.3d 1150 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-13\">In <em>Madera-Madera, </em>we held that a conviction under Georgia\u2019s drug trafficking statute constitutes a \u00a7 2L1.2 \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d because the statute (1) requires \u201cpossession of a <em>significant </em>quantity of drugs,\u201d (2) \u201cinfers an intent to distribute,\u201d and (3) treats trafficking as a \u201cmore serious offense ,.. than either simple possession or possession with intent to distribute.\u201d <em>See </em>333 F.3d at 1231-32. Then, in <em>James, </em>we relied on <em>Madera-Madera </em>in determining that a violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.135(1)(b) likewise requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>' \u201cpossession of a significant quantity of drugs,\u201d \u201cinfers an intent to distribute,\u201d and treats trafficking as a \u201cmore serious offense ... than either simple possession or possession with intent to distribute.\u201d <em>See </em>430 F.3d at 1154-55 (quoting <em>Madera-Madera, </em>333 F.3d at 1232). Given the key similarities between Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.135(1)(b) and Georgia\u2019s drug trafficking statute, we conclude that under <em>Madera-Madera </em>Eriza-Gomez\u2019s conviction is a \u00a7 2L1.2 \u201cdrug trafficking offense.\u201d Therefore, the district court did not err in imposing a 16-level enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">We apply the abuse of discretion standard to a defendant\u2019s claim that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1188-89 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc). In reviewing a sentence for reasonableness, \u201cwe consider the final sentence, in its entirety, in light of the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir.2006). \u201c[W]e are to vacate the sentence if, but only if, we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a): factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1190 (internal quotation mark omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">Considering the totality of the circumstances, the district court did not abuse its discretion when sentencing Eriza-Gomez. First, \u201c[w]e ordinarily expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable,\u201d and Eriza-Gomez\u2019s 57-month sentence is at the bottom of the applicable 57-to 71-month advisory guideline range. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). Second, the sentence is well below the 20-year statutory maximum for convictions under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2), <em>United States v. Valnor, </em>451 F.3d 744, 751-52 (11th Cir.2006) (reasoning that a sentence being \u201cappreciably below\u201d the statutory maximum is an indicator of reasonableness). Finally, this is Eriza-Gomez\u2019s fourth conviction for illegal entry into the United States \u2014 a fact that militates against a downward variance from Eriza-Gomez\u2019s advisory guideline range. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (listing the \u201chistory\u201d of the defendant, the need for \u201cadequate deterrence,\u201d and the need to \u201cprotect the public from further crimes of the defendant\u201d as relevant sentencing factors).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-8\">In light of the foregoing, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b935-10\">. Eriza-Gomez was convicted for trafficking between 200 and 400 grams of cocaine, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.135(l)(b)(l)(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b935-14\">. Convictions under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.135(l)(b)(l)(b) have a \u201cmandatory minimum term of imprisonment of 3 years.\" Thus, \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i)\u2019s \"13-month\u201d requirement is not at issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
