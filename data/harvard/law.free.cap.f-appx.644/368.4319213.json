The district court dismissed, with prejudice, Phillips\u2019s claims against the Federal Bureau of Investigation pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) upon concluding that Phillips failed to plead facts sufficient to support any claim for relief and that the claims were duplicative of previous filings. The district court dismissed the claims against all of the other Defendants pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) upon concluding that the claims were factually frivolous and malicious. In addition, the district court modified already-existing sanctions against Phillips to prevent Phillips from filing, removing, or transferring any litigation in the Northern District of Texas without first obtaining leave from a district court judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-21\">In her brief on appeal, Phillips fails to address the district court\u2019s reasons for dismissing her claims, does not adequately argue why she is entitled to any relief, and does not include a statement of issues presented for review. Although we must liberally construe the briefs of <em>pro se </em>litigants, <em>\u201cpro se </em>parties must still brief the issues and reasonably comply with the standards of Rule 28.\u201d <em>Grant v. Cuellar, </em>59 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>F.3d 523, 524 (5th Cir.1995). By failing to address the district court\u2019s reasoning, adequately argue entitlement to relief, and include a statement of issues presented for review, Phillips\u2019s appeal fails to comply with the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. <em>See Toala v. Marriott White Lodging Corporate, </em>456 Fed.Appx. 476, 477 (5th Cir.2012). Therefore, we DISMISS the appeal for want of prosecution. <em>See id. </em>All pending motions are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b394-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
