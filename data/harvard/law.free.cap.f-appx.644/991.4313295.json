On appeal, Defendant argues that the district court erred by applying a 16-level enhancement under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). Specifically, he argues that his prior Texas conviction for possession with intent to sell cocaine does not constitute a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under that provision. We disagree, and thus affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-8\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-9\">Defendant is a Mexican citizen who entered the United States as a permanent resident in 1980. In December 1997, Defendant was arrested in T\u00e9xas for possession with intent to distribute marijuana. He was convicted and sentenced to 27 months, and ordered removed by an immigration judge. Pursuant to the removal order, Defendant was deported to Mexico in January 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-10\">Defendant illegally reentered the United States within a year of being deported. In April 2007, Defendant was arrested in Texas for possession of cocaine with intent to deliver, in violation of Texas Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 481.112(d). Defendant was convicted and sentenced to five years, and was again deported to Mexico in February 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-12\">Subsequently, Defendant illegally reentered the United States a second time. The exact date of his reentry is unknown, but he was apprehended by Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE) agents in July 2014 in Hillsborough County, Florida. Defendant was indicted and pled guilty to one count of illegal reentry after deportation for a felony in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-13\">Pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2L1.2, the Pre-Sentence Report (PSR) assigned Defendant a base offense level of 8 for illegal reentry. Based on Defendant\u2019s prior Texas conviction for possession of cocaine with intent to deliver, the PSR applied a 16-level enhancement under the \u201cdrug trafficking\u201d provision of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). After subtracting 3 levels for acceptance of responsibility, the PSR set Defendant\u2019s total offense level at 21, criminal history category III, yielding an advisory guideline range of 46 to 57 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-14\">Defendant objected at sentencing to the drug trafficking enhancement, arguing that his Texas conviction did not constitute a \u201cdrug trafficking offense.\u201d The district court rejected Defendant\u2019s argument, adopted the 46 to 57 month guideline range as calculated in the PSR, and sentenced Defendant to 52 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-15\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-16\">We review de novo whether Defendant\u2019s Texas conviction qualifies as a drug trafficking offense for purposes, of USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A). <em>United States v. Aguilar-Ortiz, </em>450 F.3d 1271, 1272 (11th Cir.2006). We generally use a \u201ccategorical\u201d approach to determine whether a prior conviction supports a sentence enhance<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>ment under the Guidelines.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1273. Under this approach, we look only to the fact of the conviction, and the statutory definition of the offense, to determine whether the offense qualifies as a predicate for an enhancement. <em>United States v. Palomino Garcia, </em>606 F.3d 1317, 1328 (11th Cir.2010) (citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">Section 2L1.2 sets a base offense level of 8 for a defendant convicted of unlawful reentry into the United States. USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(a). It provides for a 16-level enhancement where the defendant \u201cpreviously was deported\u201d as a result of a felony conviction for a \u201cdrug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded 13 months.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i). The commentary to this section of the Guidelines defines \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d to mean:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Akv\">an offense under federal, state, or local law that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of, or offer to sell a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) or the possession of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1007-7\">USSG \u00a7 2L1.2, comment (n.l(B)(iv)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1007-8\">The Texas statute under which Defendant was convicted criminalizes the manufacture or delivery of a controlled substance. Tex. Health <em>&amp; </em>Safety Code Ann. \u00a7 481.112 (2007). It states that: \u201ca person commits an offense if the person knowingly manufactures, delivers, or possesses with intent to deliver a controlled substance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 481.112(a). The offense \u201cis a felony of the first degree if the amount of the controlled substance to which the offense applies is, by aggregate weight, ... four grams or more but less than 200 grams.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 481.112(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-10\">Comparing the elements of the Texas statute with the definition of \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d set out in the cor imentary to \u00a7 2L1.2, it is clear that the conduct prohibited by the statute qualifies for the 16-level enhancement under the Guideline. The Texas statute makes it a first degree felony to manufacture, deliver, or possess with intent to deliver a controlled substance. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 481.112(a), (d). Likewise, the commentary to \u00a7 2L1.2 defines \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d to include manufacture or distribution of a controlled substance, as well as \u201cpossession of a controlled substance ... with intent\u201d to manufacture or distribute it. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(11) (clarifying that to \u201cdistribute\u201d under federal law means \u201cto deliver\u201d). Thus, the plain language of USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) provides for the 16-level enhancement that the district court applied here. <em>See Unit</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number><em>ed States v. Madera-Madera, </em>333 F.3d 1228, 1233-34 (11th Cir.2003) (noting that a person convicted of possession with intent to distribute any amount of a controlled substance would be eligible for the \u201cdrug trafficking\u201d enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">Defendant nevertheless argues that the enhancement does not apply because the Texas statute (1) does not require remuneration and (2) criminalizes possession with intent to deliver a relatively small amount (four grams) of a controlled substance. In support of this argument, Defendant primarily relies on <em>Moncrieffe v. Holder, </em>- U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1678, 185 L.Ed.2d 727 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-7\">The issue addressed by the Supreme Court in <em>Moncriejfe </em>was whether the Georgia offense of \u201cpossession] with intent to distribute marijuana\u201d constituted \u201cillicit trafficking in a controlled substance\u201d and thus qualified as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). <em>Moncrieffe, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1683-85. The INA defines \u201cillicit trafficking in a controlled substance\u201d to include \u201cany felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act\u201d (CSA). 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B) (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)). The Supreme Court held that the Georgia offense did not satisfy this definition, because its elements do not \u201cn\u00e9cessarily\u201d involve conduct that was punishable as a felony under the CSA. <em>Moncrieffe, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1684, 1693-94. Rather, depending on the quantity of marijuana involved and whether there was remuneration, in some cases the Georgia offense involves conduct punishable only as a misdemeanor under the CSA. <em>Id, </em>at 1686.</p>\n<p id=\"A1Re\"><em>Moncriejfe </em>has no bearing on the question whether Defendant\u2019s Texas conviction qualifies as a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under USSG \u00a7 2L1.2.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Rodriguez-Bernal, </em>783 F.3d 1002, 1008 (5th Cir.2015) (rejecting an identical argument based on <em>Moncriejfe). </em>As defined by \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A), a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d for purposes of that Guideline enhancement simply requires \u201cpossession of a controlled substance ... with intent to ... distribute\u201d it, USSG \u00a7 2L1.2, comment (n.l(B)(iv)). That requirement is satisfied by Defendant\u2019s Texas conviction for possession of cocaine with intent to deliver. <em>See </em>Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. \u00a7 481.112(a), (d). Because the district court did not err in imposing the 16-level enhancement provided for in \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A), Defendant\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1007-11\">. When a \"divisible\u201d statute covers some conduct that is within, and other conduct that is broader than, the predicate offense described in the Guidelines, we use a \"modified categorical approach.\u201d <em>See United States v. Ramirez-Flores, </em>743 F.3d 816, 820-21 (11th Cir.2014) (explaining that the modified approach may be applied in cases involving a divisible statute that sets out alternative elements of an offense). Under the modified approach, we \"may \u2018consult a limited class of documents ... to determine which alternative element formed the basis of the defendant\u2019s prior conviction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 820 (citing <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 2281, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013)). We do not have to consider whether the modified categorical approach applies here, because Defendant\u2019s conviction qualifies as a predicate offense under the categorical approach.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1007-14\">. This definition \"is authoritative unless it violates the Constitution or a federal statute, or is inconsistent with, or a plainly erroneous reading of, th[e] guideline.\u201d <em>United States v. Cruz, </em>713 F.3d 600, 607 (11th Cir.2013) (citation and quotation marks omitted). Defendant concedes that the commentary is authoritative as to the relevant definition in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1008-8\">. <em>Donawa v. United States Att'y Gen., </em>735 F.3d 1275 (11th Cir.2013) is likewise inapposite, In <em>Donawa, </em>we held that a Florida conviction for possession of marijuana with intent to sell did not constitute a \"drug trafficking aggravated felony\u201d for purposes of the INA. <em>Id. </em>at 1278. Like the <em>Moncrieffe </em>decision, that holding is irrelevant to the issue presented in this case: whether the Texas offense of possession with intent to deliver cocaine is encompassed by the definition of a \"drug trafficking offense\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
