California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Frias Gomez has filed a response. The record is not sufficiently developed to allow us to make a fair evaluation of Frias Gomez\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel; we therefore decline to consider the claim without prejudice to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>collateral review. <em>See United States v. Isgar, </em>739 F.3d 829, 841 (5th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Frias Gomez\u2019s response. Although counsel addresses the validity of Frias Gomez\u2019s appeal waiver, counsel does not fully and meaningfully discuss the district court\u2019s compliance with Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11. An appeal waiver in the plea agreement does not waive the district court\u2019s compliance with Rule 11 or the need to brief this issue adequately in an <em>Anders </em>brief. <em>See United States v. Carreon-Ibarra, </em>673 F.3d 358, 362 n. 3 (5th Cir.2012); <em>see also United States v. Brown, </em>328 F.3d 787, 789-90 (5th Cir.2003). Nevertheless, our independent review confirms that the guilty plea was knowing and voluntary. We therefore concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, the motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5TH CIR. R. 42.2. Frias Gomez\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel is DENIED. <em>See United States v. Wagner, </em>158 F.3d 901, 902-03 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b370-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
