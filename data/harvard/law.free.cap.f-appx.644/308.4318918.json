In this appeal, Leal challenges the district court\u2019s denial of a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) in light of Amendment 782 to the Sentencing Guidelines. He has also moved for leave to file an out-of-time reply brief, and that motion is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-21\">First, Leal contends that the district court erred by failing to expressly find that he was eligible for a sentence reduction and determine what his amended guidelines imprisonment range would be. The district court\u2019s consideration of the issue whether relief was warranted necessarily implies that it did find Leal eligible for a sentence reduction. <em>See United States v. Larry, </em>632 F.3d 933, 936 (5th Cir.2011). Second, Leal argues that the district court abused its discretion in failing to grant him a sentence reduction. In particular, Leal argues that (1) the district court gave undue weight to his prior criminal history and that it would not have done so had it conducted a through investigation of the facts behind his^ prior convictions; (2) his postsentencing rehabilitation efforts warranted a sentence reduction, and the district court\u2019s failure to mention those efforts in its reasons for denying relief indicate that it did not consider them; (3) a sentence reduction resulting in Leal\u2019s early release would fulfill Amendment 782\u2019s purpose of reducing the federal prison population and the costs of incarceration; (4) because the district court sentenced him at the low end of the original guidelines-imprisonment range, it should have modified his sentence to be at the low end of his amended guidelines-imprisonment range; and (5) other defendants with far worse criminal histories have been granted relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) in the wake of Amendment 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>When determining whether a reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is warranted and the extent of such reduction, the district court \u201cshall consider\u201d both the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and \u201cthe nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or the community that may. be posed by a reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.1(B)(i)-(ii)). The district court also \u201cmay consider\u201d the defendant\u2019s postsentencing conduct. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.1(B)(iii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">In its order denying relief, the district court stated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the further need to protect the community. It also indicated that it had taken into account the policy statement set forth at U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, which provides that a district court may, but is not required to, consider a defendant\u2019s postsentencing conduct. In sum, the record shows that the district court considered the factors as required by law and therefore it did not abuse its discretion in denying relief. <em>See Larry, </em>632 F.3d at 936; <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b334-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
