Thus, the claim is unexhausted, and we lack jurisdiction to consider Calos\u2019s claim for protection under the CAT. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-19\">The BIA and the IJ may \u201crely on <em>any </em>inconsistency or omission in making an adverse credibility determination as long as the totality of the circumstances establishes that an asylum applicant is not credible.\u201d <em>Wang v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 531, 538 (5th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) (emphasis in original). The inconsistency need not go to the heart of the case. <em>Id. </em>at 537. A credibility finding is a finding of fact that is reviewed for substantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 538-39. Therefore, we will defer to a credibility ruling \u201cunless, from the totality of the circumstances, it is plain that no reasonable fact-finder could make such an adverse credibility ruling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 538 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-20\">Calos has not demonstrated that the record as a whole compels a conclusion that the adverse credibility finding was erroneous. <em>See id. </em>He points to no testimony or other evidence that would compel a reversal of the agency\u2019s determination that the implausibility of his claims of past persecution and his fear of future persecution on account of his Roma ethnicity or political opinion was fatal to his claim. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii) (in making credibility determination, trier of fact to consider, among other things, the inherent plausibility of the applicant\u2019s account). Given the adverse credibility ruling, Calos did not demonstrate that he was entitled to asylum or statutory withholding of removal. <em>See Chun v. I.N.S., </em>40 F.3d 76, 79 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Because the credibility determinations of the IJ and BIA withstand review, the decision to deny Calos and his wife relief is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 339, 344-45 (5th Cir.2005). Therefore, it is unnecessary to address the agency\u2019s alternative findings concerning failure to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">PETITION DENIED IN PART AND DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b314-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
