Barker appeals his conviction and sentence as a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(e)(1). On appeal, he argues that: (1) the district court erred by denying his motion to suppress, since the police impermissibly exceeded the scope of the traffic stop; and (2) the district court erred by sentencing him under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), because his previous convictions for third-degree burglary are not violent felonies within the meaning of the ACCA. After careful review, we affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-14\">When reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to- suppress, we review its factual findings for clear error and its application of the law to those facts <em>de novo. United States v. Ransfer, </em>749 F.3d 914, 921 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 392, 190 L.Ed.2d 276 (2014). We construe the facts in the light most favorable to the party prevailing in the district court \u2014 here, the government. <em>Id. </em>We usually review <em>de novo </em>the constitutionality of a statute, but arguments raised for the first time on appeal are reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Wright, </em>607 F.3d 708, 715 (11th Cir.2010). To show plain error, the defendant must show (1) an error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affected his substantial rights. <em>United States v. Turner, </em>474 F.3d 1265, 1276 (11th Cir.2007).' If the defendant satisfies the three conditions, we may exercise our discretion to recognize the error if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We review <em>de novo </em>whether a particular conviction qualifies as a violent felony under the ACCA. <em>United States v. Kirk, </em>767 F.3d 1136, 1138 (11th Cir.2014) (per curiam), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2941, 192 L.Ed.2d 962 (2015). An error may become plain as the result of an intervening decision of this Court or the Supreme Court that is squarely on point. <em>United States v. Pielago, </em>135 F.3d 703, 711 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">First, we are unpersuaded by Barker\u2019s claim that the district court erred by denying his motion to suppress. Once the police have made a lawful stop, an officer\u2019s inquiries into matters unrelated to the justification of the stop do not convert the encounter into something other than a lawful seizure, so long as those inquiries do not measurably extend the duration of the stop. <em>Arizona v. Johnson, </em>555 U.S. 323, 333, 129 S.Ct. 781, 172 L.Ed.2d 694 (2009); <em>United States v. Griffin, </em>696 F.3d 1354, 1361-62 (11th Cir.2012). \u201cThis is because such questions, absent a prolonged detention, do not constitute a \u2018discrete Fourth Amendment event.\u2019\u201d <em>Griffin, </em>696 F.3d at 1362 (quoting <em>Muehler v. Mena, </em>544 U.S. 93, 101, 125 S.Ct. 1465, 161 L.Ed.2d 299 (2005)). There is, of course, no bright-line rule for when a stop has been prolonged. <em>Id. </em>Instead, we assess the length of the stop as a whole, including any extension of the encounter, by undertaking a fact-bound, context-dependent analysis of all the circumstances concerning the stop and the unrelated questions. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1016-6\">Here, Deputy Jennifer Wells \u2014 one of two deputies who stopped Barker \u2014 testified that she only stood with Barker for \u201ca very short time,\u201d and the time from the beginning of the traffic stop to the pat-down was \u201c[j]ust a couple of minutes.\u201d Likewise, the other deputy, Brian Jackson testified that the entire incident only lasted three or four minutes. Deputy Jackson asked Barker only two questions \u2014 whether he had any weapons on him and whether he would consent to a search \u2014 and Barker responded with either a one- or two-word answer. On this record, Jackson\u2019s unrelated questions did not measurably prolong the detention, and the district court did hot err in denying the motion to suppress. <em>See id. </em>at 1361-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-8\">We find merit, however, in Barker\u2019s claim that the district court erred by sentencing him under the ACCA. The ACCA mandates a minimum 15-year sentence of imprisonment for a defendant who has three previous convictions for \u201ca violent felony or a serious drug offense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1), A \u201cviolent felony\u201d is any crime that \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another\u201d (the \u201celements clause\u201d),' or is a \u201cburglary, arson, [] extortion, [orj involves use of explosives\u201d (the \u201cenumerated offense clause\u201d). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i)\u2014(ii). The statute also includes a \u201cresidual clause\u201d that makes any felony beyond those enumerated a violent felony if it \u201cinvolve[s] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d <em>Kirk, </em>767 F.3d at 1139 (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)). However, in 2015, the Supreme Court invalidated the residual clause as unconstitutionally vague in <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 2556-57, 2563, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-11\">In this case, Barker\u2019s presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) advised that Barker had committed <em>four </em>previous violent felonies (one more than the three necessary for application of the ACCA) \u2014 one for delivery of cocaine, one for aggravated battery, and two for burglary of a structure. Barker objected to whether his two convictions for burglary of a structure constituted \u201cviolent felonies\u201d for pui\u2019poses of the ACCA\u2019s residual clause and enumerated offense clause. The district court determined, however, that Barker\u2019s burglary convictions were predicate offenses under the residual clause, and sentenced him un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>der the ACCA. Although the low end of the guidelines\u2019 range was 235 months\u2019 imprisonment, the district court varied downward to impose a prison term of 188 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-4\">While Barker\u2019s appeal was pending, the Supreme Court decided in <em>Johnson </em>that the residual clause was unconstitutional. In light of <em>Johnson, </em>we conclude that the district court erred in sentencing Barker based on his previous burglary convictions under the now-invalid residual clause of the ACCA and remand for resentencing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In supplemental briefing following <em>Johnson, </em>the government has argued (as it did before the district court and in its original brief to this Court) that Barker\u2019s burglary convictions are predicate offenses under the ACCA\u2019s enumerated offense clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">We leave it to the district court in the first instance to determine on remand whether a sentencing enhancement may be sustained in these circumstances under the enumerated clause of the ACCA. He must be resentenced without reference to the residual clause. \u201c[W]hen a criminal sentence is vacated, it becomes void in its entirety; the sentence \u2014 including any enhancements \u2014 has been wholly nullified and the slate wiped clean.\u201d <em>United States v. Stinson, </em>97 F.3d 466, 469 (11th Cir.1996) (quotation omitted). \u201cConsequently, when a sentence is vacated and the case is remanded for resentencing, the district court is free to reconstruct the sentence utilizing any of the sentence components.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1017-7\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1017-9\">. Although Barker did not object to the constitutionality of the residual clause in district court, the intervening decision of <em>Johnson </em>establishes that the district court plainly erred by sentencing him based on the residual clause. <em>See Pielago, </em>135 F.3d at 711 (\"[A]n intervening decision of this Court or the Supreme Court squarely on point may make an error plain.\u201d). Moreover, we apply the law as it exists at the time of appellate consideration. <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>422 F.3d 1285, 1301 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
