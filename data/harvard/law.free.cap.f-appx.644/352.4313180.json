(He conceded re-movability.)</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>Guillen challenges the BIA\u2019s determination he was not entitled to withholding of removal because he was not a member of a cognizable particular social group. He does not renew his contention he was entitled to withholding of removal because he faces persecution in Mexico based on his political beliefs, nor does he contest the BIA\u2019s determination he was not entitled to relief under the CAT; therefore, those claims are abandoned. <em>See, e.g., Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The BIA agreed with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Guillen is not eligible for withholding of removal because he failed to show membership in a cognizable particular social group; accordingly, the decisions of both the BIA and IJ are reviewable for substantial evidence. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 903 (5th Cir.2002). In that regard, his burden is to demonstrate the evidence compels 'a conclusion contrary to that reached by the BIA and IJ. <em>E.g., Eduard v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 182, 186 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Guillen applied for withholding of removal based on his membership in the particular social group identified as \u201cMexican deportees who have lived many years in the United States, vulnerable to extortion, and resented by organized criminals now operating in Mexico\u201d. He contends his extended residency in the United States has instilled particular traits that will make him readily recognizable and vulnerable to abuse by criminals, and he is unable to,relocate. This is insufficient to show the BIA erred in upholding the IJ\u2019s determination that Guillen\u2019s proffered group lacks the requisite social distinction and particularity. <em>See Orellana-Monson v. Holder, </em>685 F.3d 511, 518-19 (5th Cir.2012). Guillen points to no evidence in the record which compels a contrary conclusion; accordingly, he has not met his burden of proof. <em>See Eduard, </em>379 F.3d at 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b378-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
