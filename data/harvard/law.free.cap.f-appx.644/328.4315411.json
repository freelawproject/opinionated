He contends that the prosecutor\u2019s comments during closing argument improperly commented on.his failure to testify in his own defense and improperly shifted the burden of proof to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-20\">Review is for plain error since Reyes Vasquez did not object in the district court. <em>See United States v. Virgen-Moreno, </em>265 F.3d 276, 292 (5th Cir.2001). During closing argument, the prosecutor commented that the evidence that Reyes Vasquez\u2019s voice was on the recorded conversations was unrefuted. These comments did not impermissibly comment on Reyes Vasquez\u2019s silence or shift the burden of proof to Reyes Vasquez because they were responsive to defense counsel\u2019s closing argument that the evidence of the phone calls and voice identification involved no specific training or scientific methods or a voice comparison. <em>See Virgen-Moreno, 265 </em>F.3d at 293-93. Viewing the prosecutor\u2019s comments in context and in light of the jury instructions, the jury would not \u201cnaturally and necessarily\u201d interpret the challenged remarks as a comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify or an impermissible shifting of the burden of proof. <em>See Virgen-Moreno, </em>265 F.3d at 292-93; <em>see also United States v. Jefferson, </em>258 F.3d 405, 414 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-21\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b354-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
