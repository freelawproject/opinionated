Gadsden pleaded guilty to opening or causing others to open checking accounts with minimum deposit amounts and then using bad checks from those accounts to make purchases. He now challenges how his sentence was calculated. First, Gadsden argues that the district court\u2019s loss calculation was not supported by sufficient evidence. Second, he argues that the district court improperly counted victims and losses from times during the conspiracy when he was incarcerated. Third, Gadsden argues that he was not a leader or organizer of the conspiracy. Finally, he argues that the conspiracy did not involve sophisticated means. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-14\">First, Gadsden argues that the district court\u2019s loss calculation was not supported by sufficient evidence. We review a district court\u2019s loss calculation for clear error. <em>United States v. Barrington, </em>648 F.3d 1178, 1197 (11th Cir.2011). The sentencing court \u201cneed only make a reasonable estimate of the loss, given the available information,\u201d though its calculation must be supported by \u201creliable and specific evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). If the loss amount is greater than $400,000 but not more than $1,000,000, the defendant\u2019s offense level increases by 14. USSG \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1) (2013). If the loss amount is greater than $1,000,000 but not more than $2,500,000, the offense level increases by 16. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1002-15\">The district court did not clearly err in calculating the loss amount. The court relied on the testimony of Secret Service Agent Leighton Greenlee, who used a mul-tifactor analysis to trace bad checks to the conspiracy. A bad check was included in the loss amount only if it satisfied specific criteria, such as being: from a local bank account opened with a minimum deposit; overnighted to the account holder; written just after the account was opened; mailed to an address linked to the conspirators; used for a high-cost purchase; or used at a frequently victimized store.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Agent Greenlee created a spreadsheet listing checks that fit this pattern and excluded any that did not. He arrived at a total loss amount of $1,418,264.50. The district court considered this testimony and established the loss amount as $1,000,000. Neither party objected to the court\u2019s calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-16\">The evidence at sentencing was sufficient to support the district court\u2019s reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>able estimate of the loss amount. Agent Greenlee calculated a loss amount based on a variety of factors as well as his investigation of the conspiracy. The district court reduced the amount calculated by Agent Greenlee by almost 30 percent, adding a margin of error for any checks that Agent Greenlee may have mistakenly attributed to the conspiracy. The district court\u2019s calculation triggered a lower enhancement level for Gadsden. We cannot say that the district court clearly erred in determining the loss amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">Second, Gadsden argues that the district court improperly counted victims and losses from portions of the conspiracy that occurred while he was incarcerated on other charges. We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its application of those facts to justify a sentencing enhancement <em>de novo. United States v. Creel, </em>783 F.3d 1357, 1359 (11th Cir.2015). The base offense level for a defendant involved in a conspiracy is determined on the basis of \u201call reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the [conspiracy] that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction, in preparation for that offense, or in the course of attempting to avoid detection or responsibility for that offense.\u201d USSG \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1)(B) (2013). The Guidelines provide a four-level enhancement for offenses that involved 50 or more victims. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2B1.1(b)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-7\">\u201cA conspirator\u2019s participation in a conspiracy is presumed to continue until all activity related to the conspiracy ceases.\u201d <em>United States v. Odom, </em>252 F.3d 1289, 1299 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cSince conspiracy is a continuing offense, a defendant who has joined a conspiracy continues to violate the law through every moment of [the conspiracy\u2019s] existence, and he becomes responsible for the acts of his co-conspirators in pursuit of their common plot.\u201d <em>Smith v. United States, </em>568 U.S. -, -, 133 S.Ct. 714, 719, 184 L.Ed.2d 570 (2013) (alteration in original) (quotation and citations omitted). A defendant may avoid such liability only by withdrawing from the conspiracy, which requires him to prove that he: (1) took affirmative acts inconsistent with the object of the conspiracy, and (2) either communicated those acts or his desire to withdraw to his co-conspirators, or disclosed the scheme to law enforcement, <em>Odom, </em>252 F.3d at 1299. \u201cMere cessation of participation is not sufficient to establish withdrawal.\u201d <em>United States v. Arias, </em>431 F.3d 1327, 1341 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-13\">The district court did not clearly err by counting the losses and victims from portions of the conspiracy that occurred while Gadsden was incarcerated. Gadsden presented no evidence showing that he withdrew from the conspiracy while incarcerated. \u2022 To the extent he argues that his imprisonment was tantamount to withdrawal, we have rejected this argument. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>940 F.2d 1413, 1427 (11th Cir.1991). Thus, Gadsden\u2019s continued participation in the conspiracy was presumed. <em>See Odom, </em>252 F.3d at 1299. Because his co-conspirators\u2019 perpetuation of the scheme was reasonably foreseeable, Gadsden remained responsible for the associated losses and victims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1003-14\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-15\">Third, Gadsden argues that he was not a leader or organizer of the conspiracy. Whether a defendant had a leadership role <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>is a finding of fact that we review for clear error. <em>Barrington, </em>648 F.3d at 1200. The Guidelines provide a four-level enhancement \u201c[i]f the defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3B1.1(a) (2013). Courts should consider the following factors when weighing the defendant\u2019s role:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-4\">the exercise of decision making authority, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.1, cmt. n. 4 (2013). All these factors need not be present \u2014 they \u201care merely considerations for the sentencing judge,\u201d though \u201cthe exercise of some authority in the organization\u201d is required. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>584 F.3d 1022, 1026 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation omitted). Recruiting and directing conspirators generally shows the necessary degree of leadership. <em>See United States v. Caraballo, </em>595 F.3d 1214, 1231-32 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-6\">The district court did not clearly err in concluding that Gadsden was a leader or organizer of the conspiracy. All of the 35 to 40 participants interviewed by Agent Greenlee identified Gadsden or his brother, David, as being involved in the conspiracy. Gadsden recruited and directed at least five people in furtherance of the conspiracy, one of whom made ten trips around Alabama on his behalf. Gadsden also arranged truck rentals to pick up fraudulently purchased merchandise, directed people who he said \u201cworked for him\u201d to buy certain goods for resale to regular customers, and used \u201crecruiters\u201d to find more participants. The district court did not clearly err by imposing a leadership-role enhancement on Gadsden.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1004-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-10\">Finally, Gadsden argues that the conspiracy could not have involved sophisticated means because the process of passing bad checks is inherently simple. We review a district court\u2019s finding that the defendant used sophisticated means for clear error. <em>Barrington, </em>648 F.3d at 1199. The Guidelines provide a two-level enhancement for offenses involving sophisticated means. USSG \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(10) (Nov. 2013). \u201cSophisticated means\u201d are defined as \u201cespecially complex or especially intricate offense conduct pertaining to the execution or concealment of an offense,\u201d which may include actions like hiding assets or transactions via fictitious entities, corporate shells, or offshore accounts. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2B1.1, cmt. n. 9(B). This enhancement applies when the defendant engaged in \u201crepetitive, coordinated conduct designed to allow him to execute his fraud and evade detection.\u201d <em>United States v. Bane, </em>720 F.3d 818, 827 (11th Cir.2013). Each action during the conspiracy need not be sophisticated; it is enough for the scheme to be sophisticated in its totality. <em>United States v. Ghertler, </em>605 F.3d 1256, 1267 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-11\">The district court did not clearly err in concluding that the conspiracy involved sophisticated means. The conspiracy lasted for several years, involved around 200 participants, and targeted businesses in four states. The district court identified other factors that suggested sophistication: (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>Gadsden s use of third parties to open checking accounts, which effectively concealed his identity; (2) the highly specific nature of the products Gadsden fraudulently purchased for his customers; (3) the technique Gadsden used to telephonically \u201cpush[] through\u201d bad checks with check-processing companies if they were initially refused by a merchant; and (4) the large number of individual transactions involved. Although Gadsden argues that the scheme could not have been sophisticated given that it did not involve fictitious entities, corporate shells, or offshore accounts, these are not the only types of transactions that may be sophisticated. <em>See Ghertler, </em>605 F.3d at 1268 (upholding a sophisticated-means enhancement even though the defendant \u201csometimes made little or no effort to conceal either the fact of his fraud or his identity\u201d). The totality of the-conspiracy was sufficiently sophisticated to support the district court\u2019s finding here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1002-11\">. Agent Greenlee confirmed the reliability of this analysis by interviewing 35 to 40 of the nearly 200 suspected members of the conspiracy and investigating their methods.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1003-8\">. Gadsden also argues that, even if he failed to withdraw, he should not have been responsible for smaller, separate check fraud conspiracies that \"may\u201d have been operating within the larger conspiracy he helped create. But this theory is speculative and unsupported \u2014 he has presented no evidence that any smaller conspiracies actually existed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1004-7\">. Gadsden also argues that he could not have been a leader of the conspiracy because it continued in his absence while he was incarcerated. We have already rejected Gadsden\u2019s argument that he is absolved of responsibility for the conspiracy during his periods of incarceration. <em>See supra </em>Part II.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
