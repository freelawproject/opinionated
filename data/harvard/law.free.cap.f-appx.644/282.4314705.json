The district court construed the claims raised as seeking 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 relief .and thus construed the petition as an unauthorized successive \u00a7 2255 motion over which it lacked jurisdiction. Reviewing the district court\u2019s legal determinations de novo and its factual findings for clear error, we affirm. <em>See Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 425 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-20\">Jurisdiction over Roberson\u2019s habeas petition was proper in any division of the Northern District of Texas, the district of Roberson\u2019s confinement. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 124(a)(2), (3); <em>Lee v. Wetzel, </em>244 F.3d 370, 373 (5th Cir.2001). Roberson argues that he warrants application of the \u00a7 2255 savings clause because the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 renders him actually innocent of his crime of conviction. As Roberson challenges the legality of his sentence, rather than the manner in which it is being executed, the district court did not err in concluding that his claims arise under \u00a7 2255. <em>See Padilla, </em>416 F.3d at 425-26. Similarly, his claim that he is \u201cactually innocent\u201d of the sentence enhancement attacks the manner in which his sentence was initially determined. <em>See Kinder v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number><em>Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 212 (5th Cir.2000). Therefore, he also had to meet the requirements of the savings clause of \u00a7 2255 to raise this claim in a \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>Id. </em>However, because he has not shown that his claims \u201c[are] based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that [he] may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense,\u201d Roberson has not shown that he is entitled to proceed under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b308-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47,5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
