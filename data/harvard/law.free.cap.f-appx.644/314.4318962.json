He has abandoned any challenge to the denial of relief under the CAT by failing to brief that issue adequately. <em>See Thuri v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 788, 793 (5th Cir.2004) (noting that arguments not raised in the petition for review are considered waived); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas Cty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-22\">Generally, we have authority to review only the decision of the BIA but will consider the IJ\u2019s decision if it influenced the determination of the BIA. <em>Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 593 (5th Cir.2007). Because the BIA agreed with the IJ\u2019s findings and conclusions, the IJ\u2019s findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>are renewable. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 903 (5th Cir.2002). We review the determination of an alien\u2019s eligibility for asylum for substantial evidence. <em>Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 339, 344-45 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Bishwakarma asserts that the BIA erred in concluding that his asylum application did not meet the one-year statutory deadline. Regardless of any error, we decline to reverse and remand on this issue because the IJ and the BIA considered the merits of Bishwakarma\u2019s asylum application. Cf<em>. Nakimbugwe v. Gonzales, </em>475 F.3d 281, 284-85 (5th Cir.2007) (reversing and remanding due to timeliness error, where the error resulted in the BIA failing to consider the merits of petitioner\u2019s asylum application).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Bishwakarma also argues that the IJ violated his due process rights by aggressively questioning him during his immigration hearings. We review constitutional claims de novo. <em>See Sattani v. Holder, </em>749 F.3d 368, 370 (5th Cir.2014). As the BIA concluded, the record reveals that the IJ appropriately asked questions in order to fully develop the record. <em>See Calderon-Ontiveros v. INS, </em>809 F.2d 1050, 1052-53 <em>&amp; </em>n. 1 (5th Cir.1986). Moreover, the questions asked by the IJ did not preclude Bishwakarma from presenting further testimony or evidence concerning his claims and did not \u201csubstantially prejudice\u201d him. <em>Id. </em>at 1052; <em>see Wang v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 531, 541 (5th Cir.2009) (rejecting similar due process claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">Bishwakarma further asserts that the BIA erred in affirming the IJ\u2019s findings on his credibility. In making an adverse credibility determination, the IJ noted that Bishwakarma provided testimony that was not only internally inconsistent, but also inconsistent with the documentary evidence, including the affidavit Bishwakarma submitted with his asylum application. The IJ cited to numerous inconsistencies upon which it had relied to reach its decision. The BIA cited these same inconsistencies, noting that the IJ\u2019s analysis was \u201ccogent\u201d and specifically citing (1) Bishwa-karma\u2019s lack of knowledge of the monarchy in Nepal, which was supported by his alleged political party, (2) Bishwakarma\u2019s explanations regarding the date he and his family Were first contacted by the Maoists, his alleged torturers, (3) the dates and circumstances of his family\u2019s abduction by the Maoists, and (4) the dates and circumstances of the murders of his brother and sister. The BIA asserted that these inconsistencies were \u201cmaterial,\u201d noting that Bishwakarma was unable to provide a coherent timeline of abuse. In light of Bishwakarma\u2019s inconsistent and often vague testimony, neither the IJ nor the BIA erred by concluding that Bishwakarma was not a credible witness. <em>See Wang, </em>569 F.3d at 537-38; 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii). Accordingly, substantial evidence supports the denial of his application for asylum. <em>See Wang, </em>569 F.3d at 536-37; <em>Zhang, </em>432 F.3d at 344-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">In his final issue on appeal, Bishwakar-ma asserts that he is entitled to a fair consideration of his request for relief in the form of withholding of removal. An applicant for withholding of removal \u201cmust demonstrate \u2018a clear probability\u2019 of persecution upon return\u201d to his native country. <em>Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 138 (5th Cir.2004); \u201cA clear probability means that it is more likely than not that the applicant\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened by persecution on account of either his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Id.; see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 1208.16(b)(1)(i) (stating that a showing of past persecution gives rise to a rebuttable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>presumption that an applicant\u2019s life or freedom will be threatened in the future). Because this standard is more stringent than the standard required to determine eligibility for asylum \u2014 past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of an enumerated ground \u2014 an applicant who fails to show a well-founded fear, without more, will necessarily fail to show a clear probability of persecution. <em>See Chen v. </em>Gonzales, 470 F.3d 1131, 1135, 1138 (5th Cir.2006). Given the adverse credibility determination and Bishwakar-ma\u2019s failure to satisfy his burden of proof regarding his eligibility for asylum, he, thus, fails to satisfy the higher objective burden required to show eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See id. </em>at 1138.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Accordingly, Bishwakarma\u2019s petition for review is.DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b340-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
