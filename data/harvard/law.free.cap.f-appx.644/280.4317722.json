Logan, federal prisoner # 05951-090, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition, brought pursuant to the \u201csavings clause\u201d in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). In 2005 in the Western District of Wisconsin, Logan pleaded guilty to' being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), and he was sentenced to the 15-ye'ar mandatory minimum required by the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18, U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). In his current challenge to his sentence in his \u00a7 2241 petition, Logan argued that because Wisconsin repeater misdemeanors, such as his, no longer qualify as violent felonies, the sentencing court erred in sentencing him under the ACCA, and he should be resentenced to the 10-year statutory minimum under \u00a7 922(g)(1) without the ACCA enhancement. The district court determined that Logan had not met the criteria for proceeding under the savings clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-17\">A certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) is not required to appeal the denial of a federal prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 425 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, Logan\u2019s motion for a COA is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-18\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s legal conclusions. <em>Id. </em>\u201cSection 2255 provides the primary means of collaterally attacking a federal sentence, and is the appropriate remedy for errors that occurred at or prior to the sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 425-26 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Under the \u201csavings clause\u201d of \u00a7 2255, a federal prisoner may challenge the legality of his detention in a \u00a7 2241 petition only if he shows that remedy under \u00a7 2255 would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 2255(e); <em>Padilla, </em>416 F.3d at 426. To do so, he must show that: (1) his claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that he may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense; and (2) his claim was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in his trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001); <em>see Garland v. Roy, </em>615 F.3d 391, 394 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-19\">A claim, such as Logan\u2019s, that challenges only the validity of his sentence fails to establish that he was convicted of a nonexistent offense, as required by the first prong of <em>Reyes-Requena. See Padilla, </em>416 F.3d at 426-27 (holding that a petitioner\u2019s claim that his terms of imprisonment exceeded the statutory maximum for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>charged offense did not fulfill the first prong of Reyes-Requena); <em>see also Kinder v. Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 213-14 (5th Cir.2000) (holding that a claim that the \u00a7 2241 petitioner was actually innocent of being a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 is not a claim that the petitioner is actually innocent of the crime of conviction); <em>In re Bradford, </em>660 F.3d 226, 230 (5th Cir.2011) (same); <em>Preston v. Ask-Carlson, </em>583 Fed.Appx. 462, 463 (5th Cir.2014) (\u201c[C]laims relating to sentencing determinations do not fall within the savings clause and are not cognizable under \u00a7 2241, even where the petitioner asserts a \u2018miscarriage of justice\u2019 or actual innocence relating to the alleged sentencing errors.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">In one sentence, Logan cites to <em>Persaud v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1023, 188 L.Ed.2d 117 (2014), for the proposition that his \u201cclaim of unconstitutional sentencing is properly raised in a section 2241 petition.\u201d In <em>Persaud, </em>the Supreme Court entered a grant, vacate, and remand (GVR) order for reconsideration by the Fourth Circuit in light of the Solicitor General\u2019s brief. 134 S.Ct. at 1023. A GVR is not a substantive decision on the merits and thus does not satisfy <em>Reyes-</em>Requena\u2019s requirement of a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision. <em>Kenemore v. Roy, </em>690 F.3d 639, 640-43 (5th Cir.2012). In the absence of an en banc decision by this court or an intervening Supreme Court decision overruling circuit precedent holding that a \u00a7 2241 petition cannot be used to challenge solely the validity of a federal sentence, this court is bound by its own precedent. <em>See United States v. Traxler, </em>764 F.3d 486, 489 (5th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Logan\u2019s motion for release on bail pending this appeal is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b306-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
