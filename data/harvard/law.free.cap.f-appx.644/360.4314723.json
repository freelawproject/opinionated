California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Day has not filed a response. We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeals present no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEALS ARE DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th C\u00ede. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-21\">However, the judgment contains a clerical error. Day was convicted of conspiring to commit mail and wire fraud, and the written judgment reflects that he was convicted of conspiring to commit mail and wire fraud affecting a financial institution. We therefore REMAND to the district court for correction of this clerical error. <em>See </em>Fed,R.Crim.P. 36.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b386-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
