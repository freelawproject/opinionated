Pau-lino was originally sentenced to the statutory mandatory minimum of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment after a conviction for conspiracy to import 100 kilograms or more of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952(a), 960(b)(2)(G), and 963. On appeal, he argues that he is eligible for a reduction because: (1) Amendment 782 of the Sentencing Guidelines applies to him; and (2) the district court erred in finding that the government had not made a motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) authorizing the court to reduce his sentence below the statutory mandatory minimum. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-17\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the Sentencing Guidelines and the scope of its authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and review for clear error the underlying factual findings. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>587 F.3d 1300, 1303 (11th Cir.2009). Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may reduce the prison sentence of a \u201cdefendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission!;.]\u2019\u2019 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(1). \u201cThe purpose of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is to give a defendant the benefit of a retroactively applicable amendment to the guidelines ... But [a defendant] is not to receive a lower sentence than he would have received if the amendment had been in effect at the time of his sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Glover, </em>686 F.3d 1203, 1206 (11th Cir.2012); <em>see also United States v. Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d 535, 542 (11th Cir.2013) (\u201cSection 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a sentence reduction if a guidelines amendment does not have the effect of reducing the defendant\u2019s sentence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-19\">The grounds upon which a district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) are narrow. <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 376 (11th Cir.2012). For a defendant to be eligible for such a reduction, the Sentencing Commission must have amended the guideline at issue, that amendment must have lowered the defendant\u2019s applicable sentencing range, and the amendment must also be listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(d). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>\u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l) &amp; comment. (n.l(A)). The applicable guideline range is a defendant\u2019s guideline range before any departures or variances. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B.10 comment. (n.l(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">Amendment 782 may serve, when applicable, as the basis for a sentence reduction. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(d). Effective November 1, 2014, Amendment 782 provides a two-level reduction in base offense levels for most drug quantities listed in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). U.S.S.GApp. C, amend. 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">A statutory mandatory minimum term of five years\u2019 imprisonment exists for -defendants convicted of crimes under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 952(a). 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(a), (b)(2). A district court can impose a sentence below a statutory minimum after the government authorizes it via a \u00a7 3553(e) substantial assistance motion. <em>Melendez v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 120, 125-30, 116 S.Ct. 2057, 135 L.Ed.2d 427 (1996). However, a \u00a7 5K1.1 substantial assistance motion cannot, on its own, permit a departure below a statutory minimum. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">In this case, the district court did not err in denying his \u00a7 3582 motion for a reduction in sentence. As the record shows, the district court did not clearly err in its factual finding that the government did not make a \u00a7 3553(e) motion authorizing a departure below the statutory mandatory minimum. The record supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that the motion was made only pursuant to \u00a7 5K1.1, authorizing only a departure below the Guidelines minimum; indeed, the record reflects that neither the government nor the sentencing court mentioned \u00a7 3553(e) during sentencing, but they did specifically refer to \u00a7 5K1.1. Thus, even if Amendment 782 had been in effect at the time of Paulino\u2019s sentencing and even if it lowered his applicable guideline range, the lowest sentence available was the one he received <em>after </em>the \u00a7 5K1.1 departure \u2014 60 months. Because a defendant cannot receive a lower sentence than he would have received if the amendment had been in effect at the time of the original sentencing, the district court did not err in concluding that no further reduction was available.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
