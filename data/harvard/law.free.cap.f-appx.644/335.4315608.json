He further asserts that his illegal reentry did not pose a danger to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">The within-guidelines sentence is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.2008). After considering Lopez-Salgado\u2019s arguments, the district court determined that a sentence within the advisory guidelines range was appropriate based on Lopez-Salgado\u2019s repeated removals from, and reentries into, this country. Lopez-Salgado\u2019s benign motive for returning to this country is insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008). His argument regarding the staleness of his prior alien transportation conviction is likewise insufficient. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>660 F.3d 231, 234-35 (5th Cir.2011). Further, we have rejected the argument that \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s purported lack of an empirical basis necessarily renders a sentence under it unreasonable, <em>see United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009), and that \u00a7 2L1.2 overstates the seriousness of the offense. <em>See United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 212 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-14\">Lopez-Salgado\u2019s argument that the sentence is greater than necessary to meet the goals of \u00a7 3553(a) amounts to a disagreement with the district court\u2019s balancing of the sentencing factors, and we will not reweigh those factors. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51-52, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). He has failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b362-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
