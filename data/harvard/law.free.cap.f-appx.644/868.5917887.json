Jimenez filed this suit in the District Court for the Southern District of Florida, requesting removal of a state court child custody dispute between him and his ex-wife, Karen Wizel. Jimenez alleged (1) that the state court violated his First Amendment right to freely exercise his religion and his Fourteenth Amendment liberty interest in parenting his two children when it ordered he could only have supervised visitation based on Jimenez\u2019s religious practices and beliefs; and (2) the state court violated his due process rights by failing to give him an opportunity to contest the allegations against him or adequate notice of the hearing. The district court initially dismissed his complaint for failure to state a claim but provided Jimenez with an opportunity to amend. In his amended complaint, Jimenez more specifically raised claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985, alleging that various parties to the state custody action, as well as Wizel, conspired to violate these same constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-14\">The district court determined it lacked jurisdiction over the state court proceedings because child custody disputes are not within the federal courts\u2019 original jurisdiction, and it dismissed the remainder of Jimenez\u2019s amended complaint for failure to state a claim. On appeal, Jimenez argues that the district court erred in both determinations. After a thorough review of Jimenez\u2019s amended complaint and brief, we conclude that the district court committed no reversible error. Therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b883-16\">At every stage in the proceeding, we review de novo the jurisdiction of not only our court but also the district court. <em>See Castleberry v. Goldome Credit Corp., </em>408 F.3d 773, 779-80 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-17\">Those matters over which the federal courts have original jurisdiction may be removed from state court to federal court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(a). The federal courts have original subject matter jurisdiction over federal questions. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. In addition, those matters regarding enforcement of constitutional rights related to equality may properly be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>removed to federal court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443. The Supreme Court has interpreted \u00a7 1443 to apply \u201conly to rights that are granted in terms of [racial] equality and not to the whole gamut of constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Georgia v. Rachel, </em>384 U.S. 780, 792, 86 S.Ct. 1783, 1790, 16 L.Ed.2d 925 (1966); <em>accord Alabama v. Conley, </em>245 F.3d 1292, 1295 (11th Cir.2001) (per curiam), These rights are distinguishable from those vindicated by the due process clause and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, which \u201cconfer equal rights in the sense ... of bestowing them upon all.\u201d <em>Rachel, </em>384 U.S. at 792, 86 S.Ct. at 1790 (internal quotation marks omitted). <em>Rachel </em>set out a two-pronged test to determine whether removal is proper under \u00a7 1443(1): \u201cFirst, the petitioner must show that the right upon which the petitioner relies arises under a federal law providing for specific civil rights stated in terms of racial equality. Second, the petitioner must show that he has been denied or cannot enforce that right in the state courts.\u201d <em>See Conley, </em>245 F.3d at 1295 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">Here, Jimenez sought to remove to federal court a child custody dispute still pending in Florida state court, citing, <em>inter alia, </em>to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331, 1441, and 1443 as the basis for federal subject matter jurisdiction. The district court held it lacked jurisdiction to review the state court action. We hold that the district court was correct in ruling that removal of the child custody dispute was improper under \u00a7\u00a7 1441 or 1443.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">The child custody dispute is not a matter. arising under the original jurisdiction of the federal courts because it is not an action \u201carising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. Though Jimenez asserts that he is not seeking modification of a child custody decree, the violations he alleges stem in whole from the ongoing state court\u2019s adjudication of the dispute between him and his wife regarding the forthcoming custody arrangement. Therefore, removal under \u00a7 1441 would be improper. <em>See also Ankenbrandt v. Richards, </em>504 U.S. 689, 703-04, 112 S.Ct. 2206, 2215, 119 L.Ed.2d 468 (1992) (holding that the domestic relations exception to diversity jurisdiction divests federal courts of jurisdiction to review child custody orders under \u00a7 1332, as well).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">Further, the state court case that Jimenez wishes to remove to federal court does not implicate equality-based rights cognizable under \u00a7 1443. It is not clear whether Jimenez sought to remove under \u00a7 1443(1) or \u00a7 1443(2), but removal is improper under either provision. For purposes of \u00a7 1443(1), Jimenez only alleged violations of his rights to due process, free exercise of religion, and Fourteenth Amendment liberty interest as a parent, which are \u201cbroad constitutional guarantee[s] of general application,\u201d rather than rights implicating racial equality.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Rachel, </em>384 U.S. at 792, 86 S.Ct. at 1790. Thus, he fails to satisfy the first prong of <em>Rachel. See Conley, </em>245 F.3d at 1295-96. Separately, removal under \u00a7 1443(2) would be improper because Jimenez is not a federal officer or agent. <em>See City of Greenwood v. Peacock, </em>384 U.S. 808, 823-24, 86 S.Ct 1800, 1809-10, 16 L.Ed.2d 944 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"AdIo\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, we conclude the district court did not err in concluding it lacked jurisdiction over the pending state court child custody dispute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Separately, we agree that the district court had jurisdiction over those claims Jimenez raised under \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985, because these are federal statutes providing federal question jurisdiction. <em>See, e.g., Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, </em>429 U.S. 274, 279, 97 S.Ct. 568, 572, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">We next determine whether Jimenez properly stated a claim for relief under either federal cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u201cstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1974, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). \u201c[Njaked assertions devoid of further factual enhancement\u201d or \u201c[tjhread-bare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conelusory statements, do not suffice.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted and alteration adopted). In reviewing whether a complaint meets the pleading requirements, \u201c[p]ro se pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-9\">We review de novo a dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, \u201caccepting the allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Leib v. Hillsborough Cty. Pub. Transp. Comm\u2019n, </em>558 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b885-11\">In his amended complaint, Jimenez seeks to bring a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against several actors: Wizel, the mother of his children; Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF); DCF investigator Thereza Hernandez; DCF case coordinator Melyssa Lopez; attorneys Yvette B. Beyes Miller, Ana C. Morales, Margarita Arango Moore, and Sabrina Salomon; Reyes <em>&amp; </em>Arango Moore, P.L. (R &amp; AM) and the Legal Defense Firm of South Dade, P.L. (LDF); Vanessa L. Archer; Archer Psychological Services P.A. (APS); guardian ad litem Anastacia Garcia; and the Law Office of Anastasia M. Garcia, P.A. (LOAG) (collectively, the Defendants). He alleges that the Defendants violated his First Amendment rights, Fourteenth Amendment due process rights, and other unidentified federal rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-14\">To state a claim for relief under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must allege that an act or omission committed by a person acting under color of state law deprived him of a right, privilege, or immunity secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States. <em>See Hale v. Tallapoosa Cty., </em>50 F.3d 1579, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>1582 (11th Cir.1995). A person acts under color of law when he or she is \u201cacting with power possessed by virtue of the defendant\u2019s employment with the state.\u201d <em>See Edwards v. Wallace Cmty. Coll., </em>49 F.3d 1517, 1522 (11th Cir.1995). Although state employment is \u201cgenerally sufficient\u201d to make a person a state actor, \u201c[n]ot all actions by state employees are acts under color of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1523. A private party may be held liable as a state actor in only three circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-4\">(1) the State has coerced or at least significantly encouraged the action alleged to violate the Constitution (\u201cState compulsion test\u201d); (2) the private parties performed a public function that was traditionally the exclusive prerogative of the State (\u201cpublic function test\u201d); or (3) the State had so far insinuated itself into a position of interdependence with the private parties that it was a joint participant in the enterprise (\u201cnexus/joint action test\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b886-5\"><em>See Rayburn ex rel. Rayburn v. Hogue, </em>241 F.3d 1341, 1347 (11th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted and alteration adopted).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">The district court did not err in dismissing Jimenez\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim against Wizel, Reyes Miller, Morales, Arango Moore, Sa-lomon, Archer, Garcia, LDF, R &amp; AM, LOAG, and APS because they are private parties, and Jimenez did not properly plead any allegations that the circumstances satisfy one of the three tests to transform them into state actors. <em>See id.; see also Higdon v. Smith, </em>565 Fed.Appx, 791, 793 (11th Cir.2014) (per curiam) (explaining that guardian ad litem was not a state actor under any of the three tests set forth in <em>Rayburn). </em>In addition, the district court did not err in ruling that Jimenez failed to state a claim against DCF. If DCF is a state agency, then it is entitled to sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment. <em>See Fouche v. Jekyll </em>Is<em>land-State Park Auth., </em>713 F.2d 1518, 1520 (11th Cir.1983). Even if it is not a state agency, though, Jimenez\u2019s claim still fails because the only allegation he raised was that DCF is liable for the actions of its agents, and \u201c[rjespondeat superior or vicarious liability will not attach under \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>See City of Canton v. Harris, </em>489 U.S. 378, 385, 109 S.Ct. 1197, 1203, 103 L.Ed.2d 412 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">Lastly, Jimenez failed to state a claim against Hernandez and Lopez. Accepting the facts in the light most favorable to Jimenez, Hernandez and Lopez may be considered state actors by virtue of their alleged employment at DCF. Jimenez argues that Hernandez and Lopez violated his parental right to make decisions pertaining to \u201cthe care, custody, and control\u201d of his children, see <em>Troxel v. Granville, </em>530 U.S. 57, 66, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 2060, 147 L.Ed.2d 49 (2000) (plurality opinion), without due process when they interviewed his minor children without receiving his consent or providing him notice, and then gave a copy of the resulting report to Wizel\u2019s attorneys without providing him an opportunity to object to any conclusions in the report.- Even accepting these allegations as true, Jimenez has not stated a plausible claim for relief under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-9\">There are instances in which the First Amendment\u2019s freedom of religion intersects with the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process protections of parental rights, and a parent\u2019s interest subsequently sounds under both the First and Fourteenth Amendments. <em>See Prince v. Massachusetts, </em>321 U.S. 158, 164-66, 64 S.Ct. 438, 441-42, 88 L.Ed. 645 (1944). However, the fact that religious convictions underpin a parent\u2019s interest in raising his children does not insulate him from some governmental interference in the family relationship. <em>See id. </em>at 166, 64 S.Ct. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>442; <em>Foy v. Holston, </em>94 F.3d 1528, 1536 (11th Cir.1996). The constitutional guarantee to due process requires that a parent receive \u201ctimely notice, in advance of a hearing in which parents\u2019 rights to custody are at stake.\u201d <em>Dykes v. Hosemann, </em>743 F.2d 1488, 1494 (11th Cir.1984). The plaintiff-parent must adequately allege that his constitutional right was deprived without adequate process. <em>See, e.g., Novak v. Cobb Cty.-Kennestone Hosp. Auth., </em>849 F.Supp. 1559, 1567 (N.D.Ga.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">Here, Jimenez did not properly allege that the relevant state actors denied him adequate process. Although Jimenez alleges that interviewing the minor children without his consent or notice is a deprivation of due process, we disagree. The alleged interview arose in the middle of an ongoing child custody dispute, amidst allegations that Jimenez was mistreating his children, and Jimenez failed to plead any connection between the interview and the purported deprivation of his constitutional parental rights. \u25a0 Further, the alleged provision to Wizel\u2019s attorneys of a copy of a report generated from that interview, without first allowing Jimenez to preemptively \u201ccorrect\u201d it, is not a deprivation of due process. In the absence of additional, plausible, factual allegations tying a lack of process to the alleged deprivation of a constitutional right, Jimenez\u2019s complaint fails to assert a claim against Hernandez and Lopez under \u00a7 1983. Therefore, we affirm the order of the district court as to Jimenez\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">Jimenez also alleges that the Defendants conspired to violate his civil rights and seeks relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(2), (3). We address each claim in turn. Section 1985(2) provides a cause of action for two types of conspiracies: \u201c[T]he first four clauses of [\u00a7] 1985(2) refer to conspiracies that are designed to obstruct the course of justice in any court of the United States\u201d while \u201cthe last two clauses of [\u00a7] 1985(2) refer to conspiracies designed to deny or interfere with equal protection rights.\u201d <em>See Bradt v. Smith, </em>634 F.2d 796, 801 (5th Cir. Unit A Jan.1981) (internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> To state a claim under \u00a7 1985(2), then, the plaintiff must either \u201cshow a nexus between the alleged conspiracy and a proceeding in federal court\u201d or \u201cshow a racial or otherwise class-based discriminatory animus.\u201d <em>Id.; cf. Kush v. Rutledge, </em>460 U.S. 719, 726, 103 S.Ct. 1483, 1488, 75 L.Ed.2d 413 (1983) (no requirement to show class-based animus when plaintiff alleges a violation of the first part of \u00a7 1985(2)). Irrespective of the type of conspiracy alleged, the plaintiff must provide sufficient allegations to make plausible that there was a \u201cmeeting of the minds between two or more persons to accomplish [the] common and unlawful plan.\u201d <em>See McAndrew v. Lockheed Martin Corp., </em>206 F.3d 1031, 1036 (11th Cir.2000) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-12\">The district court concluded that Jimenez failed to state a claim under \u00a7 1985(2) because he provided insufficient allegations that any conspiracy that occurred was premised on class-based animus. However, in so ruling, the district court misunderstood claims under \u00a7 1985(2) to always require evidence of class-based animus. Contrary to the district court\u2019s reading, Jimenez\u2019s complaint attempts to allege <em>both </em>types of \u00a7 1985(2) conspiracies, only one of which requires sufficient allegations of class-based ani<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>mus. We conclude that the district court\u2019s error was harmless, however, because Jimenez failed to state a claim premised on either type of conspiracy recognized under \u00a7 1985(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">\u2022 Jimenez\u2019s complaint first alleges that Reyes and Morales conspired with Wizel to violate Jimenez\u2019s civil rights by procuring an emergency hearing based on an \u201cinaccurate and misleading document[]\u201d and without providing Jimenez proper notice, because notice was sent to the wrong address. This type of allegation sounds more in the first type of conspiracy recognized under \u00a7 1985(2) because it involves a judicial proceeding. However, the type of proceeding allegedly involved was one in <em>state court, </em>not federal court; this is not an allegation that properly forms a basis for relief under \u00a7 1985(2). <em>See Bradt, </em>634 F.2d at 800 (describing the first type of conspiracy recognized under \u00a7 1985(2) as one pertaining to obstructions of justice in <em>federal </em>courts); <em>McAndrew, </em>206 F.3d at 1035 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">Separately, Jimenez alleges that several different actors conspired to violate his civil rights and discriminated against him on the basis of his Christian faith. This allegation sounds under the second half of \u00a7 1986(2). However, even assuming that discrimination on the basis of identification with a particular religious group could form the basis of a claim under \u00a7 1985(2), Jimenez\u2019s allegations prove conclusory in nature. For example, his complaint alleges that Dr. Archer conspired with persons unnamed to violate his civil rights by making a false DCF accusation pertaining to the burning of his daughter\u2019s legs with an iron, and that Dr. Archer\u2019s report, upon which the state court relied, falsely determined his religious beliefs to be \u201cfanatical\u201d in nature. Jimenez provides no statements connecting these two allegations, or otherwise indicating that Archer intended to discriminate against Jimenez on the basis of his religion. Moreover, Jimenez provides no statements indicating that the existence of a conspiracy is factually plausible. Rather, Jimenez provides only \u201cnaked assertions devoid of further factual enhancement,\u201d which is not enough. <em>See Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. at 1949 (internal quotation marks omitted and alteration adopted).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-10\">Jimenez also seeks relief under \u00a7 1985(3). To state a claim for relief under \u00a7 1985(3), a plaintiff must allege sufficient facts reflecting</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-11\">(1) a conspiracy, (2) for the purpose of depriving, either directly or indirectly, any person or class of persons of the equal protection of the laws, or of equal privileges and immunities under the laws; and (3) an act in furtherance of the conspiracy, (4) whereby a person is either injured in his person or property or deprived of any right or privilege of a citizen of the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b888-12\"><em>See Childree v. UAP/GA CHEM, Inc., </em>92 F.3d 1140, 1146-47 (11th Cir.1996). For purposes of the second element, the plaintiff must properly plead an allegation that \u201csome racial or perhaps otherwise class-based, invidiously discriminatory animus [lay] behind the conspirators\u2019 action.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1147 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-13\">Although other circuits have recognized that a religious group may serve as a protected class for purposes of the second element of a \u00a7 1985(3) claim,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> this circuit has not done so. However, even assuming that being a member of a particular reli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>gious group provides a basis for a \u00a7 1985(3) claim, Jimenez\u2019s complaint still fails to state a claim because, as noted above, he provides no allegations that any two individuals conspired to deprive him of equal protection of the laws due to his religious beliefs. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Moore, </em>525 F.3d 1033, 1039-40 (11th Cir.2008) (describing basic elements of a conspiracy); <em>see also Childree, </em>92 F.3d at 1146-47 (listing the first two elements of a claim under \u00a7 1985(3) to be evidence of a <em>conspiracy </em>to deprive the plaintiff of equal protection of the law).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-13\">Therefore, the district court did not err in ruling that Jimenez failed to state a claim under \u00a7 1985(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-14\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b889-15\">In light of the foregoing, we affirm the district court\u2019s ruling that Jimenez failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b884-6\">. We have assumed, without ever holding, that \u00a7 1985(3) qualifies as an equal rights statute for purposes of \u00a7 1443(1). <em>See Conley, </em>245 F.3d at 1296. -However, Jimenez has not provided sufficient allegations to make facially plausible that he cannot pursue this claim in state court, thus failing the second part of the <em>Rachel </em>test. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, we need not address today whether \u00a7 1985(3) definitively qualifies as an equal rights statute for purposes of \u00a7 1443(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b885-8\">. To the extent Jimenez seeks injunctive relief from the state court\u2019s order granting the emergency motion suspending time-sharing with his children, we cannot provide such relief. The state judicial proceedings remain ongoing, implicate important state interests in the family, and there remains adequate opportunity for Jimenez to raise his constitutional challenges throughout the ongoing proceedings as well as the state appellate courts. <em>See Middlesex Cty.
