HIGGINSON, Circuit Judge: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b331-22\">Kendall Williams, federal prisoner #30070-034, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce his sentence. In 2007, Williams pleaded guilty to possessing crack cocaine with the intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841; possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking offense, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c); and being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). With a total offense level of 23 and a criminal history score of III, he was sentenced to 71 months for the \u00a7 841 and \u00a7 924(c) charges, with a mandatory-consecutive 60-month term on the \u00a7 924(c) charge. In August 2014, Williams filed the instant pro se \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, seeking a two-level reduction to his offense level based on retroactive Amendment 782 and his post-sentencing rehabilitative efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-23\">The district court\u2019s decision to deny the motion despite Williams\u2019s eligibility for a sentence reduction is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Henderson, </em>636 F.3d 713, 717 (5th Cir.2011). If the record shows that the district court gave due consideration to the motion as a whole and considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, even implicitly, then there is no abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Whitebird, 55 </em>F.3d 1007, 1010 (5th Cir.1995); <em>see also United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 673 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Williams argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion, urging that the denial was based on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence and an incomplete consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. He asserts that a proper assessment of the evidence and factors, including the non-serious nature of his underlying offense, as well as his personal history and characteristics, including his pursuit of educational, vocational, and drug-treatment opportunities while in prison, weighed in favor of awarding a sentencing reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">The district court had before it Williams\u2019s arguments in favor of a sentence reduction; the original and reduced guidelines ranges; Williams\u2019s criminal history, including three prior drug offenses; a synopsis of his post-sentencing conduct, including approximately seventeen disciplinary violations, which infractions included threats of bodily harm; and the Government\u2019s opposition to the requested sentencing reduction, urging that Williams\u2019s early release would pose a threat to public safety. The record thus reflects that the district court appropriately considered Williams\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion as a whole, implicitly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and took into account the danger to the community that might result from a reduction in his term of imprisonment. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 673; <em>see also United States v. Smith, </em>595 F.3d 1322, 1323 (5th Cir.2010). Accordingly, Williams has not demonstrated any abuse of discretion on the district court\u2019s part. <em>See Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d at 1010.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b331-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
