Rios\u2019s motion was based on Amendment 782 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, which lowered the base offense level for most drug offenses. Rios argues that the district court had authority to reduce his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Amendment 782 provides for a two-level reduction in the base offense level for most drug offenses. U.S.S.G.App. C, amend. 782. Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The applicable policy statements, found in \u00a7 1B1.10, state that, while Amendment 782 is retroactively applicable, <em>a </em>reduction in the term of imprisonment is not authorized if the amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B) <em>&amp; </em>(d). In determining a defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range, the court leaves all other guideline application decisions intact. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">The district court did not err in determining Rios was not eligible for a sentence reduction. <em>See United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008) (reviewing' <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusion about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2)). At Rios\u2019s original sentencing, the district court adopted the presentence investigation report\u2019s (PSI) finding that his offense conduct involved 519.2 kilograms of cocaine, and Rios\u2019s factual proffer was consistent with that finding. Also, Rios did not object to that amount in the PSI. See <em>United States v. Davis, </em>587 F.3d 1300, 1303-04 (11th Cir.2009) (affirming the district court\u2019s use of an unobjected-to drug quantity amount in the PSI in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding). That amount of cocaine, even after Amendment 782, still results in the same base offense level of 38, because it is above the 450-kilogram threshold necessary to trigger that base offense level. <em>Compare </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(e)(1) (2006), <em>with </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1) (2014). Thus, because Amendment 782 did not lower Rios\u2019s guideline range, the district court was without authority to reduce his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
