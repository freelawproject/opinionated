Garner\u2019s sentence was enhanced under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), based in pertinent part on his two prior Florida convictions for fleeing or attempting to elude, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935. We affirm Garner\u2019s conviction and vacate Garner\u2019s sentence and remand for resen-tencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-22\">Garner first challenges the constitutionality of his conviction under section 922(g)(1). Garner contends that 18 U.S.C. 922(g)(1) is facially unconstitutional because regulation of the mere possession of a gun exceeds Congress\u2019s powers under the Commerce Clause. Gamer also argues that section 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional as applied to him because his <em>intrastate </em>possession of a gun manufactured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>out-of-state had no substantial effect on <em>interstate </em>commerce. As Garner concedes, however, his arguments are foreclosed squarely by this Court\u2019s binding precedent. <em>See, e.g,, United States v. McAllister, </em>77 F.3d 387, 390 (11th Cir.1996). Thus, we affirm Garner\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">About his sentence, Garner argues\u2014 based on the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015) \u2014 that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence under the ACCA. Because Gamer raised no objection to the constitutionality of the ACCA\u2019s residual clause in the district court, we review only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d 1319, 1320 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">Under the law of the circuit in existence when Garner was sentenced, a felony conviction under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(2) qualified as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause. <em>See United States v. Petite, </em>703 F.3d 1290, 1301 (11th Cir.2013). In <em>Johnson, </em>however, the Supreme Court struck down, as unconstitutionally vague, the residual clause of the ACCA. 135 S.Ct. at 2557-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">Thus, after <em>Johnson, </em>Garner\u2019s convictions for fleeing or attempting to elude may serve as predicate offenses under the ACCA only if they qualify as violent felonies under a different ACCA provision. But Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935 does not have \u201cas an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical fore 3 against the person of another,\u201d are not \u201cburglary, arson, or extortion,\u201d and does not involve the \u201cuse of explosives.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i)-(ii); <em>see also Sykes v. United States, </em>564 U.S. 1, 131 S.Ct. 2267, 2273, 180 L.Ed.2d 60 (2011) (concluding, under the categorical approach, that an Indiana conviction for \u201c[r]esisting law enforcement through felonious vehicle flight\u201d failed to qualify under either the ACCA\u2019s elements clause or enumerated offenses clause), <em>overruled on other grounds hy Johnson, </em>135 S.Ct. at 2551; <em>Petite, </em>703 F.3d at 1293.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-12\">We conclude \u2014 and the government concedes \u2014 that Garner\u2019s Florida convictions for fleeing or attempting to elude no longer qualify as violent- felonies under the ACCA. As a result, Garner\u2019s remaining two qualifying predicate convictions for serious drug offenses are insufficient to sustain Garner\u2019s ACCA status. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) (requiring three predicate convictions for a violent felony or serious drug offense to trigger ACCA enhancement).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-13\">In the light of our decision in <em>United States v. Jones, </em>743 F.3d 826 (11th Cir.2014), and in the light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Johnson, </em>the district court\u2019s application of an ACCA enhancement to Garner\u2019s sentence constituted plain error. We vacate Garner\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b896-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b895-10\"> On appeal, Gamer raises two other challenges to his sentence, neither of which demonstrates reversible error. First, Gamer contends \u2014 based on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Johnson </em>\u2014 that the residual clause of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.2(a)(2) must be struck down' as unconstitutionally vague. Without the residual clause, Garner argues that his conviction for fleeing or attempting to elude constitutes no \"crime of violence\u201d under section 4B 1.2(a)(2) and, thus, he no longer qualifies as a career offender under the guidelines. We reject this argument as foreclosed by this Court\u2019s precedent. <em>See United States v. Matchett, </em>802 F.3d 1185, 1194 (11th Cir.2015) (concluding that the vagueness doctrine does not apply to the advisory sentencing guidelines).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-15\">We also reject Garner\u2019s argument that the district court erred in applying a four-level enhancement under section 2K2.1(b)(6)(B). The undisputed evidence demonstrates that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>Garner was in possession of a gun that was found in close proximity to sealed baggies of marijuana and other drug paraphernalia. Thus, the preponderance of the evidence supports a finding that Garner was involved in the sale of marijuana and that the gun in Garner\u2019s possession had the potential to facilitate his drug sales. For background see <em>United States v. Carillo-Ayala, </em>713 F.3d 82, 92 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
