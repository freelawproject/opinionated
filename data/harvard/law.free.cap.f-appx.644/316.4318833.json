Angulo challenges the $160,000 forfeiture order, arguing that the district court erred by rejecting his argument that the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2S1.3(b)(3) safe harbor provision applied and by concluding that the forfeiture did not violate the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-22\">We review the district court\u2019s interpretation or application of the Guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>See United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). Under \u00a7 2S1.3(b)(3), the offense level will be decreased to six if: (1) \u201csubsection (a)(2) applies and subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2) do not apply;\u201d (2) Angulo \u201cdid not act with reckless disregard of the source of the funds;\u201d (3) \u201cthe funds were the proceeds of lawful activity; and\u201d (4) \u201cthe funds were to be used for a lawful purpose.\u201d Angulo\u2019s total offense level was 15, which included a two-level increase pursuant to \u00a7 2S1.3(b)(1)(B) because the offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>involved bulk cash smuggling. The application of the \u00a7 2S1.3(b)(l)(B) enhancement means that the safe harbor provision cannot apply. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2Sl.3(b)(3)(A). As An-gulo does not challenge the application of the \u00a7 2S1.3(b)(l)(B) enhancement, he cannot demonstrate that the district court erred in denying his request for a reduction under \u00a7 2S1.3(b)(3). <em>See Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d at 764; <em>United States v. Scroggins, </em>599 F.3d 433, 446-47 (5th Cir.2010) (concluding that the failure to brief an argument sufficiently results in its waiver).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">\u201c[A] punitive forfeiture violates the Ex'cessive Fines Clause if it is grossly disproportional to the gravity of a defendant\u2019s offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Bajakajian, </em>524 U.S. 321, 334, 118 S.Ct. 2028, 141 L.Ed.2d 314 (1998). Among the factors that the Court considered in <em>Bajakajian </em>in making the proportionality determination were: (a) the essence of the defendant\u2019s crime and its relationship to other criminal activity; (b) whether the defendant was within the class of people for whom the statute of conviction was principally designed; (c) the maximum sentence, including the f\u00edne that could have been imposed; and (d) the nature of the harm resulting from the defendant\u2019s conduct. <em>See id. </em>at 337-39, 118 S.Ct. 2028; <em>see also United States v. Wallace, </em>389 F.3d 483, 485-88 (5th Cir.2004). We review de novo the district court\u2019s proportionality determination and for clear error the district court\u2019s factual findings. <em>Bajakajian, </em>524 U.S. at 336-37 &amp; n. 10, 118 S.Ct. 2028; <em>United States v. Wyly, </em>193 F.3d 289, 303 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">With respect to the first <em>Bajakajian </em>factor, the essence of Angulo\u2019s crime was bulk cash smuggling in violation of \u00a7 5332(a), not a reporting offense like the defendant in <em>Bajakajian, </em>and the $160,000 at issue was the instrumentality of his crime. <em>See </em>USA PATRIOT Act, Pub. L. No. 10756, \u00a7 371(a)(6), 115 Stat. 272 (2001). Congress has stated that cash smuggling is related to other criminal activity, as it \u201cis one of the most reliable warning signs of drug trafficking, terrorism, money laundering, racketeering, tax evasion and similar crimes.\u201d PATRIOT ACT \u00a7 371(a)(3), 115 Stat. 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">As to the second <em>Bajakajian </em>factor, the district court found that Angulo was within the class of individuals targeted by the statute. Emphasizing the manner of An-gulo\u2019s transportation of the money, the district court stated that Angulo fit the profile of a bulk cash courier. The district court discounted Angulo\u2019s assertion that the money was his life savings which he withdrew over time, noting that the series of $100 bills found dated back only to 1996; that Angulo\u2019s claim of savings was somewhat fantastic given that he claimed from seven to nine dependents on his tax returns; and the fact that Angulo had a serious drinking problem. Other testimony from the forfeiture hearing supported the district courts conclusion that the money was not Angulo\u2019s life savings. An-gulo had a negative monthly, cash flow and owed medical, child support, and credit card debts. Further, in contravention of his claim that he withdrew his paychecks after they were deposited, Angulo had two receipts in his possession demonstrating that he had deposited a total of 814,300 in September 2013 and January 2014, but possessed no bank documents indicating the money was subsequently withdrawn. The district court did not clearly err in making the finding that Angulo was within the class of individuals targeted by the statute. <em>See Wyly, </em>193 F.3d at 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">As to the third <em>Bajakajian </em>factor, the maximum statutory fine that could be imposed was $250,000, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5322(a), and the maximum Guidelines fine for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>total offense level of 15 was $40,000, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.2(c)(3) (2014). While the $160,000 forfeited was four times the maximum guidelines fine, the amount forfeited was well within the statutory maximum fine of $250,000. <em>See </em>\u00a7 5E1.2(c)(3); \u00a7 5322(a). We have cited with approval an Eleventh Circuit case which stated that \u201cif the value of the forfeited property is within the range of fines prescribed by Congress, a strong presumption arises that the forfeiture is constitutional.\u201d Wallace, 389 F.3d at 486 (quoting <em>United States v. 817 N.E. 29th Drive, </em>175 F.3d 1304, 1309 (11th Cir.1999)). Angulo has not rebutted this presumption. <em>See id. </em>at 486-88. Finally, as to the fourth <em>Bajakajian </em>factor, the nature of the harm caused by Angulo\u2019s conduct, Congress has emphasized the seriousness of bulk cash smuggling and its relationship to other types of criminal activity such as terrorism, tax evasion, money laundering, and drug trafficking. <em>See </em>PATRIOT ACT \u00a7 371(a)(5), 115 Stat. 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">The district court did not clearly err in its factual findings with respect to the proportionality determination, nor did the district court err in concluding that the forfeiture was not grossly disproportionate. <em>See Bajakajian, </em>524 U.S. at 337 n. 10, 118 S.Ct. 2028; <em>Wyly, </em>193 F.3d at 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b342-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
