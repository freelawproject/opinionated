HIGGINSON, Circuit Judge: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b325-20\">Esperanza Jaimes-Benitez pleaded guilty to illegal reentry after having been previously deported. At the time of this most recent arrest, she was still on supervised release from a prior offense. The district court sentenced her to 70 months in prison for the illegal reentry, and 8 months in prison for the supervised release violation to run consecutively, for a total of 78 months. Jaimes-Benitez appeals, arguing that the district court erred in ordering that the sentences be served consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-21\">Jaimes-Benitez\u2019s assertions of error are conclusory at best \u2014 she does not provide any argument or citation to legal authority in support of her contentions. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(8) (requiring that appellate briefs include, among other things, an argument containing the appellant\u2019s \u201cconten-: tions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which [she] relies\u201d). An appellant must properly brief an issue to preserve it, including relevant facts and a theory on which this court should decide the case. \u201cIt is not enough to merely mention or allude to a legal theory.\u201d <em>United States v. Scroggins, </em>599 F.3d 433, 446 (5th Cir.2010). Mere recitations of law along with an \u201cabrupt assertion\u201d of error do not present an issue for appeal. <em>Brinkmann v. Dall. Cty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Therefore, Jaimes-Benitez has abandoned any challenge to her supervised release violation sentence. <em>See Scroggins, </em>599 F.3d at 446.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-22\">Even if Jaimes-Benitez\u2019s brief was adequate, however, she does not establish any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>error. The district court had the discretion to sentence Jaimes-Benitez to consecutive terms in prison for her illegal reentry and supervised release violations. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a); <em>United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 260 (5th Cir.2009). In fact, the Sentencing Commission recommends consecutive sentences in this scenario. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual Ch. 7, Pt. B, intro, comment. (2015) (\u201cIt is the policy of the Commission that the sanction imposed upon revocation is to be served consecutively to any other term of imprisonment imposed for any criminal conduct that is the basis of the revocation.\u201d). Because Jaimes-Benitez\u2019s sentence both fell within the advisory range and was consistent with the Guidelines\u2019 advice regarding consecutive sentences, it is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. Nothing in the record suggests that Jaimes-Benitez can rebut this presumption. <em>See United States v. Candia, </em>454 F.3d 468, 473 (5th Cir.2006). To the extent that Jaimes-Benitez suggests that she received an illegal sentence in excess of the statutory maximum sentence, she is mistaken. She was subject to a statutory maximum twenty-four month prison term for her supervised release violation. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-22\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance, or to dismiss, or for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED as moot. Jaimes-Benitez\u2019s pro se motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED as untimely. <em>Cf. United States v. Wagner, </em>158 F.3d 901, 902-03 (5th Cir.1998) (denying defendant the opportunity to proceed pro se on appeal after defendant\u2019s counsel had filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967)).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b325-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
