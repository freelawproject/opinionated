By moving to proceed IFP, Rivers is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal was not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Our inquiry into a litigant\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves \u2018legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u2019 \u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\">The Supreme Court has prescribed a two-step inquiry for a district court that is considering a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 826, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). The court must first determine whether a prisoner is eligible for a reduction as set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a). <em>Id. </em>If he is eligible, then the district court must \u201cconsider any applicable [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors and determine whether, in its discretion,\u201d any reduction is warranted under the particular facts of the case. <em>Id. </em>at 827, 130 S.Ct. 2683. We review the decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Henderson, </em>636 F.3d 713, 717 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">The district court implicitly found Rivers. eligible for the reduction but determined that a reduction was unwarranted due to the danger posed to the public by his early release. Rivers contends that this was an abuse of discretion, citing his post-sentencing. rehabilitative efforts, including his completion of various prison programs and the absence of any incidents of violence since his incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"A3Z\">The record reflects that the district court considered Rivers\u2019s motion as a whole, gave specific reasons for its denial, and referenced the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Rivers thus cannot show an abuse of discretion on the district court\u2019s part. <em>See Henderson, </em>636 F.3d at 717; <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 673 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010 (5th Cir.1995),</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Rivers has failed to show that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220. Accordingly, his IFP motion is DENIED. Additionally, because this appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b349-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
