(\u201cUAHSF\u201d), for racial discrimination and retaliation under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e, 1981, and 1983, as well as for workers\u2019 compensation retaliation under Alabama Code \u00a7 25-5-11.1. She appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment against her. First, Peterson argues that the district court abused its discretion by rejecting as hearsay portions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>a coworker\u2019s affidavit. Second, she contends that she proved UAHSF\u2019s reasons for firing her were pretexts for racial discrimination. Third, she claims that she showed a causal connection between her protected activity and her termination, and thus she presented a prima facie case of retaliation. Finally, she asserts that she presented a prima facie case of workers\u2019 compensation retaliation under state law. After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">At the time of the events' in question, Peterson was a check-out receptionist in UAHSF\u2019s \u2019 dermatology clinic. In late 2011, she began reporting to a new supervisor, Erika Sanso. Sanso says she almost immediately began receiving complaints from customers and coworkers about Peterson\u2019s behavior and job performance. Sanso also determined that Peterson mistakenly gave one patient another patient\u2019s discharge summary, which violated federal law as well as UAHSF\u2019s policies.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Sanso issued Peterson a written warning on May 18, 2012. The warning addressed Peterson\u2019s breach of patient confidentiality as well as other concerns about her overtime accrual, productivity, customer service, teamwork, and communication.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">Shortly after Peterson began reporting to Sanso, Peterson complained to a superi- or about Sanso. Peterson stated that San-so was \u201cvery short and rude\u201d and this behavior created a \u201chostile environment.\u201d Peterson\u2019s complaint was motivated by her perception \u2014 allegedly shared by some of her African-American colleagues \u2014 that Sanso, a white woman, treated white employees better than she treated African-American employees. Sanso claims not to have learned of this concern, however, until a meeting on May 22, 2012. During this meeting, Peterson shared her concerns with Sanso. The meeting \u201cended \u25a0with [Peterson and Sanso] agreeing to work with each other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b967-10\">On June 4, 2012, Peterson was issued a final warning for a second patient privacy violation. Once again, she had given a discharge summary to the.wrong patient during check-out. Peterson did not deny making this mistake, though she disagreed with the way she was disciplined.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-11\">On June 19, 2012, Peterson went on medical leave to have surgery on her should\u00e9r, which sh\u00e9 had injured when she fell from her office chair. With Sanso\u2019s permission, Peterson had been visiting the doctor and doing physical therapy several times a week. When she returned from leave in early July, she was eventually moved from the check-out station to light duty hi the medical records department. Peterson continued her follow-up doctor\u2019s visits and physical therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-12\">Around the same time, Peterson filed an EEOC charge against UAHSF. In the charge, she accused Sanso of disparate treatment of black and white employees, specifically referencing her discipline for the discharge summary mix-up and how Sanso reacted to her taking breaks.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-13\">Peterson continued to experience problems with her coworkers. On August 22, 2012, she e-mailed Sanso about \u201coffensive\u201d treatment by other employees, which she said created a \u201chostile environment.\u201d San-so responded by arranging one-on-one meetings between Peterson and each of the allegedly offensive employees. After the meetings, Peterson said she \u201cwould do [her] best to get along with everybody,\u201d but she felt that nothing changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>In October 2012, Sanso completed Peterson\u2019s performance evaluation. She rated Peterson as having met only \u201csome expectations\u201d in various categories \u2014 such a rating is \u201cless than satisfactory.\u201d Peterson mostly disagreed with these ratings and with Sanso\u2019s written comments accompanying them, though Peterson admitted to the two patient privacy violations and to having disagreements with coworkers.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">In December 2012, Sanso claims to have received another complaint about Peterson from an African-American employee named Ashley Carter. Carter complained that Peterson generally shirked her duties, creating an unfair distribution of work. The next month, Sanso claims to have received further reports that Peterson\u2019s performance was inadequate. For instance, a secret shopper<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as well as an employee in another department notified Sanso that Peterson was still not verifying patient identity at check-out, sometimes resulting in the clinic getting bad checks. Carter continued to complain about Peterson\u2019s relative lack of productivity. Sanso verified that Carter seemed to be processing significantly more payments than Peterson.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">On January 11, 2013, Sanso had a final meeting with Peterson. Peterson was warned that she was the common denominator in all the coworker conflicts, and future problematic behavior \u201cwould not be tolerated.\u201d On January 28, 2013, Sanso noticed that the check-out desk was unattended during Peterson\u2019s shift for approximately 10 minutes. Two days later, Sanso terminated Peterson\u2019s employment at UAHSF based on \u201congoing interpersonal conflicts, patient complaints and job performance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b968-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-9\">Peterson challenges several aspects of the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment against her. We address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-10\">A. <em>Exclusion of Hearsay</em></p>\n<p id=\"b968-11\">A district court\u2019s rulings on the admissibility of hearsay evidence are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>City of Tuscaloosa v. Harcros Chems., Inc., </em>158 F.3d 548, 556 (11th Cir.1998). The district court excluded portions of an affidavit from one of Peterson\u2019s coworkers as hearsay, In the relevant paragraphs, the affi-ant repeated complaints about Sanso that she had allegedly heard from other African-American employees. These secondhand statements were offered as evidence of Sanso\u2019s racist behavior, but they were not corroborated by any direct testimony from the people who purportedly complained. The statements were merely based on conversations that the affiant claimed to have had with different people.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-12\">Hearsay is a statement, other than one made by the declarant, offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Fed. R.Evid. 801(c). Peterson has not advanced any argument or evidence to suggest why the statements here \u2014 which the affiant repeated secondhand as evidence of Sanso\u2019s alleged racism \u2014 do not squarely qualify as inadmissible hearsay. Instead, she simply discusses the probative value of the evidence. This is irrelevant if the statements are inadmissible hearsay. The district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding these portions of the affidavit as hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-13\">B. <em>Racial Discrimination Claim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b968-14\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, considering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-movant. <em>Rioux v. City of Atlanta, </em>520 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir.2008). The party moving for summary judgment bears the initial burden of establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2553, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). The burden then shifts to the non-moving party, who \u201cmust set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d <em>Eberhardt v. Waters, </em>901 F.2d 1578, 1580 (11th Cir.1990) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">Title VII and \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1983 prohibit employers from discriminating against employees on the basis of their race. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-2(a), 1981, 1983. Claims under \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1983 have the same elements of proof and analytical framework as claims under Title VII. <em>See Stallworth v. Shuler, 777 </em>F.2d 1431, 1433 (11th Cir.1985). A plaintiff may attempt to show intentional discrimination under these statutes through either direct or circumstantial evidence. <em>Schoenfeld v. Babbitt, </em>168 F.3d 1257, 1266 (11th Cir.1999). In evaluating single-motive discrimination claims supported by circumstantial evidence, we use the framework provided by <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 1079, 1087 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-9\">Under <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>once the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the employer must articulate one or .more legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its actions. <em>Id. </em>Next, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff, who must offer evidence that the employer\u2019s reasons are pretexts for illegal discrimination. <em>Id. </em>To show pretext, the plaintiff must demonstrate both that the employer\u2019s stated reason for the employment decision was false and that discrimination was the real reason. <em>Springer v. Convergys Customer Mgmt. Grp., Inc., </em>509 F.3d 1344, 1349 (11th Cir.2007) (per curiam). The plaintiff must present \u201csignificant probative evidence\u201d of pretext to avoid summary judgment. <em>Mayfield v. Patterson Pump Co., </em>101 F.3d 1371, 1376 (11th Cir.1996) (quotation omitted). Importantly, when an employer of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>fers more than one legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the decision, the plaintiff must rebut each reason. <em>Crawford v. City of Fairburn, </em>482 F.3d 1305, 1308 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">Peterson failed to present evidence that UAHSF\u2019s proffered nondiscriminatory reasons for firing her were pretextual. UAHSF listed Peterson\u2019s two patient privacy violations as reasons for terminating her, and Peterson admitted to these violations. Nor does Peterson deny that a number of her coworkers complained about her and that she repeatedly met with management to address interpersonal conflicts in the workplace. And Peterson presented no evidence to rebut UAHSF\u2019s assertion that several checks she processed were returned because she had not gotten proper identification. Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment as to Peterson\u2019s Title VII and \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1983 racial discrimination claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">C. <em>Retaliation Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">The anti-retaliation provision of Title VII forbids an employer from retaliating against an employee because she has opposed \u201can unlawful employment practice.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). Retaliation claims are also cognizable under \u00a7 1981. <em>CBOCS W., Inc. v. Humphries, </em>553 U.S. 442, 451, 128 S.Ct. 1951, 1958, 170 L.Ed.2d 864 (2008). To establish a retaliation claim, a plaintiff must show that: (1) she engaged in a statutorily protected activity; (2) she suffered a materially adverse employment action; and (3) there was a causal connection between the two events. <em>Goldsmith v. Bagby Elevator Co., </em>513 F.3d 1261, 1277 (11th Cir.2008). Whereas very close temporal proximity between the protected activity and the adverse action may indicate causation, a substantial delay between the two events \u2014 with no other evidence of cau<em>sation </em>\u2014 means no causal connection has been shown. <em>See Clark Cty. Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, </em>532 U.S. 268, 273-74, 121 S.Ct. 1508, 1511, 149 L.Ed.2d 509 (2001) (per curiam); <em>see also Thomas v. Cooper Lighting, Inc., </em>506 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir.2007) (per curiam) (\u201cA three to four month disparity between the statutorily protected expression and the adverse employment action is not enough.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-8\">Peterson failed to make out a pri-ma facie retaliation case because she did not present evidence of a causal connection between her protected activity and her termination. Peterson was terminated over six months after she filed her EEOC charge and over a year after she first complained to superiors about Sanso. Without other evidence showing a causal connection, this extended delay was fatal to Peterson\u2019s retaliation claim. <em>See Thomas, </em>506 F.3d at 1364. We affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-9\">D. <em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Retaliation Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b970-10\">Under Alabama law, \u201c[n]o employee shall be terminated by an employer solely because the employee has instituted or maintained any action against the employer to recover workers\u2019 compensation benefits.\u201d Ala.Code \u00a7 25-5-11.1. To make out a prima facie claim under this statute, a plaintiff must prove: (1) an employment relationship; (2) an on-the-job injury; (3) her employer\u2019s knowledge of the injury, and (4) termination based <em>solely </em>on her injury and her filing of a workers\u2019 compensation claim. <em>Flint Constr. Co. v. Hall, </em>904 So.2d 236, 247 (Ala.2004). To prove the final element \u2014 causation\u2014the Alabama Supreme Court has identified several factors that can be considered as circumstantial evidence. <em>See Ala. Power Co. v. Aldridge, </em>854 So.2d 554, 564-65 (Ala.2002). These include the temporal proximity between the filing of the claim and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>the termination, an employer\u2019s negative attitude toward the employee\u2019s injury, an employer\u2019s failure to adhere to company policy, sudden changes in an employee\u2019s evaluations after the claim, and evidence that the stated reason for discharge was false. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">Peterson failed to establish that her termination was based solely on her on-the-job injury and her filing of a workers\u2019 compensation claim. She did not present evidence of any of the probative factors\u2014 to the contrary, Sanso seems to have approved Peterson\u2019s weekly treatments and moved her to light duty to accommodate her condition. And as previously discussed, Peterson did not show that the reasons offered for her termination were pretextual. Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on Peterson\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">After careful consideration of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b967-8\">. According to Joan Wilson, a human resources administrator at UAHSF, this violation could have independently justified Peterson\u2019s termination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b968-6\">. \"Secret shoppers\u201d are persons paid to visit a business like an ordinary customer and then rate their experience, usually providing their review to the business being rated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b969-6\">. Peterson argues for the first time on appeal that the district court should not have applied the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework because this is a mixed-motives case. Peterson claims that she can proceed under a mixed-motives theory because the district court found an issue of fact as to whether Sanso's concern about her productivity was sufficient to motivate her termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-7\">This Court recently decided that the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework is not appropriate for examining mixed-motives claims at the summaty judgment stage. <em>Quigg v. Thomas Cty. Sch. Dist., </em>814 F.3d 1227 (11th Cir.2016). Instead, we should determine whether the plaintiff \"has presented sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude, by a preponderance of the evidence, that her protected characteristic was a motivating factor for an adverse employment decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1239 (quotation omitted) (alterations adopted).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-10\">Peterson has not carried this burden. Even assuming without deciding that she properly preserved this issue, she misreads the district court\u2019s finding. While the court speculated that Peterson\u2019s apparently lesser performance in processing payments may have been due to a change in her job responsibilities, the court did not further find that this reflected evidence of discrimination by Sanso. The court merely found that this reason, standing alone, may have been \"insufficient to motivate San-so to terminate Peterson.\u201d But Sanso had other reasons to question Peterson\u2019s job performance, including complaints from customers and coworkers. Without other evidence of discrimination, Sanso\u2019s possibly mistaken assessment of. Peterson's performance in processing payments is not proof that \"illegal bias played a role in [UAHSF\u2019s] decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1241. The assessment may have been a <em>mistaken </em>input in the decisional process, but Peterson has not shown that it was a <em>discriminatory </em>input. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
