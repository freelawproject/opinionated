Sanchez (a former TSA agent) was eligible for a potential reduction. But the district court retained the discretion to refuse to reduce the sentence. The district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to grant Sanchez relief: a decision based on the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors \u2014 the court conducted the required two-step analysis and provided a specific basis for its decision. For background, see <em>United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1257 (11th Cir.2009). The district court did not err in allowing the government to oppose Sanchez\u2019s motion, despite the government\u2019s promise in his plea agreement that it would recommend \u2014 as it did at his 2009 sentencing \u2014 a sentence at the low end of his guideline range: the plea agreement did not address the parties\u2019 obligation in the event of a future \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
