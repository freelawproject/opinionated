O\u2019Connor also challenges the district court\u2019s denial of injunctive relief. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-21\">Briefly stated, this case arises out of a series of events that happened in January <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>2010 when O\u2019Connor was an inmate at SRCI. O\u2019Connor alleges that, while on suicide watch and self-harm observation status, he ingested intentionally a paper clip and a razor blade. Shortly thereafter, Defendant officers found O\u2019Connor lying on the floor of his cell. When the officers entered O\u2019Connor\u2019s cell, a fight broke out between O\u2019Connor and the officers. During the struggle, O\u2019Connor alleges that Officer Kelley bit O\u2019Connor on the arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-3\">O\u2019Connor was then placed in restraints. While O\u2019Connor was lying restrained on the floor, Officer Morris allegedly placed his knee \u201chard\u201d against O\u2019Connor\u2019s head, forced O\u2019Connor\u2019s arms beyond their normal range of motion, and made death threats to him. Although some Defendant officers were present, O\u2019Connor alleges that the officers did nothing to stop Officer Morris.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">O\u2019Connor contends that Defendant officers failed to document properly the incident and that SRCI and FDOC failed to punish Defendant officers or to transfer O\u2019Connor to another prison. O\u2019Connor also alleges that Defendant nurses \u2014 responding to O\u2019Connor\u2019s repeated requests \u2014 tested O\u2019Connor for possible blood-borne diseases O\u2019Connor may have contracted from the bite wound but then-refused to give O\u2019Connor his test results.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">Sometime after the fight, O\u2019Connor was placed on strip-cell status, allegedly as punishment for assaulting Officer Nelson.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> O\u2019Connor says he was on strip-cell status for \u201clonger than 72 hours (weeks).\u2019\u2019 During that time, O\u2019Connor remained in a \u201ccold cell\u201d without a blanket, mattress, or bed and with only a \u201csuicide shroud\u201d to wear. He \u201cslept stooping down on the cold floor,\u201d \u201csitting with his head against the cold wall,\u201d or lying down on the \u201cextremely cold floor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b944-8\">In his sixth-amended complaint, O\u2019Con-nor purports to allege against Defendants violations of the Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments, the Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d), the Privacy Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d), the Rehabilitation Act, the Uniform Commercial Code (\u201cUCC\u201d), and Florida law.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-9\">The district court \u2014 adopting a magistrate judge\u2019s reasoned and detailed report and recommendation \u2014 dismissed O\u2019Con-nor\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s ruling on a Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, \u201caccepting the allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Hill v. White, </em>321 F.3d 1334, 1335 (11th Cir.2003). We construe liberally <em>pro se </em>pleadings. <em>Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1160 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-10\">To survive dismissal for failure to state a claim, \u201ca complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quotation omitted). \u201cA claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A complaint containing only \u201cnaked assertions devoid of further factual enhancement\u201d or \u201c[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere condusory statements, do not suffice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and alterations omitted). To avoid dismissal of his section 1983 claim, O\u2019Connor must allege facts demonstrating that he was deprived of a constitutional right by a person acting under color of state law. <em>See Griffin v. City of Opa-Locka, </em>261 F.3d 1295, 1303 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">Having reviewed the record and the parties\u2019 arguments on appeal, we agree with the district court\u2019s determination that O\u2019Connor\u2019s sixth-amended complaint failed to state a claim for relief that was plausible on its face.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> First, O\u2019Connor failed to state an Eighth Amendment excessive force claim against Officer Morris. Accepting O\u2019Connor\u2019s allegations as true, Morris did not go beyond <em>de minimis </em>force in struggling with and restraining O\u2019Connor, and O\u2019Connor alleged no dis-cernable lasting injury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Wilkins v. Gaddy, </em>559 U.S. 34, 130 S.Ct. 1175, 1178, 175 L.Ed.2d 995 (2010) (citation and quotations omitted) (the Eighth Amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment does not extend to <em>\u201cde minimis </em>uses of physical force, provided that the use of force is not of a sort repugnant to the conscience of mankind. An inmate who complains of a push or shove that causes no discernable injury almost certainly fails to state a valid excessive force claim.\u201d). O\u2019Connor also has alleged no facts sufficient to show that Morris restrained him with a malicious intention of causing harm instead of in a good-faith effort to maintain discipline. <em>See Hudson v. McMillian, </em>503 U.S. 1, 112 S.Ct. 995, 999, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992). Because O\u2019Connor failed to state a plausible Eighth Amendment claim against Officer Morris, his claims against Defendant officers for failing to intervene also fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-8\">O\u2019Connor has also stated no plausible Eighth Amendment claim based on the time he spent on strip-cell status. Although \u201cthe Constitution does not mandate comfortable prisons,\u201d prison officials must \u201cprovide humane conditions of confinement,\u201d including \u201cadequate food, clothing, shelter, and medical care.\u201d <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 1976, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-9\">A prisoner challenging the conditions of his confinement must, among other things, \u201cshow a deprivation that is objectively, sufficiently serious, which means that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>defendants\u2019 actions resulted in the denial of the minimal civilized measure of life\u2019s necessities.\u201d <em>Cottrell v. Caldwell, </em>85 F.3d 1480, 1491 (11th Cir.1996) (quotations omitted). \u201cThe challenged condition must be \u2018extreme\u2019 the priso'n\u00e9r must show, at the very least, \u201cthat a condition of his confinement poses an unreasonable risk of serious damage to his future health or safety.\u201d <em>Chandler v. Crosby, </em>379 F.3d 1278, 1289 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation omitted). As part of our analysis, we must determine \u201cwhether society considers the risk that the prisoner complains of to be so grave that it violates contemporary standards of decency to expose <em>anyone </em>unwillingly to such a risk.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in-original). In evaluating an Eighth Amendment claim, we consider both the \u201cseverity\u201d and the \u201cduration\u201d of the prisoner\u2019s exposure to extreme temperatures. <em>Id. </em>at 1295. Merely showing that prison conditions are uncomfortable is not enough. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">While we accept that O\u2019Connor <em>felt </em>uncomfortably cold while on strip-cell status, O\u2019Connor has alleged no facts demonstrating his exposure to \u201cextreme\u201d conditions. O\u2019Connor alleges only that his cell was \u201ccold\u201d and that the cell floor was \u201ccold\u201d or \u201cextremely cold.\u201d O\u2019Connor alleges no details about the actual temperature of his cell or about the degree of cold he experienced. For example, O\u2019Connor makes no allegation that' ice formed in his cell. <em>Cf. Dixon v. Godinez, </em>114 F.3d 640 (7th Cir.1997) (prison officials were unentitled to summary judgment when they submitted no evidence rebutting the inmate\u2019s allegation that ice formed regularly oh his cell walls); <em>Corselli v. Coughlin, </em>842 F.2d 23, 27 (2d Cir.1988) (reversing summary judgment in favor of prison officials where the inmate alleged that, for three months-, he was exposed to temperatures so cold that iced formed in the toilet bowl of his cell).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">O\u2019Connor alleges that, as a result of his placement on strip-cell status, he suffered pain, swelling, itching, numbness in his feet and legs (including where a bullet was lodged in his leg), stomach pain, and headaches. But nothing evidences that O\u2019Con-nor reported these medical problems to prison officials. O\u2019Connor failed to allege that he was deprived of the \u201cminimal civilized measure of life\u2019s necessities\u201d- or that the conditions of his confinement posed an unreasonable risk of serious harm to his future health or safety. <em>See Crosby, </em>379 F.3d at 1289; <em>cf. McMahon v. Beard, </em>583 F.2d 172, 175 (5th Cir.1978) (no constitutional violation when a pretrial detainee who had just attempted suicide was placed in a.\u201cstrip cell\u201d for 90 days without clothing, a mattress, sheets, or blankets).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-7\">The district court also committed no error in denying an injunction requiring the FDOC to provide O\u2019Connor with adequate medical care. We review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s decision to deny an injunction. <em>CBS Broad. v. EchoStar Communs. Corp., </em>265 F.3d 1193, 1200 (11th Cir.2001). Under this standard, \u201cwe must affirm unless we at least determine that the district court has made a \u2018clear error of judgment,\u2019 or has applied an incorrect legal standard.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b946-8\">For a district court to grant preliminary injunctive relief, a movant must show four elements including, in pertinent part, \u201ca substantial likelihood of success on the merits\u201d and that \u201cthe movant will suffer irreparable injury unless the injunction is issued.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[A] preliminary injunction is an extraordinary and drastic remedy not to be granted unless the movant clearly established the \u2018burden of persuasion\u2019 as to all four elements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-9\">In his motions for injunctive relief, O\u2019Connor contends that he suffers \u201cstomach and shoulder related problems,\u201d including severe stomach pain, cramps, bloody stools, acid reflux, regurgitation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>heartburn, indigestion, and sharp pain and numbness in his shoulders, neck, face, and hand as a result of the January 2010 incident. O\u2019Connor also contends that he suffers from anxiety, fear, agitation, depression, stress, pain, anguish, and distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">O\u2019Connor\u2019s assertions about his injuries are vague and generalized. Moreover, O\u2019Connor failed to demonstrate that he suffered \u2014 at the time he filed his motions in March 2011 and in December 2013 \u2014 from injuries that needed <em>immediate </em>treatment, or that the lack of treatment would cause actual and imminent harm. Because O\u2019Connor failed to demonstrate that he was likely to prevail on the merits of his substantive claims, or that he would suffer irreparable harm in the absence of injunctive relief, the district court abused no discretion in denying an injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b944-6\">. The district court found implausible O'Con-nor's allegation that he was placed on strip-cell status just for disciplinary reasons. Accepting the allegations in O\u2019Connor\u2019s complaint as true, O\u2019Connor was being treated for mental illness, including \"hallucinations, depression, homicidal and suicidal tendencies, paranoia, and other issues.\u201d While on suicide watch and self-harm observation status, O\u2019Connor swallowed a razor blade and a paperclip, and shortly thereafter, was placed on strip-cell status by a prison psychologist and given only a \"suicide shroud\u201d to wear. In the light of these allegations, we agree that it seems implausible that O'Connor was placed on strip-cell status simply as punishment for assaulting an officer and not for his own protection and safety. But our ultimate decision does not hang on this observation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b945-6\">. As an initial matter, several of O\u2019Connor\u2019s claims wholly lack merit and warrant little discussion. We agree with the district court\u2019s determination that O\u2019Connor's claims for violations of FOIA, the Privacy Act, the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, and the UCC necessarily fail as a matter of law. We reject O\u2019Connor\u2019s Fourth Amendment claims (1) because Officer Kelley\u2019s alleged bite constituted no unlawful search and seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment and (2) because O'Connor requested and consented voluntarily to a blood draw. We also reject without discussion \u2014 and for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s order \u2014 O'Connor\u2019s claims (1) under the Eighth Amendment for failure to transfer him to a different facility, (2) under the Fourteenth Amendment for substantive due process violations, for filing false disciplinary reports, and for <em>Brady </em>violations, and (3) for compensatory and punitive damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b945-11\">. We reject O\u2019Connor\u2019s argument that he suffered a discernable injury, for purposes of our Eighth Amendment analysis, when the razor blade and paperclip pierced the inside of his stomach. O'Connor swallowed voluntarily these foreign objects and nothing evidences that Officer Morris knew about the presence of the foreign objects when he restrained O\u2019Connor. Moreover, O\u2019Connor alleges that the razor blade and paperclip pierced his stom\u00e1ch before, during, and after Officer Morris's restraint of him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b947-16\">. Having reached the merits of O\u2019Connor\u2019s appeal, we need not address whether O\u2019Con-nor should have been barred from proceeding <em>in forma pauperis </em>on appeal pursuant to the \"three strikes\u201d provision of the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
