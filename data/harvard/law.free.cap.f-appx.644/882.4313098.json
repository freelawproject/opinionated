Dowis argues that (1) \u00a7 922(g)(1) is an unconstitutional infringement of his Second Amendment right to bear arms for purposes of self-defense, and (2) his sentence constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. After thorough review of the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that both the statute and Dowis\u2019s sentence are constitutional. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-23\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b896-24\">The United States indicted Dowis for knowingly possessing a firearm in or affecting interstate commerce after having been convicted of a crime punishable by more than one-year imprisonment, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Dowis moved to dismiss the indictment on grounds that \u00a7 922(g)(1) violated the Second Amendment because it failed to distinguish between prior convictions for violent, versus non-violent, felonies. The magistrate judge prepared a Report and Recommendation (R <em>&amp; </em>R) that recommended Dowis\u2019s motion be denied in light of <em>United States v. Rozier, </em>598 F.3d 768, 771 (11th Cir.2010) (per curiam), in which we held that \u00a7 922(g)(1) does not violate the Second Amendment. Dowis objected to the R <em>&amp; </em>R on grounds that <em>District of Columbia v. Heller, </em>554 U.S. 570, 128 S.Ct. 2783, 171 L.Ed.2d 637 (2008), disallowed the court from abrogating his Second Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>The district court adopted the R &amp; R, overruled Dowis\u2019s objection, and denied Dowis\u2019s motion to dismiss. After a bench trial premised on stipulated facts \u2014 including, in relevant part, that Dowis possessed the firearms as charged, they had been transported across state lines, and Dowis had previously been convicted of two felonies \u2014 the court entered an order finding Dowis guilty. Following a hearing, the district court sentenced Dowis to 30-months imprisonment with three years of supervised release to follow, which reflected a downward variance from the advisory range under the United States Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">Dowis argues that \u00a7 922(g)(1) violates the Second Amendment and his sentence violates the Eighth Amendment. We review challenges to the constitutionality of a statute or a sentence de novo. <em>Rozier, </em>598 F.3d at 770. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">Dowis argues that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional because it targets a politically unpopular group \u2014 convicted felons \u2014 and fails to differentiate between violent and nonviolent felons, without a rational basis. We have already held that \u201cstatutory restrictions on firearm possession, such as \u00a7 922(g)(1), are a constitutional avenue to restrict the Second Amendment right of certain classes of people.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 771. \u201cLike most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited.\u201d <em>Heller, </em>554 U.S. at 626, 128 S.Ct. at 2816. Certain individuals \u2014 including convicted felons \u2014 are <em>\u201cdisqualified </em>from the exercise of Second Amendment rights.\u201d <em>Rozier, </em>598 F.3d at 770 (quoting <em>Heller, </em>554 U.S. at 635, 128 S.Ct. at 2822); <em>accord United States v. Giles, </em>640 F.2d 621, 624-25 (5th Cir. Unit A 1981) (holding that predecessor statute to \u00a7 922(g)(1) survived an equal protection challenge because the government has a rational basis for restricting the Second Amendment rights of both violent and non-violent felons).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, Dowis\u2019s claim is foreclosed by this court\u2019s prior precedent. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235, 1236 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (\u201c[W]e are bound to follow a prior binding precedent unless and until it is overruled by this court en banc or by the Supreme Court.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-11\">Dowis also argues that his sentence violates the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment because it is grossly disproportionate to his conduct. Specifically, Dowis argues that spending thirty months in prison for \u201cpossessing an otherwise legal firearm is grossly excessive.\u201d Dowis received a sentence of 30-months imprisonment, which is not only below the statutory maximum of 10 years, but also a variance downward from the applicable advisory guideline range of 33 to 41 months. This lenient sentence does not violate the Eighth Amendment; \u201ca sentence <em>within </em>the statutory limits generally does not violate the Eighth Amendment.\u201d <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>451 F.3d 1239, 1243 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (emphasis added). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-12\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b897-13\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM Dowis\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b897-8\">. All decisions of the \"old Fifth\u201d Circuit handed down prior to the close of business on September 30, 1981 are binding precedent in the Eleventh Circuit. <em>Bonner v.
