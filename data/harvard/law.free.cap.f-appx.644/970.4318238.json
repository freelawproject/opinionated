Sesma-Bague contends the district court erred by failing to <em>sua sponte </em>order a competency hearing and by finding Sesma-Bague ineligible for \u201csafety-valve\u201d relief under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f). After review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>The district court did not abuse its discretion by failing to <em>sua sponte </em>order a competency hearing for Sesma-Bague. Although the record indicates that Sesma-Bague suffers from mental health issues, nothing in the record suggests that Sesma-Bague was incompetent to plead guilty. <em>See Wingo, </em>789 F.3d at 1234-35 (quoting <em>Drope v. Missouri, </em>420 U.S. 162, 171, 95 S.Ct. 896, 43 L.Ed.2d 103 (1975)) (citations omitted) (\u201cCompetence to proceed to trial or to enter a guilty plea requires the defendant to possess the \u2018capacity to understand the nature and object of the proceedings against him, to consult with counsel, and to assist in preparing his defense.\u2019 \u201d). The district court questioned Sesma-Bague during his change of plea colloquy and held that Sesmar-Bague was competent to plead guilty, calling Sesma-Bague \u201cintelligent and alert.\u201d Sesma-Bague\u2019s statements at his sentencing hearing also indicate that Sesma-Bague both understood the charges against him and in fact assisted his counsel\u2019s defense. Finally, the record is bereft of any opinion, medical or lay, questioning Sesma-Bague\u2019s competence. <em>Compare, e.g., Wingo, </em>789 F.3d at 1237 (\u201cAt least three medical doctors expressed serious doubts about Win-go\u2019s competence.\u201d). Under these facts, the district court did not abuse its discretion by failing to <em>sua sponte </em>order a competency hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-7\">The district court did not clearly err in holding that Sesma-Bague failed to meet his burden of proving his entitlement to \u201csafety-valve\u201d relief. <em>United States v. Carillo-Ayala, </em>713 F.3d 82, 88 (11th Cir.2013) (quotation omitted) (\u201c[18 U.S.C; \u00a7 3553(f)(2)] requires the defendant to show that he did not use violence or credible threats of violence or possess a firearm or other dangerous weapon ... in connection with the offense.\u201d). Although Sesma-Bague contended that the gun he showed to undercover agents was not real, both agents-one of whom held the gun-testified otherwise. The district court was entitled to credit the testimony of the agents over that of Sesma-Bague and conclude that the gun was real. <em>See United States v. Pham, </em>463 F.3d 1239, 1244 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation omitted) (\u201cWe afford substantial deference to the factfinder, in this case, the district court, in reaching credibility determinations with respect to witness testimony.\u201d). Likewise, the district court did not clearly err in concluding that Sesma-Bague\u2019s selling methamphetamine while contemporaneously possessing the gun constitutes use in connection with the offense, particularly given testimony that Sesma-Bague planned to use the gun to deter other drug dealers from invading his territory. <em>See Carillo-Ayala, </em>713 F.3d at 96 (emphasis in original) (\u201c[T]he presence of a gun within a defendant\u2019s dominion and control during a drug trafficking offense ordinarily <em>will </em>suffice to show possession during and in relation to the offense and, therefore, that the defendant possessed the firearm in connection with the offense.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b984-25\">.
