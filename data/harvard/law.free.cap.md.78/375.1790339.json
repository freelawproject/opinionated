B. Club of Baltimore City of the first part, and P. of the City of Chicago of the second part, in these words: \u201cThe said party of the second part agrees to play ball for the party of the first part for the season of 1892, for the sum of three thousand ($3,000) dollars, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>with five hundred dollars advanced on the contract, said sum of five hundred dollars ($500) to be considered part of the said three thousand ($3,000) dollars above stated; salary payable first and fifteenth of each month; services to commence on the 26th. of March, 1892, and to end on October 31st, 1892.\u201d P. entered upon the services and performed them until first day of June, 1892, when he was discharged or released. He was paid the five hundred dollars advance money, and also four payments on account of his salary. The grounds set up for his discharge were want-of skill and ability. In an action by P. against the B. B. Club, for a breach of the contract, two defences were relied upon by the-defendant: First, that the plaintiff did not exercise that degree of skill and efficiency required of professional base ball players, playing in the league or association to which the defendant belonged, and was discharged for inefficiency. Secondly, that there was a universal and well known custom observed by all professional base ball clubs, that the club shall have the right on ten days notice, to release any player who does not come up to-the requirements of his position and play satisfactorily; and that the defendant received the ten days notice and was discharged. Held :</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b400-5\">1st. That the standard of comparison or test of efficiency, is that degree of skill, efficiency, and knowledge which is possessed by those of ordinary skill, competency, and standing in the particular trade or business for which they are employed; and no-higher skill than this could be required of the plaintiff, the contract being entirely silent as to the degree of skill to be possessed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b400-6\">2nd. That the evidence failed to establish the custom or usage-relied on as a defence, the same being too vague and unmeaning, and the plaintiff having testified that he had never signed or seen a contract with the ten days clause, and knew of no custom by which a player could be discharged in that way.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b400-7\">3rd.

That if the jury find from the evidence, that on or about the 14th day of' November, 1891, the plaintiff entered into an agreement with the defendant in which the plaintiff agreed to play ball for the defendant for the season of 1892 for the sum of $8,000, with $500 advanced, which was to be considered as part of said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>$3,000, the salary to be payable on the 1st and 15th of each month, his services to commence on March 26th, 1892, and end on October 31, 1892; that the said plaintiff entered upon the discharge of his duties under said contract, and continued in the employ of the defendant until about the 1st day of June, 1892, faithfully performing his duties, if the jury so find, having received from said defendant the said advance of $500 and four instalments of $178.57 each, and that on or about the first day of June, 1892, the defendant dismissed him from its services and employment, and refused to permit him to perform said services, and that the plaintiff was ready and willing to perform his services under said agreement, and offered and tendered to continue in the service of the defendant until the time limited by said agreement for the expiration therefor, then the plaintiff is entitled to recover, unless the jury further find that plaintiff did not possess and exercise the skill, knowledge and efficiency possessed and exercised by other professional base ball players of ordinary skill, knowledge and efficiency, and that he was discharged for such reason.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-5\">4. That there is no evidence in this cause of any custom or usage prevailing by which the plaintiff could be released or discharged before the end of the contract period without sufficient cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-6\">5. The plaintiff moves the Court to strike out all evidence offered (and admitted subject to exception) to show the existence of a usage among professional base ball clubs to the effect that the club or its manager has a right at any time during the period of contract to discharge a player on ten days notice, in case such player does not play to the satisfaction of said club or manager.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-7\">The defendant offered ten prayers; the following only, which the Court rejected, are inserted:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-8\">1. If the jury shall find from the evidence in this case, that at the time of making the contract offered in evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>clence there was a general custom prevailing among professional bas.e ball clubs, that the manager of the club could discharge any player after ten days notice, who-was not in the opinion of the manager of the said club of sufficient skill for his duties, and they shall further find that the plaintiff was not, in the opinion of the manager of the Baltimore Base Ball Club,-of sufficient skill for his duties, and that the said manager did discharge the plaintiff, then their verdict must be for the defendant, unless the jury shall further find that the said manager was guilty of bad faith in forming his said opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-5\">3. That if the plaintiff did not possess and use in the performance of his duties, under the contract offered in evidence, that degree or amount of skill which the jury shall find was reasonably required for the performance of the said duties, to the reasonable satisfaction of the defendant, then the defendant had a lawful right to discharge the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-6\">6. When the plaintiff agreed to play professional base ball for the defendant, knowing that the defendant belonged to the class of cluhs known as league clubs, he is, by implication of law, to be considered as holding himself out as possessing that reasonable amount of skill and dexterity which is possessed by the professional baseball players who play for the league clubs, and if the plaintiff did not exercise and exert such reasonable skill and dexterity in the service of the defendant, the defendant had a right to discharge him, and the verdict must be for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-7\">8. If the jury shall find that at the time of the making of the contract offered in evidence, the defendant was a member of the National League or of the American Association of Professional Base Ball Clubs, and that the plaintiff' had' knowledge of it, and shall further find that the plaintiff was employed by the defendant for the purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>of taking part in contests between the defendant\u2019s club and other clubs of said association, and shall further find that the plaintiff did not possess or did not use in such contests that degree of skill which was ordinarily-used by other members of the clubs belonging to the said association, then the defendant had the right to discharge the plaintiff, and their verdict must be for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-5\">The Court granted the first, fourth and fifth prayers of the plaintiff, and gave also the following instruction of its own:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-6\">That if the jury find for the plaintiff, then he is entitled to recover the contract price, less such sums as may have been paid to him, and also less such sums as he earned, or by the exercise of due diligence might have earned, in the line of his business, during the remainder of the period covered by the contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-7\">And granted the second, fourth, fifth, seventh, ninth and tenth prayers of the defendant, and rejected the first, third, sixth and eighth prayers of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-8\">The defendant excepted, and the verdict and judgment being against it, appealed.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-9\">The cause was argued before Robinson, C.

It is most briefly and informally drawn, and declares that Pickett agrees \u201cto play ball\u201d for the defendant for the season of 1892 for the sum of three thousand dollars, to be paid in a particular manner, and that his services shall commence on 26th of March and end on October 31st, 1892. There is no stipulation whatever as to what shall or shall not authorize either party to the contract to rescind or abrogate it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-8\">Possibly the most analogous case that can be cited is <em>Metzner vs. Bolton, </em>9 <em>Exch., </em>518, where a salesman was employed <em>for a year, </em>and there was a usage of the trade to dismiss on three months notice. The usage was held to modify the contract.

That knowledge will, if the jury find the custom to have been of such genera] and universal prevalence, be presumed in law. <em>Lyon &amp; Scott vs. George, </em>44 <em>Md., </em>301; <em>Bank of Columbia vs. Fitzhugh, </em>1 <em>Harr. &amp; G., </em>248.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b407-6\">But if it were necessary for the jury to find <em>actual, knowledge </em>of this custom on the part of the plaintiff, they could infer such knowledge from the fact that he himself testified that he had been a professional base ball player for eight or nine years, and had, among other clubs, played on the Philadelphia League Club in 1890.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b407-7\">It is a well known principle of law that, whenever any one accepts employment which requires the exercise of special skill or knowledge, he impliedly holds himself out as possessing and as agreeing to use that degree of skill which the employment demands. <em>Wood on Master and Servant, sec. </em>157; <em>Leatherberry vs. Odell, 7 Fed.

The contract was made and entered into by and between the Baltimore Base Ball Club of the City of Baltimore, party of the first part, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>and John T. Pickett, of the City of Chicago, party of the second part, and is in these words: \u201cThe said party of the second part agrees to play ball for the party of the first part for the season of 1892, for the sum of three thousand ($3,000) dollars, with five hundred dollars advanced on contract; said sum of five hundred ($500) dollars, to be considered part of the said three thousand ($3,000) dollars above stated. Salary payable first and fifteenth of each month; sei-vices to commence on the 26th of March, 1892, and end on October 31st, 1892.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">The appellee, the plaintiff below, entered upon the services and performed them until the first day of June, 1892, when he was discharged or released. He was paid the five hundred ($500) dollars advanced money, and also four payments on account of his salary. The grounds set up for his discharge were want of skill and ability. The judgment was for the plaintiff and the defendant has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">At the trial there were ten exceptions reserved to the rejection by the Court of evidence offered by the defendant, the third, ninth and tenth of which, were abandoned at the hearing. There were also exceptions to the granting of the first, fourth and fifth prayers of the plaintiff, and to the rejection of the first, third, sixth and eighth prayers of the defendant, and to the instruction on the part of the Court. These exceptions form the basis of this appeal, and we will pass upon them in their regular order. There were two defences relied upon by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">First, that the plaintiff did not exercise that degree of skill and efficiency required of professional base ball players, playing in the league or association to which the defendant belonged, and was discharged for inefficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">Secondly, that there was a universal and well known custom observed by all professional base ball clubs, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>tbe club shall have the right on ten days\u2019 notice, to release any player who does not come up to the requirements of his position, and play satisfactorily; that the \u25a0defendant received the ten days\u2019 notice and was discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">It will be observed that the contract in this case was a special one, for a precise period, definite in its terms, and is simply an ordinary hiring under a special contract. It is entirely silent as to the degree of skill the plaintiff should possess in the business for which he was \u2022employed. In the words of the contract \u201che was to play ball for the Baltimore Base Ball Club, the party of the first part, for the season of 1892.\u201d Now, it is a well settled rule that the standard of comparison or test of \u25a0efficiency is that degree of skill, efficiency and knowledge which is possessed by those of ordinary skill, competency and standing in the particular trade or business for which they are employed. And as the contract provided for no higher degree of skill than this, none other \u25a0could be required. The Supreme Court\u2019 of Pennsylvania lays down the doctrine to be: \u201cWhere skill as well as \u25a0care is required in performing the undertaking, if the party purport to have skill in the business, and he undertakes for hire, he is bound to the exercise of due and ordinary skill in the employment of his art or business about it, or, in other words, to perform in a workmanlike manner. In cases of this sort he must be understood to have engaged to use a degree of diligence and attention and skill adequate to the performance of his undertaking. Ordinary skill means that degree which men engaged in that particular art usually employ, not that which belongs to a few men only of extraordinary endowments and capacities.\u201d <em>Waugh vs. Shunk, </em>20 <em>Pa. St., </em>133; also <em>Harmer vs. Cornelius, </em>5 <em>C. B. Reports, N. S., </em>236; <em>Parker vs. Platt, </em>74 <em>Ill., </em>432.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>This doctrine was fairly submitted to the jury by the first prayer of the plaintiff and the fourth prayer of the defendant, by which they were in substance, told that-if they found that the plaintiff did not possess and exercise the skill, knowledge and efficiency possessed and exercised by other professional base ball players of ordinary skill, knowledge and efficiency, and that he was discharged for such reasons, then their verdict must be for the defendant. A large number of witnesses, who-had been professional base ball players for six or ten years, and who had played with the plaintiff, testified that they considered him a good player, and that he played an average good game of hall.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">We pass now to the second question in the case. The contention on the part of the appellant is that the contract was made subject to a usage or custom that the club had a right to cancel the contract and discharge the player on giving ten days\u2019 notice when the player is deficient in his playing. The contract is entirely silent upon this subject, and it is not admitt\u00e9d that the-player had the reciprocal right to abandon the club, or to cancel the contract when he deemed it proper or right, to do so. We have carefully examined the testimony, and find a failure of proof to establish an}^ usage. The evidence was manifestly t.oo vague and unmeaning to-warrant, upon any principles, the submission of any proposition based upon it. The plaintiff testified \u201cthat-he had been playing professional base ball for the past nine years, is familiar with the rules of the game, and had signed contracts for professional clubs; that he had never signed a contract with the ten days\u2019 clause; that, he never even saw one, and knew of no custom by which a player could be discharged that way. That nothing was said about it when he signed.\u201d The authorities all hold that a usage to be admissible must be proved to be known to the'parties or be so general and well estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>lished that knowledge and adoption of it may be presumed, and it must be certain and uniform. <em>Foley &amp; Woodside vs. Mason &amp; Son, </em>6 <em>Md., </em>51; <em>Second National Bank of Balto. vs. Western National Bank of Balto., </em>51 <em>Md., </em>128; <em>The Citizens\u2019 Bank of Baltimore vs. Grafflin, </em>31 <em>Md., </em>520; <em>Patterson vs. Crowther &amp; Boone, </em>70 <em>Md., </em>125. But conceding that there was sufficient evidence of the custom and usage contended for by the appellant, we are clearly of the opinion that it was not admissible to vary the terms of this special contract. The contract. as we have said, is one for a definite term of service and binding on both parties. To admit the usage \u25a0would not only destroy its mutuality but vary its terms. The Supreme Court of Rhode Island in a similar case to the one now under consideration held, that \u201ca local usage cannot be considered a part of a contract, when it contradicts that contract.\u201d Justices Dureee and Haile, in delivering the opinion of the Court, say, the contract and usage cannot stand together. Either the contract must prevail and make void the usage, or the usage must prevail and make void the contract. The contract described in this declaration is not a contract made with reference to the usage, but against it. The contract described, is to labor for a year, but the usage terminates it at will. The contract is by the very fact of its existence, a protest against the usage, for it ceases to be a special contract the moment that the usage is made part of it. A usage which annuls such a contract cannot be given in evidence, without subverting the well settled rule, that usages inconsistent with a contract cannot be given in evidence to affect it. <em>Sweet vs. Jenkins and Man, </em>1 <em>Rhode Island, </em>147. And to the same effect, is the case of <em>Peters vs. Staveley, </em>Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, where Chief Justice Cockburn holds that, the contract being for one week certain, the custom even if proved, could not control it. 15 <em>Law Times Beports, </em>275; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>also, <em>Smith vs. </em>Sheridan, 32 <em>N. Y. State Reporter, </em>23. The same rule has been established by this Court in a number of cases. <em>Foley &amp; Woodside vs. Mason &amp; Son, supra; The Citizens\u2019 Bank of Baltimore vs. Grafflin, supra; Susquehanna Fertilizer Co. vs. White &amp; Co., </em>66 <em>Md., </em>452; <em>Patterson vs. Crowther &amp; Boone, </em>10 <em>Md., </em>125; <em>First Nat. Bank of Baltimore vs. Taliaferro, </em>12 <em>Md., </em>165.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">It follows then from this view of the case, that there was no error by the Court in granting the plaintiff\u2019s fourth, and fifth prayers which were to the effect that there was no evidence of any usage by which the plaintiff could be discharged before the end of the contract period without sufficient cause, and the exclusion from the jury of all evidence offered to show the existence of such a usage. The first prayer of the defendant relative to the existence of the usage was properly rejected. The third, sixth and eighth prayers of the defendant were properly rejected for the reasons we have heretofore given. The first prayer granted on the part of the plaintiff was correct, and contained the law upon that branch of the case. We have examined all the exceptions and .discover no error of which the appellant has a right to complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">The first, second, fifth, sixth and seventh exceptions to the admission of evidence, are substantially the same, and present the question as to the degree of skill required of the plaintiff in the performance of his duty. The evidence was properly rejected because it tended to exact or to establish a higher degree of skill than that contemplated by the contract. The appellant was not a member of the National League at the time the contract was entered into, on November 14, 1891; it did not become such until January, 1892. This testimony was therefore immaterial and irrelevant. The fourth exception was to the refusal of the Court to allow the following question to be answered: \u201cCan you tell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>whether or not there was any public complaint by the patrons of the manner in which Mr. Pickett filled, his position ?\u201d It is unnecessary to pass upon the exception as the witness afterwards substantially answered tho question proposed, and defendant had the benefit'of his answer. The remaining exception was to the instruction of the Court as to the measure of damages. This prayer instructed the jury that if they found for the plaintiff, he was entitled to recover the contract price, less such sums as may have been paid to him, and also less such sums as he earned, or by the exercise of due diligence might have earned, in the line of his business, during the remainder of the period covered by the contract. We think this was unexceptionable, and is the law laid down by this Court in <em>Cum. &amp; Pa. R. R. Co. vs. </em>Slack, 45 <em>Md., </em>161.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"AFz\">(Decided 12th January, 1894.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Finding no error, and the whole case having been fairly submitted to the jury, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
