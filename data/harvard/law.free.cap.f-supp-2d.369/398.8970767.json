Conclusion.437</p>\n<p id=\"b432-51\">In 1996, Warner-Lambert Company (\u201cWarner-Lambert\u201d), now owned by Pfizer \u00ed\u00f1e., announced the development of Rezu-lin, the trade name of a drug used to treat Type 2 diabetes, a disease affecting ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>proximately 16 million Americans.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The United States Food and Drug Administration approved the drug in 1997, and it was administered to 1.92 million people. Following reports that some patients taking Rezulin experienced liver failure resulting in transplant or death, the drug was withdrawn from the market in March 2000.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This led to the commencement of thousands of lawsuits for alleged personal injuries or apprehension of personal injuries in consequence of the ingestion of the drug.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The federal actions have been consolidated in this Court for pretrial proceedings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Extensive liability discovery against defendants has been completed. Defendants Pfizer Inc., Warner-Lambert, and Parke-Davis<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (collectively, \u201cPfizer\u201d) move, pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 702 and <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>to exclude \u201cproposed expert testimony that Rezulin can cause a liver injury, or exacerbate a pre-existing liver condition, in the absence of marked elevation of liver enzymes while the patient was taking the medication.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Plaintiffs\u2019 Executive Committee, which is responsible for coordinating the activities of plaintiffs during pretrial proceedings,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> retained the experts and is defending this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-13\">\n<em>I. The Legal Backdrop and the Positions of the Parties</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b433-14\">Causation in toxic tort cases has two components, general and specific, and the plaintiff must establish both in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>prevail.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cGeneral causation is whether a substance is,capable of causing a particular injury or condition in the general population, while specific causation is whether a substance caused a particular individual\u2019s injury.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As explained in the Federal Judicial Center\u2019s <em>Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-3\">\u201cGeneral causation is established by demonstrating, often through a review of scientific and medical literature, that exposure to a substance can cause a particular disease (e.g., that smoking cigarettes can cause lung cancer). Specific, or individual, causation, however, is established by demonstrating that a given exposure is the cause of an individual\u2019s disease (e.g., that a specific plaintiffs lung cancer was caused by his smoking).\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">Plaintiffs offer the testimony of a number of expert witnesses to prove general caus\u00e1tion. As relevant here, they would opine that Rezulin is capable of causing liver injury \u201csilently,\u201d that is without markedly elevating liver enzymes, and that such injury is a consequence of a form of liver cell death, known as apoptosis, that the experts assert can be induced by Rezu-lin.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Pfizer contends that plaintiffs\u2019 experts\u2019 testimony is insufficiently reliable to satisfy <em>Daubert </em>and Rule 702. It claims that their theories are unsupported by testing and that the potential rate of error therefore cannot be determined. They maintain also that they have not been subjected to peer review and publication and that they do not have widespread acceptance in the scientific community. Furthermore, Pfizer argues that the opinions of plaintiffs\u2019 experts are not the product of independent research but were developed solely for this litigation and, finally, that the experts overlook or ignore contrary evidence. The plaintiffs resist these assertions.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">\n<em>11. Proceedings on the Motion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b434-11\">Each side has submitted thousands of pages of expert reports, scientific and medical articles, depositions and other documents in connection with the motion. The Court heard oral argument and then conducted a two-day evidentiary hearing at which three of the plaintiffs\u2019 experts and one defense expert testified.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Court then had the benefit of extensive proposed findings of fact from each side and point-by-point responses .to each set of proposed findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-12\">\n<em>III. Scientific Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AmV\">\n<em>A. Relevant Physiology</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Arn\">\n<em>1. Cells</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b434-13\">The human body consists of cells. The cell has three basic components: the nucleus, the cytoplasm, and the plasma mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>brane.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The nucleus contains the cell\u2019s genetic information.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The plasma membrane surrounds the cell and \u201cacts as a selective barrier that enables the cell to concentrate nutrients gathered from its environment and retain the products it synthesizes for its own use, while excreting waste products.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The cytoplasm is defined as everything besides the nucleus and cell membrane,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and it contains among other things membrane-bound structures known as organelles, of which one type is the mitochondrion (in the plural, mitochondria).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The mitochondria sometimes are referred to as the \u201cpowerhouse\u201d of the cell<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> because chemical reactions occurring therein produce adenosine triphosphate (\u201cATP\u201d), the cell\u2019s energy currency.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">\n<em>2. The Liver\u2022</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">The liver, located in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, is a large organ that plays a central role in the body\u2019s biochemical activity. It metabolizes, or breaks down, a large number of substances, synthesizes essential enzymes, and detoxifies and eliminates a variety of compounds from both within and without the liver.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> A vein known as the portal vein carries to the liver all blood from the digestive tract, facilitating the liver\u2019s absorption of toxic chemicals that a person has ingested.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Most of the liver\u2019s. biochemical functions take place within cells known as hepatocytes, which are the predominant type of cell in the liver.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-19\">Medicine recognizes many forms of liver disease, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (\u201cNAFLD\u201d), described as \u201cfatty liver without inflammation,\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and a related condition<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> known as non-alcoholic stea-tohepatitis (\u201cNASH\u201d), described as \u201cfatty liver with inflammation.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> These conditions are associated with fibrosis,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>scribed as \u201cscarring of the liver\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and more precisely as \u201cthe presence of excess extracellular matrix.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Fibrosis can lead to cirrhosis,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> a final stage of liver disease in which \u201cgroups of hepatocytes become completely encased by fibrous material, and nodules replace normal lobular organization.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> When liver disease is \u201cmoderately advanced,\u201d \u201cfibrosis often appears as connective tissue that spans portal and central areas,\u201d a condition known as \u201cbridging fibrosis.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">\n<em>3. Mechanisms of Cell Death</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AWL\">Some of the plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses base their proposed testimony on theories relating <em>to </em>death of liver cells allegedly attributable to Rezulin.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">There are two basic mechanisms of cell death: necrosis and apoptosis.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Experts from both sides agree on their basic features.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">In necrotic cell death, the cell membrane ruptures, and the contents of the cell are discharged into the surrounding tissue. Among these cellular contents in the liver are enzymes, including alanine amino-transferase (\u201cALT\u201d) and aspartate amino-transferase (\u201cAST\u201d) (collectively, \u201ctransa-minases\u201d).<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Thus, necrotic cell death in the liver in sufficiently large quantities is accompanied by elevations of liver enzyme concentration in the blood<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-15\">In apoptosis, by contrast, the dying cell shrinks and is engulfed and digested by neighboring phagocytes,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> described in one of the expert reports as \u201ctissue clean up cells.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Apoptosis sometimes is known as \u201cprogrammed cell death\u201d or \u201ccell suicide.\u201d <footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Like necrosis, it is \u201coften naturally initiated by the body to eliminate cells that are no longer needed\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> and is necessary for human survival.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-16\">Apoptosis in the liver usually is not accompanied by enzyme elevation because the phagocytes typically devour the apop-totic cells before the latter release their contents into blood. Apoptosis in the liver, however, may result in elevated liver enzymes when it takes place on such a scale that the ability of viable cells to remove dying cells is overwhelmed.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>\n<em>B. Drugs, Toxicity to the Liver, and Re-zulin</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Because the liver \u201cis central to the metabolic disposition of virtually all drugs and foreign substances,\u201d liver injury \u201cis a potential complication of nearly every medication that is prescribed.\u201d <footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Experts from both sides agree that liver injury caused by drugs is typically categorized as hepa-tocellular, cholestatic, or mixed based on the pattern of blood test results. Hepato-cellular injury is injury to hepatocytes and is manifested by elevated quantities of transaminases in the blood. Cholestatic injury is injury to the liver\u2019s ability to produce and excrete bile and is manifested by elevated quantities of alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. The injury is mixed if features of both hepatocellular and choles-tatic injury are present.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">In general, drugs are either predictable or unpredictable (idiosyncratic) toxins to the liver, or hepatotoxins. Predictable toxins are dose-dependent. Unpredictable toxins, while capable of producing damage at therapeutic doses, do. so rarely.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-13\">There is no dispute that a small percentage of patients treated with Rezulin developed reversible elevations of ALT of more than three times the upper limit of normal.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> The mechanism by which Rezulin is toxic to liver cells is not well understood.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> The defendants\u2019 experts believe that Rezu-lin is an idiosyncratic hepatotoxin, inducing liver injury on an unpredictable basis in a very small number of cases.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> The plaintiffs\u2019 experts believe that Rezulin can be directly toxic to cells, even though the drug exhibits features of idiosyncratic toxicity.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Liver injury attributable to Rezu-lin is predominantly hepatocellular,<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> but the defendants do not dispute, at least for purposes of this motion, that the drug is capable of causing cholestatic or mixed injury.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>\n<em>C. Patient Population</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">Type 2 diabetes affects an estimated 16 million Americans.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> It is associated with obesity, and both obesity and diabetes are associated with NAFLD and NASH.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Approximately 50 percent of patients with diabetes have NAFLD.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> (The prevalence of NAFLD in the general population of the United States was once estimated at 24 percent and is likely higher today.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark>) The percentage of diabetics with NASH is unknown but probably smaller.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">\n<em>D. Evidence of Causation in Medicine</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">The expert testimony in this ease purports to be grounded on a number of scientific and medical studies. For the sake of context, the Court briefly reviews principles regarding the applicability of different kinds of scientific and medical research.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">The \u201cgold standard\u201d for determining the relationship between a drug and a health outcome is the clinical trial. In such investigations, subjects are assigned randomly to one of two groups: one exposed, and the other not exposed, to the drug of interest. Such studies, however, are not always available, at least in part because ethical constraints preclude exposing human beings to agents known or thought to be toxic.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Thus, other kinds of evidence often are used to assess whether a drug or agent is related to the risk of developing a certain condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-12\">Chief among these are observational epidemiological studies, in which subjects that were exposed to an agent prior to the investigation are compared with subjects not so exposed.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-13\">Another type of information used by physicians and medical researchers is the case report, which is a description of a particular patient\u2019s clinical history and symptoms. As explained in the <em>Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-14\">\u201cCase reports lack controls and thus do not provide as much information as controlled epidemiological studies do. However, case reports are often all that is available on a particular subject.... Causal attribution based on case studies must be regarded with caution. However, such studies may be carefully considered in light of other information available, including toxicological data.\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-15\">The difficulty with case reports, in other words, is distinguishing between association and causation. Simply because a patient exposed to a particular substance exhibited a set of symptoms does not mean that it was the substance that caused the symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-16\">In addition to research on humans, scientists often perform experiments on living animals, such as rats, mice, and monkeys. The advantages of such studies include the fact that they can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>conducted as true experiments, with exposure controlled and measured and ethical limitations diminished.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Nevertheless, although it is \u201ca basic principle of toxicology and pharmacology\u201d that \u201ca compound causing an effect in one mammalian species [usually] will cause it in another,\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> extrapolation from animal studies to humans cannot be done uncritically. For one thing, different species have important physiological differences. For another, the high doses often used in animal studies may not correspond to considerably lower concentrations of a drug or other substance to which humans are in reality exposed.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Finally, researchers frequently conduct experiments on cell and tissue cultures. These experiments, sometimes referred to as <em>in vitro </em>studies to distinguish them from studies performed <em>in vivo, </em>meaning on live humans and animals, also are subject to the problem of extrapolation. It is not always clear that \u201cone can generalize findings from the artificial setting of tissues in laboratories to whole human beings.\u201d <footnotemark>61</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">\n<em>TV. The Proposed Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">The defendants do not challenge the admissibility of expert testimony to the effect that Rezulin is capable of causing liver injury that results in elevation of liver enzymes. They train their fire only on opinion testimony that the drug is capable of doing so \u201csilently,\u201d that is, without markedly elevating those enzymes approximately concurrently with treatment.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> The defendants challenge aspects of the opinions of five expert witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-14\">Before reviewing the challenged testimony, a preliminary note is in order. The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel at every stage have gone further than their experts. They have formed hypotheses that the experts nowhere mentioned, they have forged connections that the experts stopped short of drawing, and they have portrayed as sturdy hypotheses that the experts espoused hesitantly if at all. None of these elaborations by counsel is relevant. The subject of this motion is the proposed testimony of expert's, not the theories of the lawyers.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-15\">\n<em>A. The Experts and Their Opinions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AiqQ\">\n<em>1. Dr. Smith</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b439-16\">The opinion of Dr. Martyn T. Smith, who testified at the evidentiary hearing, is central to this motion. Dr. Smith is a toxicologist. He holds a Ph.D. and is a professor in the Division of Environmental Health Sciences at the University of California at Berkeley\u2019s School of Public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>Health. He is not a clinician and has no training in hepatology.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">Dr. Smith opines that \u201c[a] careful review of all of the literature allows one to conclude to a reasonable degree of scientific probability that [Rezulin] more likely than not ... can damage the liver \u2018silently\u2019 because apoptosis does not cause elevation of liver enzymes in serum.\u201d<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> He states \u201cthat to a reasonable degree of scientific probability troglitazone<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> can induce apop-totic death of cells in the liver in humans <em>in vivo. </em>\u201d<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Dr. Smith offers two major mechanisms by which Rezulin could cause apoptosis. The first involves a cascade of chemical events in which the mitochondria cease functioning normally and release a protein into the cytoplasm that triggers apopto-sis.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> The second involves the bile salt export pump, or BSEP. The BSEP is a protein in the plasma membranes of hepa-tocytes that pumps bile salt out of the cell. Dr. Smith states that Rezulin can interfere with the functioning of the pump, leading to the build-up of toxic bile salts in the cells and that this condition triggers apop-tosis.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">\n<em>2. Dr. Reed</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">Dr. John C. Reed\u2019s opinion also is a major subject of this motion. Dr. Reed is the president and chief executive officer of the Burnham Institute, a research center in La Jolla, California.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> He holds an M.D. and a Ph.D.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> and has described himself as follows: \u201cI don\u2019t consider myself a liver expert or hepatology expert. I consider myself an apoptosis expert.\u201d<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> Dr. Reed testified at the evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-16\">Dr. Reed\u2019s declarations are intended to \u201caddress[ ] the evidence that Rezulin (tro-glitazone) induces apoptosis in human and animal cells.\u201d<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> Dr. Reed\u2019s declarations do not say that a Rezulin-induced injury could be silent.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> His testimony therefore is relevant only to the extent that it provides support for the other experts \u2014 principally Dr. Smith \u2014 who are willing to draw that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-17\">\n<em>S. Dr. Julie</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b440-18\">Neil Julie, M.D., practices gastroenterol-ogy and hepatology in a Maryland suburb of Washington, D.C.,<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> and also testified at the evidentiary hearing. His initial declaration is organized for the most part as a set of conclusions, each in the form of a single sentence and each followed by the statement that \u201c[m]y opinions are based upon my education, training and experience as well as my review of the following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>materials\u201d and then a long list of documents, medical articles, and testimony. The conclusions relevant here are that \u201cRezulin causes a multitude of hepatocellu-lar injuries including but not limited to ... apoptosis .... \u201d and \u201cRezulin liver injury can occur without an elevation of AST and ALT.\u201d<footnotemark>75</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">The plaintiffs submitted a second declaration from Dr. Julie to address:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-6\">\u201cthe tools a medical doctor should appropriately utilize in order to diagnose a medical condition generally and, more specifically, the use of differential diagnosis [<footnotemark>76</footnotemark>] with respect to a Rezulin-relat-ed hepatic injury, including evidence of studies showing mitochondrial damage and apoptosis caused by Rezulin.\u201d<footnotemark>77</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">Dr. Julie concludes: \u201cit is my opinion that it would be inappropriate to broadly conclude that a patient did not suffer a drug-induced liver injury from Rezulin simply based upon the absence of a marked elevation in liver enzymes.\u201d<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> In support of this statement, Dr. Julie states among other things that \u201c[a] physician performing a differential diagnosis must consider. ... relevant scientific evidence\u201d of Rezulin\u2019s \u201ctoxic effect on mitochondria and its ability to induce cell death via apoptosis.\u201d<footnotemark>79</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">Dr. Julie acknowledged that his view that Rezulin is toxic to the mitochondria is derived from the opinions of Drs. Smith and Reed and the articles they cite for support.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-18\">A <em>Dr. Day</em></p>\n<p id=\"b441-19\">Dr. Christopher P. Day is a research scientist and practicing hepatologist. He holds an M.D. and a Ph.D. and is a professor at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne in the United Kingdom.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> His report is concerned mainly with illustrating the varied ways in which Rezulin and other drugs can injure the liver.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-20\">As relevant here, Dr. Day would testify that \u201ca biologically plausible explanation for why many patients with liver disease post-exposure to troglitazone may not have had significant elevations of their transa-minase levels\u201d is that cells undergoing apoptosis are consumed by surrounding cells.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> Dr. Day\u2019s declaration further states that cholestasis and mitochondrial injury are \u201cbiologically plausible mechanisms for the development of apoptosis in patients exposed to troglitazone.\u201d<footnotemark>83</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A9x\">The Court notes that cholestatic injury normally results in increased bilirubin or alkaline phosphatase<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> and that Dr. Day does not say that apoptosis related to cho-lestasis, if it occurs at all, would not affect bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels. Furthermore, Dr. Day does not say that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>apoptosis related to mitochondrial injury could cause injury without an elevation of transaminases. In other words, Dr. Day does not appear to offer the testimony that the defendants are seeking to exclude, which is the opinion that Rezulin can cause liver injury without an elevation in at least one of the four substances. His testimony therefore is of limited relevance. The Court nonetheless considers it insofar as it could be read to suggest that any injury caused by Rezulin would be silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">\n<em>5. Dr. Bonkovsky</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Herbert L. Bonkovsky, M.D., is a hepa-tologist and a professor at the University of Connecticut Medical School.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> The thrust of his opinion is that Rezulin \u201ccauses a wide spectrum of liver disease.\u201d<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> He states among other things that liver inflammation \u201csuch as that caused by Rezulin\u201d can lead to bridging fibrosis and cirrhosis and that \u201c[tjhese injuries have been observed in many cases with either normal or near normal values of ALT.\u201d<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> Dr. Bonkovsky, however, does not say that any such injuries that have been observed were due to Rezulin, nor does he provide any support for the statement that those injuries occurred with normal values of ALT.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Elsewhere in his declaration Dr. Bon-kovsky opines that apoptosis<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> and inhibition of the BSEP<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> are plausible mechanisms of injury due to Rezulin. In addition, Dr. Bonkovsky\u2019s opinion reviews some of the research cited in the reports of Drs. Reed and Smith for the proposition that Rezulin can affect the mitochondria.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> But Dr. Bonkovsky does not attempt to relate these statements, nor does he state that an effect on the mitochondria could cause apoptosis or that any injuries due to inhibition of the BSEP or apoptosis would be silent. He states without significant elaboration that he agrees with the views expressed in Dr. Smith\u2019s report \u201con the various mechanisms of action associated with Rezu-lin,\u201d <footnotemark>91</footnotemark> but there is no indication that Dr. Bonkovsky intends to testify that Rezu-lin can cause liver injury silently.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">\n<em>6. Summary</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">To the extent the experts would testify that Rezulin can cause \u201csilent\u201d liver injury, they have postulated a causal chain in which Rezulin can affect the mitochondria or the BSEP and thus trigger apoptosis, which would be injurious but silent. A graphical representation of the theory might be useful:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-9\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>\n<em>B. The Science upon Which the Experts Rely</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">The Court now will review the scientific research that the experts cite in support of their opinions. As will be discussed in a later section, the Court does not necessarily agree that all of the cited studies support the conclusions. The Court\u2019s concern for the time being, however, is to present the experts\u2019 own case. Nonetheless, at certain points in the following discussion, the Court will add its own observations\u2014 for example, comments on aspects of the studies, on the nature of the connections between the studies and the expert opinions, or on the absence of certain kinds of evidence \u2014 when it believes that additional information is essential to evaluate the testimony in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">As an initial matter, the plaintiffs\u2019 experts cite no studies that say that Rezulin can cause a silent liver -injury. There are no clinical trials and no observational epidemiological studies supporting the plaintiffs\u2019 position. Nor have the plaintiffs pointed to any clinical case in which Rezu-lin was believed to have caused such an injury.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> Rather, the opinions at issue on this motion are based on studies that the experts say support individual links in their causal chain. In particular, the experts have cited studies that connect Rezu-lin to apoptosis, studies that connect Rezu-lin to mitochondrial damage, and studies that connect Rezulin to an effect on the BSEP. Nearly all of these studies were conducted <em>in vitro.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b444-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>\n<em>1. Early Links in the Proposed Causal Chain: The Claim that Rezulin Causes Apoptosis Through Effects on the Mitochondria or the BSEP</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">a. Studies Connecting Rezulin to Apop-tosis</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">The Court begins with studies cited by the experts for the proposition that Rezu-lin caused apoptosis in certain kinds of cells.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">At the outset, it is important to note that none of these studies dealt with normal human liver cells. The plaintiffs and their experts imply that Kostrubsky et al. (2000),<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> a study that found that Rezulin was toxic to normal human liver cells at certain concentrations, shows that Rezulin produces apoptosis. That study, however, says nothing at all about whether the cell death occurred via apoptosis or necrosis.<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> The same is true of several other studies cited by the plaintiffs and their experts, including Ramachandran et al. (1999).<footnotemark>95</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-12\">The experts cite one study in which Rezulin was found to cause apoptosis in rat hepatocytes. Toyoda et al. (2001) found that Rezulin produced this effect at concentrations of 15 p.M<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> and above.<footnotemark>97</footnotemark> Furthermore, a Warner-Lambert scientist tentatively reached the same conclusion from the company\u2019s own data.<footnotemark>98</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-13\">The experts cite four<footnotemark>99</footnotemark> studies in which Rezulin was found to produce apoptosis in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>human liver cancer cells. Bae and Song (2003), Toyoda et al. (2002), Yoshizawa et al. (2002), and Yamamoto et al. (2001) observed that Rezulin produced this result in a dose-dependent fashion above certain concentrations.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">In addition, the experts cite a number of studies in which Rezulin at certain concentrations produced apoptosis in cultured cancer cells of other organs. Harris and Phipps (2002) found that troglitazone induces apoptosis in malignant white blood cells. Ohta et al. (2001) observed a similar result in thyroid cancer cells. Tsubouchi et al. (2000) found the same in lung cancer cells. Guan et al. (1999) did so in bladder cancer cells, and Takahashi et al. (1999) and Sato et al. (2000) obtained this result in stomach cancer cells. Finally, Dr. Reed cites a trio of cases on prostate cancer cells, but they did not find that Rezulin produces apoptosis in human cells.<footnotemark>100</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Several of the studies on cancer cells examined the effect of Rezulin in concert with other substances. For example, the Kim et al. (2002) study examined the effect on lines of ovarian cancer cells of combining an anti-tumor agent known as TRAIL with troglitazone. The researchers found that troglitazone combined with TRAIL (but neither alone) killed tumor cells; the mechanism was believed to be apoptosis. Similarly, Elstner et al. (1998) found that the combination of troglitazone and another chemical (but neither by itself) caused apoptosis in human breast cancer cells.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">Finally, the experts cite studies on what Dr. Reed describes as \u201cnormal\u201d cells from other organs.<footnotemark>101</footnotemark> Gouni-Berthold et al. (2001) and Okura et al. (2000) obtained results suggesting that troglitazone caused apoptosis in cultures of a type of blood vessel cell taken from r\u00e1ts and associated with atherosclerosis in humans. YamazaH et al. (2002) and Kawahito et al. (2000) derived a similar result for cultures of a type of cell that destroys the joints of patients with rheumatoid arthritis because it proliferates like a tumor. And Rovin et al. (2002) found that troglitazone induces cell death believed to be apoptotic in a type of kidney cell that proliferates in response to injury but that can cause kidney failure if the proliferation is excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">b. Studies Connecting Rezulin to Mitochondrial Damage</p>\n<p id=\"b445-12\">In addition to the studies that show apoptosis from Rezulin, albeit not in normal human liver cells, the experts cite studies showing that Rezulin can affect the mitochondria of liver cells. A preliminary clarification is called for. Toxicity from Rezulin. linked to mitochondrial damage is not necessarily relevant to the silent injury theory. It is uncontested that an injury would not be silent if it occurred by necrosis. The studies on mitochondria are relevant to the silent injury theory set forth in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>the expert reports only to the extent that those studies can be used to connect Rezu-lin with apoptosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">The experts cite a number of studies in which Rezulin caused morphologic, or structural, changes to mitochondria. Caldwell et al. (2001a) administered normal doses of Rezulin to NASH patients for six months and examined, among other things, their mitochondria. These investigators found that more of the mitochondria had a misshapen and unusually elongated appearance after treatment. They found as well \u201ca decrease in the mean total number of mitochondria ... and an increase in the mean percentage of mitochondria that were enlarged and contained intramito-chondrial crystals ... but neither change was statistically significant.\u201d<footnotemark>102</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Although Drs. Smith\u2019s and Reed\u2019s expert reports do not mention it, these researchers looked for evidence of apoptosis. They examined the post-treatment biopsies of five patients with an electron microscope and found that \u201cfeatures of apoptosis (bleb formation, nuclear fragmentation) were not evident.\u201d<footnotemark>103</footnotemark> They then applied a biochemical marker that detects apoptosis and found \u201c[n]o statistically significant difference between the before and after specimens[.]\u201d<footnotemark>104</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Apart from Caldwell et al. (2001a), the other mitochondria studies all were performed <em>in vitro. </em>Shishido et al. (2003) applied troglitazone at concentrations up to 50 p,M \u2014 the researchers chose that concentration because it had prevented the cells from proliferating without inducing apoptosis in a previous study performed on liver cancer cells<footnotemark>105</footnotemark> \u2014 to an immortalized<footnotemark>106</footnotemark> cell line and found \u201cmarked enlargement\u201d<footnotemark>107</footnotemark> and other abnormalities in the mitochondria. Tirmenstein et al. (2002) applied the drug to liver cancer cells and found \u201cextensive alterations in mitochondrial morphology.\u201d<footnotemark>108</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-14\">Several of the studies cited by the experts measured a quantity known as the mitochondrial membrane potential, which is the electrical gradient, or polarization, between the outside and inside of a mito-chondrion. A decrease in this polarization indicates that the mitochondria are not functioning normally. Haskins et al. (2001) found that troglitazone at certain concentrations produced a decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential in rat hepatocytes and in the hepatocytes of one diabetic human donor, but not in the cells of another diabetic donor. These researchers wrote that \u201c[f]uture studies should address the downstream effects of these changes, since nuclear condensation and apoptosis are observed as late effects that are shared by\u201d troglitazone\u2019s chemical family.<footnotemark>109</footnotemark> Shishido et al. (2003) and Tir-menstein et al. (2002) found that troglita-zone at certain concentrations depolarized the mitochondrial membrane in the'immortalized liver cells and in liver cancer cells, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>Dr. Smith\u2019s reports, but not Dr. Reed\u2019s, argue that the above-described effects on the mitochondria link Rezulin to apoptosis. Dr. Smith begins with the statement that \u201c[t]he decline in mitochondrial transmem-brane potential seen in these experiments is called the mitochondrial permeability transition.\u201d<footnotemark>110</footnotemark> Dr. Smith continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0C\">\u201cDuring the mitochondrial permeability transition, pores in the mitochondrial membrane are opened and [a protein known as] cytochrome c is released into the cytoplasm.... The cell \u2018knows\u2019 the cytochrome e should be normally be [sic ] inside the mitochondria, so when it l\u00e9aks out it acts as a signal telling the cell that the mitochondria are badly damaged, and this stimulates the cell to commit suicide (i.e. apoptosis)[.]\u201d <footnotemark>111</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOW\">Dr. Smith here cites Ravagnan et al. (2002). That article<footnotemark>112</footnotemark> states that once a cell has been induced to die, \u201cthe outer mitochondrial membrane becomes completely permeabilized to proteins, resulting in the leakage of potentially toxic mitochondrial intermembrane proteins\u201d \u2014 the authors include cytochrome c in this category \u2014 \u201cthat orchestrate the degradation phase of apoptosis.\u201d <footnotemark>113</footnotemark> Ravagnan et al. (2002) thus does not say, as Dr. Smith seems to, that mitochondrial change (due to Rezulin or otherwise) alone can be an <em>independent cause\" </em>of apoptosis. Rather, the authors view certain mitochondrial changes as themselves products of some prior cause of cell death and as one <em>step </em>in a chain of events that leads to apoptosis. Another article cited by Dr. Smith, Bissell et al. (2001), reflects a similar understanding.<footnotemark>114</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">A cited study that does agree with Dr. Smith<footnotemark>115</footnotemark> is Kim et al. (2003). These researchers found that the change in permeability of the mitochondrial membrane triggered cell death in rat hepatocytes. This paper, however, reports that the cell will undergo apoptosis \u2014 as opposed.to necrosis \u2014 only if there is sufficient ATP. The organized death of the cell is a process that consumes energy, and without energy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>(in the form of ATP), the cell defaults to the necrotic mode of death.<footnotemark>116</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">Another paper that agrees that the depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane itself can be a cause of cell death is Tirmenstein et al. (2002). This study, however, does not indicate whether the cell death occurs via apoptosis or necrosis, and it specifies that troglitazone leads to a decrease in the amount of ATP in the cell. Furthermore, the concentrations at which troglitazone produced cell death in this study were higher than those at which it began to affect the mitochondria.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Dr. Smith continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-6\">\u201cA protein in the cytoplasm, called Bax, then migrates to the mitochondrial membranes and accelerates the apoptotic process by making the mitochondrial membrane even more permeable, thus further releasing even more cytochrome c into the cytoplasm thereby speeding up the apoptotic process[.]\u201d<footnotemark>117</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Here Dr. Smith cites Smaili et al. (2001). Those researchers found that a decline in the mitochondrial membrane potential precedes the attachment of Bax to the mitochondria in cells genetically engineered to overproduce Bax. The authors sum up the implications of their research this way: \u201cour results suggest that alterations in mitochondrial energization <em>associated with </em>apoptosis can initiate Bax docking to mitochondria.\u201d <footnotemark>118</footnotemark> The study, in other words, says nothing about whether mitochondrial dysfunction (whether caused by Rezulin or otherwise) is an independent cause of apoptosis. This study, like the research reviewed in Ravagnan et al. (2002), created conditions known to induce apoptosis and then examined the sequence of events within the cell.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-11\">Dr. Smith concludes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-12\">\u201cFor TRO induced liver cell apoptosis, this process has recently been studied in detail by Bae and Song.... They found a critical role for Bax and [a protein known as JNK] activation in TRO induced liver cell apoptosis.... TRO ... induced apoptosis that was preceded by activation of JNK ... and increased levels of Bax [and] release of cytochrome c....\u201d<footnotemark>119</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-13\">Bae and Song (2003), as mentioned above, found that troglitazone causes apoptosis in liver cancer cells. They found as well that TRO increases the levels of proteins associated with apoptosis, including Bax and cytochrome c. They did not, however, examine the mitochondria.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-14\">c. Studies Connecting Rezulin to an Effect on the BSEP</p>\n<p id=\"b448-15\">Dr. Smith\u2019s other proposed mechanism through which Rezulin allegedly could cause silent injury involves the BSEP. As with the evidence on mitochondria, and for the same reasons, any effect on the BSEP is relevant to the silent injury theory only to the extent that it connects Rezulin with apoptosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-16\">The experts cite several articles in which Rezulin was found to interfere with the ability of cells to export bile salts. Preminger et al. (1999) reported that troglita-zone interfered with the flow of bile in isolated rat livers. Two studies by Funk et al. confirmed this result in live rats; they found that when troglitazone was administered to rats, there was an increase in the concentration of bile acid in the rats\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>blood plasma believed to have been caused by interference with the BSEP. Elevation of bile acid is analogous to elevation of bilirubin;<footnotemark>120</footnotemark> both indicate a cholestatic injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">To connect the presumed effect on the BSEP to apoptosis, Dr. Smith and Dr. Reed cite a group of studies and review articles.<footnotemark>121</footnotemark> All are concerned with elucidating the biochemical mechanisms by which the build-up of bile in the liver can produce apoptosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">\n<em>2. The Last Link in the Chain: The Claim that Apoptosis from Rezulin Causes Silent Injury</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 experts have cited no evidence that any apoptosis caused by Rezu-lin can result in a silent injury. That is, the plaintiffs\u2019 experts have offered no evidence that apoptosis caused by Rezulin, if any, occurs at a clinically significant level or, even if it does, that the resulting injury would remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">The following exchange occurred during Dr. Smith\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-8\">\u201cThe Court: I think ... it is your view ... that doses of Rezulin that have been shown to be cytotoxic in cell studies obviously can be achieved in some human cells. We agree so far?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A73\">\u201cThe Witness: Sure. I agree on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-9\">\u201cThe Court: ... [W]hat, if anything, does that tell us on an empirical basis, as opposed to a theological basis, [about] whether achievement of those doses in some undefinable proportion of liver cells has any serious adverse consequences for anybody? ... Isn\u2019t it entirely possible, and indeed probable, that there is some minimal number or proportion of liver cells that have to be killed off before there is any interference with the fiver\u2019s functioning that matters to anybody?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-14\">\u201cThe Witness: That is true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-15\">\u201cThe Court: Right. Do we know what this, and how it relates to the effect of Rezulin?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-16\">\u201cThe Witness: I don\u2019t think we do know, your Honor.\u201d<footnotemark>122</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-17\">Dr. Reed testified in a similar way. The following exchange occurred during his cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-18\">\u201cQ. Doctor, you testified that you believe it is possible that Rezulin could be inducing a low level of apoptosis in human fivers, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-19\">\u201cA. Yes, I believe that is possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-20\">\u201cQ.... [D]o you have any study or any data to support that sustained apoptosis has resulted in clinical injury in a patient taking Rezulin?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-21\">\u201cA. Such a study has not been performed, to my knowledge.\u201d<footnotemark>123</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-22\">Dr. Reed further testified as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-23\">\u201cThe Court: So just to try to put it in bottom line colloquial terms, even assuming ... everything you and Dr. Smith have said about the capability of Rezulin to induce apoptosis in particular fiver cells at what I will call for the sake of quickness relevant concentrations, we have no empirical data that indicates to us how many or what percentage of the fiver cells are in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>jured in that way in vivo and what the threshold level of injury, in terms of numbers or proportion of liver cells, needs to be before there is any clinical injury to the patient?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-4\">\u201cThe Witness: No, we really don\u2019t know the percentage. All we know is, as I have said, one out of every 50 people has sufficient cell death occurring ... that their transaminase levels rose when they took the drug.\u201d<footnotemark>124</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">\n<em>C. Arguments that Rezulin Can Cause Silent Liver Injury Through Mechanisms Other than Apoptosis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Aop\">In addition to the apoptosis theory, the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel have argued that liver injury caused by Rezulin can be silent either because Rezulin suppresses the production of enzymes in the liver or because the enzymes might have been depleted already in a patient with pre-existing liver injury.<footnotemark>125</footnotemark> The logical implication is that even if the apoptosis theory discussed above were unsubstantiated or incorrect, plausible mechanisms by which Rezulin can cause silent liver injury would remain. The problem is that these mechanisms, for the most part, were proposed by the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, not their experts. To the limited extent that they have been adopted by the experts, they are not supported.<footnotemark>126</footnotemark> The only physiological explanation offered by the plaintiffs\u2019 experts in support of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>their opinion that Rezulin can cause liver injury silently that requires further consideration is that involving apoptosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">\n<em>D. Patients Whose Liver Enzymes Were Not Monitored</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel raise the possibility that some people had abnormally elevated liver enzymes while on Rezulin therapy that were not recorded, either because the patient was not tested or was not tested at a time when the enzymes were elevated.<footnotemark>127</footnotemark> The Court recognizes this possibility. But it has no bearing on the present motion, as it does not speak to whether Rezulin <em>can </em>cause liver injury through a mechanism that does not result also in elevated enzymes.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">\n<em>V. Law Governing the Admission of Expert Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\"><em>A. </em>Daubert <em>and Its Progeny</em></p>\n<p id=\"ANjX\">The standard governing a district court\u2019s determination whether to admit scientific or other expert testimony is familiar. Federal Rule of Evidence 702 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-11\">\u201cIf scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if (1) the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods, and (8) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-12\">This rule incorporates principles established by the Supreme Court in <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.</em><footnotemark><em>128</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Court there recognized that district judges have a \u201cgatekeeping\u201d<footnotemark>129</footnotemark> role in which they must ensure that \u201cscientific testimony or evidence admitted is not only relevant, but reliable.\u201d<footnotemark>130</footnotemark> <em>Daubert </em>observed that the relaxation for expert witnesses of the usual requirement of first-hand knowledge presumably \u201cis premised on an assumption that the expert\u2019s opinion will have a reliable basis in the knowledge and experience <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>of his discipline.\u201d<footnotemark>131</footnotemark> For that reason, a trial judge must \u201cmake certain that an expert ... employs in the courtroom the same level of intellectual rigor that characterizes the practice of an expert in the relevant field.\u201d<footnotemark>132</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">A federal district judge faced with a challenge to the admissibility of expert testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-5\">\u201cmust determine at the outset ... whether the expert is proposing to testify to ... scientific knowledge that ... will assist the trier of fact to understand or determine a fact in issue. This entails a preliminary assessment of whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid and of whether that reasoning or methodology properly can be applied to the facts in issue.\u201d<footnotemark>133</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">These matters are to be determined by a preponderance of proof.<footnotemark>134</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">The inquiry is \u201ca flexible one.\u201d<footnotemark>135</footnotemark> In <em>Daubert, </em>the Supreme Court articulated four pertinent factors while leaving open the possibility of others: (1) whether the expert\u2019s theory \u201ccan be (and has been) tested;\u201d (2) whether the theory \u201chas been subjected to peer review and publication;\u201d (3) the \u201cknown or potential rate of error;\u201d and (4) whether the theory has \u201cwidespread acceptance.\u201d<footnotemark>136</footnotemark> Courts have considered other factors as well, including whether an expert\u2019s opinion was developed for litigation and whether the expert has accounted adequately for obvious alternative explanations.<footnotemark>137</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-16\">In addition, Rule 702\u2019s requirement that the proposed testimony \u201cassist the trier of fact to ... determine a fact in issue\u201d means that the proffered testimony must be \u201csufficiently tied to the facts of the case that it will aid the jury in resolving a factual dispute.\u201d<footnotemark>138</footnotemark> The <em>Daubert </em>decision recognized that this consideration, which has been described as one of \u201cfit,\u201d \u201cgoes primarily to relevance.\u201d<footnotemark>139</footnotemark> A district court therefore is not required \u201cto admit opinion evidence that is connected to existing data only by the <em>ipse dixit </em>of the expert. A court may conclude that there is simply too great an analytical gap between the data and the opinion proffered.\u201d <footnotemark>140</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Thus in <em>General Electric Co. v. </em>Joiner,<footnotemark>141</footnotemark> the Supreme Court held that a district court did not abuse its discretion when it excluded the testimony of experts that exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) was likely responsible for the lung cancer of an electrician who was a smoker and had a family history of lung cancer. The Supreme Court found that the animal studies on which the experts relied, which involved exposing infant mice to massive doses of PCBs, \u201cwere so dissimilar to the facts presented in this litigation that it was not an abuse of discretion for the District Court to have rejected the experts\u2019 reliance on them.\u201d<footnotemark>142</footnotemark> The Supreme Court likewise did not take issue with the district court\u2019s conclusions that four epidemiological studies were not a reliable basis for the experts\u2019 opinions. In two of the four studies, the authors were unwilling to conclude that PCB exposure had caused cancer in the observed workers. The third study did not even involve PCBs, and the subjects in the fourth had been exposed to numerous carcinogens in addition to PCBs.<footnotemark>143</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The Second Circuit\u2019s recent case law follows the logic of <em>Joiner </em>and <em>Daubert. </em>In <em>Amorgianos v. National Railroad Passenger Corp.,</em><footnotemark><em>144</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Circuit reiterated the familiar principles governing the admissibility of expert testimony and further held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-6\">\u201c[t]o warrant admissibility ... it is critical that an expert\u2019s analysis be reliable at every step.... In deciding whether a step in an expert\u2019s analysis is unreliable, the district court should undertake a rigorous examination of the facts on which the expert relies, the method by which the expert draws an opinion from those facts, and how the expert applies the facts and methods to the case at hand.\u201d<footnotemark>145</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-13\">In that case the district court was confronted with expert testimony that, among other things, exposure to certain toxic chemicals was a general cause of the type of neuropathy allegedly suffered by the plaintiff bridge painter. The district court \u201cconducted an extremely thorough review of the scientific literature\u201d on which those experts relied.<footnotemark>146</footnotemark> The Circuit found that this review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-14\">\u201cwas certainly within the broad discretion afforded to the district court under <em>Daubert </em>and its progeny, and did not impinge upon the jury\u2019s function. It is precisely such an undertaking that assures that an expert, when formulating an opinion for use in the courtroom, will employ the same level of intellectual rig- or as would be expected in the scientific community.\u201d <footnotemark>147</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-15\">The Circuit upheld the district court\u2019s exclusion of the experts.<footnotemark>148</footnotemark> The district court found that the articles cited by at least one of the experts \u201cfail[ed] to \u2018fit\u2019 the facts of this case, either in terms of the type and duration of exposure, or the type and duration of the observed effects.\u201d<footnotemark>149</footnotemark> It found it significant as well that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>expert \u201cprepared his opinion for litigation, rather than as part of his academic research, and he has not seen fit to share his opinion\u201d with the relevant professional community.<footnotemark>150</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">The Second Circuit\u2019s most recent pronouncement on the admissibility of expert testimony came last year in <em>Wills v. Amerada Hess </em>Corp,<footnotemark>151</footnotemark> In that case, the Circuit held that a district court did not abuse its discretion when it excluded an expert report theorizing that a sailor\u2019s cancer probably was caused by toxins to which he had been exposed on the defendant\u2019s ships. The district court found that the studies on which the expert had relied did not establish a sufficient link between the toxins and the type of cancer because they were done only on animals and found a significant link only when the animals ingested the chemical, which the sailor had not done. The court was dissatisfied also with the expert\u2019s failure to account adequately for the possibility that the cancer had been caused by the sailor\u2019s smoking and drinking.<footnotemark>152</footnotemark> Finally, the court found that the expert\u2019s novel theory of causation \u2014 which the expert admitted was \u201cthe product of his own \u2018background experience and reading\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>153</footnotemark> \u2014 failed the <em>Daubert </em>test because it had not been tested or subjected to peer review, there was no known error rate, and it was not generally accepted.<footnotemark>154</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-13\"><em>B. The </em>Daubert <em>Standards Apply to Opinions About General and Specific Causation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b454-14\">As discussed earlier, a plaintiff in a toxic tort case must prove both general causation, that is, that the alleged toxin is capable of causing injuries of the kind suffered by the plaintiff, and specific causation, that is, that the alleged toxin caused the particular plaintiffs injuries. The <em>Daubert </em>requirements apply alike to expert opinions on general and specific causation. Indeed, since <em>Daubert </em>many district courts\u2018have excluded expert testimony regarding general causation on grounds quite similar to those proposed here.<footnotemark>155</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b455-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number><em>VI. </em>Daubert <em>Analysis of the Proposed Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">\n<em>A Testing and Error Rate, Peer-Review, Publication, Widespread Acceptance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The challenged testimony in this case does not satisfy any of the core <em>Daubert </em>factors. The theory that Rezulin can cause a liver injury silently never has been tested<footnotemark>156</footnotemark> and necessarily has no error rate. It never has been published or subjected to peer review \u2014 aside from an edited version of Dr. Smith\u2019s report, which used more tentative language<footnotemark>157</footnotemark> and which he published in a toxicology journal at the suggestion of a member of its editorial board who also is a paid consultant for the plaintiffs in this litigation.<footnotemark>158</footnotemark> It appears to have no acceptance outside this litigation, let alone widespread acceptance.<footnotemark>159</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>The plaintiffs argue that' the research linking Rezulin to apoptosis and apoptosis to injury is part of the established scientific literature.<footnotemark>160</footnotemark> The challenged testimony however, is the opinion that Rezulin is capable of causing a silent liver injury. At issue, in other words, is much more than the independent assertions that Rezulin causes apoptosis in some types of cells under some conditions and that excessive apoptosis can be injurious. It is the extrapolation from the existing literature that never has been tested, peer-reviewed, published, or widely accepted.<footnotemark>161</footnotemark> As the Second Circuit has made clear, \u201cit is critical that an expert\u2019s analysis be reliable <em>at every step ... \u2018any </em>step that renders the analysis unreliable under the <em>Daubert </em>factors renders the expert\u2019s testimony inadmissible.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>162</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">\n<em>B. Independence from Litigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">There is likewise no real dispute that the theory that Rezulin can cause a silent liver injury was developed solely in connection with this litigation. The plaintiffs have come forward with no evidence that Dr. Smith ever proposed this idea publicly before, and Dr. Reed admitted at the evi-dentiary hearing that he had not presented the theories in his expert report on the possible mechanisms of Rezulin\u2019s alleged toxicity in any context other than this litigation.<footnotemark>163</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>\n<em>C. Consideration of Contrary Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">A factor that courts have considered in <em>Daubert </em>analyses is whether an expert has accounted adequately for obvious alternative explanations. This is appropriate because any theory that fails to explain information that otherwise would tend to cast doubt on that theory is inherently suspect. By the same token, if the relevant scientific literature contains evidence tending to refute the expert\u2019s theory and the expert does not acknowledge or account for that evidence, the expert\u2019s opinion is unreliable. Accordingly, courts have excluded expert testimony \u201cwhere the expert selectively chose his support from the scientific landscape.\u201d <footnotemark>164</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">In this case, the plaintiffs\u2019 experts have ignored a large amount of information that calls many aspects of the silent injury theory into question.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Their reports do not mention that the one study that looked for Rezulin-induced apoptosis in humans failed to find it. Caldwell et al. (2001a) administered Rezu-lin to human patients and looked for morphological and biochemical evidence of apoptosis but found none.<footnotemark>165</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-14\">The expert reports point out that Toyoda et al. (2001) found that Rezulin induced apoptosis in healthy rat hepatocytes. But they do not mention that Kim et al. (2002) \u2014 a paper of which Dr. Reed was a coauthor and which he discussed in his declarations \u2014 investigated healthy hepato-cytes from cynomologus monkeys and found that Rezulin, alone or in combination with the anti-tumor agent TRAIL, failed to induce1 apoptosis. Rats are much further than monkeys from humans, and Dr. Reed himself regards cells from monkey as a useful alternative to human cells.<footnotemark>166</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-15\">The expert reports do not mention that four of the studies on cancer cells \u2014 including the Kim et al. (2002) study performed in Dr. Reed\u2019s laboratory \u2014 compared the effect of troglitazone on the cancer cells to the effect on healthy cells and that, in every such comparison, troglitazone was found to induce apoptosis in the cancer cultures while having no effect on the healthy cells.<footnotemark>167</footnotemark> The expert reports do not mention, in other words, that the reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>many researchers were investigating tro-glitazone\u2019s effects on cancer cells and on diseased tissue is that they were actively exploring the possibility that the drug could be an effective therapy for killing or preventing the proliferation of malignant tissue without harming healthy cells.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">The expert reports do not discuss the fact that the same researchers who found that troglitazone affected the mitochondria in the cells of live humans, immortalized liver cells, and liver cancer .cells either observed no evidence at all of apoptosis or other cell death<footnotemark>168</footnotemark> or, if they did observe cell death, (i) observed it at concentrations higher than the concentrations required to affect the mitochondria, and (ii) did not specify whether the mechanism was apop-tosis.<footnotemark>169</footnotemark> The expert reports did not discuss the fact that Shishido et al. (2003), a study performed on immortalized human liver cells, looked for but could not find cytochrome c, considered a sign of apopto-sis, and believed this absence \u201csuggest[ed] no clear involvement of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in this <em>in vitro </em>system as previously reported.\u201d<footnotemark>170</footnotemark> The expert reports saw fit to omit that, while Haskins et al. (2001) did find that troglitazone affected the mitochondria in liver cells derived from one diabetic patient, these researchers failed to see this result in the cells derived from another diabetic patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">In other words, the scientists have discussed only the evidence that they believed would advance the plaintiffs\u2019 position. Their reports cannot be said to reflect \u201cthe same level of intellectual rigor that characterizes the practice of an expert in the relevant field.\u201d<footnotemark>171</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-10\">\n<em>D. \u201cFit\u201d and the \u201cAnalytical Gap\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b458-11\">A crucial consideration in evaluating the admissibility of expert testimony is whether the conclusions flow reliably from the premises. As the Supreme Court has explained, \u201c[a] court may conclude that there is simply too great an analytical gap between the data and the opinion proffered.\u201d<footnotemark>172</footnotemark> Or as Judge Becker has explained for the Third Circuit: \u201c[e]ven if an expert\u2019s proposed testimony constitutes scientific knowledge, his or her testimony will be excluded if it is not scientific knowledge <em>for purposes of the </em>case.\u201d<footnotemark>173</footnotemark> This consideration is bound up with the relevancy requirement described in <em>Daubert </em>as one of \u201cfit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-12\">The analytical gap between the research and the conclusions the experts would draw is independently sufficient to warrant exclusion of the testimony in question. The plaintiffs have no evidence for the final link in their causal chain, and they extrapolate from the earlier links in ways the Court finds unreliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-13\">\n<em>1. The Experts Have No Evidence for the Crucial Link in Their Causal Chain</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b458-14\">The experts have no evidence to carry them all the way down their causal chain to silent liver injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>It is worth bearing in mind that some level of apoptosis is entirely normal and occurs all the time in healthy tissue. Drs. Reed and Smith admitted that they have no information on whether therapeutic doses of Rezulin, even assuming they can cause additional levels of apoptosis beyond the normal baseline, can do so to a clinically relevant extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Furthermore, both sides\u2019 experts and the literature agree that when an insult producing apoptosis is sufficiently serious, the injury or impairment will not be silent. Thus the question is not just whether Re-zulin can cause apoptosis to occur at levels sufficient to cause injury or impairment, but whether it can do so and remain silent. The plaintiffs\u2019 experts have offered no evidence that this is possible. Indeed, <em>nothing </em>in the challenged expert reports gives <em>any </em>indication about the actual capacity of phagocytes (the \u201cclean-up\u201d cells) to absorb the end products of apoptosis \u2014 -the precondition to the injury\u2019s hypothesized silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">11. <em>The Experts Have Failed To Link the Studies on Mitochondria and the BSEP into Their Causal Chain</em></p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">Similarly, the studies on mitochondria have no connection to Rezulin-induced apoptosis. Dr. Smith would opine that (a) Rezulin has been shown to affect the structure and function of the mitochondria, and (b) apoptosis has been shown to involve changes to the mitochondria, and therefore (c) Rezulin can produce apoptosis. This is speculative, and it confuses association with causation. Dr. Smith\u2019s reasoning is logically equivalent to saying that (a) every time John gets hungry he eats, and (b) John eats .whenever he goes to a restaurant, therefore (c) every time John gets hungry, he goes to a restaurant. There are of course plenty of times when John gets hungry and eats at home.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-12\">So too here. There is not simply the possibility that Rezulin changes the mitochondria without producing apoptosis. There are empirical demonstrations of this in the studies of Caldwell et al. (2001a),<footnotemark>174</footnotemark> Shishido et al. (2003),<footnotemark>175</footnotemark> and Tirmenstein et al. (2002) <footnotemark>176</footnotemark> performed, respectively, on live humans, immortalized human liver cells, and liver cancer cells.<footnotemark>177</footnotemark> The plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>tiffs\u2019 experts must have some reliable basis for asserting that Rezulin-induced mitochondrial abnormalities lead specifically to apoptosis, otherwise the mitochondria research does nothing to help them survive this motion. The plaintiffs\u2019 experts have no such basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">Nor is Dr. Smith\u2019s theory rendered reliable by the fact that he, and some of the articles he cites, assert that a change in mitochondrial membrane function itself is an initial cause of, and not just a phenomenon associated with, apoptosis. The fact that there is compelling evidence (which he ignores) in the very studies that he and Dr. Reed cite to the effect that human liver cells \u2014 normal, immortalized, and cancerous' \u2014 can sustain mitochondrial damage without shriveling up and dying undermines what the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel have described as Dr. Smith\u2019s \u201cone plus one equals two\u201d<footnotemark>178</footnotemark> argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The BSEP research suffers from the same basic difficulty discussed above. That is, while there are studies to suggest that Rezulin, through a mechanism involving the BSEP, can produce cholestatic injury and that cholestatic injury is associated with apoptosis, there is no reason to believe that any apoptosis caused by BSEP malfunction would be silent. The cholestatic injury that Rezulin produced in rats in the two Funk et al. studies was manifested by the presence in the rats\u2019 blood of products closely associated with bilirubin.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">For apoptosis associated with cholestasis to be silent, surrounding phagocytes would have to absorb the dying bile salt-filled cells. Can they really do this? The very toxicity to cells of bile and related compounds \u2014 this is to be contrasted with ALT and AST \u2014 is a starting point of the research on the BSEP and cholestasis. Dr. Smith offers no help in resolving this paradox, and therefore no reason to believe that inhibition of the BSEP by Rezulin could produce a silent injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">\n<em>3. The Research on Apoptosis in Cell Cultures Does Not \u201cFit\u201d the Opinion at Isstoe</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b460-12\">The preceding discussion shows that the most that can be said for the research cited by the experts, to the extent it is relevant at all, is that it shows that at certain concentrations, Rezulin causes apoptosis in the hepatoeytes of rats (but not monkeys), in human liver cancer cells, in cancerous cells of other organs (but, so far as the data presented to the Court indicate, not in healthy cells from those organs), and in non-cancerous disease tissue.<footnotemark>179</footnotemark> The plaintiffs argue that the experts can extrapolate reliably from <em>in vitro </em>results to draw conclusions about the effect of Rezulin in humans.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-13\">Caution always must be used in extrapolating results in tissue culture to effects in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>live humans.<footnotemark>180</footnotemark> As explained in the <em>Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALe\">\u201cThousands of in vitro toxicological tests have been described in the scientific literature .... There are short-term in vitro tests for just about every physiological response and every organ system .... Relatively few of these tests have been validated by replication in many different laboratories or by comparison with outcomes in animal studies to determine if they are predictive of whole-animal or human toxicity.\u201d<footnotemark>181</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AdZ\">In assessing the reliability of an extrapolation from <em>in vitro </em>results to effects in live humans, two crucial considerations are the type of cell on which the <em>in vitro </em>experiment was performed and the dose to which the cells were exposed.<footnotemark>182</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">a. Types of Cells</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">In the cited studies, the cells in which Rezulin was found to produce apoptosis were not normal human liver cells. They were either healthy liver cells of rats, cancerous human liver cells, and cancerous or otherwise abnormal cells from other human organs. This fact is of substantial significance. In light of the explanations of the plaintiffs\u2019 experts and the concessions of the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, almost none of these studies appears to be a rehable basis for extrapolating to the liver of a living human.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">To begin with, Dr. Smith described at the hearing a \u201chierarchy\u201d of relevance of experiments on different kinds of cells.<footnotemark>183</footnotemark> At the top of the hierarchy is human hepa-toeytes. Next is \u201cimmortalized\u201d hepato-cytes, which Dr. Smith rates \u201cabout equivalent\u201d to \u201crat hepatocytes or any of the animal liver cells.\u201d<footnotemark>184</footnotemark> The third level is \u201cliver tumor cells, such as hepatoma cell lines. And the fourth part of the hierarchy would be non-target tissue cells.\u201d<footnotemark>185</footnotemark> The suggestion is that extrapolation becomes less and less appropriate as one proceeds down the hierarchy.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">In fact, it is on the basis of this testimony that the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel have argued that Rezulin\u2019s pattern of harming malignant but not normal tissue from various organs does not detract from their hypothesis that Rezulin is toxic to the (non-cancerous) liver. In their proposed findings of fact, the defendants pointed out that in the body of science before the Court, every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>time the effects of Rezulin on cancer cells were compared with the effects on normal cells, Rezulin killed the cancer cells without damaging the normal ones.<footnotemark>186</footnotemark> The plaintiffs\u2019 response, for each of these studies, is some form of the statement that \u201c[t]he experiment did not concern liver cells and is therefore of limited relevance to troglitazone hepatotoxicity.\u201d<footnotemark>187</footnotemark> Indeed, the plaintiffs make a similar statement in connection with other studies performed on non-liver cells.<footnotemark>188</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">The plaintiffs thus effectively have abandoned all of the studies on non-liver cells as a basis for their experts\u2019 opinions. Accordingly, the Court is convinced that most of the <em>in vitro </em>studies upon which the plaintiffs\u2019 experts initially relied do not support a reliable extrapolation to the opinion that Rezulin can cause a silent liver injury in humans.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Furthermore, the Court does not regard the four cited studies in which troglitazone produced apoptosis in human liver cancer cells as a reliable basis for predicting the drug\u2019s effect on non-cancerous human livers. The plaintiffs and their experts have ignored the evidence that Rezulin does <em>not </em>have an apoptotic effect on non-cancerous monkey liver cells and failed to deal with the fact that cancer cells \u2014 in the four studies cited to this Court that compared them with healthy cells from the same organ\u2014 respond to troglitazone in ways that healthy cells do not. And it is undisputed that cancer cells are abnormal precisely in that their mechanisms of cell growth and death have been disturbed.<footnotemark>189</footnotemark> Indeed, Dr. Smith himself ranked cancerous liver cells as third out of fourth in his hierarchy of relevance.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-12\">When all of the studies involving human liver tumor cells and cells from other organs are stripped away, what is left is the Toyoda et al. (2001) study, which investigated rat hepatocytes and is considered below.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-13\">b. Dose</p>\n<p id=\"b462-14\">It is a fundamental principle of toxicology, as Dr. Smith explained at the hearing, that \u201cthe dose makes the poison.\u201d <footnotemark>190</footnotemark> Consequently, if the doses at which Rezulin was observed to be toxic to cultured cells are not achieved in the liver <em>in vivo, </em>extrapolation from the <em>in vitro </em>experiments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>is not reliable.<footnotemark>191</footnotemark> In light of the preceding discussion, the only <em>in vitro </em>study that the Court finds it necessary to consider further is Toyoda et al. (2001), which investigated rat hepatocytes.<footnotemark>192</footnotemark> Thus the question is whether the doses to which the cells in that study were exposed are comparable to those to which cells in the liver of a living human are exposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Dose is a function both of concentration of a toxin and of time of exposure.<footnotemark>193</footnotemark> Toyoda et al. (2001) found that troglitazone at concentrations of 15 pM and above killed most of the rat hepatocytes within 20 hours. But that result obtained only in the absence of albumin, a protein to which Rezuhn is more than 99 percent bound in human blood.<footnotemark>194</footnotemark> The binding to albumin means that the molecules of troglitazone are not as free to interact with other substances. Results obtained in the absence of albumin therefore cannot readily be generalized or extrapolated to a living human.<footnotemark>195</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Toyoda et al. (2001) itself demonstrates the significance of the presence of albumin. When those researchers added a 2 percent solution of bovine serum albumin to the cells, the same 15 pM concentration of troglitazone that was otherwise so toxic to the cells produced virtually no effect after 24 hours. Even a 100 pM solution of troglitazone destroyed less than 20 percent of the cells, and a 50 pM solution destroyed approximately 5 percent.<footnotemark>196</footnotemark> In human blood plasma, the concentration of albumin is 4 percent,<footnotemark>197</footnotemark> or double the maximum used in the Toyoda et al. (2001) study. The question raised by the Toyoda et al. (2001) results therefore is whether the concentrations at which troglitazone produced apoptosis in the presence of albumin <em>in vitro </em>are comparable to the concentrations of troglitazone achieved <em>in vivo </em>in therapeutic settings.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-12\">When a patient was taking prescribed doses of Rezulin, the average maximum concentration in the blood plasma was determined to be 2.0 to 6.3 pM, depending on the dosage,<footnotemark>198</footnotemark> a finding substantially adopted by experts on both sides.<footnotemark>199</footnotemark> The defendants argue that the concentration in the liver of a patient taking Rezulin is approximately equal to that in the blood plasma,<footnotemark>200</footnotemark> which is a small fraction of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>concentrations of troglitazone found to be toxic in the Toyoda et al. (2001) study.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">The plaintiffs\u2019 experts contend that the concentration of Rezulin inside a patient\u2019s liver actually is much higher \u2014 50 to 80 pM, according to Dr. Smith.<footnotemark>201</footnotemark> At the evidentiary hearing, Dr. Smith said the disparity between this level and the concentration found in the bloodstream is attributable to hepatic first-pass uptake, which is the liver\u2019s absorption of certain substances from the bloodstream right after they have \"left the gut.<footnotemark>202</footnotemark> Furthermore, the plaintiffs\u2019 experts have cited research that they say corroborates this range.<footnotemark>203</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Before examining Dr. Smith\u2019s analysis, the Court pauses to point out several major difficulties with extrapolation from the published literature. The concentration of troglitazone discussed in Toyoda et al. (2001) is the concentration in the <em>medium that surrounds the cells, </em>not the concentration <em>inside the liver cells. </em>However, Kawai et al. (1997), the lone published study that found that the concentration of troglitazone in the liver is higher than in the plasma,<footnotemark>204</footnotemark> sought to measure the concentration in the entire liver tissue without distinguishing between the concentrations inside and outside the cells.<footnotemark>205</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-12\">These two concentrations are not interchangeable. The plasma membrane is a selective barrier. Indeed, it is the cell\u2019s ability to maintain internal conditions that differ from those outside that makes all life possible.<footnotemark>206</footnotemark> As one of the defense- experts has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-13\">\u201cIntact cells have a complex membrane separating the <em>intracellular </em>contents from the outside medium or blood. The degree to which a substance in the <em>extracellular </em>medium traverses the cell membrane is a complex function of many factors.... It is thus grossly incorrect to adopt an <em>intracellular </em>concentration, even if correct, and apply that to phenomena observed at a specific <em>extracellular </em>concentration.\u201d<footnotemark>207</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>Furthermore, it is unknown whether any toxicity due to troglitazone is a function of its presence outside the plasma membrane of the cell (where it may interact with certain proteins embedded in the membrane) or inside the cell (where it can interact with compounds in the cytoplasm).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Another difficulty is that the concentrations measured in Kawai et al. (1997) actually encompassed not just the pure trogli-tazone molecule, but the various related molecules, known as metabolites, that result from biochemical breakdown processes inside the cell.<footnotemark>208</footnotemark> Dr. Smith could give little information the extent to which these metabolites are toxic.<footnotemark>209</footnotemark> In consequence, the concentrations observed by Kawai et al. (1997) may overstate the relevant concentrations by aggregating troglitazone and metabolites that may have different properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Thus, although it may be true that tro-glitazone and its metabolites accumulate in the liver, there is still no basis for the assertion that it is clinically realistic to expose cells in culture to <em>extracellular </em>concentrations comparable to the <em>whole-tissue </em>concentrations alleged by Drs. Smith and Reed. The question, contrary to what the plaintiffs and their experts have implied, is not whether the concentrations used in Toyoda et al. (2001) match the combined concentration of troglitazone and its metabolites across the entire liver; rather, it is whether the concentrations of troglitazone used in Toyoda et al. (2001) match the concentrations of troglitazone to which the <em>outside </em>of the cells in patients actually were exposed. Even putting this point aside, however, there are independent difficulties in Dr. Smith\u2019s projection of the concentration of Rezulin in the liver based on absorption on the \u201cfirst pass.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-13\">Dr. Smith started with the premise that Rezulin\u2019s absolute \u201cbioavailability\u201d \u2014 the fraction of the ingested drug that is absorbed from the gut instead of remaining there<footnotemark>210</footnotemark> \u2014 is 50 to 70 percent. In other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>words, if a patient takes 600 milligrams (mg) of Rezulin, 300 to 420 mg will be absorbed by the body.<footnotemark>211</footnotemark> The Court notes that the 50 percent figure is comparable to, if on the high end of, published estimates.<footnotemark>212</footnotemark> The 70 percent figure is based on the premise that food increases bioa-vailability.<footnotemark>213</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Dr. Smith next stated that 43 percent of that amount (i.e. 129 to 180.6 mg) will be absorbed directly by the liver on the first pass from the gut.<footnotemark>214</footnotemark> He cited Izumi et al. (1996) for that figure, but the study does not support it. In fact, Izumi et al. (1996) assumed what the plaintiffs dispute; which is that \u201cthe. concentrations of unbound drug in venous blood' and liver are equal.\u201d<footnotemark>215</footnotemark> Nevertheless, using the molecular weight of troglitazone (441 grams/ mole) and assumptions about the mass of the liver (1500 grams) and its density (1 gram/1.08 milliliters), Dr. Smith converted the 129 to 180.6 mg to a concentration range: 180.5 to 252.8 |xM.<footnotemark>216</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">But this number is meaningless.<footnotemark>217</footnotemark> Dr. Smith himself explained that such a concentration would obtain only if all of the Rezulin absorbed by the liver on the first pass were absorbed at once, which it is not, rather than over time.<footnotemark>218</footnotemark> Thus, Dr. Smith said, \u201cIf you do a toxicokinetics model of troglitazone it predicts the concentration of troglitazone in the liver will be 50 to 80 micromolar after a therapeutic concentration....\u201d<footnotemark>219</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-12\">The plaintiffs have failed to establish any reliable basis for the 50 to 80 p,M range. Dr. Smith gave no information on how he reached that number. While he methodically explained the calculations and assumptions that produced the range 180.5 to 252.8 jjlM, he simply uttered \u201ctoxicoki-netic modeling\u201d before producing the range of 50 to 80 p,M. He provided no information concerning the structure of the model or the data and assumptions used in producing the claimed result.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-13\">Moreover, even if Dr. Smith\u2019s assertion on this point were accepted, the Court could not accept the figure as reliable. For one thing, it is based on the premise that 43 percent of the absorbed fraction of troglitazone is absorbed directly by the liver on the \u201cfirst pass,\u201d a number that the Court could not find in the only study that Dr. Smith cited for it. And there is still the problem that Dr. Smith failed to explain how the tissue-wide concentrations he postulates can be used to relate (a) the extracellular concentrations to which cells actually were exposed in patients taking Rezulin to (b) the concentrations used in Toyoda et al. (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-14\">In spite of all of this, even if it were accepted that the concentration of troglita-zone in the liver is 50 to 80 p,M, and even if the failure to distinguish between intracellular and extracellular concentration were overlooked, there would be another reason why extrapolation from the Toyoda et al. (2001) study cannot be said to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>reliable. The experts have provided no information on the distribution of troglita-zone in the liver. Drs. Smith, Reed, and Julie agree that Rezulin is <em>not </em>distributed homogeneously in the liver,<footnotemark>220</footnotemark> but they cannot say how it <em>is </em>distributed.<footnotemark>221</footnotemark> That is, they have no information on the percentage of cells that would be exposed to the concentrations that they assert are toxic. The drug may concentrate in discrete pockets, perhaps close to the portal vein,<footnotemark>222</footnotemark> causing localized damage but leaving the rest of the organ unharmed and consequently causing no clinically significant effect. The plaintiffs\u2019 experts have no answer to this difficulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">The Court finds that extrapolation from the results of Toyoda et al. (2001) to the livers of patients who took Rezulin is unwarranted. The Court cannot and does not say that Drs. Smith and Reed are wrong or that the defendants\u2019 experts are right. Rather, it is not satisfied that there is a reliable basis for an extrapolation from the results of an <em>in vitro </em>experiment that used troglitazone at a concentration of 50 or 100 p,M with a 2 percent solution of albumin to clinical effects in a patient taking Rezulin. Similar statements could be made about other studies relied on by the experts, but the Court finds it unnecessary to discuss the specifics of those studies.<footnotemark>223</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-18\">\n<em>VII. The Plaintiffs\u2019 Argument Concerning Differential Diagnosis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b467-19\">The plaintiffs attempt to get around all of these problems by arguing that the testimony in question could be used to support opinion testimony regarding causation based on the clinical process of elimination known as differential. diagnosis.<footnotemark>224</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-20\">The Federal Judicial Center\u2019s <em>Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence </em>has explained differential diagnosis this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>\u201c[T]he physician determines which of two or more diseases with similar clinical findings is the one that the patient is suffering from. The physician does this by developing a list of all of the possible diseases that could produce the observed signs and symptoms, and then comparing the expected clinical findings for each with those exhibited by the patient.\u201d <footnotemark>225</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">The plaintiffs argue that the opinions about silent liver injury are admissible because they are based on what they call a \u201cplausible mechanism.\u201d <footnotemark>226</footnotemark> The plaintiffs\u2019 position is that a physician faced with a patient who took Rezulin and experienced silent liver injury could attribute that injury to Rezulin by performing a differential diagnosis that takes that \u201cplausible mechanism\u201d into account.<footnotemark>227</footnotemark> But the plaintiffs have underestimated their burden under <em>Daubert.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">A physician attempting to establish a causal relationship between exposure to a substance and a particular patient\u2019s illness must \u201cdemonstrate that the medical and scientific literature provides evidence that in some circumstances the exposure under consideration can cause the outcome under consideration. This step is synonymous with establishment of general causation.\u201d<footnotemark>228</footnotemark> In other words, the determination of cause in an individual case, or differential diagnosis as that term has been used by courts, \u201cdoes not \u2018speak to the issue of general causation. [It] assumes that general causation has been proven for the list of possible causes\u2019 that it rules in and out in coming to a conclusion.\u201d <footnotemark>229</footnotemark> As one court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-12\">\u201cthe final, suspected \u2018cause\u2019 remaining after this process of elimination must actually be <em>capable </em>of causing the injury.... And, of course, expert opinion on this issue of \u2018general causation\u2019 must be derived from scientifically valid methodology.\u201d <footnotemark>230</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-13\">A physician thus may not link any particular patient\u2019s injury to Rezulin unless there is some reliable basis for the opinion that therapeutic doses of Rezulin can cause such an injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-14\">The Court is mindful that two district judges in this Circuit seem to have come to a different view, stating, with reference to the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>McCullock </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number><em>v. H.B. Fuller Co.,</em><footnotemark><em>231</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that \u201c[differential diagnosis is a reliable basis to prove general causation in this circuit\u201d <footnotemark>232</footnotemark> and that \u201caccording to the Second Circuit, if a qualified expert performs a reliable differential diagnosis, the plaintiff need not satisfy the general causation requirement.\u201d <footnotemark>233</footnotemark> But the view that differential diagnosis necessarily is sufficient to establish general causation is not borne out by <em>McCulloch. </em>The Circuit there merely registered its approval of the expert\u2019s reliance on a variety of sources to arrive at an opinion as to causation in one.patient\u2019s case, an opinion that, so far as the Circuit\u2019s opinion indicated, did not differentiate between general and specific causation. It is not at all clear that the Court regarded differential diagnosis as inevitably probative of general causation.<footnotemark>234</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">The plaintiffs point out that researchers and clinicians in the field of liver toxicology use a variety of data and analysis' \u2014 -sometimes including differential diagnoses on individual patients \u2014 to conclude that a particular drug is capable of causing a particular injury.<footnotemark>235</footnotemark> The plaintiffs further point out, correctly, that the physicians who first determined that Rezulin caused certain types of liver injuries (non-silent ones) had no published studies but made judgments based on a totality of information.<footnotemark>236</footnotemark> The implication is that physicians retained for this litigation should be able to testify that Rezulin is a possible, and the most likely, cause of particular plaintiffs\u2019 symptoms\u2014 symptoms that were consistent with liver injury but that occurred without elevated enzymes \u2014 and that these physicians should be able to do so by relying upon, among other things, the expert testimony that the defendants are seeking to exclude on this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-12\">The plaintiffs\u2019 mistake throughout is to overlook the fact that science and medicine refine themselves over time,\u2019 gradually converting tentative hypotheses into reliable principles. The idea that Rezulin sometimes causes acute liver injury, albeit not silently, appears not now to be controversial for a number of reasons, including the existence of a significant number of compelling case reports and several generally accepted, empirically verified (though not necessarily perfectly understood) physiological processes through which drug-induced liver injury occurs. A medical theory that has no little or no empirical support, is entirely unaccepted outside the very lawsuit in which the theory is being advanced for the first time, and that suffers from numerous analytical gaps is an entirely different matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-13\">\n<em>VIII. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b469-14\">To sum up, the plaintiffs have not established the reliability of the silent injury theory. The theory never has been tested or peer-reviewed, has not been published except by Dr. Smith after the commencement of this litigation and. only then in speculative terms and suspicious circumstances, and has no acceptance outside this litigation. The plaintiffs\u2019 experts have ignored information that appears to call crucial aspects of their theory into question. The theory rests on a series of empirically unbridgeable analytical gaps. Most impor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>tantly, the experts have not established a sound basis for concluding that Rezulin-induced apoptosis can occur at clinically significant levels and remain silent. Similarly, the experts have failed to show that any mitochondrial changes attributable to Rezulin themselves can cause apoptosis or that any cholestatic injury due to Rezulin\u2019s effect on the BSEP would be silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Thus, all the experts really have are a set of studies in which Rezulin produced apoptosis in tissue cultures. These studies, however, do not \u201cfit\u201d the opinion they are used to support. Save one study on rat hepatocytes, all were performed on cancerous liver cells and cancerous or otherwise unhealthy cells of other organs. The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel and their experts have acknowledged that studies on such cells are not reliable predictors of <em>in vivo </em>outcomes in a non-cancerous liver.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Nor is the study on rat hepatocytes a reliable basis for extrapolation. Among other issues, there is no reason to believe that the doses used in that study (or, for that matter, in many of the other studies presented to the Court) approximated the doses to which clinically relevant quantities of cells in the human liver are exposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">The plaintiffs attempt to deal with all of these problems by arguing that the testimony in question could factor into the diagnosis of an individual patient. The plaintiffs\u2019 position is that a physician, faced with a patient who took Rezulin and had symptoms of liver disease but no elevated enzymes, could use the opinions of Drs. Smith and Reed and the research they cite to conclude that the patient\u2019s injury was caused by Rezulin. The flaw, however, is that a physician must have some reliable basis for believing that a particular substance is capable of causing the injury in question in relevant circumstances before concluding that the substance caused that injury in a particular case. Here, there is no such basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">:\u00a1\u00ed :\u00a1: $ \u2021 \u2021 $</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">In a now-famous passage, the Supreme Court recognized that the trial judge\u2019s ga-tekeeping role:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-11\">\u201cinevitably on occasion will prevent the jury from learning of authentic insights and innovations. That, nevertheless, is the balance that is struck by Rules of Evidence designed not for the exhaustive search for cosmic understanding but for the particularized resolution of legal disputes.\u201d<footnotemark>237</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-12\">The Court is fully aware that investigation of the molecular mechanisms of cell death is one of the most promising and potentially clinically relevant frontiers in science. Indeed, time and medical science may one day prove the plaintiffs\u2019 experts right. But in Judge Posner\u2019s oft-quoted words, \u201cthe courtroom is not the place for scientific guesswork, even of the inspired sort.\u201d<footnotemark>238</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-13\">Federal Rule of Evidence 702 and <em>Dau-bert </em>and its progeny set forth standards and give district courts the obligation and the discretion to determine whether expert testimony meets those standards. The Court is convinced that the silent injury theory does not. The defendants\u2019 motion to exclude proposed testimony of plaintiffs\u2019 experts that Rezulin can cause liver injury, or exacerbate a pre-existing liver condition, in the absence of marked elevations of liver enzymes while the patient was taking the medication [docket item 899] therefore is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-14\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Appendix: Scientific and Medical Studies Discussed in the Opinion</p>\n<p id=\"AJJX\">Myung-Ae Bae &amp; Byoung J.

The case reports that the plaintiffs and their experts say are examples or illustrations of an injury silently caused or exacerbated by Rezulin do not support their assertions.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">Dr. Smith at the hearing pointed to data on one patient with NASH in the Caldwell et al. (2001a) study (the conventions used in this opinion to refer to scientific studies are explained in the following footnote) who had advanced bridging fibrosis that progressed during six months of Rezulin treatment to frank cirrhosis without an elevation in liver enzymes. He acknowledged that \"this is-the only example I know of in the peer-reviewed literature that exacerbation of a pre-existing liver condition occurs in a silent manner.\u201d Tr. 5/20/01, at 94. The implication \u2014 one not drawn by the study\u2019s authors \u2014 is that Rezulin in this case caused a silent injury, namely the progression from fibrosis to cirrhosis. <em>See id. </em>at 94-95. But this is entirely unsubstantiated and a classic example of the <em>post hoc ergo propter hoc </em>(i.e. after the fact, therefore because of the fact) fallacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">As discussed in section III.A.2 above, it is not at all rare for a patient to undergo a progression from advanced bridging fibrosis to cirrhosis in the absence of Rezulin. Thus, the question is whether <em>this </em>patient's progression can be attributed to Rezulin. Dr. Smith pointed to no evidence to support his belief that this timeline was unusually short for this progression, and he admitted that he has no expertise on progression from fibrosis to cirrhosis. <em>See id. </em>at 95-96. Dr. Julie, who does have clinical expertise, said that he would expect this progression normally to take at least two to five years, but that \"[wjithout knowing the general clinical history of the patient, however, I can't really apply that.\u201d Tr. 5/21/03, at 262. Dr. Julie acknowledged that a biopsy will fail to detect cirrhosis in a certain percentage of cases. <em>Id. </em>at 273-75. Because Dr. Julie was unwilling to draw the very conclusion required to support the statement that Dr. Smith essentially admitted he was not qualified to make, there is no reliable basis for concluding that the patient in the Caldwell et al. (2001a) study is an example of liver disease or injury silently caused or exacerbated by Rezulin.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-11\">Similarly, Dr. Julie\u2019s second declaration cites four case reports in which Dr. Julie says autopsies and biopsies revealed \"acidophilic bodies,\u201d which are considered evidence of apoptosis, <em>see </em>Pet\u00e9r J. Scheuer &amp; Jay H. Lef-kowitch, Liver Biopsy Interpretation 365 (6th ed. 2000) (Ex. 189). <em>See </em>Julie (3/18/03) Decl. 14-15 (Ex. 336). One of those cases specifically states that \u201c[ajcidophilic or apoptotic change of the liver cells or Mallory bodies was rarely found.\u201d Fukano et al. (2000), at 251. The other three patients did exhibit acidophilic bodies, but they experienced elevated enzyme levels as well. <em>See </em>Herrine &amp; Choudhary (1999); Murphy et al. (2000) (case 3); Kohlroser et al. (2000) (patient 1). These cases therefore do not speak to the issue of silent apoptotic injury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"93\">\n<p id=\"b444-7\">.

For the proposition that Rezulin \"may effectively suppress evidence\" of elevation of enzymes, PL Mem. 14 &amp; n. 17, the plaintiffs\u2019 brief cites Dr. Julie\u2019s second declaration: \"[S]tudies and articles confirm that Rezulin may suppress transaminase levels and mask this one indicium of liver injury.\u201d Julie (3/18/03) Decl. \u00b6 12 (Ex. 336). This statement is highly tentative. Moreover, the studies and articles that Dr. Julie cites in support of the statement show only that Rezulin can depress <em>baseline </em>enzyme levels in non-injured animals and patients and in cell cultures of rat kidney cells. They say nothing about whether this effect would persist if the Rezulin caused a liver injury. <em>See </em>Caldwell et al. (2001a) (non-injured patients); Caldwell (2001b) (same); Extracts of Mtg. of Austr. Drug Eval. Comm. (Oct. 1-2, 1998) \u00b6 2.17.25 (Ex. 359) (rats); Routh et al. (2002) (cultures of rat kidney cells). Dr. Julie's extrapolation from these findings therefore is speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">The plaintiffs and Dr. Julie\u2019s declaration cite also evidence from Warner-Lambert researchers, but the evidence does not say what the plaintiffs would have it say. Dr. Kan He's two-line email about two patients who died after taking Rezulin but who had normal ALT levels does not give any context or indicate whether there was an elevation of the other three substances. <em>See </em>Email from Kan He to Rebecca Boyd (Jan. 19, 1999) (Ex. 365). And the patient with an ALT level of 122 mentioned by Dr. Maddrey in his deposition <em>did </em>have an elevated enzyme leyel \u2014 122 was three times the normal level. <em>See </em>Maddrey (7/16/02) Dep. 238-40 (Ex. 290). Additionally, the plaintiffs and Dr. Julie cite two letters from physicians to their colleagues, but one of those letters makes no mention of enzyme levels, <em>see </em>Letter from Randall W. Whitcomb (Jan. 4, 1995) (Ex. 376), and the other notes that levels were elevated, <em>see </em>Letter from Janet B. McGill to Robert Misbin (March 1, 2000) (Ex. 378).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-13\">As for the argument that \"[wjhere the liver is already significantly damaged ... or scarred, it will have less healthy cells and, therefore, less transaminases to release,\u201d PL Mem. 17; <em>accord </em>PL Facts \u00b6 244, the plaintiffs do not even cite expert testimony to that effect. Dr. Bonkovsky's Declaration, which the brief cites, <em>see </em>Pl. Mem. 17 n. 28, asserts that Rezulin can cause injury without an elevation of ALT but says nothing about a depletion of transaminases. <em>See </em>Bonkovsky Decl. \u00b6\u00b621-24, 29 (Ex. 332). Dr. Julie testified at the hearing \"that if there is enough hepatocyte and liver dysfunction and destruction, there may be a diminished hepatic reserve to the point where enzymes are much less likely to spike because of a lack of normal hepatic tissue,\u201d Tr. 5/21/03, at 252, but this statement was unsupported and it does not appear in Dr. Julie\u2019s declaration. The plaintiffs cite also testimony from physicians to the effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>that patients with cirrhosis do not always have elevated enzymes. PI. Mem. 17 n. 28. That testimony, however, says nothing about enzyme levels during any liver injury caused by Rezulin and, more to the point, it does not discuss the physiological theory in support of which the plaintiffs\u2019 brief cites it. <em>See </em>Julie (7/29/02) Dep. Ill (Ex. 281); Watkins (6/15/01) Dep. 162 (Ex. 306); Maddrey (7/16/02) Dep. 166 (Ex. 290). Finally, the plaintiffs cite a letter from Dr. Watkins to Parke-Davis stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-10\">\"Rezulin characteristically produces an he-patocellular injury, i.e., elevations in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) with normal serum bilirubin early in the course of injury. Jaundice generally occurs only when hepatocellular injury has been severe as indicated by serum ALT &gt; 1,000 IU/L of duration greater than 1 week. The only exception has been in patients caught very late in the course of their illness (when the liver\u2019s supply of ALT has been exhausted) or when the patients have preexisting severe cirrhosis.\u201d Letter from Paul B. Watkins to Mark Caswell (March 1, 1999) (Ex. 404).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9m\">This statement does not necessarily accord with the theory at issue. A patient can be an \"exception\u201d to the course of injury described in the letter and still exhibit abnormally elevated enzymes.

Under a separate heading, the text goes on to say that \"[cjhronic liver injury from some agents increases collagen deposition [i.e. fibrosis], often .... absent evidence of hepatocellular necrosis or inflammatory response.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That statement suggests that some drugs can cause liver injury without hepatocellular necrosis, but not that Rezulin is such a drug or that such injury would be silent (the injury could be cholestatic, which is not silent).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">The second reason why this passage in the <em>Cecil Textbook </em>does not help the plaintiffs is that medical textbooks by their nature are summaries of empirical research and therefore may contain inaccuracies and overgener-alizations. If a statement in a textbook is unsupported by research, the textbook does not buttress the reliability of the expert testimony in question. <em>See Caraker v. Sandoz Pharms.
