Upon the second trial the evidence was the same as on the former, except that the plaintiff gave documentary and expert evidence, which was controverted by the defendant, showing that on several other railroads rules and systems of practice similar to those which he contends it was the duty of the defendant to adopt and enforce were, and had been for some time, in general and successful operation, and expert evidence that they were reasonable and efficient. The law of this case may be regarded as established upon the former appeal (115 App. Div. 632, 101 N. Y. Supp. 211); and, the plaintiff having supplied proof as to the probable efficiency of the rules, a case was made for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-16\">It follows, therefore, that in granting defendant\u2019s motion for a non-suit the learned trial justice w-as in error, and the judgment must be reversed, and a new trial granted; costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-17\">HIRSCHBERG, P. J., and WOODWARD and MILLER, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"pAuc\">BURR, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AUMD\">I dissent. If there was sufficient evidence to to the jury that by other railroad companies a rule had been adopted that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>some member of the gang should be charged with the duty of watching for approaching cars and giving adequate warning of the'danger, the failure to adopt and enforce such a rule was not the proximate cause of the accident in this case. The very thing which such a rule was intended to accomplish was in fact done. The plaintiff was warned of the approaching cars in ample time to leave the track. He either did not hear, or neglected to obey, the warning.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
