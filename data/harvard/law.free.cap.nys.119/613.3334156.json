Upon motion of the defendant, this order allowing an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>execution to issue was vacated, and from that order the plaintiff appealed. On October 22, 1902, the plaintiff obtained a second order allowing an execution to issue to the sheriff under the same section of the Code, which execution is now in force, and the sheriff is acting under it. The defendant now moves to dismiss the appeal from the order entered on the 28th of May, 1909, on the ground that the plaintiff waived her right to appeal by obtaining the second order, under which execution has actually issued and is now in force.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">By the provisions of section 1391 of the Code of Civil Procedure, to entitle plaintiff to such an execution, it must appear that no prior execution under that section has been issued. There can, therefore, be but one execution under this section, and this court would not be justified in reversing the order of the Special Term, so long as an execution in favor of the plaintiff is outstanding. It is quite apparent, therefore, that the appeal will be unavailing, and we think it clear that, by obtaining the subsequent order allowing an execution to issue, she waived her right to appeal from the prior order vacating the prior execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">It follows that the appeal must be dismissed, but, under the circumstances, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
