The complaint is that, as the plaintiff was attempting to board one of the defendant\u2019s cars, it started before he had got in a position of safety. At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, the court granted a nonsuit. The court denied \u2022the plaintiff\u2019s motion to reopen the case to put in additional evidence, but granted a new trial for the purpose of enabling the plaintiff to do that; and the complaint of the appellant on this appeal is that the trial court should not grant a new trial solely for the purpose of giving a party another chance to present his evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-20\">We think, however, that the order may be'sustained, for the reason that the plaintiff\u2019s evidence presented a question for the jury. The plaintiff testified in-.substance that, as the car approached him, he signaled the motorman to stop, whereupon the car commenced to slow down, and as it reached him had nearly come to a stop; that while the car was thus moving very slowly, and almost coming to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>stop, he took hold of the stanchion, got both feet on the running board, and was about to step up inside the car, when the conductor rang the \"bell, the car started, his foot slipped, and- he fell and was dragged some distance.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The nonsuit was evidently granted upon the ground that there was no proof of the defendant\u2019s negligence, of any unusual movement of the car upon starting; but the negligence complained of was in accelerating the speed of the car at all before the plaintiff had got securely aboard. It has been held that the starting of a car before a woman passenger has obtained a seat presents a question for the jury. Dochtermann v. Brooklyn Heights R. R. Co., <em>32 </em>App. Div. 13, <em>52 </em>N. Y. Supp. 1051, affirmed 164 N. Y. 586, 58 N. E. 1087; Morrow v. Brooklyn Heights R. R. Co., 119 App. Div. <em>22, </em>103 N. Y. Supp. 998. What-ever be the rule in case the passenger is a man, he must at least be given an opportunity to get into a position of security; and the starting of the car, or accelerating its speed, while the passenger is still \u25a0attempting to step up into the car, and before he has got a firm footing, presents a question for the jury. It is not claimed that it is contributory negligence as matter of law to attempt to board a street car just coming to a stop. See Pfeffer v. Buffalo R. R. Co., 4 Misc. Rep. 465, 24 N. Y. Supp. 490, affirmed 144 N. Y. 636, 39 N. E. 494; Sexton v. Metropolitan Street Railway Co., 40 App. Div. 26, 57 N. Y. Supp. 577; Mulligan v. Metropolitan Street Railway Co., 89 App. Div. 207, 85 N. Y. Supp. 791; Morrison v. B. &amp; S. A. R. R. Co., 130 N. Y. 166, 29 N. E. 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">The order should be affirmed</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">Order affirmed, with costs. All concur; WOODWARD, J., in result</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
