No person, shall have, sell or offer for sale in the city of New York any food which is adulterated or misbranded. The term \u2018food\u2019 as herein used shall include every article of food arid every beverage used by man and all confectionery. Food, as herein defined, shall be deemed adulterated: * * * (g) If, in the case of confectionery, it contains terra alba, barytes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>talc, chrome yellow, or other mineral substance or poisonous color or flavor, \u00f3r other ingredient deleterious or detrimental to health, or any vinous, malt or spirituous liquor or compound or narcotic drug.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">He was sentenced to pay a fine of $10, or, in default, to imprisonment in the city prison for five days.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">It is urged against the judgment that the mere possession of such confections is not an offense under this section, and that there was no proof that the defendant had the confections for sale or offered them for sale. Buckley, an inspector, testified that he visited certain premises where the defendant carried on a \u201ccandy jobber\u201d business; that he saw the defendant at his place of business, and informed him that the witness was an inspector, come to examine his candies; that he examined a number of candies in boxes, and topk six samples thereof; that he paid the defendant 10 cents.for the six samples, which were taken- and delivered t\u00f3 the chemist of the health department. The witness further testified that he asked how much he owed to the defendant for these samples, whereupon the defendant \u201ctold me 10 cents, and I paid him 10 cents.\u201d As the witness asked how much he owed for the confections, and the defendant.named a price, which was paid andi accepted, this transaction was a voluntary sale, unaffected by the circumstance that it was made to a buyer who theretofore had said that he .was an inspector, who desired to examine his candies. Moreover, we think that the record justifies the conclusion that the defendant had for sale or was offering for sale these confections. They were taken from the confections kept in the defendant\u2019s place of business. The defendant admits that he was a \"jobber\u201d of candy, that he sold candies to the stores, that he had purchased these candies from a manufacturer, and that he had them at this place of business. There was no contention that these confections from which the samples were taken were bought for consumption by the defendant, or for any other use outside of his business of resale.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">It is further contended that the said section 68 does not apply to \"candy jobbers,\u201d in that the criminal intent is a necessary part of the-crime. The provision in its terms applies to a candy.jobber, if he be a person who sells or offers for sale, and such, as we understand, is the business of a \u201cjobber\u201d\u2014in other words, a middleman. As we read the provision, intention is not an element of the offense, and it is not essential that it should be. People v. Kibler, 106 N. Y. 321, 12 N. E. 795; People v. Werner, 174 N. Y. 132, 66 N. E. 667. The Legislature has seen fit to constitute the act itself the offense. If the statute seem severe in isolated cases, of which the one at bar may well be an example, if the uncontradicted contention of the defendant be true that he was deceived by the manufacturer, the courts have no powers of remission, limitation, or multiplication, in the face of the plain language of the statute. Such legislation has been justified by the paramount purpose to preserve the public health, because experience has taught that, if such statutes make intention to deceive and to defraud an essential part of the offense, they are of \u201clittle use and rarely accomplish their purpose.\u201d People v. Kibler, supra, 106 N. Y., at page 324, 12 N. E., at page 796.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">The judgment must be affirmed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
