After the answer had been interposed, a motion was made for judgment on the pleadings. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 537. Although the notice does not in express terms state that the ground of such motion is that the pleading is frivolous, that was its manifest purpose and intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-20\">The motion should have been granted. The answer in this case contains neither a general nor a specific denial of any material allegation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>of the complaint, nor any statement of any new matter constituting a defense or counterclaim. To be sufficient, an answer must contain either one or both. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 500. There is nothing in the answer to identify the suit therein referred to with that described in the complaint. It might have referred to something entirely different.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">If the complaint and answer could be supposed to relate to the same subject-matter, the answer is fatally defective in pleading a breach of warranty either as a defense or a counterclaim. It fails to state what was the grade or material of the suit which the plaintiffs agreed to sell to the defendant, or in what respects the suit delivered varied therefrom. No facts, or even conclusions, respecting this are' contained in the answer. At most it contains only an expression of opinion on the part of the defendant and his wife that the suit delivered was not of the grade or material agreed upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion for judgment granted, with .$10 costs of the motion and costs of the action. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
