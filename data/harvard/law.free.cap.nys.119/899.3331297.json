I shall notice only the latter ground. I quote the statement of the affiant relative to the subject of the defendant's residence, viz.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-15\">\u201cThat the defendant in said action, Edward F. Sehlichter, is not a resident of the state of New York, but that he resides in the city of Philadelphia, state of Pennsylvania. The deponent\u2019s knowledge as to the fact that the defendant is not a resident of the state of New York is based upon conversations had with defendant personally, and upon correspondence between plaintiffs and \u00abdefendant, upon the letter heads of the letters received from defendant in such correspondence; it being stated that defendant is the manufacturer of Philadelphia standard water towers, water and steel tanks for all purposes, \u2018Philadelphia\u2019 patent silo and patent roof, with his office at 1910 Market street, Philadelphia, Pa., and with works at Norristown, Pa.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b932-16\">It will be observed that no fact is stated upon which the judicial mind can base a conclusion. The affiant states as of his own knowledge that the defendant is a nonresident of the state of New York and resides in the state of Pennsylvania; but that statement is so qualified as to show that it was made on information and belief. The affiant states that his knowledge is based on conversations with the defendant. It is apparent that he means \u201cbelief,\u201d not \u201cknowledge.\u201d But it does not suffice that the affiant may be satisfied of the truth of what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>he states on information and belief. The court, not he, must decide the fact. If the conversations referred to had been stated, the court might conclude that they did not justify that belief, or a finding by' the court in accordance with it. The further statement that the defendant\u2019s letter heads show that he has an office in Philadelphia and a manufacturing plant at Norristown is not sufficient to establish nonresidence. The ground of the attachment was that the defendant was a nonresident. See subdivision <em>2, </em>\u00a7 636, of the Code of Civil Procedure. The court was required to find as a fact that the defendant was a nonresident before granting the order; but the papers before it disclose nothing upon which to base such a finding, except the opinion of one of the plaintiffs, and that does not suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-3\">The order should be reversed, and the motion granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion granted, with. \u2022$10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
