The complaint alleges that \u201cthe plaintiff rendered services to and for the defendants at the defendants\u2019 request, and on their promise to pay for the same, as an architect, and on like request and promise to pay therefor furnished materials necessary and proper to and about said work, labor, and services.\u201d The defendants answered separately, each denying the allegations of the complaint. In the affidavit upon which the order for the examination was granted it is stated \u201cthat this deponent has no knowledge of the relations existing between the two defendants aforesaid, or whether or not either of such defendants was the agent for the other during the happening of the events set forth in the complaint, the allegations of which complaint are true, and which allegations are hereby incorporated into and made a part of the affidavit with the same force and effect as though set forth in hsec verba herein, and that it will be unsafe for the plaintiff to proceed to the trial of this action without a disclosure on the part of the defendant Irwin B.

It is clear that the affidavit upon which the order for examination in this case was made does not comply with these requirements. No fact or circumstance to show that the deposition of the defendant is material and necessary is specified. On' the contrary, it is quite apparent that the testimony sought to be elicited would be neither material nor necessary to establish the cause of action alleged in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">Many of the technical rules which formerly restricted the right of a party to examine his adversary before trial have been relaxed;, but the fundamental rule that the testimony sought must be essential1 to the moving party\u2019s case has not been abrogated. Oakes v. Star Co., 119 App. Div. 358, 104 N. Y. Supp. 244; Caldwell v. Glazier, 128 App. Div. 315, 112 N. Y. Supp. 655.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion to vacate the order for examination granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
