Should the tenant not break the. conditions of the agreement, then the said amount will be applied by the landlord to the last two months\u2019 rent of the lease.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1040-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>The lease was dated June 12, 1907. The tenant failed to pay the rent which became due on September 1, 1907, whereupon the landlord collected a sum of money from the undertenants, and on September 6, 1907, began summary proceedings to recover possession of the premises, which culminated on September 18, 1907, in the issue of a warrant and the dispossession of the tenant. The tenant now sues to recover his deposit, less the amount of rent due when the warrant of dispossession was executed. He was defeated, upon the ground that his action was premature. The clauses of the lease bearing upon \u25a0this question are peculiar. They read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1040-5\">\u201c(8) That if the said premises, or any part thereof, shall become vacant \u2022during the said term, the landlord or his representatives may re-enter the same, either by force or otherwise, without being liable to prosecution therefor, and relet the said premises as the agent of the said tenant, and receive the rent thereof, applying the same, first, to the payment of such expense as he may be put to in re-entering, and then to the payment of the rent due by these presents; the balance, if any, to be retained by the landlord as liquidated damages.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1040-6\">\u201c(16) * * * That, if default be made in any of the covenants herein contained, then it shall be lawful for the said landlord to re-enter the said premises, and the same to have again, repossess, and enjoy. The said tenant hereby \u25a0expressly waives the service of any notice in writing of intention to re-enter, as provided for in the third section of an act entitled \u2018An act to abolish distress for rent and for other purposes,\u2019 passed May 13, 1846.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1040-7\">The privilege of the landlord to re-enter and let the premises as the \u2022agent of the tenant is expressly limited to the contingency of the premises being vacant, and there is neither allegation nor stipulation that they ever did become vacant. The condition as to the breach of the covenants, including the covenant to pay rent, is merely that the landlord may re-enter, and nothing is said about reletting as the agent \u2022of the tenant. In Anzolone v. Paskusz, 96 App. Div. 188, 89 N. Y. Supp. 203, and like cases, the covenant which was deemed to survive \u2022eviction was one for the payment of rent, and the fulfillment of all \u25a0covenants, and it was expressly agreed that, in case of the breach of any of these covenants, the landlord might re-enter and relet as the \u25a0agent of the tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-8\">A dispossession in summary proceedings under the statute terminates the lease, except as to the covenants and conditions which are \u2022expressly so drawn as to survive. The covenant for the payment of . rent was not so drawn in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-9\">The judgment must be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellants to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
