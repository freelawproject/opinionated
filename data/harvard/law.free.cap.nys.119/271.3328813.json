The property was so placed with the plaintiffs in January, 1906, at the selling price of $200,-000, with a commission of 2 per cent, to the plaintiffs. In the following April, or 1st of May, the plaintiffs called the attention of one Maxon W. Tifft to the property, giving him the price and terms of sale, and furnishing him the amount of rent received therefrom; but nothing more was done by the plaintiffs to induce Tifft to purchase, or to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>bring about an agreement between him and the defendant. Indeed, the plaintiffs did not even call the attention of the defendant to Tifft as a prospective buyer until the following October, after negotiations had been concluded and an agreement made directly between the defendant and Tifft for the sale of said property. On the 37th day of September, 1906, an agreement in writing between the defendant and Tifft was made for the sale of said property at the sum of $187,000. Tifft bought the property for his mother, and the deed was made to her October 15, 1906. There is no evidence that the defendant knew, or had any reason to believe, that Tifft had seen the plaintiffs about the property, or that the plaintiffs had ever called the attention of Tifft to the property, until after the defendant had agreed to sell the property to Tifft.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The learned trial court correctly held that the plaintiffs must establish that they were the procuring cause of the sale, arid so instructed the jury. We, however, are of the opinion that the evidence was insufficient to submit that question to the jury. The mere fact that the property was sold to the same person to whom the plaintiffs had, five or six months previous to the sale, given the information, without informing the defendant, or doing anything further to effect a sale, is not sufficient to entitle the plaintiffs to commissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">The judgment should therefore be reversed, arid a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
