The complaint alleges that the defendant received from each of certain French merchants a sum of money, or (in one case) certain merchandise, to be expended in advertising, and that he \u201cdid not apply said sum, or any substantial part thereof, to the express purpose for which he had received it from plaintiff, namely, to advertise plaintiff\u2019s merchandise, but, on the contrary, appropriated and converted the same to his own use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">The complaint wholly lacks the allegations necessary to charge a conversion, and neither the complaint nor affidavit states, nor can it be spelled out from them, how much defendant owes. It is not alleged that defendant received the money or goods in a fiduciary capacity, nor do the contracts show it. They are contracts for the sale of merchandise to defendant; plaintiff and his assignors agreeing to bear the cost of advertising up to a certain sum. It is not alleged that defendant represented that he had expended any particular sum, and upon such representation received payment. The allegation is that certain sums were sent to him to be expended in advertising, and that he has not, as yet, spent all that was sent him. This -may give plaintiff a right to recover back whatever has not been spent; but it does not imply fraud, or the violation of a fiduciary duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-12\">The order appealed from must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion to vacate granted, with $10 costs. All concur. ' 1</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
