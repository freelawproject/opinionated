The appellant appealed, and not demand a new trial in County Court. The County Court reversed the judgment \u201cupon questions of law,\u201d with $10 costs, and ordered a new trial before the justice who had tried the case. The appellant contends that the County Court exceeded its authority in ordering a new trial and in its award of costs, and we concur in this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Prior to the enactment of chapter 553, p. 1277, of the Laws of 1900, there was no power in the County Court to order a new trial in the court below, except where judgment had been taken by default and the appellate court was satisfied from the affidavits presented that manifest injustice had been done. Section 3064, Code Civ. Proc.; 3 Wait\u2019s Law &amp; Practice (7th Ed.) p. 635 et seq. By chapter 553, p. 1277 of the Laws of 1900, section 3063 was amended by permitting the appellate court, upon the reversal of a judgment, \u201cwhere the judgment is contrary to or against the weight of the evidence, * * * to order a new trial before the same justice; * * * and, in such a case, the costs of the appeal are in the discretion of the court.\u201d This statute was an innovation, extending the authority of the County Court, and yet limiting that authority to a case where the judgment is contrary to or against the weight of the evidence. This court, in a memorandum decision, distinctly recognized this limitation. Markel v. Gummer, 84 App. Div. 634, 82 N. Y. Supp. 1107. See, also, Gasson v. Atkins, 59 Misc. Rep. 145, 112 N. Y. Supp. 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The County Court erred in its award of costs. Its only power was to reverse or affirm the judgment. It had no discretion over the costs. They are regulated by statute. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 3066, subds. 3, 4, and section 3067.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">The judgment and order should be modified, by providing for the absolute reversal of the judgment, with costs to the appellant in this court and the courts below. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
