It also set forth the following note:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-16\">\u201c$700.00 Fulton, New York, April 18, 1908.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-17\">\u201cOn June 1, 1908, after date, the Fulton Contracting Company promises to-pay to the. order of James Davidson seven hundred ($700.00) dollars, at its office in Fulton, New York, value received, without interest to maturity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-18\">The answer pleads as a defense that the plaintiff is a foreign corporation doing business within the state of New York, and has not filed a certificate as required by section 15 of the general corporation-law (Consol. Laws, c. 23). Assuming that the note upon which the action was brought was made and indorsed in this state (section 76, Negotiable Instrument Law [Consol. Laws, c. 38]), that fact alone-did not establish that the plaintiff was doing business in this state.' There are many judicial definitions as to what constitutes doing business on the part of a foreign corporation within the state. Without reviewing the decisions, it is clear, from an examination of them, that a mere solitary transaction, or the making of a single contract within the state, does not constitute doing business in the state, within the meaning of the statute.
