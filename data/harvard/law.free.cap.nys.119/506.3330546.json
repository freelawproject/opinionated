The defendant appeals from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">There is no exact standard of what constitutes cruel and inhuman treatment. Conduct on the part of a husband which, under some circumstances, might be passed over without serious consideration, is, under other circumstances, cruel and inhuman. It depends upon the temperament, the breeding, the condition in life, and a great variety of special circumstances, which find peculiar expression upon the trial, and which cannot, in the very nature of things, be made to appear in a printed record. In the absence, therefore, of legal error, appellate courts should be reluctant to interpose to overthrow the findings of fact made by the justice presiding at the trial. While there are some matters in this record which appear comparatively trivial, and which might be accounted for by an'unreasoning jealousy on the part of the plaintiff, the testimony as a whole appears to be sufficient to justify the findings of fact made upon the trial, and, if the facts are as found, the judgment follows as a matter of course.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">It appears that, at a time when the parties were living together, they entered into a voluntary agreement to live apart, and the defendant in that agreement undertook to pay $700 per month, and to furnish a house and other things for the use of the plaintiff; and while, this agreement was, of course, void, it furnishes some basis for the determination of a proper allowance for the plaintiff in this action, when she has established her right to live apart from her husband, and the latter has no ground for complaint upon this score.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
