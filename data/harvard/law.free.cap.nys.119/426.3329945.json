The order appealed from va<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>cates that order and sets the case for trial peremptorily on a date named, \u201cunless the plaintiff stipulates that as a condition of such discontinuance he agrees not to sue again on the same cause of action, and to pay the taxable costs of this action and such additional allowance to defendant as the court may grant herein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">The pleadings are not before us; but the order appealed from appears to have been made on the affidavit of the defendant, which, however, does not state any reason for vacating the order of discontinuance. It appears that the action was brought for the purpose of impressing a trust in favor of the plaintiff upon certain real property of the defendant; but nothing is shown which would make it inequitable for the plaintiff to discontinue. The defendant says that she wants to try the issues on the merits); but a defendant cannot compel a plaintiff to litigate against his will, merely for the satisfaction of winning after a trial. If the plaintiff does not wish to prosecute his action, the defendant cannot require him to do so. It was proper to obtain the order of discontinuance ex parte. While the court retains control of the matter, and in a proper case has discretion to vacate such an order, that discretion can only be exercised when facts are presented justifying it. Matter of Butler, 101 N. Y. 309, 4 N. E. 518; Winans v. Winans, 124 N. Y. 140, 26 N. E. 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Moreover, upon the facts disclosed by this record, the court could not impose the condition that the plaintiff should stipulate not to bring another action (Kilmer v. Evening Herald Co., 70 App. Div. 291, 75 N. Y. Supp. 243) ; nor could the court require the plaintiff to stipulate that he would pay whatever additional allowance the court might grant. If the case was one for an extra allowance, that fact should have been shown by proof; and the plaintiff might have been required to pay the costs, including an additional allowance, as a condition of discontinuance, but he could not be required to stipulate away the right to test the question whether an additional allowance was proper, and no facts were shown justifying an additional allowance. See Schlegel v. Roman Catholic Church, 124 App. Div. 502, 108 N. Y. Supp. 955.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">The order appealed from should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
