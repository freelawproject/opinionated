Y. Supp. 1083, On the second trial the complaint was dismissed. The judgment entered upon the dismissal was reversed by the Court of Appeals, which held that upon plaintiff\u2019s evidence the jury might have found that a valid enforceable contract had been made between the parties. 195 N. Y. 63, 87 N. E. 798. To this extent, therefore, the law of the case is settled. Again the plaintiff has recovered a judgment, and we are now called upon to consider questions not heretofore considered. The contract upon which plaintiff relies is claimed to have been made on May 1, 1902, and provides for the sale by de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>fendant to plaintiff of \u201cabout 1,000 tons of broken coal per month for shipment previous to February 1st, 1903, at $3.90 per ton gross tons alongside within limits.\u201d So far as it was written, it was in the form of a letter by plaintiff requesting defendant to enter an order as above. No written or other acceptance of the order was shown, except that on May 5th and 7th defendant delivered to plaintiff 566 tons of coal. The plaintiff\u2019s claim is that this coal was delivered in part fulfillment of the contract, and thus constituted evidence of its acceptance by defendant, and took it out of the statute of frauds. Defendant claims that these were independent sales, having no reference to the alleged contract. On May 1, 1902, there commenced a strike at the coal mines which continued until October 20th of the same year, producing a famine in the coal market which greatly increased the price. During all this time the plaintiff, although he testifies that he was constantly obliged to buy coal of the same character which he says defendant had contracted to deliver him, made no demand upon defendant, and made no remonstrance at defendant\u2019s failure to deliver. The plaintiff testified that for three or four weeks before the 12th of May the coal strike was being discussed by the coal men, and the daily press, and that \u201cthe newspapers were taking it up pretty stiff.\u201d The defendant\u2019s printed billheads, in common use in his business, and which were sent to plaintiff for the shipments of May 5th and 7th, contained the notice: \u201cAll sales or contracts subject to strikes, accidents or other causes beyond our control.\u201d Notwithstanding the verdict of the jury, we find it incredible that under these circumstances the defendant would have made a firm contract at a low price covering the succeeding nine months with the probability of a general strike staring him in the face, and we find it equally incredible that plaintiff, if he really believed that he had such a contract, should never have called upon defendant to deliver coal under it, but should have gone elsewhere, and bought similar coal at much higher prices. The conclusion seems to us to be inevitable that neither party at the time believed or understood that any binding contract existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-5\">Assuming, however, that the jury was right in finding that there was such a contract, it remains to consider the exceptions taken upon the trial. The contract did not specify the time or place of delivery or the precise amount of coal to be delivered. All that it said about delivery is that it was to be \u201calongside within limits.\u201d What this means is not made evident by the contract itself, and is not explained by the testimony. As to the amount the order is for \u201cabout\u201d 1,000 tons per month, with the following qualifications:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-6\">\u201cFor the next three or four months I may not be able to take my full monthly quota, but shall live up to my obligations as nearly as possible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1059-7\">Under this contract, the plaintiff was not bound to take the full 1,000 tons per month, and the defendant could not have insisted upon delivering that' amount to him. The amount to be taken was distinctly left open to the plaintiff\u2019s determination. It was therefore incumbent upon him, if he desired deliveries under his alleged contract, to notify defendant month by month how much he was prepared to receive. This he did not do, and, in fact, made no demand whatever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>until December, 1902. Under a contract so indefinite' as to the amount to be delivered and the place of delivery, defendant was under no obligation to tender delivery until demand was .made upon him, or, at least, he was notified when, where, and how much to deliver.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-5\">The court permitted evidence to be given of the price of coal during the whole period of the strike, even permitting plaintiff to testify as to the prices at which he purchased similar coal from other parties. This was erroneous, not only because it covered a period during which defendant had not been called upon to make delivery, but also because the proof should have been limited to the market price of coal. No special damages were alleged, and it was incompetent to show what plaintiff paid in individual cases. -The error in the receipt of this evidence was accentuated by the charge, duly excepted to, which under other circumstances might not have been important, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1060-6\">\u201cThe plaintiff is.entitled to the difference between the value to him of the coal contracted for if it had been delivered and the price that the plaintiff was to pay therefor to be ascertained by the jury upon all the facts in the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1060-7\">The true rule in such a case is that if plaintiff is entitled to recover anything, it is the difference between the contract price and the market price of similar coal at the times when deliveries should have been made. As we construe the contract, a demand was necessary to put plaintiff in default as to the deliveries to be made in any month. As to any month in which no demand was made the plaintiff cannot recover at all, for the contract was not for 1,000 tons to be delivered -in installments, but for 1,000 tons per month. Each month therefore stands by itself, and, if delivery during any month was excused or waived, the defendant could not be compelled to make up the amount by delivering more than 1,000 tons in a succeeding month.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-8\">The judgment and order must be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-9\">INGRAHAM, LAUGHEIN, and HOUGHTON, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"pAX5t\">McLAUGHLIN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5S\">(dissenting). The Court of Appeals on the former appeal in this case held that a prima facie case was made for the jury and reversed this court, and ordered a new trial. Thedford v. Herbert, 195 N. Y. 63, 87 N. E. 798. The evidence introduced on the last trial was substantially the same as that on the former. The case was therefore properly sent to the jury, and the verdict cannot be said to be against the weight of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-11\">I vote to affirm the judgment, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
