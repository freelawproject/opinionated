The defendant duly demanded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>that the place of trial be changed to the county of New York. As it appeared that the plaintiff had never been a resident of the county of Queens, but was a resident of the county of Kings when he began his action, and that the defendant was a resident of New York county, the defendant was entitled to the change of venue as a matter of right. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 984; Nichols\u2019 New York Practice, p. 1930, and authorities cited. This absolute right could not be defeated by a showing as to the convenience of witnesses. Veeder v. Baker, 83 N. Y. 156; Mills v. Starin, 119 App. Div. 336, 104 N. Y. Supp. 230. After the change has been made, the plaintiff may then avail himself of either of the second and third subdivisions of section 987 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Authorities supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">The order must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion must be granted, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
