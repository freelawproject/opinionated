Held that, since a will may be altered only by pursuing one of the first two methods described, the tearing or obliterating of one clause of a will, with intent to revoke that clause and to permit the remainder to stand, is ineffectual, since no tearing or obliteration can-be effectual, unless it destroys the whole will, and is intended to do so.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b1036-11\">[Ed.

Curtis, the due execution of which was conclusively established, was revoked or altered by him in his lifetime. The paper offered for probate consisted of several sheets, and contained five paragraphs, numbered from first to fifth, inclusive. The paragraph numbered third was incomplete upon the paper as offered. It contained the words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1037-13\">\u201cThird. I give and bequeath uuto my brother-in-law Frank.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1037-14\">This paragraph began near the foot of the first sheet. A portion of the bottom of that sheet was missing. It presented the appearance of having been either cut or torn off. In the margin, and nearly opposite the words above quoted was a memorandum in the handwriting \u25a0of the said Curtis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1037-15\">\u201cCancelled the 3rd paragraph, June 30, 1908. B. F. Curtis.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1037-16\">The testimony of all of the witnesses to the execution of the will was to the effect that when it was executed it was not in its present form. As was stated by one of them, at that time\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1037-17\">\u201cit was a complete instrument. That third paragraph was still in the will. \"The first page of the will which was signed by me and the other witnesses contained a full first page, and the paper now handed to me at the bottom of the first page has a portion torn off, removing a part of the third paragraph.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1037-18\">Attached to the original will is a codicil, and the same witness, testifying in regard to the execution of the codicil, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1037-19\">\u201cI must have seen the will at that time. It was in the same condition as at the time I signed the original will.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1037-20\">Another witness, testifying as to the execution of the codicil, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1037-21\">\u201cI saw the will there., Mr. Carley was handling the will at that time. He was turning over the pages, and I saw the original will. It was a perfect will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>at that time\u2014no mutilation or destruction of any part of it. It was a complete will. * * * When I signed the codicil, I say that it was not mutilated, as it is now shown me. I am sure that it was not mutilated when the codicil was written and signed. * * * I myself engrossed the original will and codicil, so that I know positively that it was complete when the codicil was written there.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1038-5\">Still another witness, testifying as to the execution of the will, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1038-6\">\u201cIt [the first page] was not in the same condition then as now. * * * At that time the will was in perfect condition so far as the first page was concerned.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1038-8\">Assuming, as we must upon the evidence in this case, that the mutilation of the paper_was the act of the said Curtis, we are of the opinion that by such act the will was neither revoked nor altered in the manner prescribed 'by the statute. 3 Gumming &amp; G. Gen. Laws, p. 4464, \u25a0\u00a7 43. This statute permits the revocation of a will in three ways: (a) By some other will in writing; (b) by some other writing of the testator, declaring such revocation and executed with the same formalities with which the will itself was required by law to be executed; (c) by burning, tearing, canceling, obliterating, or destroying with the intent and for the purpose of revoking the same. But the statute permits a will to be altered only in one or the other of the first two methods described. The tearing or obliteration of one clause in a will, although with a purpose of revoking the same and permitting the remainder of the will to stand, is not effectual for that purpose. No tearing or obliteration can be effectual, unless it altogether destroys the whole will and was intended so to do. Lovell v. Quitman, 35 Hun, 537, affirmed 88 N. Y. 377, 43 Am. Rep. 254; Burnham v. Comfort, 108 N. Y. 535, 540, 15 N. E. 710, 2 Am. St. Rep. 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-9\">\u2022While it may be conceded that there is some evidence of an intention on the part of the testator to alter his will and revoke the third paragraph thereof, mere intention to revoke or alter is ineffectual, unless accompanied by such physical act as the statute declares to be necessary to accomplish the purpose. In re Akers, 74 App. Div. 461, 77 N. Y. Supp. 643, affirmed on opinion below 173 N. Y. 620, 66 N. E. 1103. As there was, therefore, no effectual alteration of any part of the will or revocation of the third paragraph thereof, if any will is to be admitted to probate, it must be a will in the form and condition in which the will was when originally executed and witnessed. Schouler on Wills (3d Ed.) p. 484, \u00a7 434; Simrell\u2019s Estate, 154 Pa. 604, 26 Atl. 599, 35 Am. St. Rep. 864; Jackson v. Holloway, 7 Johns. 394; Quinn v. Quinn, 1 Thomp. &amp; C. 437; In re Wilcox\u2019s Will (Sur.) 20 N. Y. Supp. 131; In re Penniman, 20 Minn. 245 (Gil. 220), 18 Am. Rep. 368; Hesterberg v. Clark, 166 Ill. 241, 46 N. E. 734, 57 Am. St. Rep. 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-10\">But the paper admitted to probate by the learned Surrogate\u2019s Court of Queens county is not in the form and condition in which the will of Benjamin F. Curtis was when originally executed and written. The second finding of fact of the said Surrogate\u2019s Court, to the effect that the will made and executed by the said Benjamin E. Curtis was \u201cin the words and figures following: * * * Third. I give and bequeath unto my brother-in-law Prank\u201d\u2014and the seventh finding of fact, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>the effect \u201cthat no proof has been made that the third paragraph of said will contained, any other words than as found by me in the second finding herein,\u201d is not only not sustained by the evidence, but is directly contrary to all of the evidence introduced in the case. Whether, upon the evidence that was introduced with respect to the contents of paragraph third of the said will, the Surrogate\u2019s Court would have been justified in finding exactly what the language of that paragraph originally was, we express no opinion, as upon the new trial, which must be had herein, additional evidence may be introduced. _ It would be unfortunate if, by reason of inability to produce sufficient satisfactory evidence upon that point, it became necessary to deny probate altogether. In re Barber, 92 Hun, 489, 37 N. Y. Supp. 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-5\">The decree of the Surrogate\u2019s Court of Queens county must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs of this appeal to the appellant to be paid out of the estate. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
