Murphy v. Interurban St. Ry. Co. (Sup.) 88 N. Y. Supp. 187.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-15\">It seems to us that the order should be modified, by imposing as a condition- for the granting of the same the payment of a sum equal to costs before and after notice of trial, one term fee, and a trial fee, and, as so modified the order is affirmed, without costs to either party of this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
