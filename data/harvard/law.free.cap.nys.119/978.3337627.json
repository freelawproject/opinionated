Harris \u201cmade in the manner, to the extent and upon the blanks required\u201d in said policy. One of the conditions contained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>in the policy was that it should be void if the insured before its date had \u201cbeen attended by a physician for any serious disease or complaint; or has had before said date any * * * disease of the ' * * * kidneys.\u201d Another condition of the policy was that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-6\">\u201cProofs of death under this policy shall be made upon blanks to be furnished by the company and shall contain * * * the record, evidence, and verdict \u00abof the coroner\u2019s inquest, if any be held.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1012-7\">On July 27, 1907, the said Henry G. Harris died. Thereafter the plaintiff began this action to recover the amount of the said policy, and alleged in her complaint that the plaintiff had submitted to the defendant \u201cproofs of death in accordance with the terms and conditions of the said policy,\u201d and that the plaintiff and the insured had performed all of the \u201ccovenants and conditions on his and her part in said contract or policy to be performed.\u201d From the judgment rendered in the said action, the defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-8\">Having alleged compliance, the plaintiff cannot establish waiver of performance of either covenants or conditions. Allen v. Dutchess County Mut. Ins. Co., 95 App. Div. 86, 88 N. Y. Supp. 530; Williams v. Fire Association of Philadelphia, 119 App. Div. 573, 104 N. Y. Supp. 100. The plaintiff failed to show a submission of proofs of death in accordance with the terms and conditions of the policy. She testified that after the death of the insured she called at the office of the company, and they gave her a paper which they instructed her to fill up and return. She then offered in evidence a paper partly printed and partly written, entitled: \u201cMetropolitan Life Insurance Company. Statement of Claimant.\u201d This paper, which she says that, she signed \u25a0and gave to' the insurance collector, was\u2019 not verified, although the \u25a0.printed blank contained a form of oath to be administered to the \u2022claimant. In answer to the question, \u201cCause of death,\u201d was written the words, \u201cSee transcript.\u201d When this paper was offered in evidence, it was objected to as immaterial, irrelevant, and incompetent, and on the ground that it was incomplete. It was- admitted, and the defendant excepted. If this unverified paper could be deemed a proof o,f death (O\u2019Reilly v. Guardian Mutual Life Ins. Co., 60 N. Y. 169, 19 Am Rep. 151; Glazer v. Home Insurance Co., 113 App. Div. 235, 98 N. Y. Supp. 979), it was incomplete. Accompanying the paper, -which was produced by the defendant, although not physically attached to it, was another paper, entitled \u201cA Transcript from the Records of the Deaths Reported to the Department of Health of the City of New York.\u201d This was certified by the chief clerk of the department of health in the borough of Manhattan, and the seal of the department was attached, as required by section 933, of the Code of Civil Procedure. It was therefore competent evidence. People ex rel. Sears v. Tobey, 153 N. Y. 381, 47 N. E. 800. It purported to be the certificate and record of the death of Henry Harris.. It does not appear how this paper came into the defendant\u2019s hands. After the paper offered by the plaintiff had been received in evidence against defendant\u2019s objection and exception, the defendant offered this paper in evidence, and it was excluded upon the ground that the plaintiff had never seen it. The fair meaning of the plaintiff\u2019s answer to the question, \u201cCause of-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>death,\u201d must be a cause stated in some transcript of the record of the death of the insured. It does not appear that there was any other record thereof. The identity of the person referred to in the death certificate with the person referred to in the policy of insurance is presumptively established by the identity of name. Hatcher v. Rocheleau, 18 N. Y. 87; Hartshorn v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 55 App. Div. 471, 67 N. Y. Supp. 13; Layton v. Kraft, 111 App. Div. 842, 98 N. Y. Supp. 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">This presumption is further strengthened by the fact that the place of death stated in the death certificate and in plaintiff\u2019s statement is the same, and that the names of the father and mother of the deceased and the insured are also the same. \u25a0 The plaintiff must be deemed by her answer to the question to have authorized the defendant to make this official transcript of the record of the death of Henry Harris a part of the paper which she submitted as a proof of death. If it was proper in the first instance to admit the paper offered by the plaintiff without this, certainly it was competent for the defendant to have this paper received in evidence to complete the statement made by the plaintiff. The materiality and importance of this evidence becomes apparent when we find from an inspection of such paper that the cause of Harris\u2019 death was stated to be, \"Alcoholism, Chronic Bright\u2019s,\u201d and that a coroner\u2019s inquest was held. That being the case, in order to make the proofs complete, it was the duty of the plaintiff, under the express provision of the policy, to furnish to the defendant the record, evidence, and verdict of the said coroner\u2019s inquest, and, until that was done, proofs of loss in accordance with the terms of the contract, and which were a necessary condition precedent to the right to recover upon the policy, had not been furnished.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">It is probable that other errors prejudicial to the defendant were committed in the course of the trial; but, inasmuch as this is sufficient to require a reversal of the judgment, it' is unnecessary that these should be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-7\">The judgment appealed from should be reversed, and a new trial-ordered ; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
