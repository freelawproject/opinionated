The demurrer has been overruled; the defendant appealing to this court from the interlocutory judgment entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-20\">It is undoubtedly true that the plaintiff has included in his complaint matters which would in part sustain an action for breach of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>contract, as well as one for deceit and fraud; but he has made no attempt to separately state two causes of action, and it may be fairly gathered from the pleading that the purpose of the recitals was to show the grounds on which the plaintiff acted in accepting the alleged false and fraudulent statements, rather than as material allegations in a cause of action for breach of contract. A careful perusal of the complaint leads to the conclusion that the plaintiff has merely set forth an action for deceit and fraud, and that the demurrer of the defendant has been properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">The interlocutory judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur, except MILLER, J., not voting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
