Among the tenants was the appellant, Merrill who held under a written lease dated April 5, 1909, and running for three years. Demand was made by receiver for the payment of the sum of $200, the rent for the months of June and July. Merrill refused to pay, claiming that he had paid five months\u2019 rent in advance. Summary proceedings to remove him were commenced in the Municipal Court, which were dismissed, and no appeal was taken. The receiver then instituted proceedings to punish the appellant for contempt for nonpayment of the rent. The order appealed from is the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">There are several fatal objections to the order. In the first place, it does not contain the absolutely necessary adjudication that the tenant\u2019s failure to pay the rent was calculated to, or actually did, defeat, impair, impede, or prejudice the rights or remedies of the complaining party. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 2281; Obermeyer v. Adisky, 123 App. Div. 272, 107 N. Y. Supp. 949; Schweig v. Schweig, 122 App. Div. 787, 107 N. Y. Supp. 905. In the second place, the defendant is fined $300, whereas the only proof contained in the moving papers showed him to be in default for $200. In the third place, it was improper to include the motion costs in the fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">These reasons require a reversal of the order. In resting our decision upon these grounds, we are not to be understood as intimating that a resort to cpntempt proceedings is the proper method to collect rent in cases like the present. The receiver claims the rent by virtue of a lease made by the owner of the property. He stands in the landlord\u2019s shoes, and has the same remedies in case of nonpayment of rent that the landlord himself would have had, but for the appointment of the receiver. This does not include the right to collect rent by contempt proceedings. The landlord might have dispossessed the tenant for nonpayment of rent, or might have sued him, and this is what the order appointing the receiver authorized him to do. A different case is presented when a person, claiming to be the lessee of the entire premises, collects rent from the subtenants in defiance of the order which forbids him to do so. In such cases, the person collecting the rent is -deemed to interfere with the possession of the property by the court, and can be compelled to pay to the receiver the rents actually collected. Fletcher v. McKeon, 71 App. Div. 278, 75 N. Y. Supp. 817; Id., 74 App. Div. 231, 77 N. Y. Supp. 465; Moore v. Smith, 70 App. Div. 614, 74 N. Y. Supp. 1089. This is a very different thing from using contempt proceedings for the collection of rents due upon' a lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
