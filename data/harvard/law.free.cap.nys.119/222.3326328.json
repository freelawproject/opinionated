J.</author>\n<p id=\"AzB\">The defendant by an instrument in writing, designated therein as a \u201clease,\u201d contracted with plaintiff to \u201clet\u2019\" to plaintiff, who agreed to \u201ctake\u201d from defendant, \u201call that certain right or privilege to maintain three stands in Steeplechase Park, Coney Island, N. Y., for the sale of all kinds of candies, peanuts, and popcorn, the said right being the exclusive right for said business within Steeplechase Park from the beach to Surf avenue; also, in addition, the storeroom under the Steeplechase .tracks, and one of said stands to be located in the main pavilion of Steeplechase Park, as already designated, and its size not to exceed 8x8 feet.\u201d The period of such \u201cletting\u201d was to be from the opening day of said park to the 1st day of October, 1907, at a \u201crent\u201d of $1,200, payable $600 on the signing of the instrument, $300 on June 15, 1907, and $300 on July 5, 1907. Plaintiff took possession and made the payments above mentioned. The last of such payments was made on July 5,1907, which was in full for the whole season. Thereafter, and on July 28, 1907, the entire park was destroyed by fire, and plaintiff here sues to recover that proportion of the said \u201crent\u201d of $1,200 which would cover the period subsequent to July 28, 1907, and between that date and October 1, 1907, when the lease by its terms was to terminate.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>The only question presented is this: Was the instrument a lease or a license? If it was a lease, the rent due and owing, and paid on July 5th, cannot be recovered, notwithstanding the destruction by fire on July 28, 1907. The test of the distinction between a lease and a license depends, substantially, upon the question whether or not the contract or authority granting the right to enter upon the land of another confers upon the person so entering an interest in the land, so as to affect the other in the exclusive use of his land. While it is true that the mere use of the 'words \u201clease\u201d and \u201clet\u201d in the contract does not necessarily create a lease, as distinguished from a license, nevertheless the instrument in suit must be regarded as a lease, since it gave plaintiff a right to the possession and use, not only of a certain specified space of ground for his stands, but also of the storeroom under the tracks, which right of use and possession certainly affected defendant\u2019s right to the exclusive use of its land. We are of opinion, therefore, that the learned court below fell into error in holding that the instrument was a license, and not a lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
