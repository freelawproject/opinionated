We think, however, that the payment of the taxable costs of the action up to the time of the making of such motion should have been imposed as a condition for granting the \u201cmotion. See In re Ryan, 70 Hun, 149, 24 N. Y. Supp. 277, affirmed 141 N. Y. 550, 36 N. E. 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-18\">Order modified, by imposing payment of the taxable costs in the action as a condition for granting the motion, and, as thus modified, affirmed, without costs of this appeal to either party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
