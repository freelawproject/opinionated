He demanded judgment against the owner of the property for the said sum of money, that the lien be declared a valid lien against the realty until \u25a0discharged by the payment of the judgment, that the surety be declared liable, and that he have such other and further relief as might be just and proper. The defendant demurred, on the ground that it appeared on the face of the complaint that the court did not have jurisdiction. That demurrer was sustained, with leave to plead over, but in case of failure the defendants should have judgment absolute. The plaintiff \u25a0did not plead over, and judgment absolute was rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">This court is committed to a conclusion contrary to that of the learned Municipal Court. Eadie v. Waldron, 64 App. Div. 424, 72 N. Y. Supp. 233. We may surmise that our decision was not called to the attention of the learned court, inasmuch as it does not appear upon the points of either of the defendants upon this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
