J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7Q\">On March 14, 1898, defendant made and delivered to plaintiff\u2019s testator, for value, the following note:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-28\">\u201c$150.00. New York, March 14, 1898.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-29\">\u201cOn demand, after date, I promise to pay to the order of George Van Vliet one hundred and fifty dollars, at my store, 852 B\u2019way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-30\">\u201cValue received. Fred\u2019k Kanter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>It is conceded' that payment was demanded formally on July 2, 1908, and that payments aggregating $82.50 had been received and. applied upon the principal of the note prior to \"such formal demand, and defendant\u2019s liability on the note is not disputed. A counterclaim on the part of defendant, however, amounting to $63.50, with interest from November 1, 1908, is also conceded. The only point in issue is whether interest should be allowed on the note from its date and delivery, March 14, 1898, or from the date1 of the actual formal demand, July 2, 1908. The court below allowed interest from the date and delivery of the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">As we have seen, the note is payable on demand, and the demand is presumed to have been made at the time of the delivery of a demand note, at which time the note became payable and the right of action-complete. Church v. Stevens, 56 Misc. Rep. 572,107 N. Y. Supp. 310, and cases cited. In the case of a demand note, the word \u201cdemand\u201d is not to be treated as a part of the contract, but is used to show the debt is due (McMullen v. Rafferty, 89 N. Y. 547); and, as stated in Ledyard v. Bull, 119 N. Y. 63, 23 N. E. 444, \u201cmoney payable on demand does not draw interest until after demand.\u201d As interest is not payable by the terms of the contract, it is recoverable on- the theory of damages for the detention of the principal, and from such time as defendant was placed in default (1 Suth. Dam. 619, 620; In re Trustees, 137 N. Y. 95, 32 N. E. 1054); and, as a promissory note payable on-demand is due forthwith upon delivery of the note (Hyman v. Doyle, 53 Misc. Rep. 597, 103 N. Y. Supp. 778), interest became payable on such delivery as damages for the nonpayment of the money due (Ledyard v. Bull, 119 N. Y. 74, 23 N. E. 444).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The result reached by the court below was correct, and the judgment must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.
