It appears that the defendant was appointed and qualified as receiver of the Second Avenue line in September, and therefore at the time of the accident the title to all the property of the company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>was in him; but it also appears by affirmative testimony that the defendant started to operate the road only at midnight on November 12th, and the Metropolitan Company was operating the road on October 15th. Since the defendant is liable only for the negligence of his own servants, if he was not operating the road at the time of the accident, the fact that the title of the road had vested in him before that time is immaterial. The negligence of the trolley driver is imputed to the person who had general control of his acts and who employed him, and it is not imputed to the owner of the road. It is not a question of who controlled the road, but of who controlled the driver whose negli- \u2022 gence caused the accident. _ .</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">_ The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
