Corporations have the power to do certain acts specified in their articles of incorporation or in the general statutes, and such powers as flow from and are incident and necessary to the exercise of the enumerated powers, but no power to assume the debt of another corporation for a consideration moving to the original debtor. It seems well settled that such a power is not incidental to the powers expressly conferred on corporations organized under statutes authorizing the formation of corporations for business or manufacturing purposes. National Park Bank v. German-American Co., 116 N. Y. 281, 22 N. E. 567, 5 L. R A. 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The act of the president could, therefore, not bind the corporation; nor should the corporation be estopped from setting up that this act was ultra vires. The doctrine of estoppel in ultra vires is based upon the rule that, where the contract has been executed, the corporation is presumed to have received the benefit, and should not be permitted to escape the burden; but where the benefit is alleged and -proven to have been rendered to another, and at the request of the party benefited, the rule does not apply. The case is absolutely barren of any \u25a0proof of benefit to the defendant corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
