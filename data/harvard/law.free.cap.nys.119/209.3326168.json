When the case was reached for trial, a stipulation, signed by the attorneys for the respective parties, was filed, which stipulation, omitting its title, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-20\">\u201cIt is hereby stipulated and agreed by and between the attorneys for the respective parties hereto, for the purposes of the trial of the above-entitled action: That on the 2d day of July, 1906, there was an open account between plaintiff and defendants, showing credits to the plaintiff for trucking done by it for the defendants. On the 1st day of July, 1906, that account showed a credit in favor of plaintiff for at least the sum of $364.65. That on the 2d day of July, 1906, defendants debited plaintiff\u2019s account with the sum of $364.65.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-21\">.After this stipulation was filed, the plaintiff moved to amend its complaint to show:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-22\">\u201cThat on or about July 2, 1906, an account was stated between .the plaintiff and the defendants, and at such accounting it was shown that the defendants were indebted to the plaintiff in the sum of $364.65.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>Although the defendants objected to this amendment being made, they did not claim surprise, and the case proceeded to trial. The president of the plaintiff testified that the defendants had paid the plaintiff no money on account of the <em>$36\u00e1.65, </em>and that was substantially all the testimony given by the plaintiff to sustain the allegations of either the complaint as originally made or the amended complaint. The defendants attempted to giye, and gave, some testimony tending to show that the plaintiff had, while doing some trucking for them, obtained a case of goods from the steamer Campania for delivery to the Lehigh Valley Railroad Company, which case was never delivered by plaintiff to the railroad company, and for the loss of which defendants paid a sum equal to the sum of $364.65. What connection the defendants had with the Lehigh Valley Railroad Company was not shown, nor why the defendants were obligated to pay that company for goods lost by the plaintiff does not appear. Some evidence tending to show that the plaintiff, whom they engaged to do the defendants\u2019.trucking business, agreed to become responsible for any loss occasioned by it, was offered by the defendants, but refused by the trial justice, on the objection of plaintiff\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">As before stated, the plaintiff offered no testimony whatever in support of its original claim for work, labor, and services, and relied wholly upon the legal effect of the stipulation abovp quoted as constituting \u201can account stated.\u201d In this it is in error. At most it was a mere admission on the part of the defendants that on July <em>2, </em>1906, \u201cthere was an open account,\u201d which is far from being an account stated between plaintiff and defendants, and that such account showed a credit in favor of plaintiff of at least $364.65,- and that on that day the defendants \u201cdebited\u201d or charged to plaintiff the sum of $364.65; the whole effect of the stipulation being that, so far as the account between the plaintiff and defendants stood on July <em>2, </em>1906, the credit and debit were exactly the same. The stipulation, at most, was an admission on the part of the defendants; and, if the plaintiff relies upon that admission as sustaining its cause of action upon either its original or amended complaint, such admission is equally available to the defendants, as showing that the plaintiff admitted a charge against it of an amount equal to the plaintiff\u2019s credit. The admission, if taken at all, must be taken as a whole. Viewed in that way, it proves nothing. As the record now stands, the plaintiff proved no cause of action against the defendants, and the defendants failed to show that the plaintiff was liable to the defendants by reason of any goods lost by it. There should, therefore, be a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellants to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b242-7\">DAYTON, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ato\">(dissenting). No counterclaim was pleaded, and yet was as to a plaintiff\u2019s liability therefor. The stipulation is to the effect that, before this action was brought, the parties found a credit in plaintiff\u2019s favor in the amount sued for and a debit for the .same sum against it. It appears, however, that this debit was made without plaintiff\u2019s consent, and was claimed in part payment, or- offset, for the \u201clost package.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>Though not pleaded, that question was litigated unsuccessfully by the defendants. The admission that $364.65 was due plaintiff was unchallenged, and thus plaintiff was entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">It seems to me that our former conclusion was correct, and that the judgment should be again affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
