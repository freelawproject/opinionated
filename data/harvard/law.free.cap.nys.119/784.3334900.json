The legal questions involved in the present case are the same that are considered in the case by this appellant against Samuel De Waltoff (decided herewith) 119 N. Y. Supp. 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-18\">The lease involved herein was for three years, at $1,000 a year, and the tenant claims to have paid the whole rent for the full term in advance. Although the justice of the Municipal Court found that the defense of payment had been established, the evidence to sustain it is most unsatisfactory. The tenant claims to have paid $500 in -cash. This may well be true, but that amount would have been more than eaten up before the present landlord demanded rent of him. The remaining $2,500 the tenant claims to have paid by rendering professional services, or receipting for such services already rendered. To establish such a defense, in a case surrounded by such circumstances as surround the present case, the evidence of the services claimed to have been rendered and their value should be clearly shown. It is not sufficient that the mortgagor receipted for the amount. The ten-: ant\u2019s evidence as to the nature and extent of the services was vague and unsatisfactory, and there was no evidence whatever as to their value, or from which the court could estimate their value. The burden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>of proving prepayment rests upon the tenant, and the proof should be clear and convincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">The determination of the Appellate Term atid the final order of the Municipal Court must be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs in this court and the Appellate Term to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
