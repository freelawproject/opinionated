The defendants both own and operate lines of electrical railways in the borough of Brooklyn, city of New York. The plaintiff was a passenger on a car belonging to defendant the Nassau Electric Railroad Company. A collision occurred between the car in which plaintiff was riding and a car belonging to the defendant the Brooklyn Heights Railroad Company, in consequence of which plaintiff was injured. No evidence was offered showing how the collision occurred, or which company was at fault. It is well established that in such a case the mere happening of the accident raises a presumption of negligence on the part of the carrying company, and casts upon it the task of showing that it was free from fault. This results from the high degree of care required from a common carrier towards its passengers. Loudoun v. Eighth Avenue R. R. Co., 162 N. Y. 381, 56 N. E. 988; Duhme v. Hamburg-American Packet Co., 184 N. Y. 404, 77 N. E. 386, 112 Am. St. Rep. 615; Henson v. Lehigh Valley R. R. Co., 194 N. Y. 205, 87 N. E. 85, 19 L. R. A. (N. S.) 790. The same rule, however, does not apply to the owner of the colliding car in which plaintiff was not a passenger. Falke v. Third Avenue R. R. Co., 38 App. Div. 49, 55 N. Y. Supp. 984.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-13\">The complaint was therefore properly dismissed as to the Brooklyn Heights Railroad Company, but improperly dismissed as to the Nassau Electric Railroad Company. The determination is therefore affirmed as to the Nassau Electric Railroad Company, and as to the Brooklyn Heights Railroad Company it is reversed, and the judgment of the Municipal Court affirmed, without costs to either party as against the other in this court or in the Appellate Term. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
