At the very end of the charge, and just before the case was submitted to the jury, the court charged the plaintiff\u2019s request, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-7\">\u201cIf the jury find that the mother of the plaintiff sent her child out into the street in the care and custody of a guardian, and if they further find that defendant maintained this defective railing in a negligent manner, then they must find for the plaintiff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">This charge took the question of contributory negligence from the jury, and practically nullified the previous portions of the charge as to that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">There are other errors, which need not here be discussed, as a new trial should be granted for the prejudicial error above stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
