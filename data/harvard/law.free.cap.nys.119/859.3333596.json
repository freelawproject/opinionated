J.</author>\n<p id=\"ACf\">The defendant was indicted for poisoning cattle-under section 660 of the Penal Code. He was indicted by a grand jury drawn for a term of the Supreme- Court in St. Lawrence county. The-case was sent to the County Court. The defendant demurred to the indictment for lack of jurisdiction. The demurrer was sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">The case of People v. Knatt, 156 N. Y. 302, 50 N. E. 835, seems to have settled two questions: First, that a crime committed under-section 660 of the Penal Code is one triable exclusively in a Court of Special Sessions under section 56 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, unless the certificate provided for under section 57 of the Code of Criminal Procedure be made. -It was conceded upon the trial that such a certificate was not made. It is further settled by the majority of the court in that case that the jurisdiction of the court could not be-raised by a demurrer, but could only be raised by motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">It is unnecessary for us to pass in any way upon the merits of this-appeal. The district attorney does not claim that the grand jury had any jurisdiction to find this indictment. The defendant was, therefore, entitled to his discharge; and if we reverse this judgment, and overrule this demurrer, it would simply result in sending the prisoner back for his discharge upon motion. We are at a loss to understand how there is any practical question before us. The appeal, therefore,, should be dismissed,.without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-9\">Appeal dismissed, without costs. All concur. ,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
