Defendant, in his answer, alleges that he is the owner, and sets up, as a separate defense, that plaintiff intrusted the mare to one Gibson for sale, and \u201cclothed said Gibson-with the indicia of ownership of said mare,\u201d whereby he was induced to purchase her in the belief that she was the property of Gibson. Defendant now appeals from an order for a bill of particulars by which he is directed to furnish defendant,- together with other information, with \u201ca full statement of the acts of plaintiff or the facts constituting such indicia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-17\">The phrase \u201cclothe with indicia of ownership\u201d is a metaphorical expression of such uncertain meaning that it is clearly the duty' of plaintiff's attorney to inform himself as to the particulars of this defense before proceeding to trial; but the order which he has obtained requires a disclosure of evidentiary facts. In Smith v. Anderson; 126 App. Div. 24, <em>26, </em>110 N. Y. Supp. 191, it appeared that defendant had-pleaded a release, and plaintiff had obtained an order for a bill of-particulars \u201cof the'specific words, acts, and writings * * * constituting the release.\u201d The order was modified so as to require defendant to state whether or not the release was express, and, if so,' to set forth a copy thereof, and, if implied from acts, to set forth in general terms the nature of those acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number>Section 4 of the order appealed from is modified, so as to read as follows: \u201cIf such \u2018indicia\u2019 were not in writing, a statement, general in terms, of the acts of plaintiff or the facts constituting such indicia\u201d \u2014and, as so modified, affirmed, without costs, but with disbursements to the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-3\">GIEGERICH, J., concurs.
