The judgment asked is that the Union, its officers and members, be required to supply to the plaintiffs such competent help as may be required, and enjoined from further violating the terms of the agreement. The plaintiffs secured an order to .show cause why an injunction pendente lite should not be granted; the only reason for requesting such an order, stated in the moving affidavit, being \u201cbecause plaintiffs desire a temporary injunction as aforesaid, having given the undertaking required by law.\u201d Upon the return of the order, the order appealed from was made, which is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>\u201cThat the defendant supply these plaintiffs with such employ\u00e9s, who are members of its Union, who are not employed at the present time, * * * during the pendency of the agreement between the defendant and the Cloth Spongers\u2019 Employers\u2019 Association, bearing date November 22, 1907.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">There are many objections to this order. It is by no means certain that the complaint states a cause of action; for, besides technical defects, it is doubtful whether any one but the Association could enforce the terms of the agreement, or whether it could be enforced by injunction at all. The agreement is recited to be under seal, and, if that is so, the plaintiffs certainly could not bring any action thereon, Henricus v. Englert, 137 N. Y. 488, 33 N. E. 550. In any event, however, the order could not stand, because it enjoins the defendant, not during the pendency of the action, but during the pendency of the agreement, which was to last until December 31, 1910. It thus grants the very relief demanded in the complaint, the right to which can be determined only upon the trial of the action. Oppenheim v. Thanasoulis, 123 App. Div. 494, 108 N. Y. Supp. 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The order appealed from is therefore reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10'costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
