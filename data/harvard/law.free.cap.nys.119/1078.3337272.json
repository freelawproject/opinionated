One of these representations was that the deceased had never suffered from consumption, and another was that neither of his parents had died of that disease. Upon cross-examination various questions asked of the plaintiff which were material upon the question of the falsity of these representations were excluded upon the ground that the plaintiff was not qualified to answer. The questions required no expert knowledge, but related to conditions which any layman might observe, and their exclusion was erroneous and prejudicial to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-11\">For the errors indicated, the judgment must-be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-12\">LEHMAN, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1111-13\">GOFF, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJY\">(dissenting). The question put to plaintiff, sister of the deceased, as to whether or not the deceased had consumption, was not a question to be answered by a layman. I think it was properly excluded. Grattan v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 80 N. Y. 281, 36 Am. Rep. 617. So, also, the question, \u201cDo you know what your mother died of?\u201d the warranty being that the mother of deceased did not die of consumption. These were the only questions excluded on the ground that plaintiff was not qualified to answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-14\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
