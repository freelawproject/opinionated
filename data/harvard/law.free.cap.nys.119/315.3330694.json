This action was-brought to recover for the injuries which plaintiff claims to have, then, sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-19\">The fact that plaintiff was a passenger, and that the collision occurred, in the manner stated, was testified to both by him and another passenger on the car. The defendant introduced no testimony, but nevertheless judgment was rendered for the defendant. This, \u25a0 we think, was error. The doctrine of res ipsa loquitur \u201cdoes not permit a recovery without some proof of negligence, but it regulates the degree of proof required under certain circumstances. If proof of the occurrence shows that the accident was such as could not have happened without negligence according to the ordinary experience of mankind, the doctrine is applied, even if the precise omission or act of, negligence is not specified.\u201d Robinson v. Consolidated Gas Co., 194</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>N. Y. 37, 86 N. E. 805. When the front of a car operated by the company upon which plaintiff was a passenger ran into a car owned and \u25a0operated by another company, a presumption of negligence on the part \u25a0 of the carrying company arises, which calls upon it for an explanation. Loudoun v. Eighth Ave. R. R. Co., 162 N. Y. 380, 56 N. E. 988. Quite a different question might be presented if a car owned by another company had struck the rear of this car. Elliott v. Brooklyn Heights R. R. Co., 127 App. Div. 300, 111 N. Y. Supp. 358. While the burden of proof always remains upon the plaintiff to establish negligence, if there is no evidence to rebut the presumption which has arisen, the plaintiff has successfully borne his burden, and if there is proof of freedom from contributory negligence he is entitled to recover. Loudoun v. Eighth Ave. R. R. Co., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">There was no suggestion of contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff in this action, and therefore he'was entitled to judgment at least for nominal damages. The plaintiff testified as to his injuries, and was corroborated to some extent by the physician who attended him, and by his daughter and two other witnesses. The defendant apparently thought that his injury was of sufficient importance to make inquiries with regard to it; for, shortly after the accident, they sent an investigator, and also a physician in the employ of the company, to \u25a0examine as to the extent thereof. It is quite likely that the plaintiff may have exaggerated the extent of his injuries, and that possibly may have operated upon the mind of the learned trial judge to his prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">On the evidence, however, he was entitled to recover something by way of damages, and the judgment in favor of the defendant should be reversed, and a new trial ordered; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
