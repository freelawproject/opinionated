Smith, 186 N. Y. 465, 79 N. E. 714. The notice at bar did not comply with this requirement. An equitable action depends upon a valid lien. That not existing, this judgment cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-5\">Nor can a personal judgment be directed upon this record. Plaintiff and defendant entered into an agreement in writing, under which the plaintiff was to repair the damages caused by fire to the defendant\u2019s property for the agreed price of $2,600. It was admitted that the contract was not completed. Instead of proving the value of the work and materials actually furnished, the plaintiff undertook to prove his case by testimony of the value of the work not done, which he claimed to amount to $350, and subtracting that from the contract price of $2,600. The court found the value of the work not done to be $625, and, subtracting that and the conceded payment of $1,000 from the contract price, found the sum of $975 was due. There is a good deal of conflicting evidence as to what the plaintiff did do, and as to its condition when he ceased work. We are satisfied that a personal judgment could not be sustained upon this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-6\">It follows, therefore, that the-'judgment appealed from should be reversed, and a. new trial ordered, to proceed as an action in personam, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
