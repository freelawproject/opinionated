The complaint alleges that the accident was caused by defendant\u2019s negligence, and by reason of defects in the condition of the ways, works, machinery. or plant used by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">The order appealed from requires plaintiff to furnish particulars as follows: First, wherein the place where plaintiff\u2019s intestate was working was insecure, defective, and unsafe, as alleged in paragraph \u201cfifth\u201d of the complaint; second, wherein the tools, implements, and machinery supplied plaintiff\u2019s intestate were unsafe, improper, and defective, as alleged in paragraph \u201cfifth\u201d of the complaint; third, exactly where was plaintiff\u2019s intestate at the time he was adjusting the box referred to in paragraph \u201cfifth\u201d of the complaint; fourth, a specification of what caused the box or receptacle to turn over, as alleged in paragraph \u201cfifth\u201d of the complaint; fifth, a specification of each and every defect plaintiff claims existed'in the ways, works, and machinery connected with or used by said defendant at said place, as alleged in paragraph \u201csixth\u201d of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-11\">The defendant appeals against the qualifying clauses, reading as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-12\">\u201cFurther ordered, that the bill of particulars as ordered above shall only be furnished by the plaintiff in so far as the same is within the knowledge or information of the plaintiff; and it is further ordered, that if the plaintiff is unable to give the details required by this order, she should state on oath that she is unable of her own personal knowledge to furnish the same.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-13\">The first four items call upon plaintiff to state, as of her own knowledge, certain matters concerning which it would be unreasonable to believe that she can have personal knowledge. It does not appear, and is not probable, that she was on the spot when the accident happened, and whatever knowledge she has of the conditions as they then existed must of necessity be obtained from others. The fifth item of particulars required calls upon plaintiff to specify the defects, etc., which she claims existed. As to this, of course, the qualifying provisions of the order cannot apply; for it would be a mere evasion for plaintiff to swear that she cannot give a detailed statement of what she claims. If plaintiff is evasive in her replies, it will be open to defendant to move further.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-14\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements to respondent. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
