The action was commenced February 28, 1907\u20143 years, 7 months, and 20 days after the cause of action accrued. An action to recover damages for personal injuries resulting from negligence must be brought within 3 years after the cause of action accrues (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 383, subd. 5); but if the person entitled to maintain such an action is, at the time when the cause of action accrues, within the age of 21 years, then the time of such disability is not a part of the time limited for commencing the action, except that the time so limited cannot be extended more than 5 years by any such disability, except infancy, or in any case more than 1 year after the disability ceases. Section 396, Code Civ. Proc. The plaintiff, having reached the age of 21 years before the 3-year limitation had expired, was required to commence her action either before the expiration of that period or else within 1 year after she attained her majority. Hyland v. N. Y. Cen. &amp; H. R. R. Co., 24 App. Div. 417, 48 N. Y. Supp. 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-15\">On August 31, 1905, the day the plaintiff became 21 years of age, the 3-year statute of limitations had nearly 10 months to run against her claim\u2014until July 8, 1906. The 1-year extension allowed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>statute from the date of termination of her disability would have extended the time within which she might commence an action until August 31, 1906. The action, as stated, was not commenced until February 28,1907, over 7 months after the expiration of the 3-year period, and 6 months after the expiration of the 1-year extension. The period of limitation must be computed from the time of. the accruing of the right to relief by action. Section 415, Code Civ. Proc. The language of the statute is plain. - It is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-5\">\u201cThe time so limited cannot be extended * * * in any case more than one year after the disability ceases.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">I do not see how there can be any serious question as to what the Legislature intended, Its purpose was to give a minor who had a cause of action a reasonable time after he became of age to commence an. action to enforce it. It did not intend to add a year to the regular period of limitation, where the running of the period of limitation and the running of the year allowed by statute are concurrent. Here, when the plaintiff commenced her action, the 3-year limitation had expired, as had also the year allowed as an extension after she became of age. The statute of limitations pleaded, therefore, was a complete defense; and, the facts having been stated in the opening of plaintiff\u2019s counsel, the complaint was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">The judgment and order appealed from, therefore, are affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
