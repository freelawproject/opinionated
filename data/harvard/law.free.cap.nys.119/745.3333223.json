The undisputed evidence shows that $40,000 was the lowest price the plaintiff was authorized to sell the property for, and that $38,000 was the -best offer he obtained. The property was subsequently sold by a third party for the sum of $39,000. It follows that the plaintiff did not produce a party who was willing, ready, and able to-purchase the property at the owner's terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>The evidence adduced by the plaintiff was \"insufficient to take this case out of the general rule of law applicable to cases of this kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">The judgment is reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
