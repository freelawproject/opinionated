KELLOGG, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ApW-\">At the Fulton county Trial Term this \u25a0case was upon the calendar, and the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment upon his counterclaim was denied, with $10 costs. The plaintiff moved the case for trial, and thereupon the defendant moved to put it over the term, which motion was granted, with $10 costs to the plaintiff. One order covered both matters, and concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-20\">\u201cIt is further ordered that the said costs herein be paid to the plaintiff or -his attorney within 20 days after the entry and service of this order, as a condition for granting the -relief herein allowed, and in case said costs are not paid within the said 20 days, plaintiff may enter an order striking out th\u00e9 defendant\u2019s answer herein.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-21\">This order was served by mail February 4, 1909. On the 26th of February defendant\u2019s attorney mailed the plaintiff\u2019s attorney his check, in which it was stated, \u201cMotion costs of Van v. Madden, sending case over Trial Term,\u201d and in the letter inclosing the check he says he incloses the $10 allowed as a condition for-sending the case over the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>term, inclosing in said letter a notice of appeal from that part of the order denying his motion for judgment on the counterclaim. March 1st plaintiff\u2019s attorney replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-5\">\u201cI received, your letter Saturday night containing check for $10; said check providing that it be in settlement for motion costs in the above matter, sending the case over the Trial Term. It bears date February 27th, and not numbered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">He indorsed, used, and collected the check, and in the same envelope inclosed a Special Term order, made without notice, striking out the defendant\u2019s answer. From an order refusing to vacate that order, this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">The original order having been served by mail, the plaintiff had 40 days\u2019 time in which to pay the costs imposed upon him as a condition for putting the case over the term. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 798. The order striking out the answer was therefore prematurely granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">The correspondence and the check show that both the plaintiff\u2019s and defendant\u2019s attorneys interpreted the order as requiring a payment of $10 on account of the case going over the Trial Term, and that is not an unreasonable interpretation of the order. The $10 costs of the motion for j\u00fadgment upon the counterclaim were ordinary motion costs, the collection of which are adequately provided for by law. The term fee for putting the case over the term was a payment then due, and which was required to make the order effectual. A credit of 30 days was given for the payment, and to protect the rights of the defendant in case of nonpayment, and substantially to restore him1 in the position in which he was at the time the case was ordered over the term. Defendant\u2019s answer was to be dismissed in case he failed to pay such term fee. The provision of .the order is highly penal, and should be strictly construed, and, in view of the construction evidently placed upon it by the parties, there is no difficulty in saying that the condition in the order applies only to the payment of the term fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">The order appealed from should therefore be reversed, with $10 costs and printing disbursements, and the motion to vacate the order striking out the defendant\u2019s answer should be granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
