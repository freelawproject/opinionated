The practice of the latter in appealing from the judgment entered without service was proper, as no service of process was made on defendant (Swift &amp; Co. v. Mutual Commission Co. [Sup.] 107 N. Y. Supp. 40; Iron Clad Mfg. Co. v. B. E. Smith &amp; Sons, 28 Misc. Rep. 172, 59 N. Y. Supp. 332; Burkhard v. Smith, 19 Misc. Rep. 31, 42 N. Y. Supp. 638); and the appeal was timely taken, inasmuch as no written notice of the entry of the judgment was served on defendant (Code, \u00a7 3046). \"</p>\n<p id=\"b200-18\">The judgment must be reversed, with costs, and the complaint dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
