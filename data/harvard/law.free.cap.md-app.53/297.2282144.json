On May 5, 1981, appellant was arrested in connection with another incident, and, as a consequence of that arrest, was routinely photographed. A month later that photograph was shown, as part of an array, to the two employee-victims of the April robbery. One of the employees \u2014 Mr. Foster \u2014 identified appellant from that array, whereupon appellant was arrested and charged with the armed robbery and various associated offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-12\">Appellant was tried before a jury in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County and convicted of two counts (each) of robbery with a deadly weapon, theft, and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence. From those convictions and the twenty-five year prison sentence imposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>thereon, he brings this appeal raising seven issues. We shall address two of them:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-5\">(1) \"Did the trial court err in allowing the prosecutor to question Appellant regarding the details of a prior conviction\u201d; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-6\">(2) \"Did the trial court err in summarily rejecting Appellant\u2019s contention that any identification of him by Foster should be suppressed as the fruit of an unlawful arrest?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">The first of these we think must be answered in the affirmative. The court erred in permitting, over forceful objection, an extensive and unwarranted cross-examination regarding the circumstances of another crime of which appellant had been convicted. The error was of sufficient magnitude and prejudice as to require that we reverse the judgments and remand for a new trial. All but one of appellant\u2019s other complaints involve events occurring at his trial and are resolved by our reversal. The exception is the second issue noted above; that likely will surface again at retrial, as it involves the admissibility of evidence that the State apparently thinks is important.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">(1) Cross-Examination Regarding Prior Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">Appellant testified in his own behalf. His defense was that of alibi; he claimed that on the day of the robbery he was at his father\u2019s home from ten in the morning to five in the evening.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">Cross-examination was extensive. It ended with this colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-11\">\"Q [By prosecuting attorney] And you were in fact convicted on December 9, 1977 in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County in Criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>Trials 18207 of daytime housebreaking, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-5\">A [By appellant] Say that again, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-6\">Q You were convicted on December 9,1977, Circuit Court, Prince George\u2019s County, Criminal Trials 18207 for daytime housebreaking, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-7\">A Yes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">On redirect, defense counsel pursued the matter thusly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-9\">\"Q Mr. Robinson, when you were convicted in November, 1977, did you plead guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-10\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-11\">Q Were you guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-12\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-13\">Q Were you offered a chance to plead guilty to a less[e]r count <em>in this case?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-14\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-15\">Q Did you refuse to take that plea?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-16\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-17\">MRS.

CLAGETT: I have no other questions, Your Honor.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">The law is clear on this point. Md. Code Ann., Courts Article, \u00a7 10-905 (a) provides that \"[ejvidence is admissible to prove the interest of a witness in any proceeding, or <em>the fact of his conviction </em>of an infamous crime.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) In <em>Huber v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 245, 257 (1967), we held that \"the proper interpretation of [that provision] would permit only the fact of conviction for a specific crime to be permitted [sic, admitted] into evidence, and not the details of <em>the commission of the crime.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.) We noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-7\">\"When the details of the commission of a prior crime by a witness are introduced into evidence, there is a danger that the jury may be misled into a conviction by evidence of an offense for which the defendant is not indicted... and hence the introduction of such evidence should be subject to rigid scrutiny by the court. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-8\"><em>Id. See also Kable v. State, </em>17 Md. App. 16, 31, <em>cert. den. </em>268 Md. 750 (1973). More recently, the Court of Appeals observed in <em>Ricketts v. State, </em>291 Md. 701, 703 (1981), \"[t]he evidentiary tool the State customarily uses to attack the defendant\u2019s credibility is evidence of his prior convictions. <em>The only details ordinarily allowed to be presented to the jury are the nature of the charge and the fact of conviction.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">The questions allowed here obviously extended far beyond the nature of the charge and the fact of conviction. They included not only the \"details of the commission of the crime,\u201d but the attempt at flight and an extra-judicial confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">The trial judge allowed this line of inquiry on the ground <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>that defense counsel had \"opened the door\u201d by asking whether appellant had pled guilty \"because [he] got a deal.\u201d It would seem from this that, although not very well articulated, the court, in effect, was applying the doctrine of \"curative admissibility,\u201d a doctrine which, under some circumstances, permits a party to offer otherwise inadmissible evidence in response to like evidence offered by his adversary. <em>See, </em>in general, 1 Wigmore, <em>Evidence, </em>\u00a7 15 (3d ed. 1940); <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>2d, \u00a7 57; 29 Am. Jur. 2d, <em>Evidence, </em>\u00a7 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">We are aware of but two instances in which this doctrine has been considered in the context now before us, both times by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. <em>See Jenkins v. United States, </em>374 A.2d 581 (D. C.), <em>cert. den. </em>434 U.S. 894 (1977); and <em>Middleton v. United States, </em>401 A.2d 109 (D.C. 1979). As expounded in <em>Middleton, </em>the theory proceeds thusly: (1) it is permissible for the State to attack a testifying defendant\u2019s credibility by showing prior convictions; (2) it is also permissible for a defendant \"to give a limited explanation of extrinsic convictions when the subject is first broached by the government\u201d (401 A.2d at 125); (3) it is <em>not </em>permissible, however, for a defendant to contrast a guilty plea in a prior case with his defense of the instant case, for that bears not on his credibility but rather tends \"to create an inference of innocence with respect to the charges in the present case\u201d <em>(id., </em>125); and (4) if the defendant nevertheless injects that into the case, he has \"opened the door\u201d to the State also using otherwise inadmissible evidence regarding the prior offenses in order to respond to the impermissible inference that he is innocent in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">The doctrine of curative admissibility, in this context, has not previously been accepted in Maryland; and we have some difficulty with it, especially in this case. We note, first, that the court was plainly wrong in its interpretation of appellant\u2019s testimony on redirect examination. Appellant did <em>not, </em>as the court seemed to believe, indicate that he had pled guilty in the earlier case \"because [he] got a deal.\u201d His testimony on redirect neither mentioned nor suggested any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>kind of \"deal\u201d with regard to the earlier case. Appellant said that he pled guilty and that he <em>was </em>guilty; and that was all that he said on that subject. The question on redirect regarding a \"deal\u201d pertained to the <em>instant </em>charge, not the 1977 conviction; <em>and the court sustained the State\u2019s objection to it, thus removing the matter from the jury\u2019s consideration. </em>In that circumstance, the doctrine of curative admissibility has no application. No door was opened; there was simply nothing to respond to.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Even when applicable, the doctrine must be used with great caution. The <em>Middleton </em>Court itself recognized \"that the doctrine of curative admissibility is 'dangerously prone to overuse\u2019 \u201d and that it should be applied \" 'only to the extent necessary to remove any unfair prejudice which might otherwise have ensued from the original evidence.\u2019 \u201d 401 A.2d at 127. McCormick expresses a similar view <em>(see </em>McCormick, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 57), as does Wigmore in what he calls the \"Massachusetts rule\u201d: \"The opponent may reply with similar [inadmissible] evidence <em>whenever it is needed for removing an unfair prejudice which might otherwise have ensued from the original evidence, </em>but in no other case.\u201d (Emphasis in original; <em>see </em>Wigmore, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 15.)</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">We fail to see any such unfair prejudice in this case sufficient to justify the State\u2019s far-ranging inquiry. In the first place, aside from the obvious (and no doubt intended) prejudicial side effect to appellant, all that the State\u2019s recross examination did was to confirm what appellant had already conceded \u2014 that he was, in fact, guilty in the earlier case, and that he had pled guilty. It added nothing of substance to the instant case and did nothing to impeach the truthfulness of appellant\u2019s concession. Second, the massive response permitted here served only to inject into the case a colossal irrelevancy. Appellant was required to respond to details of another case which had nothing whatever to do with any issue properly before the jury. It was, at best, a grossly improper distraction. In all, this was hardly the \"rigid scrutiny\u201d of which we spoke in <em>Huber, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>(2) Photographic Identification</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Appellant moved, pretrial, to suppress all extra-judicial and in-court identification evidence \"[r]esulting from an illegal arrest or search and seizure.\u201d The motion did not aver that there had in fact been an illegal arrest, search, or seizure or that there was in fact any identification evidence obtained from such an arrest, search, or seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">At the hearing held on the suppression motion, it developed that the photograph of appellant included in the array shown to Messrs. Foster and Beuchert on June 5,1981, had been taken on May 5, 1981, following appellant\u2019s arrest in connection with the other incident. Detective Price, who had assembled the array and shown it to Foster, stated that he was not present when that arrest occurred. This colloquy then took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-7\">\"Q [By Defense Attorney] You did not personally know the circumstances of that arrest, detective?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-8\">MRS. CLAGETT: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-9\">THE COURT: Mr. Neal, ask him another question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-10\">MR. NEAL: My proffer is there was an illegal arrest \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-11\">THE COURT: He has already testified under oath there was no arrest made in this U-Haul case as of the time that he showed Mr. Foster the pictures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-12\">Now, what he was arrested for somewhere else doesn\u2019t make the least bit of difference to me in ruling on this motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-13\">MR. NEAL: My proffer would be if he were illegally arrested, then the photograph would be fruits of the poisonous tree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-14\">THE COURT: Mr. Neal, just ask him another question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-15\">MR. NEAL: I have no other questions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>Appellant offered no evidence regarding the photograph or (with respect to that aspect of his motion) regarding the May arrest<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the motion was thereupon denied. At trial, the six photographs in the array were admitted into evidence along with testimony regarding Foster\u2019s selection of appellant\u2019s photograph. In addition, Officer Coccaro, who had arrested appellant on May 5, testified in detail as to the circumstances of that arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Citing <em>United States v. Crews, </em>445 U.S. 463 (1980), <em>Washington </em>v. <em>State, </em>293 Md. 465 (1982), and <em>Baker v. State, </em>39 Md. App. 133 (1978), appellant argues that he was entitled, at the suppression hearing, to inquire into the validity of his May 5 arrest, on the ground that, if that arrest was unlawful, the photograph taken of him would be subject to suppression as tainted fruit from a poisonous tree.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\"><em>Crews, </em>by the time it reached the Supreme Court, involved the question of whether the \"fruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine enunciated in <em>Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, </em>251 U.S. 385 (1920), and <em>Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 471 (1963) applied to an <em>in-court </em>identification. The facts, briefly, were as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Between January 3 and January 6, 1974, three women reported being robbed while in the restroom at the Washington Monument. Each of them described her assailant to the police. On January 9, the police noticed Crews, who fit the description given by the victims, meandering around the restroom area of the Monument. Upon request, he identified himself, said that he was sixteen, and admitted that he had \"walked away from school.\u201d Their suspicion aroused, the police detained Crews for about ten minutes and attempted to take a Polaroid photograph of him; but because of inclement weather they were unable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>produce a picture suitable for display to the robbery victims. He was then taken into custody as a suspected truant and removed to the police station where he was photographed, questioned, and, after about an hour, released.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Crews was never formally arrested or charged with any offense arising from that encounter. It was clear that the whole purpose of his detention was to obtain a usable photograph that could then be shown to the three robbery victims. The photograph was indeed used for that purpose. It was presented, as part of an array, to the three women, each of whom identified Crews as the robber. The three victims subsequently identified Crews in a line-up and at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Finding that the police had no probable cause to detain Crews on January 9, the trial court suppressed the photograph taken of him that day (and the subsequent line-up identification). It found an \"independent source\u201d for the in-court identifications, however, and thus ruled them to be admissible. <em>That </em>was the issue presented to the D. C. Court of Appeals <em>(Crews </em>v. <em>United States, </em>389 A.2d 277 (1978)) and ultimately to the Supreme Court. At the appellate level, the Government conceded the inadmissibility of the photograph, and the correctness of its suppression was therefore not an issue in those proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">The Supreme Court held that the unlawful arrest did not taint the in-court identification. The identities of the defendant and the three witnesses were known prior to any misconduct, said the Court; moreover, the record indicated that the judicial identifications rested not on the photographs but on the victims\u2019 independent recollections of what had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">We may suppose from what was <em>said </em>in <em>Crews, </em>if not from what was actually decided, that, in the circumstances evident there, the Government\u2019s concession regarding the photograph taken at the police station was a sage one. <em>Cf. Washington v. State, supra, </em>293 Md. 465, 472. Clearly, that photograph was the unattenuated offspring of an illicit intercourse between Crews and the police. It was inadmissible not because of what was determined in <em>Crews </em>itself, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>because it fell squarely within the traditional concept of fruit that not only came from a poisonous tree but was itself a bit sour.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">There is a major difference here. Whether appellant\u2019s warrantless arrest on May 5 was legal or illegal, it had absolutely nothing whatever to do with this case. Unlike the situation in <em>Crews, </em>there was not even a suggestion here, much less a proffer of evidence, that appellant was arrested (or photographed) as a pretext for gathering evidence in this case. <em>Compare also Davis v. Mississippi, </em>394 U.S. 721 (1969). Indeed, an entire month elapsed before the photograph was even shown to Foster and Beuchert.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">The Supreme Court made clear in <em>Wong Sun, supra, </em>371 U.S. at 487-88, that not all evidence \"is 'fruit of the poisonous tree\u2019 simply because it would not have come to light but for the illegal actions of the police.\u201d Rather, it said, \"the more apt question in such a case is 'whether, granting establishment of the primary illegality, the evidence to which instant objection is made has been come at by exploitation of that illegality or instead by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint.\u2019 \u201d This concept has been otherwise expressed as one of \"attenuation\u201d \u2014 is the connection between the lawless police conduct (the tree) and the evidence obtained as a result of it (the fruit) so \"attenuated\u201d as to dissipate the taint that otherwise would flow from the tree to the fruit?</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">In <em>Baker v. State, supra, </em>39 Md.App. 133, we noted that the Supreme Court had adopted a balancing test in applying the \"fruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine. At p. 140:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-8\">\"The Court, in <em>Stone v. Powell, </em>428 U.S. 465... said that '[t]he primary justification for the exclusionary rule... is the deterrence of police conduct that violates Fourth Amendment rights.\u2019 . .. The deterrent effect of the exclusionary rule must be weighed against the harm which society suffers when the particular evidence, cannot be used in a judicial proceeding. Thus, '[t]he application of the rule has been restricted to those areas where its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>remedial objectives are thought most efficaciously served.\u2019 <em>United States v. Calandra, </em>414 U.S. 338, 348...''</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Most courts, when faced with a situation such as that presented here, have either expressly or tacitly applied this kind of balancing approach and have regarded the fruit as sufficiently untainted to be edible by the trier of fact. The clearest exposition of this was by Justice Mosk in <em>People v. McInnis, </em>494 P.2d 690 (Cal.), <em>cert. den. </em>409 U.S. 1061 (1972). There, as here, the defendant was initially identified by an armed robbery victim through a photograph routinely taken as the result of another arrest. There, as here, he claimed that that arrest was illegal and thus sought to suppress the photograph. Rejecting his claim, the Court held, at p. 693:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-7\">\"To hold that all such pictures resulting from illegal arrests are inadmissible forever because they are 'fruits of the poisonous tree\u2019 would not merely permit the criminal 'to go free because the constable has blundered\u2019 ... but would allow the criminal immunity because another constable in another jurisdiction in another case had blundered. It would in effect be giving a crime insurance policy in perpetuity to all persons once illegally arrested: if the photograph of a person obtained because of such an arrest becomes instrumental in the identification of that person for a crime committed many years later, it could be urged that <em>but for </em>the old illegal arrest the criminal would not have been identified. Rationally, however, a 'but for\u2019 relationship alone is insufficient to render the photograph inadmissible since it cannot be said that many years later the illegality of the earlier arrest was being 'exploited.\u2019 ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-8\">In the case at bar, while the time span between the illegal arrest and the robbery was not one of years but only a month, nevertheless the principle remains the same, and there is no evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>whatever of exploitation.\u201d (Emphasis in the original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-5\"><em>See also People v. Price, </em>394 N.E.2d 1256, 1264-65 (Ill.App. 1979); <em>United States v. Haynie, </em>637 F.2d 227, 238 (4th Cir. 1980), <em>cert. den. </em>451 U.S. 972, 988 (1981); <em>United States ex rel.

In the absence of evidence (or a reasonably firm and detailed proffer of evidence) tending to show that appellant\u2019s May 5 arrest was not only illegal but was merely a pretext for a general exploratory search (as in <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Mississippi, supra) </em>or for gathering evidence in this case (as in <em>United </em>States. v. <em>Crews, supra), </em>a routine \"booking\u201d photograph taken as a consequence of that arrest would not be suppressible as tainted fruit in this proceeding. Accordingly, the legality or illegality of the May 5 arrest, standing alone, was quite irrelevant to the suppression <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>issue, and the court therefore committed no error in foreclosing an inquiry into it.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">\n<em>Judgments reversed; case remanded for new trial; Prince George\u2019s County to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b329-12\">. Three other defense witnesses gave testimony corroborating that alibi.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b338-8\">. Appellant was arrested while a passenger in a stolen car, in which a shotgun and a handgun were discovered. His suppression motion also included the shotgun recovered from the car; and, with regard to that aspect of the motion, he testified that he was merely a passenger in the car and did not know it had been stolen. That testimony was directed solely at the issue of \"standing\u201d to complain about the seizure, and did not directly touch upon the validity of the arrest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b342-7\">. In <em>Teresinski, </em>the defendant was stopped in his automobile, purportedly on the ground that he was a juvenile and was in violation of a juvenile curfew law. The detention, if not the initial stop, was unlawful. The officer searched the car, found certain evidence traceable to an earlier robbery of a grocery store, and arrested the defendant <em>for that robbery. </em>He was \"booked\u201d and photographed. The photograph was then promptly shown to the robbery victim, who identified the defendant from it. The Court held, at p. 758: \"Since defendant was booked and photographed following that detention <em>as part of the investigation of the Seven-Eleven robbery, </em>the robbery victim\u2019s identification of defendant\u2019s booking photograph \u2014 a <em>photograph taken as a direct and immediate result of that </em>illegality\u2014 is also inadmissible.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
