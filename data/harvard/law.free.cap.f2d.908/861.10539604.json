Specifically, Goolsby contends that the district court erred in applying the criminal history multiple under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1(d). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-15\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b942-16\">The facts in this case are not in dispute. On February 6, 1989, appellant escaped from a federal half-way house; appellant remained in a fugitive status until he was arrested on March 21, 1989. Appellant pled guilty to the charge of escape, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 751(a), and was sentenced to a twenty-eight month term of imprisonment to be followed by two years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-17\">Appellant\u2019s sentence was calculated as follows: The court determined appellant\u2019s total offense level to be 11, (base level of 13 per U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2P1.1(a)(1), minus 2 for acceptance of responsibility per \u00a7 3E1.1(a)). Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1, the district court determined appellant\u2019s criminal history score to be 11; three points for each of three prior felony convictions plus 2 points for committing the instant offense while under a criminal justice sentence. Appellant objects to the two additional criminal history points scored pursuant to \u00a7 4A1.1(d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A criminal history score of 11 equates to criminal history Category V. Without the additional 2 points, appellant\u2019s criminal history score would have fallen in Category IV. Appellant argues on appeal that the Sentencing Commission did not intend \u00a7 4A1.1(d) to apply to the offense of escape as the conduct embraced by the 2 point criminal history multiple has been considered in the offense level under \u00a7 2P1.1(a)(1). Appellant asserts that the guidelines do not contemplate this kind of double counting.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-18\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b942-19\">This is an issue of first impression in this circuit. However, every other circuit court that has considered this question has re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>jected appellant\u2019s contention. Because we generally agree with the reasoning advanced by the other circuit courts, we hold that it is proper for a district court to apply the <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> point criminal history factor when sentencing an offender for the crime of escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-4\">Interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines is similar to statutory interpretation and is subject to de novo review on appeal. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>891 F.2d 212, 214 (9th Cir.1989). <em>Cf. United States v. Jones, </em>899 F.2d 1097, 1099-1100 (11th Cir.1990) (conducting de novo review of guideline application). The applicable guidelines and accompanying commentary list no exception for escapees. In fact, \u00a7 4A1.1(d) expressly includes escapees. In those instances where the Commission intended to except an otherwise applicable element from increasing a sentence, the Commission\u2019s intent is expressly stated. <em>See, e.g., </em>\u00a7 3A1.1, Vulnerable Victim, Application Note 2 (no victim related adjustment if offense guideline specifically incorporates factor); \u00a7 3B1.3, Abuse of Position of Trust of Use of Special Skill, Application Note 1 (adjustment not applicable to embezzlement by ordinary bank teller); \u00a7 3C1.1, Willfully Obstructing or Impeding Proceedings, Application Note 4 (generally not applicable to crimes of contempt, obstruction of justice, perjury, etc.). We are reluctant to fashion an exception since the Commission has demonstrated its ability to do so in those areas it has deemed an exception to be appropriate. In a publication entitled \u201cQuestions Most Frequently Asked About The Sentencing Guidelines,\u201d Question 22 (Vol. Ill, March 1, 1990), the Commission\u2019s Training Staff opined that an offender who escapes while under a criminal justice sentence receives three criminal history points under \u00a7\u00a7 4A1.1(d) and (e).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">This explains the operation of \u00a7 4A1.1(d) in the typical case; however, the above justification is not altogether satisfactory as from the escapee\u2019s perspective the factors used to increase his criminal history category are required elements for the crime of escape itself. It is important to recognize that \u00a7 4A1.1(d) does not operate to enhance an offender\u2019s offense level, instead, it is a factor in calculating the offender\u2019s criminal history category. This distinction is important as each calculation concerns a conceptually separate notion related to sentencing. The offender\u2019s total offense level reflects the seriousness of the offense of conviction adjusted for relevant conduct. <em>United States v. Scroggins, </em>880 F.2d 1204, 1209 (11th Cir.1989). <em>See </em>U.S. S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 1B1.1(a)-(e). An offender\u2019s criminal history score \u201cevaluates the need to increase his sentence incrementally to deter him from further criminal activity.\u201d <em>Scroggins, </em>880 F.2d at 1210. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 (permitting upward or downward departure if offender\u2019s criminal history category under-represents or over-represents likelihood offender will commit future crimes); <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>883 F.2d 1007, 1008-09 (11th Cir.1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 110 S.Ct. 747, 107 L.Ed.2d 764, (1990) (discussing relationship in context of departure under \u00a7 4A1.3). In fashioning the \u00a7 4A1.1(d) factor, the Sentencing Commission determined that offenders who committed crimes while under a criminal justice sentence are more likely to commit future crimes. The purpose of this factor is to \u201cimplement[ ] one measure of recency.\u201d \u00a7 4A1.1, Background.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-10\">Another appellant in a similar case put the argument succinctly, \u201cescape is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>made worse by being committed while in custody. It is made possible by being ... in custody.\u201d <em>Goldbaum, </em>879 F.2d at 813. However, what Goldbaum and appellant here fail to recognize is that \u00a7 2P1.1 is applicable to both the crime of escape and assisting escape. The combined effect of the offense guideline and the criminal history factors is to sentence an escapee to a greater term of imprisonment than an outside person who assists the prisoner to escape. It would not be impermissible for the Commission to establish one offense level for the crimes of escape, or instigating or assisting escape and then enhance the offense level in the case where the crime is committed by one who is incarcerated. The challenged system achieves the same result. Considering the application notes, the background commentary and all the other available information, it is reasonable to conclude that the Commission set the offense level at a lower number recognizing that the criminal history score would increase the sentence for those who committed their offense while under a criminal justice sentence. Thus, contrary to Goldb-aum\u2019s conclusion, the crime of escape is in fact made worse by being committed in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">Additionally, we note that \u00a7 4A1.1 does not apply to every escape. Section 2P1.1 applies to escapes from pretrial custody as well as from a criminal justice sentence. However, \u00a7 4A1.1(d) applies only if the escape is from a criminal justice sentence. It is not unreasonable to conclude the Sentencing Commission determined that if an offender escapes from confinement imposed by sentence, that offender should be punished more severely than if he had escaped from some form of pretrial confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">We conclude, therefore, that the district court correctly applied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1(d) to appellant\u2019s escape conviction. Sections 2P1.1 and 4A1.1(d) combine to effect rational sentences under a variety of factual circumstances. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b942-13\">. This section provides: \"Add 2 points if the defendant committed the instant offense while under any criminal justice sentence, including probation, parole, supervised release, imprisonment, work release, or escape status.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b943-5\">. <em>See United States v. Jimenez, 897 </em>F.2d 286 (7th Cir.1990); <em>United States v. Bigelow, </em>897 F.2d 160 (5th Cir.1990); <em>United States v. Carroll, </em>893 F.2d 1502 (6th Cir.1990); <em>United States v.

The cases cited, <em>supra </em>note 2, involved whether the factors under both subsections (d) and (e) are applicable to an escapee. When sentencing Goolsby, the district court upheld defendant\u2019s objection to application of \u00a7 4A 1.1(e) and declined to include the one point factor. The additional point is of no consequence to appellant\u2019s sentence as a criminal history score of 12 also falls in Category V. Since the government did not appeal, however, we need not consider the applicability of subsection (e).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
