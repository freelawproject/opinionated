Tweddle, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b803-7\"><em>Frank J. Powers, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b803-8\">On the evening of September 2, 1915, at about 7:30 p. m., plaintiff, a man 58 years of age, was riding a bicycle in an easterly direction on Front street near Division street, in the city of Traverse City. Front street runs east and west, and Division street north and south. Plaintiff had just passed the easterly line of Division street, being south of the center line of Front street when he collided with the automobile of the defendant. Defendant himself was driving the machine, and had been going north on Division street, but when he reached Front street he turned to the right to go east on Front street. The collision occurred about 20 feet east of the east line-of Division street and south of the center of Front street.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b803-9\">It was the claim of the plaintiff that when he approached Division street, coming from the west, he saw defendant\u2019s automobile coming north about a quarter of a block away; that he proceeded across Division street at a slow and careful rate of speed, and when about 20 feet east of the east line of said street defendant\u2019s automobile overtook him, striking the hind wheel. It is undisputed that the automobile struck the bicycle, and that after the automobile stopped, within a few feet, both plaintiff and his bicycle were under the automobile. As a result of the accident plaintiff sustained a scalp wound, an injury to one of his. hands, and two broken ribs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b804-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>It was the claim of the defendant, supported by the testimony of others, that driving north on Division street as he approached the corner of Front he had his car fully under control, and turned east on Front street at a very slow rate of speed; that j\u00fast as he was turning into Front street plaintiff came from the north side of Front street in a southeasterly direction, directly in front of his automobile, too close to permit him to stop his machine in time to avoid a collision.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b804-5\">Under a careful charge the trial judge submitted the conflicting theories of the parties to the jury. At the end of the charge he said:</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b804-6\">\u201cHave I covered every point, gentlemen?</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b804-7\"><em>\u201cMr. Tweddle </em>(counsel for defendant) : Yes, sir; I think so.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b804-9\"><em>\u201cMr. Powers </em>(counsel for plaintiff) : Yes, sir; but this bicycle, your honor, will it go with the jury to their jury room or not?\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b804-10\">The jury returned a verdict against the defendant in the sum of $912.83, upon which judgment was duly entered. A motion for a new trial was made based upon 15 several grounds, which motion was denied.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b802-13\"> On liability of owner of automobile for collision with bicyclist, see note in 28 L.

No request was made to the trial court to file reasons for denying the motion, and no reasons were filed by the trial court. No exception was taken to the denial of the motion. \u2022 We must hold that this question is not before us on this appeal. <em>Groat </em>v. <em>Railway, </em>153 Mich. 165 (116 N. W. 1081); <em>Blakeslee &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Manufacturing Co., </em>153 Mich. 230 (117 N. W. 92); Act No. 314, chap. 18, \u00a7 63, Pub. Acts 1915 (3 Comp. Laws 1915, \u00a7 12635).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-12\">Defendant next argues his 2d, 5th, and 6th assignments, based upon the alleged erroneous admission of the testimony of the physician who attended plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>tiff; the objection being that the declaration was insufficient to support proof under the rule that special damages must be specially alleged. The declaration recites:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-5\">\u201cBy means of the premises the said plaintiff was forced and obliged and did lay out and spend a large amount of money, to wit, $200, in and about endeavoring to be cured of said sickness,' lameness, nervousness, and disorders occasioned as aforesaid, and this plaintiff will be forced to lay out large sums of money endeavoring to be cured of said sickness, lameness and disorders, occasioned as aforesaid, all of which disabilities are permanent in character.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">We are of opinion that this averment in the declaration was sufficient to support proofs as to the number of visits paid by the doctor and the amount of his charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">The 8th assignment is based upon the admission of the following testimony over objection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-8\">\u201cNow because of your injured condition, how much of the time can you work?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-9\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Probably four days a week, four days out of six.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">The objection urged is that the testimony is speculative, uncertain, remote, and a mere guess on the part of the witness. We think the objection untenable, particularly in view of the fact that plaintiff was examined carefully both upon direct and cross-examination as to his ability to labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-11\">Error is assigned upon the following, John Nerlinger, a witness for the defendant, being upon the stand:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-12\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Now, whether or not Mr. Shermer appeared to have his car under control ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-13\"><em>\u201cMr. Powers: </em>We object to that as a conclusion; let him tell what he did, and the jury will determine the other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-14\"><em>\u201cThe Court: </em>Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-15\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Well, did he have his car under control?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number><em>\u201cMr. Powers: </em>Of course, we make the same objection to the same question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-3\"><em>\u201cThe Court: </em>Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-4\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>How far did the car run after the bicycle and the car came together?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-5\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Well, I should say not over six feet, but I could not be positive as to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-6\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>What did Mr. Shermer do, if you know, to stop the car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-7\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Well, he put his foot on the brake and the clutch at the same tim\u00e9, and stopped the car almost instantly.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">While we are of opinion that the court might very well have permitted the answer to the question, and that the answer would not necessarily have involved a conclusion by the witness, in view of the later examination of the witness, the exclusion of this answer is certainly not reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-9\">The 12th assignment of error is based upon the action of the court .in striking out the answer of the defendant\u2019s wife to the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-10\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Now, Mrs. Shermer, you wouldn\u2019t know whether or not he was looking back; now is that the truth of it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-11\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Well, I know he was not because he never does look back when he drives.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b806-12\">When this question and answer is read with the context, it plainly appears that the ruling of the court was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-13\">The 13th, 14th, 15th and 16th assignments of error are based upon the refusal of the court to direct a verdict upon the ground that under the testimony plaintiff was clearly guilty of contributory negligence, as a matter of law. Replying to the arguments made in support of these assignments, it is only necessary to say that we have read this entire record with care, and are satisfied that the question of plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence as well as the question of defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>ant\u2019s negligence raised issues of fact properly determinable by the jury alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">The 18th and. 19th assignments of error are based upon alleged errors in the charge of the court. They are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b807-7\">K\u00fchn, C. J., and Stone, Ostrander, Bird, Moore, Steere, and Fellows,.
