After the FTC rejected that contention AG sought injunctive relief in Texas against further proceedings by the FTC. <em>American General Insurance Co. v. FTC, </em>359 F.Supp. 887 (S.D.Texas 1973), aff'd 496 F.2d 197 (C.A.5, 1974). In the proceedings before the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, one Calvin J. Collier, then General Counsel of FTC, appeared as counsel and signed a brief arguing that section 7 of the Clayton Act was applicable notwithstanding the McCarran Act, and also arguing that in any event the insurance companies had not exhausted their administrative remedies as the Commission\u2019s action up to that point was merely interlocutory. The Court of Appeals upheld the latter contention and affirmed the dismissal of the companies\u2019 application for injunctive relief against the continuance of the Commission proceedings. The appellate tribunal did not decide the jurisdictional issue under the McCarran Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">When the Commission did issue its final order on June 28, 1977, reaffirming its jurisdiction notwithstanding the McCarran Act, its opinion was written by Mr. Collier, who was then a Member of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The insurance companies argue in this Court that Mr. Collier should have disqualified himself from participation in the Commission\u2019s decision because of his prior participation in the case as counsel. We agree, and remand the case for further proceedings before the Commission. We express no views at this time on the interesting questions under the McCarran Act and the Clayton Act which would be presented if we reached the merits of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">At the argument before this Court, a member of the panel called the attention of counsel for the FTC to numerous instances where Supreme Court Justices had abstained by reason of the fact that they had been Attorney General during the pendency of the case, and asked whether it was the FTC\u2019s position that a Commissioner of the FTC should be governed by a less stringent standard than a Judge. Counsel\u2019s answer in the negative substantially amounted to concession of the issue involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">In addition to customary practice, it may be noted that in the case of a judge there is a statutory provision requiring disqualification in any case in which he \u201chas participated as counsel.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-11\">The same rule has been applied to administrative proceedings in <em>TWA v. CAB, </em>102 U.S.App.D.C. 391, 392, 254 F.2d 90, 91 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-12\">The principle that a party should not be judge in his own case represents a venerable tradition in Anglo-American legal history. Blackstone declared that \u201cif an act of parliament gives a man power to try all causes, that arise within his manor of Dale; yet, if a cause should arise in which he himself is party, the act is construed not to extend to that, because it is unreasonable that any man should determine his own quarrel.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-13\">Lord Coke laid down the same doctrine in <em>Dr. Bonham\u2019s Case, </em>8 Rep. 114a (C.P. 1610), which Blackstone cited in the above-quoted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>passage.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Dr. Thomas Bonham, a doctor of medicine from the University of Cambridge, was found deficient in medical science by the Royal College of Physicians, was fined and forbidden under pain of imprisonment to continue practice until admitted by the College. He continued to practice, and was committed to prison pursuant to the order of the College. He then brought an action of trespass for false imprisonment, in which he prevailed, although the College\u2019s disciplinary powers had been granted by an ancient patent of Henry VIII twice confirmed by acts of Parliament-Coke declared that since the College was to receive for its own benefit half of the fines imposed, it occupied the status both of party to the litigation and judge, in contravention of an established maxim of the common law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">On this point Coke said: \u201cThe censors [of the College] cannot be judges and parties; judges to give sentence or judgment; . . . and parties to have the moiety of the forfeiture, <em>quia aliquis non debet esse Judex in propria causa; imo iniquum est aliquem suae rei esse judicem; </em>and one <em>cannot be judge and attorney for any of the parties.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">The same maxim was reaffirmed eloquently by Sir Henry Hobart in <em>Day v. Savadge, </em>Hob. 84 (K.B. 1614): \u201ceven an Act of Parliament made against Natural Equity, as to make a Man Judge in his own Cause, is void in itself, for <em>Jura naturae sunt immutabilia </em>and are <em>leges legum.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>So too Lord Holt in <em>City of London v. Wood, </em>12 Mod.* 669, 687 (1701), held invalid a fine for refusal to serve as sheriff recovered by the city in its own court of Mayor and Aldermen.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-15\">And the same doctrine was proclaimed by the Supreme Court of the United States with respect to judgments of the minor judiciary where the judge\u2019s compensation is derived from fines imposed and collected in proceedings adjudicated by him. <em>Tumey v. Ohio, </em>273 U.S. 510, 522-24, 47 S.Ct. 437, 71 L.Ed. 749 (1927) [Taft, C.J.].</p>\n<p id=\"b528-16\">That the judge\u2019s or quasi-judicial officer\u2019s participation in the case as counsel may have been superficial rather than substantial does not affect the applicability of the principle. In the <em>TWA </em>case, <em>supra, </em>the member of' the Civil Aeronautics Board there found to be disqualified had signed a brief in the same case which argued different questions than those involved in the proceeding upon which he sat after his appointment to the CAB. In the case at bar the disqualification rule would apply a <em>for-tiori, </em>since the crucial jurisdictional issue decided by the FTC in Commissioner Col<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>lier\u2019s opinion was identical with that argued by him as counsel before the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">As previously noted, it has been the uniform practice of Supreme Court Justices to decline participation in cases pending in the Department of Justice during their tenure as Attorney General. In many such cases it is probably true that the Attorney General personally took no substantial part whatever in actually working on the case. But his mere responsibility for administrative supervision of the Department, regardless of the extent of his knowledge and his approval of the acts of his subordinates, has been deemed sufficient to activate the disqualification rule.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Consequently, in the case at bar we conclude that the Commission\u2019s final order of June 28,1977, here under review, is infected with invalidity by reason of Commissioner Collier\u2019s participation, and the matter is hereby remanded to the Commission for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">Remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b526-14\">. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 18 provides, in pertinent part: No corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire, directly or indirectly, the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital and no corporation subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission shall acquire the whole or any part of the assets of another corporation engaged also in commerce, where in any line of commerce in any section of the country, the effect of such acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly. Since the decision of <em>U. S. v. South-Eastern Underwriters\u2019 Assn., </em>322 U.S. 533, 64 S.Ct. 1162, 88 L.Ed. 1440 (1944), overruling <em>Paul v. Virginia, </em>8 Wall. 168, 19 L.Ed. 357 (1868), insurance is considered to be \u201ccommerce.\u201d The McCarran Act, discussed subsequently, was promptly passed to preserve state regulation of \u201cthe business of insurance.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b526-25\">.

The FTC, relying on <em>SEC v. National Securities, </em>393 U.S. 453, 89 S.Ct. 564, 21 L.Ed.2d 668 (1969), contends that the words \u201cbusiness of insurance\u201d refer only to relations between a company and its policyholders, not to anticom-petitive relationships between companies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b527-14\">. 28 U.S.C. 455, as amended by the Act of December 5, 1974, 88 Stat. 1609, provides that \u201cAny . . judge . shall disqualify himself. . .

The court held that this case did not involve a general custom of London the existence of which by statute might be certified by the May- or and Aldermen, but concerned only the corporate interest of the City; and that \u201cit was against right and justice, and against natural equity to allow them their certificate, wherein they are to try and judge their own cause.\u201d Hobart at 86.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b528-19\">.
