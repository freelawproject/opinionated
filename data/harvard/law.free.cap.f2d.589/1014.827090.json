(Mercy). The supplemental order provided, in accordance with the Board\u2019s previous finding that Mercy had violated \u00a7 8(a)(3) &amp; (1) of the Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that discriminatee Douglas Castle was entitled to receive backpay from Mercy in the amount of $7,659.56 plus interest at 7% per annum.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We deny enforcement of the Board\u2019s supplemental order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-10\">I. <em>Statement of the Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"awg-dedup-0\">Douglas Castle was employed by Mercy from October of 1973 to June 19, 1974. While in Mercy\u2019s employ, Castle prepared and circulated a petition that listed pay grievances against Mercy and which ultimately was sent to the Employment Standards Administration of the Department of Labor. Castle\u2019s activities were discovered by Mercy\u2019s president and others. Castle was subsequently discharged. After his discharge, Castle filed charges against Mercy, claiming that Mercy had committed multiple violations of the Act in discharging him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-17\">The Board issued a decision, after a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), that Castle\u2019s discharge was discriminatory <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and ordered that Mercy immediately reinstate Castle and compensate him for the loss of earnings he suffered as a result of his discharge. The issue of the amount of backpay due Castle was reserved for a subsequent hearing. In anticipation of this backpay hearing, Mercy and the NLRB agreed that \u201c[i]n the event judicial proceedings are . . . necessary to enforce or to review the Board\u2019s backpay determination, the only issue before the court will be the validity of the backpay computation.\u201d A supplemental backpay proceeding was instituted and the presiding ALJ found \u201cthat Castle did not make a reasonable and diligent effort to find work during the period from the date of his discharge to November 15, 1974.\u201d He found that Castle was, therefore, not entitled to backpay for that period. Although expressing doubt as to Castle\u2019s diligence in mitigating his loss of income from November 15, 1974 to March 31, 1975,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the AU concluded that Mercy had failed to prove that Castle had not made \u201creasonable and diligent efforts to find employment\u201d and that Castle was thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>entitled to backpay for that period. Castle was awarded $3,537.17 with interest at 6% per annum.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\">On December 30, 1976, the backpay order issued by the ALJ was reviewed by the NLRB. The Board was in agreement with the ALJ\u2019s determination that Castle was entitled to backpay for the period November 16, 1974 to March 31, 1975. However, the Board found that the ALJ erred in rejecting Castle\u2019s claim for backpay from June 19, 1974 to November 15, 1974. Contrary to the ALJ\u2019s findings, the Board concluded that the evidence presented indicated \u201cCastle\u2019s persistent efforts to obtain employment from the date of his discharge through November 15.\u201d This persistence, the Board found, \u201cclearly manifest[ed] appropriate diligence to mitigate [Mercy\u2019s] financial loss\u201d and that Mercy had not sustained its burden of proving that Castle incurred a wilful loss of earnings. The Board ordered Mercy to pay Castle $7,659.56 net backpay with interest at 7% per annum. The Board now seeks enforcement of its supplemental decision and order.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1081-6\">II. <em>Mercy\u2019s Backpay Liability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1081-7\">Mercy urges that the supplemental order not be enforced, contending that the Board\u2019s determination that Castle exercised reasonable efforts to secure employment for the nine month period following his discharge and that he is entitled to backpay for that period is in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-8\">Section 10(c) of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(c), authorizes the NLRB to require that an employer guilty of unfair labor practices desist from such practices and \u201ctake such affirmative action, including reinstatement of employees with or without back pay, as will effectuate the policies of [the Act].\u201d The Supreme Court has stated that the Board\u2019s arsenal of reinstatement and backpay</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-14\">is remedial, not punitive, and is to be exercised in aid'of the Board\u2019s authority to restrain violations and as a means of removing or avoiding the consequences of violation where those consequences are of a kind to thwart the purposes of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"Ai8\"><em>Local 60 v. NLRB, </em>365 U.S. 651, 655, 81 S.Ct. 875, 877, 6 L.Ed.2d 1 (1961), <em>quoting Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 236, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938); <em>see NLRB v. Seven-Up Co., </em>344 U.S. 344, 346, 73 S.Ct. 287, 97 L.Ed. 377 (1953); <em>Phelps Dodge Corp. v. NLRB, </em>313 U.S. 177, 197-98, 61 S.Ct. 845, 85 L.Ed. 1271 (1941); Daylin, \u201cBack Pay Under the National Labor Relations Act,\u201d 39 Iowa L.Rev. 104, 104 (1958). A worker who has been the victim of an unfair labor practice is not entitled to simply await reimbursement from his or her employer for wages lost, for \u201cthe statute was not intended to encourage idleness.\u201d Daylin at 117; <em>see NLRB v. Seven-Up Co., </em>344 U.S. at 346, 73 S.Ct. 287; <em>Phelps Dodge Corp. v. NLRB, </em>313 U.S. at 200, 61 S.Ct. 845. To hold otherwise would undermine the \u201chealthy policy\u201d underlying the Act, \u201cpromoting production and employment.\u201d <em>Phelps Dodge Corp. v. NLRB, </em>313 U.S. at 200, 61 S.Ct. 845. Where the backpay award does not effectuate the policies of the Act, it should not be enforced. See <em>NLRB v. Dodson\u2019s Market, Inc., </em>553 F.2d 617, 620 (9th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-15\">Consistent with the policies of the Act, the rule is that once the general counsel of the Board has established the amount of backpay due the discharged employee, the burden is upon the employer to produce evidence to mitigate its liability. <em>Id. </em>at 619; <em>NLRB v. United Brotherhood of Carpenters &amp; Joiners, </em>531 F.2d 424, 426 (9th Cir. 1976). Mitigation will result not only where the worker has taken in earnings from another source after discharge, but also for \u201closses willfully incurred\u201d \u2014 such as when, the discriminatee fails to secure comparable employment without excuse. <em>Phelps Dodge </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1018\">*1018</page-number><em>Corp. v. NLRB, </em>313 U.S. at 197-98, 61 S.Ct. 845. A discharged worker is not held to the highest standard of diligence in his or her efforts to secure comparable employment; \u201creasonable\u201d exertions are sufficient. <em>See Heinrich Motors, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>403 F.2d 145, 149 (2nd Cir. 1968); <em>NLRB v. Arduini Manufacturing Corp., </em>394 F.2d 420, 423 (1st Cir. 1968); <em>NLRB v. Miami Coca-Cola Bottling Co., </em>360 F.2d 569, 575 (5th Cir. 1966); <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Brown &amp; Root, Inc., </em>311 F.2d 447, 452 (8th Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-4\">The issue we \u2022 must now decide is whether the evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding that discriminatee Castle in fact discharged the duty incumbent upon him to exercise \u201creasonable diligence\u201d in seeking comparable employment. The appropriate standard of review dictates that, to the extent the Board\u2019s decision rests on findings of fact for which there is \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d on the record as a whole, this court must defer to that decision. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e); <em>Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 488, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951); <em>NLRB v. Tomco Communications, Inc., </em>567 F.2d 871, 876 (9th Cir. 1978). On numerous occasions the courts have attempted to articulate the nebulous ingredients of the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard. The Supreme Court has stated that \u201csubstantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Consolidated Edison v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. at 229, 59 S.Ct. at 217; <em>see NLRB v. Columbian Enameling &amp; Stamping Co., </em>306 U.S. 292, 299-300, 59 S.Ct. 501, 83 L.Ed. 660 (1939) (imposing a directed verdict standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-13\">Upon review, the record reveals that Castle made attempts at securing employment an average of only three times a month during each of the nine months that he was in the job market after his discharge.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We do not believe that it is reasonable to con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number>elude that so few attempts constitute \u201creasonable diligence.\u201d <em>See NLRB v. Arduini Manufacturing Corp., </em>394 F.2d at 424 (dis-criminatee not reasonably diligent where he did not apply to company that he knew was hiring in his field of work, visited only four companies in search of employment and merely registered with the Employment Security Office); <em>NLRB v. Armstrong Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>263 F.2d 680, 683 (5th Cir. 1959) (discriminatee not reasonably diligent where he devoted full time efforts for six months to his wife\u2019s business and thereafter made infrequent attempts to secure employment elsewhere).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> To hold otherwise would run contrary to the purposes of the backpay remedy, encourage idleness and reward slothfulness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-5\">We conclude that the Board\u2019s finding that Castle was reasonably diligent in seeking employment after his discriminatory discharge is not supported by substantial evidence<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and that Mercy has adequately met its burden of proving that Castle breached his duty of mitigating his loss.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1083-6\">ENFORCEMENT DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1080-12\">.

Thus, this court has jurisdiction over the Board\u2019s petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1082-5\">. Viewing the record as a whole, as we are bound to do we extract the following testimony and evidence in summary of Castle\u2019s job search efforts:</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-6\"><em>June, 1974: </em>Castle called two ambulance companies. He was told that no positions were available and that he could submit, in person, an application at his convenience. He did not, however, do this until some three months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-7\"><em>July, 1974: </em>He contacted two ambulance companies and one fire department, each of which indicated that there were no openings. This was the extent of Castle\u2019s efforts for the month of July.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-8\"><em>August, 1974: </em>He called on three fire departments within a span of two days and left some sort of application at two of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-9\"><em>September, 1974: </em>Castle visited three of the ambulance companies which he had previously contacted and which had previously informed him that there were no openings for purposes of submitting application. He admitted that during the month of September, job search efforts took about one and a half hours of his time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-10\"><em>October, 1974: </em>Within the first two weeks of October he contacted three fire departments and then made no further efforts for the remainder of the month.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-11\"><em>November, 1974: </em>He contacted one hospital and submitted an application to another hospital. He claims that during the balance of the month he spent his time trying to develop a position as a news reporter for an emergency medical care committee newsletter, to be sponsored by a charitable organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-14\"><em>December, 1974: </em>Castle spent the first two weeks of December working out proposals for the newsletter. He also made inquiry of a friend about employment and filed an application with a health services employment agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-15\"><em>January, 1975: </em>He proceeded to make contact with three different businesses, attempting to find employment outside of his trade of ambulance driving. None of these three businesses was hiring, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-16\"><em>February, 1975: </em>His attempts to secure employment during the month of February consisted solely of three phone calls to different businesses, none of which was hiring.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-17\"><em>March, 1975: </em>After being rejected once again by two of the same businesses mentioned above, Castle finally pulled himself out of the job market by enrolling in a paramedic course at Stanford University.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-18\">Beginning at the end of June, 1974, Castle registered with the California State Employment office and reported back every two weeks throughout the backpay period. Beginning toward the end of August when he won an unemployment appeals decision, he collected an unemployment insurance check each time he visited the agency. All that he did was to get in line, where a clerk would process his check and, if any interviews were available, would let him know what he had to do. Castle described it as \u201ca formal process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-19\">Additional evidence revealed that from approximately one month prior to his discharge, until well into November, 1974, a substantial amount of Castle\u2019s time and effort was spent promoting an ambulance driver\u2019s association. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number>The evidence pointing to these extra-employment activities consisted of the credited testimony of several witnesses and a letter Castle wrote to the Emergency Medical Care Committee in which he described his discharge and the activities he undertook thereafter, stating:</p>\n<p id=\"AbU\">When I was first fired it would have been easy for me to walk away and merely get a better job for myself. But I felt an obligation to improve my fellow worker\u2019s lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-9\">The ALJ and the Board arrived at opposite interpretations of this writing and of the evidence in general. However, given the quantity and the quality of Castle\u2019s efforts and the fact that they were executed with such disinterest, we believe that neither the ALJ nor the Board correctly applied the standard of \u201creasonableness\u201d to which a discriminatee must be held with respect to his or her mitigation duty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1083-10\">. <em>Cf. Golay &amp; Co. v. NLRB, </em>447 F.2d 290, 295 (7th Cir. 1971) (discriminatees in their fifties, lacking a high school education, who applied at various businesses and finally did obtain jobs held to have been diligent in their search for employment); <em>Heinrich Motors, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>403 F.2d 145, 147-48 (2nd Cir. 1968) (where discriminatee engaged in self employment without profit, reasonable diligence in discharging mitigation duty was found nevertheless).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1083-25\">. In deciding that the Board\u2019s decision is not supported by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d we do not substitute our judgment for that of the Board on matters about which reasonable minds may disagree. The question here at issue is one of both law and fact. This court has recognized: \u201cWhere the issues are not purely factual, the Act does not explicitly direct courts to exercise a particular measure of review. Manifestly, however, the measure of our oversight increases as the Board\u2019s determination approaches the purely legal.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Tomco Communications, Inc., </em>567 F.2d 871, 876 n.2 (9th Cir. 1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1083-26\">. Because we deny enforcement of the Board\u2019s supplemental order, we need not reach Respondent Mercy\u2019s remaining contentions that the Board abused its discretion by denying enforcement of a subpoena issued by Mercy and that it received an unfair hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
