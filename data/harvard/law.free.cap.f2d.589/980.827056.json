R. ), in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a) and (c).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Count Two </em>charged defendant Lee substantively with attempting to transmit national defense information to the U.S. S.

Finally, <em>Count Twelve </em>charged Lee with receiving stolen government property (the Pyramider documents) valued in excess of $100, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1047-6\">Lee was found guilty on all counts. Sentences for various terms, including a life sentence on Count Two, were ordered to commence and run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-8\">When we view the voluminous evidence of this case (some 20 volumes of Reporter\u2019s Transcript) in the light most favorable to the verdict, as we must, we find that it is amply substantial to support Lee\u2019s conviction. Indeed, at page 1 of his reply brief Lee concedes that he transferred documents bearing a \u201cTop Secret\u2019\u2019 stamp to officials of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico. Due to this large volume of the evidence, the following is a summary of the pertinent facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-9\">On January 6, 1977, Lee was arrested by Mexican authorities in front of the Russian Embassy in Mexico City, Mexico, when he stuck his head through the Embassy fence and discarded some \u201ctrash\u201d from his pockets. Lee was taken to Mexican police headquarters for questioning. When asked to empty his pockets, Lee removed a white four-inch by eight-inch business envelope which contained ten to fifteen strips of photographic film negatives. Pictures made from these negatives were of documents marked \u201cPyramider\u201d and \u201cTop Secret.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-14\">The trial evidence showed that Lee and his codefendant Boyce worked closely together in selling the Pyramider defense secrets to Russian agents and that they split the profits from these sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-15\">Boyce was an employee for a corporation called TRW, Inc., which performed special studies of secret projects for elements of the United States intelligence community. One such project for the C.I.A. on which TRW worked was the Pyramider project. While Boyce was given a \u201cTop Secret\u201d security clearance by the C.I.A. for other work with TRW, he was never authorized access or clearance to the Pyramider project documents. Evidence was introduced at trial which showed that twenty-five fingerprints of Boyce\u2019s were found on Pyramider documents and that one fingerprint of Lee\u2019s had been found on a piece of equipment in the communications vault at TRW. The assistant director of security at TRW testified that neither Boyce nor Lee ever had any authorization to handle the files or that piece of equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-16\">Evidence was introduced to show that Lee and Boyce were seen numerous times together during the time of Boyce\u2019s employment with TRW and that they had made many trips to Mexico City. Lee himself made several trips to Mexico City travelling under an alias. He returned from these trips with \u201cstacks\" and \u201cbundles\u201d of money. Upon return, he often went directly to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>Boyce\u2019s residence to split the proceeds. At one point in the sequence one Cameron Adams traveled to Mexico City with Lee. While in Mexico City, Lee took some tape and placed an \u201cX\u201d on certain poles. When Adams asked about this, Lee told him that he was just \u201cinvolved with a spy thing here\u201d and that the \u201cX\u201d on the poles was \u201cto inform his people [that] he was in town.\u201d (R.T. 6:67)</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-4\">On another occasion, Lee showed one Sa-bel Shields a Minox camera which he owned and told her that \u201che was a Russian spy and that this was his espionage camera and that this is what he used to film top secret documents.\u201d (R.T. 6:53)</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-5\">Testimony at trial showed that this type of a Minox camera is used for photographing book pages and documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-6\">This Minox camera, which had been seen in Lee\u2019s possession several times, was seized during a search of Lee\u2019s and Boyce\u2019s residence. An F.B.I. Special Agent and photographic expert testified that the film negatives of the Pyramider project taken from Lee in Mexico City were produced by Lee\u2019s Minox camera.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-7\">LEE\u2019S DEFENSE THEORY</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-8\">Lee\u2019s defense was that he was an employee of the United States Government (the C.I.A.) and that he was working <em>for </em>the government by selling misinformation to the Russian agents. Evidence of this theory was very thin. The defense case on this point consisted of the testimony of two F.B.I. agents and the defendant\u2019s grand- ' mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-9\">One F.B.I. agent testified on direct examination that he had interviewed defendant Lee on January 14,1977, in Mexico City and that Lee had told him that he was connected with the C.I.A. and that he was employed as a subcontractor by the C.I.A. On recross-examination, however, the agent testified that a check made by F.B.I. headquarters had disclosed that Lee was not working for the C.I.A. Another agent also testified that Lee had said he was working for the C.I.A. This agent also stated that Lee\u2019s story had been found to be inaccurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-10\">Myrle Clarke, Lee\u2019s grandmother, testified that in the summer of 1976 Lee had told her concerning a trip to Mexico that he was working for the government, but on cross-examination, she stated he had not said for which government he was working.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-11\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-12\">On appeal Lee alleges: (1) that the trial court did not adequately instruct the jury on his theory of defense; (2) that the admission into evidence of three affidavits prepared by C.I.A. officials denied him his right to confrontation and were inadmissible hearsay; (3) that denial of his discovery motions was prejudicial to the preparation of his defense; (4) that the trial court improperly limited his expert\u2019s testimony; and (5) that the trial court should have held an evidentiary hearing regarding a possible conflict of interest among attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-13\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A2I\">(1) <em>Jury Instructions</em></p>\n<p id=\"aym-dedup-0\">Lee contends that the trial court erred when it refused to give a requested jury instruction regarding his employment with the government. The rejected instruction No. 26 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1048-14\">\u201cUnless you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that ANDREW DAUL-TON LEE neither was working for the United States Government, nor had a reasonable belief he was working for the United States Government with regard to \u25a0the allegations of the Indictment, you must find him not guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1048-15\">\u201cYou may only convict ANDREW DAULTON LEE if you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that ANDREW DAULTON LEE was not working for the United States Government and that he had no reasonable belief he was working for the United States Government with regard to the allegations of the Indictment. Otherwise you must find him not guilty.\u201d (CR 837)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"auv-dedup-0\">Lee relies on <em>United States v. Tashman, </em>478 F.2d 129 (5th Cir. 1973), as support for his instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>In deciding whether it was error for the trial judge to refuse Lee\u2019s proposed Instruction No. 26, we are guided by this court\u2019s prior decision in <em>United States v. Kaplan, </em>554 F.2d 958 (9th Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 956, 98 S.Ct. 483, 54 L.Ed.2d 315, where we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-4\">\u201cWhile it is clear that the trial judge must instruct the jury as to the defendant\u2019s theory of the case, the instructions given need not be in the precise language requested by the defendant. <em>Charron v. United States, </em>412 F.2d 657, 660 (9th Cir. 1969); <em>Rivers v. United States, </em>368 F.2d 362, 364 (9th Cir. 1966). The refusal to give a requested instruction is not error \u2018if the charge as a whole adequately covers the theory of the defense.\u2019 <em>United States v. Blane, </em>375 F.2d 249, 252 (6th Cir. 1967), <em>cert. denied, </em>389 U.S. 835, 88 S.Ct. 41, 19 L.Ed.2d 96 (1967), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>389 U.S. 998, 88 S.Ct. 459, 19 L.Ed.2d 503 (1967). Thus, the adequacy of the jury instructions is \u2018not [to] be determined by the giving, or failure to give, any one or more instructions,\u2019 but by examining the instructions as a whole. <em>Beck v. United States, </em>305 F.2d 595, 599 (10th Cir. 1962); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Alvarez, </em>469 F.2d 1065, 1067 (9th Cir. 1972); <em>United States v. Moore, </em>522 F.2d 1068, 1079 (9th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 1049, 96 S.Ct. 775, 46 L.Ed.2d 637.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1049-5\">554 F.2d at 968. <em>See also United States v. Seymour, </em>576 F.2d 1345, 1348 (9th Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-6\">Examining the instructions given to the jury (R.T. 13: 174-13: 245) in the present case, We find that they adequately covered Lee\u2019s theory of defense. If the jury had found that Daulton Lee had delivered the information as part of his employment by the C.I.A., then they could not have found that he had 'the necessary intent as explained in the court\u2019s instructions. The trial judge repeatedly explained what intent the jury must find to support a guilty verdict under each one of the counts of the indictment. Additionally, the indictment was read to the jury during the course of the instructions and a copy setting forth the different charges against Lee was given to the jury for use during their deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-7\">Count One of the indictment charged Lee with a conspiracy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-8\">\u201c \u2018[t]o knowingly and willfully communicate, deliver, and transmit to . the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics . information relating to the national defense of the United States . intending and having reason to believe that same would be used to the advantage of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, in violation of\u2019 the applicable statutes of the United States.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AnM\">.(R.T. 13: 188-189).</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-10\">Count Two charged Lee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-11\">\u201cwith intent and reason to believe that they would be used to the advantage of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, did knowingly and wilfully attempt to communicate, deliver, and transmit to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics . . . (the various Pyramider documents).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1049-14\">(R.T. 13: 201-202).</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-15\">Count Three charging Lee with a conspiracy;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-16\">\u201c \u2018[f]or the purpose of obtaining information respecting the national defense of the United States, did knowingly and willfully copy, take, make, and obtain (various information connected with the national defense), . . . intending and having reason to believe that same would be used to the advantage of . the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, in violation of\u2019 the applicable provisions of the law. . . . \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1049-18\">(R.T. 13: 211).</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-19\">Count Four charged Lee with the substantive offense underlying Count Three (R.T. 13; 214).</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-20\">Count Five charged Lee with receiving the \u201cTop Secret Pyramider\u201d documents, \u201c \u2018knowing and having reason to believe that same had been obtained, taken, and made by CHRISTOPHER JOHN BOYCE contrary to the provisions of\u2019 the statute of the United States.\u201d (R.T. 13: 217).</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-21\">Count Seven charged Lee with having \u201cunauthorized possession\u201d of the various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>documents relating to the national defense, \u201cwillfully communicates, delivers, or transmits, or attempts to communicate, deliver, or transmit the same to any person (explained in the instructions as agents of the U.S.S.R., see R.T. 13 : 223) not entitled to receive it.\u201d (R.T. 13: 222).</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-4\">Count Ten charged Lee with \u201cknowingly and wilfully act[ing] as an agent of . the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, without prior notification to the Secretary of State [of the United States].\u201d (R.T. 13: 225)</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-5\">Count Twelve charged Lee with \u201cknowingly and wilfully receiving], concealing], and retaining] with intent to convert to his own use and gain, records and things of value of the United States . . . knowing same to have been embezzled, stolen, purloined, and converted, said documents exceeding in value the sum of $100.00.\" (R.T. 13 : 228)</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-7\">The judge charged the jury that the crimes Daulton Lee was charged with \u201crequire proof of specific intent\u201d which required the government to prove \u201cthat the defendant knowingly did an act which the law forbids, purposely intending to violate the law.\u201d (R.T. 13: 184) Had the jury believed that Lee was acting for the C.I.A. or had a reasonable belief that he was acting for the C.I.A., then they could not have found that he had the specific intent as the judge had instructed them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-8\">Counts One, Two, Three, Four, Seven, Ten, and Twelve all required that it be found that Lee had committed the acts described in those counts knowingly, wilfully, or both knowingly and wilfully before a guilty verdict could be returned. The judge carefully defined these terms for the jury at R.T. 13: 193:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-9\">\u201cAn act is done knowingly, as stated previously, if done voluntarily and intentionally and not because of a mistake or other innocent reason.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-10\">\u201cThe purpose of adding the word \u2018knowingly\u2019 was to insure that no one would be convicted for an act done because of mistake or accident or other innocent reason.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-11\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-12\">\u201cAn act is done willfully if done voluntarily and intentionally and with the specific intent to do something the law forbids; that is to say, with bad purpose either to disobey or to disregard the law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Af8\">If the jury had chosen to believe that Lee had committed the acts in question as part of his employment for the C.I.A., then they could not find that he had committed them either knowingly or willfully. Even if Lee had a mistaken belief, the jury would have exonerated him since the \u201cknowingly\u201d requirement was designed \u201cto insure that no one would be convicted for an act done because of mistake or accident or other innocent reason.\u201d (R.T. 13: 193) Similarly, the jury could not have found that Lee had acted \u201cwilfully\u201d since that required the jury to have found that Lee acted \u201cwith bad purpose either to disobey or to disregard the law.\" (R.T. 13: 193)</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-13\">Counts One, Two, Three, and Four all contained requirements that Lee must have acted with an intent that such actions would be to the advantage of the U.S.S.R. If the jury had chosen to believe the defense theory, then Lee could not have been convicted on those counts. The other counts and the instructions on them all included a requirement that the acts have been done for the U.S.S.R.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-14\">As the instructions show, Lee was not deprived of the opportunity to present a defense based on C.I.A. employment or a reasonable belief in such employment. This is not a case where the failure to give an instruction deprived the defendant of the opportunity to argue his theory of the case to the jury. The instructions which were given opened up the area for defense counsel\u2019s eloquent and vigorous argument that Lee was or could have reasonably believed he was working for the C.I.A. <em>See e. g., </em>R.T. 13: 94, 13: 102, 13: 106, 13: 107, 13: 120, 13: 130, 13: 138, 13: 139.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-15\">(2) <em>The C.I.A. Affidavits</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1050-16\">To refute any claim by Lee that he was employed by the C.I.A., the govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>ment introduced certified affidavits from three C.I.A. officials, Robert W. Gambino, Director of the Office of Security, Robert A. Barteaux, Chief of the Information Processing Group, Information Services Staff, Directorate for Operations, and F.W.M. Janney, Director of Personnel, to show that a search of the respective records in their departments had failed to disclose any entry containing Lee\u2019s name or either of his two aliases prior to the date of his arrest on January 6, 1977. In other words, these affidavits were introduced by the government so that the jury could draw the inference that Lee had never been in the employment of the C.I.A. Lee contends that the admission of these affidavits into evidence was error because his Sixth Amendment confrontation right was violated and because the affidavits were inadmissible hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-5\">Although the right of confrontation and the hearsay rule protect similar interests of a defendant, they do not have identical applications. Evidence may be admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule and still violate the Confrontation Clause. Or, it may not violate the Confrontation Clause, but still be inadmissible hearsay. <em>California v. Green, </em>399 U.S. 149, 155-156, 90 S.Ct. 1930, 26 L.Ed.2d 489 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-6\">The affidavits in question were admitted under a well-established exception to the hearsay rule. The absence of any record, or a negative record, is generally admissible into evidence over a hearsay objection. Rule 27 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that \u201c[a]n official record or an entry therein or the lack of such a record or entry may be proved in the same manner as in civil actions.\u201d Rule 44 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1051-7\">\u201c(b) written statement that after a diligent search no record or entry of a specified tenor is found to exist in the records [of his office,] designated by the statement, ... is admissible as evidence that the records contain no such record or entry.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1051-8\">And finally, the Federal Rules of Evidence specifically allow the admission of these negative records:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1051-9\">\u201cThe following are not excluded by the hearsay rule, even though the declarant is available as a witness:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1051-10\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1051-11\">\u201c(10) <em>Absence of public record or entry. </em>To prove the absence of a record, report, statement, or data compilation, in any form, or the nonoccurrence or nonexistence of a matter of which a record, report, statement, or data compilation, in any form, was regularly made and preserved by a public office or agency, evidence in the form of a certification in accordance with rule 902, or testimony, that diligent search failed to disclose the record, report, statement, or data compilation, or entry.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1051-12\">Fed.R.Evid. 803(10). The Advisory Committee to the Federal Rules of Evidence said that the absence of any record is \u201cprobably not hearsay as defined in Rule 801.\u201d The exceptions to the hearsay rule which provide for the admissibility of negative records in the Federal Rules [Fed.R.Evid. 803(7) &amp; 803(10)] were designed to resolve any doubts about such evidence in favor of admissibility. When confronted with hearsay objections to evidence of the absence of any record, most courts have held such evidence admissible.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Therefore, we find that the district court did not err in admitting the C.I.A. affidavits over Lee\u2019s hearsay objection.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1052-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number><em>Dutton v. Evans, </em>400 U.S. 74, 91 S.Ct. 210, 27 L.Ed.2d 213 (1970) is the leading Supreme Court case on the Sixth Amendment confrontation right when evidence has been admitted pursuant to a well-recognized exception to the hearsay rule. The court gave four reasons in support of its conclusion that the hearsay evidence had not .violated the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation:</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-4\">(1) The statement contained no express assertion about past facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-5\">(2) The declarant was in a position to have personal knowledge of the matters in the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-6\">(3) The possibility that the declarant's statement was founded on faulty recollection is extremely remote.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-7\">(4) The circumstances surrounding the making of the statement were such that the possibility of misrepresentation was unlikely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-8\">400 U.S. at 88-89, 91 S.Ct. at 210. After applying these factors to the present case, we conclude that the admission of the C.I.A. affidavits did not deprive Lee of his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-9\">The first factor is the only one which may support Lee\u2019s position.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Assuming, as we do, that the affidavits contained statements about past facts, the other factors strongly support our holding. All three of the C.I.A. officials were in a position to know what their files contained. Lee did not challenge the foundation for the receipt of the affidavits. Robert W. Gambino personally examined the files of the Office of Security and found no previous record of Lee. Robert A. Barteaux and F. W. M. Janney, as custodians of the records in their respective departments, supervised searches of the records by personnel in their departments. These C.I.A. officials were in positions to have personal knowledge of whether there was any record of Lee. It is doubtful that the statements were based on faulty recollection. As indicated by the affidavits, all three of the officials were in positions of superior responsibility. The rationale which underlies all of the public document exceptions to the hearsay rules is that statements made by public officials in the discharge of their duties are generally trustworthy. The fact that the C.I.A. is the public agency involved is not a sufficient reason in itself to doubt the veracity of its officials. \"And finally, the circumstances surrounding the making of the affidavits also give credence to them. They were prepared on May 9,1977, during the trial in this case. The C.I.A. officials knew that they were to be used in this action,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Presumably, these officials are aware of the consequences of swearing to the absence of any record in a court proceeding if in fact a record had existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-15\">Guided by these indicia of reliability, we are convinced that the admission of the C.I.A- affidavits did not violate Lee\u2019s Sixth Amendment confrontation right.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>additional support for our holding in that the majority of the courts, by far, which have considered the admission of negative records against the Sixth Amendment challenge have arrived at the same conclusion.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1053-5\">(3) <em>Discovery Motions</em></p>\n<p id=\"A9N\">As indicated above, the indictment alleged violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 793 and \u00a7 794. To establish a violation of these sections, it must be proved that the information gathered or transmitted related to the \u201cnational defense.\u201d Lee contended that the Pyramider project did not relate to the \u201cnational defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-6\">Prior to trial the government possessed some thirty-five documents relating to the Pyramider project and planned to use eight of these at trial. Lee moved pursuant to Rule 16, Fed.Rules Crim.Proc., for production of all of these documents. However, the court only ordered production of the eight documents which the government intended to introduce at trial. The court denied Lee\u2019s other discovery motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-7\">Lee now contends that the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to discover the other Pyramider documents was prejudicial error. We disagree for several reasons. First, Lee completely fails to show how the eight documents which he was given were inadequate to substantiate his claim that the Pyramider project did not relate to \u201cnational defense.\u201d Secondly, while the government did not turn over the other twenty-seven documents to the defense, the government did stipulate that a representative of Lee\u2019s, a Mr. Wasson, would be permitted to view the documents in the offices of the United States Attorney (C.R. 458). An order was entered by the trial court to effectuate this stipulation (C.R. 459). Lee fails to make any showing of prejudice from having his representative view the documents as opposed to his possession of the documents themselves. As the government aptly points out, \u201c[significantly, Lee never called Mr. Wasson to testify to state his view on whether the documents related to national defense.\u201d (Appellee\u2019s Brief, p. 40). Third, Lee had the opportunity to fully cross-examine Leslie Dirks, the C.I.A. Deputy Director for Science and Technology, who authorized the Pyramider project and who testified that the project related to the \u201cnational defense.\u201d Finally, \u201c[t]he scope of discovery under Rule 16 is within the discretion of the trial judge and is not reviewable absent abuse.\u201d <em>United States v. Evans, </em>542 F.2d 805, 809 (10th Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1101, 97 S.Ct. 1124, 51 L.Ed.2d 550 (1977). <em>See also United States v. Fulton, </em>549 F.2d 1325, 1328 (9th Cir. 1977). We find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Lee\u2019s discovery motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-11\">Lee also contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion for discovery of documents relating to codefendant Boyce\u2019s security clearance. This is wholly without merit.. The government turned over these documents and the matter was resolved at trial as this colloquy between counsel establishes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1053-12\">\u201cMr. Levine [Gov. Counsel]: Your honor, in regard to that, we are providing them with documents relating to that, to Mr. Boyce\u2019s security clearance. We indicated that in response to Mr. Dougherty\u2019s motion in regard to Mr. Boyce and copies will also be provided to defendant Lee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>\u201cThe Court: All right. Does this dispose of all of defendant Lee\u2019s discovery motions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-4\">\u201cMr. Re [Lee\u2019s Counsel]: Yes, your hon- or.\u201d (R.T. lOlg).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1054-5\">(4) <em>Limitation on Expert Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"AopU\">The Pyramider project documents were classified \u201cTop Secret\u201d under the criteria of a certain Executive Order 11652. Lee wanted to challenge the propriety of the classification and called to the stand one William Florence, an alleged expert on the classification of documents under this executive order. He inquired of Florence the \u201cmeaning and application\" of Executive Order 11652. The purpose of the inquiry, according to Lee, was \u201cto afford the jury a standard by which they could determine if the Pyramider documents were properly classified as Top Secret,\u201d (Lee\u2019s Opening Brief, p. 47) We find that such an inquiry was totally irrelevant to the issues of this case and of no help to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-6\">Under the espionage statutes charged in the indictment (see notes 3 &amp; 4, supra), Lee was found guilty of gathering and transmitting documents which relate to the \u201cnational defense.\u201d There is no requirement in these statutes that the documents be properly marked \u201cTop Secret\" or for that matter that they be marked secret at all. It is enough that they related to the national defense and that they are transmitted with the intent to advantage a foreign nation or injure the United States. There is no question from the evidence produced at trial that the Pyramider documents related to \u201cnational defense.\u201d <em>See Gorin v. United States, </em>312 U.S. 19, 61 S.Ct. 429, 85 L.Ed. 488 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-7\">Since the \u201cexpert testimony\u201d of Florence on this subject of improper v. proper classification would not give \u201cappreciable help\u201d to the jury in deciding the guilt or innocence of Lee, it was properly excluded by the trial court. Such a decision \u201cis committed to the \u2018broad discretion\u2019 of the trial judge and his action will not be disturbed unless manifestly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Amaral, </em>488 F.2d 1148, 1152 (9th Cir. 1973). We are unable on this record to find that the trial court\u2019s action in limiting Florence\u2019s testimony was erroneous, much less \u201cmanifestly erroneous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-11\">(5) <em>Evidentiary Hearing on Attorney\u2019s Conflict of Interest</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1054-12\">The issue of a potential conflict of interest involving codefendant Boyce\u2019s attorneys was first raised by the government at the conclusion of pretrial proceedings. The government informed the court that a member of the law firm representing Boyce had at one time worked for the C.I.A. and that the attorney (Chelius) who actively represented Boyce did perform some work for the C.I.A. and did occasionally come into contact with contracts involving the C.I.A. The law firm resigned from the case and with Boyce\u2019s approval Chelius resigned from that law firm to remain as counsel for Boyce. Lee\u2019s counsel requested an evidentiary hearing based on the speculative possibility that Boyce\u2019s attorneys might have reported defense strategy to the government. The trial court briefly inquired of Attorney Chelius whether there were any events which had taken place on his part or on the part of his colleagues which had prejudiced or would prejudice the interests of his client or the interests of defendant Lee. (R.T. 1166-67). Chelius answered in the negative. (R.T. 1167).</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-13\">After this inquiry, the trial court denied Lee\u2019s motion for an evidentiary hearing. Lee contends this was reversible error. We cannot agree. First, the trial court performed enough of an inquiry (though informal) to satisfy itself that Boyce\u2019s counsel had not sold out the defense to the prosecution (see trial court\u2019s comments, R.T. 1167-1168).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Secondly, evidentiary hearings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>need be held only \u201cwhen the moving papers allege facts with sufficient definiteness, clarity, and specificity to enable the trial court to conclude that relief must be granted if the facts alleged are proved.\u201d <em>United States v. Carrion, </em>463 F.2d 704, 706 (9th Cir. 1972). Lee\u2019s motion did not satisfy these standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-5\">Therefore, for these reasons, we find that the denial of Lee\u2019s motion for an evidentia-ry hearing was not reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1045-10\">.
