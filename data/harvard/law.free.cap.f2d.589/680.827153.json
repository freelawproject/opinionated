If the proceeding has not been concluded and an order made at the expiration of the suspension period, on motion of the natural-gas company making the filing, the proposed change of rate . . . shall go into effect. Where increased rates . are thus made effective, the Commission may . . . require the natural-gas company ... to refund, with interest, the portion of such increased rates or charges by its decision found not justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-12\">It is well established that a natural gas company cannot recoup income denied to it when the Commission exercises the five-month suspension power under section 4(e). <em>FPC v. Tennessee Gas Transmission Co., </em>371 U.S. 145, 152, 83 S.Ct. 211, 9 L.Ed.2d 199 (1962); <em>Hope Natural Gas Co. v. FPC, </em>196 F.2d 803, 805-06 (4th Cir. 1952). It is equally well settled that, notwithstanding the mutual agreement of the parties, a rate increase may not be made retroactively effective to cover the period of suspension. <em>Shell Oil Co. v. FPC, </em>334 F.2d 1002,1009 (3d Cir. 1964); <em>Hope Natural Gas Co. </em>v. <em>FPC, supra </em>at 807. It is in this background that we consider the issue presented in this case, namely, whether the petitioner should be permitted to offset the amount of increase income denied to it (when the Commission suspended the rate increase pursuant to section 4(e)) against its refund liability arising from the collection of the excessive rates following the expiration of the suspension period and before the legality of the rate was determined by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b746-17\">Petitioner Belco Petroleum Corporation (Belco) makes interstate sales of natural gas obtained from its leasehold interests in the Big Piney Area of Wyoming. These sales are made to Northwest Pipeline Corporation (Northwest) pursuant to five separate contracts negotiated in the late 1950\u2019s and on file with the Commission as Belco\u2019s Gas Rate Schedule Nos. 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6. On August 6, 1974, Belco and Northwest agreed to amend these contracts to increase the applicable prices to forty cents (40$) per Mcf.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The next day, Belco tendered the proposed rate increases for filing with the Commission. On September 6, 1974, the Commission accepted Belco\u2019s filings and, invoking its power under section 4(e), suspended the effectiveness of the proposed rates for five months until February 7, \u25a0 1975. Under the provisions of section 4(e), if the Commission has not passed on the lawfulness of the rates, the higher rate goes into effect at the end of the suspension period.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>Approximately fifteen months before the negotiation and filing of the Belco-North-west rate increase, the Commission had issued notice of a proposed rulemaking to establish nationwide rates for natural gas obtained from wells commenced prior to January 1, 1973.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This rulemaking would affect most of the gas sold under the Belco-Northwest contracts. The rulemaking proceedings did not culminate in a final determination until December 31, 1975, over ten months after Belco\u2019s increases went into effect. On that date, the Commission issued Opinion No. 749, setting the just and reasonable rate for natural gas from the subject wells.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Opinion No. 749 also provided that for sales (such as Belco\u2019s) being made subject to refund, the newly established rate \u201cshall be the applicable just and reasonable rate as of the date of suspension\u201d and that \u201call amounts collected in excess of that rate shall be refunded.\u201d The Commission later revised the refund procedure, however, in Opinion No. 749-C, issued July 19,1976. This second opinion provided that the newly established rates would apply from the date such rates were collected subject to refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">Belco duly filed its refund reports on November 16, 1976, but in so doing, it reduced the amounts it had collected in excess of the applicable just and reasonable rate by the difference between the amounts it had been able to collect during the suspension period and the amounts it could have collected under the newly established rates had there been no suspension. By letter order dated January 11, 1977, the Commission rejected Belco\u2019s proposed offset procedure, declaring it to be \u201cimproper and inconsistent with Commission precedent.\u201d On March 10, 1977, the Commission issued an order denying Belco\u2019s application for rehearing and reaffirming its rejection of the offset procedure, but it subsequently granted Belco\u2019s request for a stay pending appeal. Belco\u2019s petition before this court seeks review of the orders of January 11 and March 10, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">As a preliminary issue, the Commission contests Belco\u2019s standing in this court. Section 19(b) of the Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717r(b) (1976), requires a reviewing court to consider only objections that have been urged before the Commission in an application for rehearing. The Commission asserts that the application for rehearing did not contain an objection to the Commission\u2019s order based on Belco\u2019s interpretation of Opinion No. 749, and that consequently this court should not address that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-10\">Belco\u2019s application for rehearing set forth arguments in support of its contention that the Commission abused its discretion in rejecting Belco\u2019s requested offset procedure, which had been based on Opinion No. 749. Section 19 does not preclude appellate consideration of an argument in support of a properly preserved ground of error. Read in the entirety, Belco\u2019s application gave notice to the Commission with sufficient clarity regarding the grounds on which it urged reconsideration. This fulfills the statutory requirement. <em>See Rhode Island Consumers\u2019 Council v. FPC, </em>164 U.S.App.D.C. 134, 143, 504 F.2d 203, 212 (1974). Accordingly, we find standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-11\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b747-12\">The language of Opinion No. 749 relevant to refund obligations provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b747-13\">For those sales which are presently being made subject to refund, we find that the rate established in this Opinion or the higher applicable rate, <em>shall be the applicable just and reasonable rate as of the date of suspension </em>and <em>all </em>amounts <em>collected </em>in excess of that rate, as adjusted pursuant to the regulations adopted herein, or the higher applicable area rate shall be refunded .</p>\n<p id=\"b747-14\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-15\">Belco argues that this language authorized it to offset its refund obligations by the income denied during the period of suspension when it could not collect a just \u00e1nd <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>reasonable rate. Belco emphasizes that it was <em>contractually </em>entitled to collect the just and reasonable rate from the date of suspension but could not do solely because the Commission exercised its valid authority under section 4(e).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">Although Belco\u2019s argument has some facial validity, the language of Opinion No. 749, read in its entirety, is not unequivocal in support of Belco\u2019s position. Instead, the language is quite ambiguous with respect to the manner of computing the refund. For example, another explanation for the above-quoted language \u2014 and in our view the more plausible one \u2014 is that the Commission, in stating that the \u201capplicable just and reasonable rate\u201d shall exist \u201cas of the date of suspension,\u201d was simply acknowledging that the filed rate had been investigated and found to be just and reasonable as of the time the investigation began or as of the date the rate would have become effective absent suspension. The separate and distinct character of the two considerations involved in Opinion No. 749 \u2014 what is the just and reasonable rate, and the manner in which the refund is to be computed\u2014 is apparent from the text of the preceding paragraph of the Opinion:</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">At the present time, there are a number of jurisdictional sales, which will be subject to the rate prescribed herein, that are being made subject to refund. By this decision, we [(1)] determine a just and reasonable rate for those sales and [(2)] require refunds of amounts collected which are in excess of the applicable rate.</p>\n<p id=\"A5D\">Thus, the just and reasonable rate was first determined as of the date of suspension (which is the usual reference point from which such a determination is made), <em>and then </em>a statement was made concerning the refunds. The reference to the \u201cdate of suspension,\u201d a phrase modifying the \u201capplicable just and reasonable rate,\u201d has, in logic, nothing to do with the Commission\u2019s statement about the computation of refunds.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">In stating that \u201call amounts collected in excess of that rate . . . shall be refunded,\u201d therefore, the Commission was embarking on the discussion of a new subject. In so stating, the Commission could well have meant that <em>all </em>monies <em>collected </em>as a result of the higher, excessive rate \u2014 that is, the rate charged during the period between the end of the suspension period and the final determination of the just and reasonable rate \u2014 should be returned to the company\u2019s customers. On this reading, in other words, the Commission intended the refund computation to be made by looking only to the period during which the higher rate was <em>actually collected, </em>a period which does <em>not </em>include the period of suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">It must be conceded, however, that Bel-co\u2019s interpretation of the language of Opinion No. 749 is not wholly unreasonable if one looks solely to the language. Although the Commission may well have intended to refer only to the period during which a higher rate was actually collected, the language of the Opinion itself does not foreclose computing the \u201cexcess\u201d by incorporating the period of suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">Fortunately, the Commission clarified this ambiguity in its subsequent order of July 19, 1976, Opinion No. 749-C. This order provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b748-10\">[Rjefunds shall be computed on the basis of the adjusted national rate or the otherwise applicable area rate, whichever is greater. <em>Such rates shall apply from the date rates were collected subject to refund . .</em></p>\n<p id=\"b748-11\">(Emphasis added). The order also provided:</p>\n<p id=\"Am5\">For those proceedings in which rates are presently being collected subject to refund or were collected subject to refund prior to the issuance of Opinion No. 749, <em>refunds will be determined on the basis of the adjusted national rate prescribed in Opinion No. 749 </em>or the otherwise applicable higher area rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-12\">(Emphasis added). This language clarified the ambiguity created by the imprecise language in Opinion No. 749. Opinion No. 749-C makes clear that the refunds were to be computed <em>without </em>reference to what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>could have been collected during the period of suspension. Indeed, the second of the above-quoted passages strongly suggests that all Opinion No. 749 sought to accomplish by referring to the \u201cdate of suspension\u201d was to demonstrate that the approved rate was \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d on the factual showing as of that date, but not that refunds were to be computed by including a backward adjustment for the period of suspension. The clarification in Opinion No. 749-C indicates, moreover, that the reference to \u201camounts collected\u201d in Opinion No. 749 was intended to limit the refund computation to the period after the lapse of the suspension, that is, to the period when \u201camounts\u201d were <em>actually </em>\u201ccollected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Azo\">Indeed, a detailed examination of Opinion No. 749-C strongly suggests that Opinion No. 749 was <em>never </em>intended to permit Bel-co\u2019s proposed offset procedure. The reference to \u201cthe applicable just and reasonable rate as of the date of suspension\u201d was contained in the text of Opinion No. 749 in a section entitled \u201cRefunds and Rate Increases.\u201d The procedure for computing the refund was set forth in more specific terms in Ordering Paragraph (D), which provided:</p>\n<p id=\"A3Q\">(D) <em>Producer Refunds and Purchaser\u2019s Flow-Through</em></p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">Within 120 days of the date of this order, refund reports shall be filed with this Commission in triplicate, and one copy served on the purchaser, by each <em>producer </em>(other than small producers) <em>collecting rates </em>subject to refund in Section 4(e) or Section 7(c) proceedings in excess of the adjusted national rate prescribed herein or the otherwise higher applicable area rate, and as to which refunds are required under the terms of this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"A-i\">(Emphasis added). This paragraph, which articulates the procedure for paying refunds, makes no reference to the period of suspension. This paragraph, like the passage from the same order analyzed above, is ambiguous: the period for computing the \u201cexcess of the adjusted national rate\u201d could be confined solely to the period after the suspension period when rates were actually collected, or it could be that period as well as the period of suspension. The language from Opinion No. 749-C quoted above was specifically designated as amending Ordering Paragraph (D) of Opinion No. 749. As we noted, that language from Opinion No. 749-C makes no reference to the period of suspension. This omission suggests to us that the Commission never meant to refer to the period of suspension in computing the refund and that Opinion No. 749-C was meant to clarify an ambiguity in the earlier order to prevent an interpretation permitting an offset procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">There is an additional reason strongly suggesting that Opinion No. 749 was never intended to allow the offset procedure urged by Belco. In <em>FPC v. Tennessee Gas Transmission Co., supra, </em>the Court stated that a company \u201ccan <em>never </em>recoup the income lost when the five-month suspension power of the Commission is exercised under \u00a7 4(e).\u201d 371 U.S. at 152, 83 S.Ct. at 215 (emphasis added). This is a clear statement of regulatory philosophy, one which has been religiously followed by the Commission. Had the Commission intended to shift its regulatory approach with Opinion No. 749, it surely would have done so with less ambiguous language than that found in the opinion. <em>See Gillring Oil Co. v. FERC, </em>566 F.2d 1323, 1325 (5th Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">In any event, Opinion No. 749-C clearly and unambiguously clarified the language of Opinion No. 749. When construction of an agency regulation is in issue, courts owe great deference to the interpretation adopted by the agency and will uphold that interpretation if it is reasonable and consistent with the regulation. The court need not find that the agency\u2019s construction is the only possible one, or even the one that the court would have adopted in the first instance. <em>United States v. Larionoff, </em>431 U.S. 864, 872, 97 S.Ct. 2150, 53 L.Ed.2d 48 (1977); <em>Udall v. Tallman, </em>380 U.S. 1, 16-17, 85 S.Ct. 792, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965); <em>Bowles v. Seminole Rock Co., </em>325 U.S. 410, 414, 65 S.Ct. 1215, 89 L.Ed. 1700 (1945); <em>Leefer v. Administrator, NASA, </em>177 U.S.App.D.C. 62, 66, 543 F.2d 209, 213. Consistent with this principle, a court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>should enforce the language in a subsequent, clear regulation, if otherwise reasonable and valid, instead of that in a prior, ambiguous regulation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This case is not an example of an agency reversing itself without adequate explanation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Rather, the Commission here discerned an ambiguity in its initial order and it acted to correct that ambiguity in clear and precise terms. In such a circumstance, enforcement of the clarifying language is wholly appropriate. <em>Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Ry. Co. v. ICC, </em>187 U.S.App.D.C. 241, 245, 571 F.2d 1190, 1194 (1977).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In short, the Commission\u2019s action may not have been \u201ctidy, but it was not arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Our inquiry does not end with the conclusion that the Commission did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in clarifying the ambiguity of Opinion No. 749. The question remains whether Belco has a right to offset its refund obligation by the amount of income denied it during the suspension period. Stated differently, the issue is whether depriving Belco of the offset deprives it of income to which it is entitled on statutory or constitutional grounds. We hold that it does <em>not.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b750-14\">\n<em>A</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b750-15\">Nothing in section 4(e) requires the Commission to order refunds. The Commission <em>may </em>order refunds, but the decision is left to the Commission\u2019s discretion. <em>Cities Service Gas Co. v. FPC, </em>175 U.S.App.D.C. 316, 328, 535 F.2d 1278, 1290 (1976); <em>Placid Oil Co. v. FPC, </em>483 F.2d 880, 905 (5th Cir. 1973), <em>aff\u2019d sub nom. Mobil Oil Corp. v. FPC, </em>417 U.S. 283, 94 S.Ct. 2328, 41 L.Ed.2d 72 (1974); <em>In re Hugoton-Anadarko Area Rate Case, </em>466 F.2d 974, 990 (9th Cir. 1972). In granting the Commission that discretion, Congress did not specify how the refunds should be computed; this, too, was left to the discretion of the agency.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Furthermore, the statute does not give a company filing a rate under section 4(d) the right to collect the just and reasonable rate throughout the period of suspension when the Commission invokes its power under section 4(e). Had Congress so intended, it could easily have inserted the appropriate language into the statute.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Nor does the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>statute give the producer the right either to offset with illegally accumulated funds the income denied during the suspension (or any other) period, or to offset such denied income against refund obligations. Because the statute does not give the company a right to the just and reasonable rate during the period of suspension, and because the statute does not affirmatively grant the right to an offset, the Commission, in the proper exercise of its broad discretion, did not deny Belco any right to which it was entitled under the Natural Gas Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">It is not insignificant that the Commission acted consistently with the statutory bias favoring retroactive rate reductions but not retroactive rate increases, a bias Congress wrote directly into the statute:</p>\n<p id=\"apx-dedup-0\">[T]he Commission shall have no power to order any increase in any rate contained in the currently effective schedule of such natural gas company <em>on </em>file with the Commission, unless such increase is in accordance with a new schedule filed by such natural gas company; but the Commission may order a decrease where existing rates are unjust, unduly discriminatory, preferential, otherwise unlawful, or are not the lowest reasonable rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717d(a) (1976). While the offset Belco proposes is not technically a retroactive rate increase, it is a retroactive assessment against the consumer and would have the same effect as a retroactive rate increase. Regardless of how the offset is characterized, rates the consumer did not pay during the suspension period would be charged against them, albeit camouflaged as reductions in the payments Belco must make for having charged above a just and reasonable rate after the suspension period lapsed. The conclusion is inevitable, then, that in denying Belco\u2019s request for an offset, the Commission neither violated the statute nor deprived Belco of any right to which it was entitled under the statute. <em>See Gillring Oil Co. v. FERC, supra </em>at 1325.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">\n<em>B</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">The constitutional implications of natural gas regulation were addressed in <em>Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, </em>390 U.S. 747, 88 S.Ct. 1344, 20 L.Ed.2d 312 (1968), in which producers of natural gas challenged the validity of the FPC\u2019s initiation of area rate regulation. One argument advanced by the producers was that the system of area regulation exceeded the Commission\u2019s constitutional and statutory authority. The Court responded:</p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">It is plain that the Constitution does not forbid the imposition, in appropriate circumstances, of maximum prices upon commercial and other activities . Its exercise has regularly been approved by this Court . .. It is, however, plain that the \u201cpower to regulate is not a power to destroy,\u201d . . . and that maximum rates must be calculated for a regulated class in conformity with the pertinent constitutional limitations. Price control is <em>\u201cunconstitutional . if arbitrary, discriminatory, or demonstrably irrelevant to the policy the legislature is free to adopt . . </em>..\u201d <em>Neb-bia v. New York, </em>291 U.S. 502, 539 [54 S.Ct. 505, 517, 78 L.Ed. 940]. Nonetheless, <em>the just and reasonable standard of the Natural Gas Act \u201ccoincides\u201d with the applicable constitutional standards, FPC v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co., </em>[315 U.S. 575,] 586 [62 S.Ct. 743, 86 L.Ed. 1037], <em>and any rate selected by the Commission from the broad zone of reasonableness permitted by the Act cannot properly be attacked as confiscatory. </em>Accordingly, there can be no constitutional objection if the Commission, in its calculation of rates, takes fully into account <em>the various interests which Congress has required it to reconcile. </em>We do not suggest that maximum rates computed for a group or geographical area can never be confiscatory; we hold only that <em>any such rates, determined in conformity with the Natural Gas Act, and intended to \u201cbalanc [e </em>] . <em>the investor and the consumer interests,\" are constitutionally permissible. FPC </em>v. <em>Hope Natural Gas Co., </em>[320 U.S. 591,] 603 [64 S.Ct. at 288, 88 L.Ed. 333],</p>\n<p id=\"A2M\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>390 U.S. at 768-70, 88 S.Ct. at 1360-61 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">Insofar as it affects the producer, a decision by the Commission to approve a producer\u2019s filed rate at a just and reasonable level somewhere below the proposed rate is analytically the same as a decision by the Commission that a refund should be made. Both decisions impose a maximum price upon the producer; the difference is that one operates prospectively while the other operates retroactively. Consequently, like a rate decision, a refund order would be unconstitutional if \u201carbitrary, discriminatory, or demonstrably irrelevant to the policy the legislature is free to adopt.\u201d And a refund decision that falls within \u201cthe broad zone of reasonableness permitted by the Act\u201d could not \u201cproperly be attacked as confiscatory.\u201d In sum, no constitutional objection will lie if the Commission fully accounts for \u201cthe various interests which Congress has required it to reconcile.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Similarly, a decision by the Commission to suspend the effectiveness of proposed rates \u2014 a decision which may operate permanently to deprive a natural gas producer of a just and reasonable rate <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u2014 is properly within the sound discretion of the Commission. Section 4(e) reflects the careful balancing of several interests. Obviously, an important purpose of the suspension power is to maintain the status quo for up to five months during which the Commission can investigate the reasonableness of the proposed rate. <em>Phillips Petroleum Co. v. FPC, </em>227 F.2d 470, 474 (10th Cir. 1955), <em>cert. denied, </em>350 U.S. 1005, 76 S.Ct. 649, 100 L.Ed. 868 (1956). Yet that is not its only purpose. A good example of the broader implication of section 4(e)\u2019s suspension power is apparent in <em>Hunt Oil Co. v. FPC, </em>398 F.2d 746 (5th Cir. 1968), in which four independent natural gas producers, parties to an area rate proceeding initiated under section 5(a), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717d(a) (1976), petitioned the court for review of the Commission\u2019s five-month suspension of their proposed rate increases. The court, in response to the petitioners\u2019 claim that the five-month suspensions were meaningless when no individual examination of the proposals was contemplated within that period, declared:</p>\n<p id=\"AMUu\">It is manifest that an area rate case requires more than five months to be completed by the Commission. However, it cannot be denied that the five-month period is being utilized by the Commission in its investigation and determination of the area rate. . . . The five month\u2019s suspension period is a congressional authorization provided by the Natural Gas Act and we are without authority to nullify it. Petitioners assert no constitutional invalidity in the practice but contend that the circumstances warrant a holding by us that the Commission\u2019s exercise of the five months\u2019 suspension period in the majority of independent producer filings, when an applicable area rate case is pending, is an abuse of discretion. We are unable to agree, for it is apparent that <em>Congress intended to protect consumers from increased rates until the Commission would fix just and reasonable rates, but it considered that a </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number><em>period of five months would be the maximum time permitted.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">398 F.2d at 749-50 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">As <em>Hunt Oil </em>illustrates, section 4(e) reflects a congressional balance of the consumer\u2019s interest in being protected from excessive rates and of the producer\u2019s interest in receiving some increase pending final Commission action in what can often be lengthy investigations. When the Commission suspends a rate, its action is expected to reflect an appropriate balance of these competing interests, thereby furthering the legislative intent. Presumably, if a suspension is not within the zone of reasonableness reflecting the appropriate balance of competing interests, it may be confiscatory and unconstitutional within the meaning of <em>Permian Basin.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The permissible zone, however, is obviously extremely broad when suspension orders are being tested, for in that context Congress has seen fit by statute to afford the Commission considerable discretion.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-15\">In testing the Commission\u2019s decision disallowing Belco to offset the income denied during the period of suspension against the refunds of the excessive rates charged in the post-suspension period, we hold that the Commission did not transgress the broad zone of reasonableness that marks the constitutional limits on Commission activity. The Commission has determined that such an offset is inconsistent with policies served by section 4(e)\u2019s suspension power. These policies reflect, in our view, the careful balancing of competing interests, which Congress has directed the Commission to reconcile.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>The Commission\u2019s responsibility is to \u201cafford consumers a complete, permanent, and effective bond of protection from excessive rates and charges.\u201d <em>Atlantic Refining Co. v. Public Service Commission, </em>360 U.S. 378, 388, 79 S.Ct. 1246, 1253, 3 L.Ed.2d 1312 (1959); <em>FPC v. Hope Natural Gas Co., </em>320 U.S. 591, 612, 64 S.Ct. 281, 88 L.Ed. 333 (1944); <em>Cities Service Gas Co. v.

As the court of appeals recognized in <em>Hunt Oil, </em>one of the purposes of the suspension period is \u201cto protect consumers from increased rates until the Commission would fix just and reasonable rates.\u201d 398 F.2d at 750. This goal exists independently of the refund possibility. Belco\u2019s suggestion that consumers will not suffer from the refund offset is belied by the manner of computation its'elf. As we noted earlier, rates that the consumer did not pay during the suspension period are charged against them as reductions of the refunds Belco must make for having charged users more than the just and reasonable rate in the post-suspension period. This situation is quite similar to that in <em>Gillring Oil Co. v. FERC, supra, </em>in which the court upheld the Commission\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s request to offset the refunds it was ordered to pay for charging prices in excess of ceiling prices in other years. Petitioner argued that the consumer would not be injured from the refund offset because charging ceiling prices in all years would have been reasonable. The court rejected that argument, stating that it \u201cdefies plain arithmetic, ignores the ceiling rate concept, and flaunts [sic] the filed rate doctrine.\u201d 566 F.2d at 1326.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">\n<em>C</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b754-9\">Our research and that of counsel have not uncovered any decisions directly addressing the issue of this case. The case law does, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>however, provide some guidance in resolving the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">In <em>Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, supra, </em>the Supreme Court considered whether the Commission\u2019s power to order refunds was limited to periods in which aggregate revenues for all producers in a given area exceeded aggregate revenue requirements for such producers. In holding that the Commission\u2019s power was not so limited, the Court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">A rate found to be unjust and unreasonable is declared by \u00a7 4(a) to be unlawful; if the rate has been the subject of a rate schedule modification under \u00a7 4(d), the Commission is empowered by \u00a7 4(e) to order its refund. <em>We can see no warrant, either in the Act or in the terms of the Commission\u2019s orders, now to impose any additional limitations upon the Commission's authority .</em></p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">390 U.S. at 827, 88 S.Ct. at 1391 (emphasis added). There are, as Belco asserts, factual distinctions between this case and <em>Permian Basin : </em>the latter involved many producers while this case presents one producer with identifiable contract commitments. Yet the similarities between the two cases are striking, particularly in the reasoned path that the Commission followed in each case. The <em>Permian Basin </em>Court said that the Commission</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">reasonably concluded that the adoption of a system of refunds conditioned on findings as to aggregate area revenues . would require consumers to accede to unjust and unreasonable prices merely because other prices . . . had proved improvident.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">390 U.S. at 828, 88 S.Ct. at 1392. Here, the Commission apparently reasoned that the offset procedure was unreasonable, for it could cause consumers to accede to unjust and unreasonable prices in a period between the lapse of the suspension period and the conclusion of the investigation. Moreover, the Commission had a reasonable concern that producers not be enticed to seek rates far in excess of the just and reasonable level in order to create a fund against which retroactive rates could be offset. Like the <em>Permian Basin </em>Court, we find no reason \u201cnow to impose any additional limitations upon the Commission\u2019s authority/\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"A6Q\">Similarly, the reasoning in <em>FPC v. Tennessee Gas Transmission Co., supra, </em>tends to support the Commission\u2019s decision in this case. Tennessee Gas operated an extensive pipeline system, which it divided into six rate zones with rate differentials. It did not have a system-wide rate applicable to all services. In 1959, Tennessee Gas filed with the Commission proposed rate increases for its six rate zones. The proposed rates were based on a 7% overall return on its net investment. At the outset of the hearings on the reasonableness of the proposed rates, the Commission imposed a five month suspension period. After a full hearing, the Commission concluded that 6%% rather than 7% was a just and reasonable return. Accordingly, it ordered Tennessee Gas to file lower rates retroactive to the end of the five-month suspension period and to refund the differences collected since that time. Tennessee Gas did not object to the 6Vs% figure for return on net investment, but it did contend that requiring refunds prior to a determination on cost allocation among its zones of operation might result in its being unable to realize the just and reasonable return during the refund period. Tennessee Gas reasoned that in some of the zones the approved rates might exceed the collected rates less the refunds ordered, with the result that it would be unable to achieve a <em>&amp;Vs% </em>return because it could not retroactively collect the higher rate in those zones while it was obligated to make full refunds in the remaining lower rate zones. On review, the court of appeals held that the Commission erred in ordering an immediate refund before it had determined other issues in the proceeding, particularly the proper allocation costs among the six zones, an issue that could well determine the reasonableness of the overall filed rate with respect to each zone. The Supreme Court reversed the court of appeals:</p>\n<p id=\"b755-11\">[A]n analysis of the policy of the [Natural Gas] Act clearly indicates that a natural gas company initiating an increase in rates under \u00a7 4(d) <em>assumes the hazards </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number><em>involved in that procedure. . . . [T]he company can never recoup the income lost when the five-month suspension power of the Commission is exercised under \u00a7 4(e). </em>The company is also required to refund any sums thereafter collected should it not sustain its burden of proving the reasonableness of an increased rate, and it may suffer further loss when the Commission upon a finding of excessiveness makes adjustments in the rate detail of the company\u2019s filing. <em>In this latter respect a rate for one class or zone of customers may be found by the Commission to be too low, but the company cannot recoup its losses by making retroactive the higher rate subsequently allowed; </em>on the other hand, when another class or zone of customers is found to be subjected to excessive rates and a lowered rate is ordered, the company must make refunds to them. The company\u2019s losses in the first instance do not justify its illegal gain in the latter. The company having initially filed the rates and either collected an illegal return or failed to collect a sufficient one must, under the theory of the Act, <em>shoulder the hazards incident to its action including not only the refund of any illegal gain but also its losses where its filed rate is found to be inadequate.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">371 U.S. at 152-53, 83 S.Ct. at 215 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Thus, that a higher rate might be declared just and reasonable in one of the zones did not entitle Tennessee Gas, in effect, to offset the income denied in that zone against the refunds ordered in another zone. Here again, <em>Tennessee Gas </em>can be factually distinguished from this case: the petitioner in the former did not seek to offset income denied during the suspension period against the ordered refunds. Yet the principle underlying the case \u2014 that a company cannot recoup its losses by imposing a retroactive assessment on its customers \u2014 is equally applicable here. The Court\u2019s statement that a company \u201ccan <em>never </em>recoup the income lost when the five-month suspension power of the Commission is exercised\u201d reflects, as we have said, a regulatory philosophy that has served both to further, within constitutional limits, the interests which the Act is intended to protect, and to reconcile other competing interests. It was proper for the Commission to insist that Belco both \u201crefund [its] illegal gain\u201d and shoulder \u201cits losses,\u201d which were \u201cincident to its actions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">Perhaps the most important implication of <em>Tennessee Gas </em>and <em>Permian Basin </em>is that no precedent <em>forbids </em>the Commission from following the course it has taken. In the reported cases, the Commission has resisted off-setting refunds with prior losses, for such procedures have often closely resembled retroactive ratemaking. But the interests to be furthered by the Act also justify prohibitions on other kinds of retroactive assessments like the one Belco would impose here. It is not the province of this court to substitute its judgment for that of the Commission. <em>See Humbolt Express v. ICC, </em>186 U.S.App.D.C. 141, 567 F.2d 1134, 1137 (1977). If the Commission\u2019s judgment is to be altered at all, it must offend one of the standards we use to test such judgments. The absence of specific precedent authorizing the Commission\u2019s conclusion is not troublesome when, as here, the philosophy of the decided cases is congruent with the path the Commission has followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b756-10\">Accordingly, because the Commission did not act in an arbitrary and capricious manner in denying Belco\u2019s request, and because a contrary result is not mandated by the Constitution, the statute, and the philosophy underlying the relevant judicial precedent, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-11\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b746-14\">.

[Statutory citations omitted.] No such provision was inserted in the statute here under consideration. It is argued that it is as reasonable to make the rates retroactive to the beginning of the suspension period as to the end thereof. The answer is that Congress made express provision for the refund of the excess portion of rates collected after the expiration of the suspension period but made no provision whatever for collecting any additional amount for the period of suspension.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b752-6\">. That it does so does not render \u00a7 4(e) constitutionally defective. <em>Hope Natural Gas Co. v. FPC, </em>196 F.2d 803, 808 (4th Cir. 1952); <em>see FPC v. Tennessee Gas Transmission Co., </em>371 U.S. 145, 152-53, 83 S.Ct. 211, 9 L.Ed.2d 199 (1962). Nor is the fact that a producer may have a contract with the consumer relevant. It is true that a regulatory scheme of the Natural Gas Act is premised on contractual agreements voluntarily devised between producer and consumer; these contracts are abrogated only for ' public necessity. <em>Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, </em>390 U.S. 747, 822, 88 S.Ct. 1344, 20 L.Ed.2d 312 (1968). Congress has concluded, however, that the public interest in protecting consumers from unreasonable charges justifies suspending the operation of such rates, in the Commission\u2019s discretion, for up to five months from the date of filing. The policy concern is present regardless of whether the producer has a contract with the consumer. Indeed, it is well settled that the contract regulating the relationship between producer and consumer is distinct from the service the producer provides and that the contract may, at times, be subject to checks imposed by the regulatory scheme. See Sunray Mid-Continent <em>Oil Co. v. FPC, </em>364 U.S. 137, 153, 80 S.Ct. 1392, 4 L.Ed.2d 1623 (1960).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b753-6\">. This point is well made by the court of appeals in <em>Hope Natural Gas Co. </em>v. <em>FPC, </em>196 F.2d 803, 809 (4th Cir. 1952):</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">Any loss sustained by a maintenance of the status quo [i. e., by suspension] while such determination [of the reasonableness of a proposed rate increase] is being made is properly considered, not as a violation of a constitutional right, but as a necessary incident of rate regulation so long as the period of suspension does not \u201coverpass the bounds of reason.\u201d See <em>American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. v. United States, </em>229 (299) U.S. 232, 247, 57 S.Ct. 170, 177, 81 L.Ed. 142</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b753-8\">. Here again the reasoning of <em>Hope Natural Gas Co. v. FPC, </em>196 F.2d 803 (4th Gir. 1952) is instructive:</p>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">It is argued that since the rates allowed by the Commission were found to be reasonable with reference to a test year which ended just before the beginning of the suspension period, there is as much reason in making the rates applicable during the following period when the rates which had been suspended were in effect. <em>This however, was a matter for Congress and not for the Commission or the courts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b753-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 808 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b753-11\">. [The-following discussion is not concurred in by the other two members of this panel.]</p>\n<p id=\"b753-12\">An example of the application of policies underlying the Commission\u2019s exercise of discretion under \u00a7 4(e) is illustrated by the considerations suggested by the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-13\">A producer who files a proposed rate that is subsequently adjudged by the Commission to be a just and reasonable rate is nonetheless deprived of that rate during the suspension period that the Commission invokes in the exercise of its \u00a7 4(e) power. Owing to the likelihood that the Commission will order a refund if a proposed rate is in excess of the just and reasonable rate, a producer now stands to gain very little from filing a rate he believes to be outside the zone of reasonableness. A producer may, of course, file a rate he knows to be somewhat higher than the Commission is likely to approve, but such a decision at the present time is probably prompted by the not inconceivable chance that within the very broad range of reasonableness the Commission will approve a rate on the higher end of the zone. A just and reasonable rate is not a product of any single formula, but is instead a rate within a broad ambit of various rates which may be just and reasonable <em>See, e. g., Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, </em>390 U.S. 747, 767, 88 S.Ct. 1344, 20 L.Ed.2d 312 (1968); <em>FPC v. Hope Natural Gas Co., </em>320 U.S. 591, 602, 64 S.Ct. 281, 88 L.Ed. 333 (1944); <em>FPC v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co., </em>315 U.S. 575, 585-86, 62 S.Ct. 736, 86 L.Ed. 1037 (1942). Thus, any current tendency to propose a somewhat higher rate is more a function of a strategically-based hope for a higher legitimate return than a rationally-based expectation of future <em>illegitimate </em>gain. If, however, a producer were permitted to offset the income denied him during the suspension period against his refund obligation, the producer would then have an incentive to file a rate in excess of what he knows is a just and reasonable rate <em>because </em>of a rationally-based expectation of future illegitimate gain. That is, if the Commission\u2019s investigation of the proposed rate lasts longer than the suspension period (a not uncommon occurrence), then the producer would be allowed to collect the unreasonable rate and divert some of it to his own use, knowing that he will be able to offset some of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>this excess against income denied him during the suspension period.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Allowing an offset, as Belco requests, would tend to encourage unreasonably high filings with an eye toward generating a fund with which suspension period rates could, in effect, be increased, thereby diminishing or eliminating altogether the refund due consumers. The Commission could reduce or avoid this tendency by exercising its option to suspend for one day only. But while this might reduce the incentive to file excessive rates, it would place a burden on the Commission\u2019s exercise of its discretion and sacrifice the additional consumer interest, evident in the <em>Hunt- Oil </em>analysis above, in being free from increased rates for the maximum allowable period while the Commission is consid\u00e9ring the validity of the increase. Congress has determined that the risk of harm to the public of paying excessive rates \u2014 absent the additional incentives to file such rates inherent in an offset procedure \u2014 justifies the use of a five month suspension period. This delicate balance would be disrupted if producers were encouraged to file excessive rates, or alternatively, if consumers are denied the protection of an up-to-five-month suspension period.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Of course, the offset procedure proposed by Belco would not impact consumers in the same manner as a pure retroactive increase. See <em>Indiana &amp; Michigan Elec. Co. v. FPC, </em>163 U.S.App.D.C. 334, 336, 502 F.2d 336, 344 (1974), cert. <em>denied, </em>420 U.S. 946, 95 S.Ct. 1326, 43 L.Ed.2d 424 (1975). Belco\u2019s procedure would not require customers to make direct payments to Belco. It would, however, reduce the refund payment to consumers, a refund prompted by the imposition of an illegal rate on those customers. This impact would no doubt be less than that incurred by the customers in <em>Indiana &amp; Michigan Electric, </em>but the disruption to a balanced regulatory scheme would still be significant simply because an offset procedure would force the Commission to sacrifice one or the other of the public interests served by the suspension power.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b754-11\">. <em>Gillring\u2019s </em>offset procedure can be factually distinguished from that proposed by Belco. In the years that Gillring\u2019s prices were below the ceiling prices, the Commission was not restricting the upward movement of the prices in any way. Rather, the price was that voluntarily devised by the regulated companies, disturbance of which is not countenanced unless demanded by public necessity. 566 F.2d at 1324; <em>see Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, </em>390 U.S. 747, 822, 88 S.Ct. 1344, 20 L.Ed.2d 312 (1968). In this case, the bargain of the parties, which will not be disturbed unless harmful to the consumers, was suspended for five months and Belco seeks an indirect reparation for its inability to collect its increased rate during that period. The distinction, however, does not alter the fact that the offset procedure in both cases \u201cdefies plain arithmetic\u201d and flouts \u201cthe filed rate doctrine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b754-12\">An offset procedure similar to the one proposed in <em>Gillring </em>was also rejected in <em>Phillips Petroleum Co., </em>41 F.P.C. 415, 417 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
