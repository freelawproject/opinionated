Specifically, appellant complains that information in the file, compiled by SBA during an internal security check on him, has been revealed to a former SBA employee to aid the latter in his claim of employment discrimination against the agency. Appellant seeks an injunction against continued use of the file, and a judicial determination that some of the material incorporated therein is false and should be expunged or amended. The District Court entered a summary judgment dismissing appellant\u2019s action on the ground that he had failed to exhaust administrative remedies.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b786-9\">On May 25, 1976, and again on June 7 following, appellant wrote to SBA\u2019s Director of Personnel, asking that information allegedly obtained from his security file be removed from his former fellow employee\u2019s equal employment opportunity file. The agency\u2019s Privacy Act Officer and its Director of Personnel advised appellant that the data at issue were not contained in records under the control of the Office of Personnel, and that this precluded them from acting on appellant\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-17\">Thereafter, on August 5, appellant initiated the present suit. Appellees moved to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment, on the ground, <em>inter alia, </em>that appellant had not pursued his administrative recourse as required by the Privacy Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Several procedural motions then followed in rapid succession. In order to provide an opportunity for discovery, appellant sought, and the District Court granted, an extension of the period within which to respond to appellees\u2019 motion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellees countered by requesting a protective order staying discovery pending disposition of the motion for judgment of dismissal. Appellant then filed an opposition to this motion and asked for a further extension of time, again on the basis of need for discovery. Due to a clerical error, the last motion was not transmitted to the court prior to its ruling on appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Pursuant to its Rule l-l(d),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the court interpreted appellant\u2019s apparent silence as acquiescence in the motion for judgment and, on September 30, 1976, accordingly ruled in appellees\u2019 favor.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b786-18\">Appellant then filed a timely motion to vacate the outstanding judgment and for reconsideration of his previously overlooked request for a second extension of time. On June 23, 1977, the District Court held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>appellant\u2019s purported need for discovery did not constitute good cause, as required by Rule 6(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and denied the sought-after extension of time.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> At the same time, the court denied appellant\u2019s motion to vacate the September 30, 1976, judgment on the ground that appellant had not exhausted his administrative remedies.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">Under the Privacy Act, appellant was entitled to ask SBA for \u201can amendment of a record pertaining to him.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> He did so and his request was denied. He was not, however, told that he could appeal that determination within the agency, nor was he apprised of the established procedures for administrative review. Thus SBA did not comply with the mandate of the Privacy Act that it \u201cinform\u201d him not only \u201cof its refusal to amend the record in accordance with his request\u201d and \u201cthe reason for the refusal,\u201d but also of <em>\u201cthe procedures established by the agency for the individual to request a review of that refusal by the head of the agency or an officer designated by the head of the agency, and the name and business address of that official.\u201d </em><footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ak6\">Because, as appellees concede,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> there is no record that Harper was advised of the administrative review procedure, he should not be penalized for bypassing it. His lack of knowledge of the appropriate channels of administrative review could have led him to forego that review \u2014 which might have afforded him relief \u2014 and that in turn deterred the District Court from reaching the merits of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-15\">SBA\u2019s failure to inform appellant of his right to administrative review aligns this case with our recent decision in <em>Hall v. United States Civil Service Commission.</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>And SBA has expressed its willingness to now provide appellant with that , review.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> To this end, the judgment appealed from is reversed and the case is remanded to the District Court with instructions to retain jurisdiction pending further consideration of appellant\u2019s claims by the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-16\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b786-11\">.
