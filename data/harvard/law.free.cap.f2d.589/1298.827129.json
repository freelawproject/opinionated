Smith executed an installment note and granted the Bank a security interest in the van. The certificate of title issued by the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles listed Smith as the owner and the Bank as the first lienholder of the van.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-10\">Thereafter the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) made an assessment of unpaid taxes against Smith and filed notices of a tax lien. After unsuccessful efforts at collection, the IRS seized the van. In accordance with 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6335, it gave notice of the seizure to Smith, and posted notice of sale at two locations in South Bend and in a South Bend newspaper. These notices offered for sale \u201conly the right, title, and interest of Thomas J. Smith/Re Mod Construction\u201d and correctly described the van except for the model year, which was incorrectly listed as 1970. The van was sold by sealed bid for $1,000 to Raymond Norris, and the IRS issued to Norris a certificate of sale. This certificate stated that \u201call right, title and interest of the taxpayer shown [Thomas J. Smith d/b/a Re Mod Construction] in and to the property described\u201d was transferred to Norris. On the basis of this certificate and in accordance with 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6339(a)(5),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles issued a certificate of title to Norris. Neither the application nor the certificate of title showed any lienholder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-15\">Norris subsequently sold the van for $2,500 to Bobby Acrey, who applied for and was issued a certificate of title by the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles. This certificate of title showed Valley Bank and Trust Company as the first lienholder. The prior lien of National Bank and Trust was not shown oh the certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-16\">National Bank and Trust filed a wrongful levy action against the United States under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7426(a)(1). Also named as defendants were Norris, Smith, and Ralph Van Natta, Commissioner of the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles. Defendants Acrey and Valley Bank and Trust Company were subsequently added by amended complaint. The Bank filed a motion for summary judgment, and all the defendants except Norris filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The district court granted the cross-motion of the defendant United States, finding that the IRS had no duty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1301\">*1301</page-number>give notice of the tax sale in writing to the Bank and that the mis-description of the van in the notices as a 1970 model was not a substantial defect which would invalidate the sale. The court also found no violation of the Bank\u2019s due process rights; it noted the power of the IRS to seize property for the collection of revenues and stated there was no taking of the Bank\u2019s property since its interest as a senior lienholder was unaffected by the seizure and sale. Finding no remaining federal question or constitutional claim, the court concluded the remaining claims would be more properly resolved in a state court and accordingly dismissed the claims against the other five defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-5\">On appeal, the Bank asserts that a wrongful levy occurred through the operation of \u00a7 6339(a)(5), which by voiding the prior certificate of title also automatically destroyed the Bank\u2019s lien \u2014 that is, the certificate of sale issued to Norris resulted in the sale to him of all interest in the van, including the Bank\u2019s security interest, not just the taxpayer\u2019s (Smith\u2019s) interest. This result, it alleges, violated its due process rights because proper notice was not given before its property was taken. The Bank asserts that the rights of an innocent third party are entitled to more protection than those of a delinquent taxpayer, and that the giving of proper notice to interested parties can be accomplished without an excessive additional administrative burden. The Bank also argues that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing the pendent claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-6\">The government as appellee argues that the Bank is not entitled to relief either on the basis of a wrongful levy/due process violation, or on the basis of a statutory right to written notice as the owner of the van under \u00a7 6335. The government argues that there was no wrongful levy because nothing was seized and sold but the taxpayer\u2019s interest; thus, since no interest of the Bank was taken by the government, no basis for a due process challenge by the Bank exists. The government concludes, therefore, that the district court lacked jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-13\">In addition, the government argues that the Bank was not an owner of the van but a lienholder; thus, it was not entitled by statute to notice beyond publication. The government maintains that the notice given was sufficient in spite of the model year error. While admitting that the Bank\u2019s interest as a lienholder may have been seriously impaired, the government argues that any impairment was not the result of the issuance by the IRS of the certificate of sale, but instead was the result of the issuance of a lien-free certificate of title by the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles. The government states that the Bank\u2019s construction of \u00a7 6339(a)(5) would impute an unconstitutional intent to Congress and is inconsistent with the case law, statutes, and treasury regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-14\">We hold at the outset that the allegations made by the Bank properly invoked jurisdiction of the claim against the United States under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7426(a)(1). The Bank alleges that its perfected security interest was effectively destroyed by the seizure and sale of the van by the IRS under \u00a7\u00a7 6331-6339 and particularly through the operation of \u00a7 6339(a)(5). The government admits that if a seizure and sale does in effect destroy or irreparably injure an interest in property, that result is a proper basis for a wrongful levy action. This principle is embodied in the Internal Revenue regulations. Treas.Reg. \u00a7 301.7426-l(b)(l) (d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Whether a wrongful levy actually occurred in this case is, of course, a separate question from the propriety of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-15\">The Bank states that the basic issue on appeal is the constitutional adequacy of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1302\">*1302</page-number>notice it received of the seizure and sale. We cannot agree. Before the notice issue is reached, there must be a finding that the Bank was an owner of the van and thus entitled by statute to written notice, or that an interest of the Bank was taken by the IRS. The determination of whether an interest of the Bank was taken rests ultimately on a determination of the proper construction of \u00a7 6339(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-4\">We conclude first that the Bank was not an owner of the van under Indiana law. The Supreme Court has stated that the federal tax lien law defines federal consequences to rights created by state law; it is thus necessary to look at state law to determine the property interests involved. <em>Aquilino v. United States, </em>363 U.S. 509, 80 S.Ct. 1277, 4 L.Ed.2d 1365 (1960). <em>See also Crow v. Wyoming Timber Products, </em>424 F.2d 93 (10th Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-5\">The Indiana statutes define the owner of a motor vehicle as a person who holds the legal title, or a conditional vendee or lessee or mortgagor with an immediate right of possession. Ind.Code Ann. \u00a7 9-1-1-2. This definition is made applicable to chapters 1 through 4 of title 9, which cover, among other things, the requirements for issuance and transfer of certificates of title. The definition is therefore appropriate in the present situation and it compels the conclusion that the interest of the Bank is that of the holder/owner of the <em>lien, </em>not the van. Therefore, the Bank had no statutory right to written notice of the seizure and sale under \u00a7 6335. Furthermore, seizure of the van was not by itself a taking of the Bank\u2019s property. It is the- impact of the seizure and sale on the Bank\u2019s interest as lienholder that we must consider in determining if there was a wrongful levy. Only if that interest is taken or destroyed by virtue of \u00a7 6339(a)(5) do we reach the due process implications of the notice given.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1366-7\">As early as 1890, the Supreme Court recognized that a certificate issued at a tax sale transferred only the interest of the delinquent taxpayer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1366-8\">\u201cIf Congress intended to invest the collector with authority to sell, by the summary process of notice and publication, the interest of any other person than the delinquent distiller, the statute would have prescribed a certificate that would pass the interest of such person in the property sold. The provision that the certificate of purchase shall pass the interest of the delinquent in the property sold by the collector excludes, by necessary implication, the interest of any other person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1366-9\"><em>Mansfield v. Excelsior Refining Co., </em>135 U.S. 326, 340,10 S.Ct. 825, 830, 34 L.Ed. 162 (1890), <em>quoted in Blacklock v. United States, </em>208 U.S. 75, 28 S.Ct. 228, 52 L.Ed. 396 (1908). This principle is still recognized today. <em>See e. g., United States v. Sage, </em>566 F.2d 1114, 1115 (9th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-10\">This long-standing principle must be kept in mind in a determination of the proper construction of \u00a7 6339(a)(5). In addition, \u00a7 6339(a)(5) is a corollary to \u00a7 6339(a)(2) and the two provisions should be construed consistently if possible. Section 6339(a)(2) states that the certificate of sale for personal property transfers \u201call right, title, and interest of the party delinquent in and to the property sold.\u201d This provision is followed by the word \u201cand\u201d and several provisions relating to the specific types of property. Thus, when subsection (5) refers to \u201csuch transfer,\u201d its reference is to subsection <em>(2) </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>the transfer of only the taxpayer\u2019s interest. In addition, the authority granted by \u00a7 6339(a)(5) is to record the transfer \u201cas if the certificate of title . . . were transferred or assigned by the party holding the same.\u201d The stated intent of \u00a7 6339(a)(5) was to \u201ckeep the public records of title to motor vehicles in proper order.\u201d H.Rep. No. 1337 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1303\">*1303</page-number>[1954] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 4017, 4559 (83d Cong., 2d Sess.). Section 6339(a)(5) does alter the Indiana statutory scheme for transfer of title by eliminating the requirement that applications for new title and transfers of title be accompanied by the previous certificate of title. Ind. Stat.Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 9-1-2-1, 9-1-2-2. However, the language of \u00a7 6339(a)(5) quoted above, especially when construed in conjunction with the accepted effect of a tax sale previously discussed and the stated legislative intent, manifest an intent to supersede state law through operation of the supremacy clause only as far as necessary to transfer the taxpayer\u2019s interest in the property. To construe the section as authorizing the destruction of a lienholder\u2019s interest is clearly beyond this intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-5\">Our construction of \u00a7 6339(a)(5) is consistent with \u00a7 6331(a); the regulations, Treas. Reg. \u00a7 301.6335-l(c)(4)(iii), and the printed matter on the notice of sale, Treas. Form 2434 \u2014 A, and the certificate of sale, Treas. Form 2435. All of the above refer to the subject of the levy and sale as the right, title, and interest of the taxpayer. The regulations and notice of sale state specifically <em>only </em>that right, title, and interest is offered for sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-6\">We thus conclude that the Bank\u2019s construction would impute to Congress an intent clearly not present in comparable provisions of the tax law, and we hold that construction incorrect. The authority granted under \u00a7 6339(a)(5) is to record the transfer of the taxpayer\u2019s interest in the vehicle and to void the prior certificate showing the taxpayer\u2019s interest, not to void any lien showing on the prior certificate. The latter would be an intrusion into property rights that is neither necessary under the tax sale procedure, nor consistent with prior construction of similar statutes or the government\u2019s intention as stated in the regulations, notices, and certificate of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-7\">This construction of \u00a7 6339(a)(5) is further supported by contrasting the levy procedures of \u00a7 6331 <em>et seq. </em>with the judicial proceeding authorized under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7403. Under \u00a7 7403, the district court is expressly empowered to finally determine all claims to the property involved, <em>i. e., </em>the interests involved extend beyond those of the taxpayer. In these circumstances Congress has recognized a need for protection of third-party interests and has required that all persons with liens on or claims of interest in the property be made parties to the action. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7403(b). The absence of a similar requirement under the levy procedures implies that no disturbance of third-party interests was intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-11\">We further conclude that the actions of the IRS in this situation did not in effect destroy or irreparably injure the Bank\u2019s interest in the van.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We have concluded that the authority granted by \u00a7 6339(a)(5) is limited to the voiding of the prior certificate of title and recording of the transfer as to the taxpayer\u2019s interest in the property. There is no assertion that the IRS actions were in any way inconsistent with this construction, i. e., that any representation was made that any interest other than the taxpayer\u2019s was involved. Thus for a wrongful levy to have occurred, some unusual circumstances, comparable to those which existed or were of concern in prior cases where , wrongful levy actions were held proper,'; would have to exist here. For example, in \u2022 <em>Citizens Bank &amp; Trust of Md. v. United States, </em>344 F.Supp. 866 (D.Md.1972), money , in the taxpayer\u2019s bank account was levied f on and paid out to the government, leaving , nothing for the lienholder. In <em>Little </em>River <em>Farms, Inc. v. United States, </em>328 F.Supp. 476 (N.D.Ga.1971), the plaintiff was a judg- \u00a1 ment creditor whose interest was therefore <em>{ </em>not in a specific piece of property and who would have had to follow numerous items \u00a1 of personalty in separate actions. And in , <em>Ala. Exchange Bank v. United States, </em>373 F.Supp. 1221 (M.D.Ala.1974), the <em>court, </em>seemed concerned with the consequences of j extreme situations such as sale of the prop-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1304\">*1304</page-number>,o a habitual criminal who would not realistic source of collection. We note c the decision in <em>Ala. Exchange Bank </em>as a denial of a motion to dismiss; the plaintiff would still be required to prove its allegation of wrongful levy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-3\">These situations can be contrasted with the circumstances in <em>Pargament </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>272 F.Supp. 553 (S.D.N.Y.1967), where the plaintiff was the holder of a purchase money mortgage on plant and fixtures which were seized and sold at a tax sale. The court disallowed the wrongful levy claim, noting that the senior mortgage was unaffected by the tax sale and that the plaintiff, who had actual notice of and a representative present at the sale, had neglected to protect its own interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-4\">We find no circumstances here which support a conclusion that the Bank\u2019s interest in the van was in practical effect destroyed by the issuance of a certificate of sale by the IRS. The van continued to exist as a source of collection after the sale. Although the failure of the Bank to appear as lienholder on the certificate of title issued to Norris was the cause of the impairment of its interest, this result was not mandated by the provisions of \u00a7 6339(a)(5). In addition, under Indiana case law a certificate of title is only evidence, not conclusive proof, of actual title, and a bank which complied with the statutory requirements for recording liens has been allowed to recover a vehicle from an innocent subsequent purchaser. <em>Central Finance Co. of Peru, Inc. </em>v. <em>Garber, </em>121 Ind.App. 27, 97 N.E.2d 503 (1951). <em>See also United States v. City of New York, </em>233 F.2d 307, 310 (2d Cir. 1956) (federal statutory provision as to interest conveyed at tax sale takes precedence over erroneous recitation of same in deed). Finally, under Ind.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 9-1-2-1, the Bureau of Motor Vehicles is required to use \u201creasonable diligence\u201d in determining the truth of the facts contained in an application for a certificate of title.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1368-6\">Since the interest of the Bank was neither taken nor destroyed by the IRS issuance of a certificate of sale, we do not reach any question of the adequacy of notice to the Bank in the context of due process requirements. <em>See Herndon v. United States, </em>501 F.2d 1219,1220, n. 4 (8th Cir. 1974) (wife\u2019s homestead interest not conveyed by tax sale of property held in husband\u2019s name only; thus, no violation of due process rights). Notice by publication was all that was required under \u00a7 6334(b), and the model year error was not a defect which harmed the Bank\u2019s interest as lien-holder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-7\">Finally, we hold that the dismissal of the claims against the five defendants other than the United States was proper. The Bank summarizes its claims against these defendants as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-8\">(1) Against Smith, for default on the contract with the Bank;</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-9\">(2) Against Norris, on the basis that he purchased no more than the taxpayer\u2019s interest and had constructive notice of the Bank\u2019s interest because of the original certificate of title;</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-10\">(3) Against Acrey, on the basis that he purchased only the taxpayer\u2019s interest and had constructive notice of the Bank\u2019s interest because \u00a7 6339(a)(5) is unconstitutional, and the tax sale was void and thus Norris had nothing to sell;</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-11\">(4) Against Van Natta, on the basis that the federal statute under which he acted is unconstitutional and he acted beyond the scope of his authority;</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-12\">(5) Against Valley Bank and Trust, on the basis that it could not acquire an interest in the van greater than of its debtor Acrey, and it had constructive notice of the Bank\u2019s interest since \u00a7 6339(a)(5) is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-13\">Appellant\u2019s Brief at 21-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-14\">The district court dismissed these claims under the guidelines provided for the discretionary exercise of pendent jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1305\">*1305</page-number>under <em>United Mine Workers of America v. Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. 715, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-5\">The parties have devoted their arguments here to the propriety of that exercise of discretion. We have no doubt that the court did not abuse its discretion under the <em>Gibbs </em>guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-6\">We do note that the so-called pendent state claims ran against parties other than the United States the only defendant specified in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7426. Where that is true, pendent or ancillary jurisdiction cannot be found without further inquiry into the intent of Congress in conferring jurisdiction of the federal claim. <em>See Aldinger v. Howard, </em>427 U.S. 1, 96 S.Ct. 2413, 49 L.Ed.2d 276 (1976); <em>Owen Equipment &amp; Erection Co. v. Kroger, </em>437 U.S. 365, 98 S.Ct. 2396, 57 L.Ed.2d 274 (1978). The parties have not argued the impact of <em>Aldinger </em>and <em>Owen </em>on the question of jurisdiction of the state law claims in this case. In the posture of the case, we need not consider such impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-7\">The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1364-12\">. Section 6339(a) Certificate of Sale of Property Other Than Real Property. \u2014 In all cases of sale pursuant to section 6335 of property (other than real property), the certificate of such sale</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-13\">(2) As conveyances. \u2014 Shall transfer to the purchaser all right, title, and interest of the party delinquent in and to the property sold; and (5) As authority for transfer of title to motor vehicle. \u2014 If such property consists of a motor vehicle, shall be notice, when received, to any public official charged with the registration of title to motor vehicles, of such transfer and shall be authority to such official to record the transfer on his books and records in the same manner as if the certificate of title to such motor vehicle were transferred or assigned by the party holding the same, in lieu of any original or prior certificate, which shall be void, whether canceled or not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1365-7\">. The stated purpose of \u00a7 7426(a)(1) was to provide a remedy, via suit against the government, when the property levied on and sold is other than the taxpayer\u2019s. S.Rep. No. 1708 [1966] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 3722, 3751-52 (89th Cong., 2d Sess.). The regulations are not inconsistent with this objective; if the interest of a person other than the taxpayer is in effect destroyed by the proceeding, the result is the same as if that person\u2019s interest were actually taken. Thus, such a situation is entitled to the protection of \u00a7 7426(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1366-6\">. In <em>Ala. Exchange Bank v. United States, </em>373 F.Supp. 1221 (M.D.Ala. 1974), the court characterized the lienholder as the owner of the property involved to the extent of its lien and thus allowed the lienholder to sue for wrongful levy. The definition we choose does not strain the state law concepts of ownership or accepted principles of tax sales, but still allows consideration of the merits of a wrongful levy claim under the effective destruction rationale.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1367-8\">. Treas.Reg. \u00a7 301.7426-l(b)(l)(d) lists the following as factors to be considered in this determination: nature of the property, number of purchasers, value of each item sold, increase in costs of collection, and percentage of property available for payment sold at the tax sale.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1368-5\">. Admittedly the Bank\u2019s options for collection have been considerably complicated in the course of events. We express no opinion on the cause of any impairment of the Bank\u2019s interest beyond our conclusion that it was not a necessary result of the actions of the IRS.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
