Its accounts are insured by appellee Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (\u201cFSLIC\u201d) pursuant to Title IV of the National Housing Act of 1934 (the \u201cNHA\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The FSLIC is an agency of the United States as defined by APA subsection 551(1).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It operates under the direction of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (the \u201cBoard\u201d), an independent agency of the United States in the Executive Branch. The Board was given plenary authority to charter, regulate and supervise federal savings and loan associations by the Home Owners\u2019 Loan Act of 1933.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-15\">The regulations involved in this case are Insurance Regulations 563.17-1<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 571.2,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> issued by FSLIC, and Bulletin PA-7a,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> issued by the Board\u2019s Office of Examinations and Supervision (\u201cOES\u201d). The procedural validity of Regulation 563.17-1 is uncontested. This regulation largely restates the comprehensive, discretionary authority granted to FSLIC by 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1726(b) (1976). It provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that each FSLIC-insured institution \u201cshall be audited at least once in each calendar year by auditors and in a manner satisfactory to [FSLIC] in accordance with general policies from time to time established by the Board <em>tl</em></p>\n<p id=\"b725-17\">Challenged Regulation 571.2: (1) requires that insured institutions \u201cmust satisfy the audit requirement of \u00a7 563.17-l(a) . . . by means of an audit by a public accountant or internal auditor\u201d (12 C.F.R. \u00a7 571.2(b)); (2) specifies in considerable detail criteria that must be met before an audit or an auditor will be satisfactory to FSLIC (12 C.F.R. \u00a7 571.2(c)); and, (3)'delegates the agency\u2019s broad authority over such matters to the Chief Examiner of the district in which an insured institution\u2019s home office is located (12 C.F.R. \u00a7 571.2(d)). In addition, Regulation 571.2 contains a provision allowing an insured institution to seek a waiver from burdensome audit requirements that may be granted in the discretion of the Chief Examiner (12 C.F.R. \u00a7 571.2(e)). The regulation also indicates that additional specifications for audits or auditors may be issued from time to time by OES or by the Chief Examiner (12 C.F.R. \u00a7 571.2(d)(1)). OES Bulletin PA-7a is ope such directive. It details criteria that auditors must meet in order to be satisfactory to FSLIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>The District Court dismissed Guardian\u2019s complaint, ruling that the challenged regulations had been validly promulgated without notice and comment procedures. We affirm. We have concluded that the challenged regulations come within APA subsection 553(b)(A) and thus were exempted from the requirement for public notice and comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">Section 553 of the APA, set forth in the margin,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> prescribes the procedures that must be satisfied before a \u201crule\u201d within the APA definition may be promulgated.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The general policy of section 553 is to provide for public notice and comment procedures before the issuance of a rule. This public participation assures that the agency will have before it the facts and information relevant to a particular administrative problem, as well as suggestions for alternative solutions. Public rulemaking procedures increase the likelihood of administrative responsiveness to the needs and concerns of those affected. And the procedure for public participation tends to promote acquiescence in the result even when objections remain as to substance. Congress has, however, provided for a number of exceptions to notice and comment procedures. These accommodate situations where the policies promoted by public participation in rulemaking are outweighed by the countervailing considerations of effectiveness, efficiency, expedition and reduction in expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-18\">It is conceded that the challenged regulations are \u201crules\u201d within the definition of subsection 551(4).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Ordinarily such a concession would trigger the basic procedures governing \u201crule making\u201d set forth in sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>tion 553.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The issue here is whether the agency has demonstrated that this ease is governed by the exceptions to section 553.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">\n<em>FSLIC investigative powers</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">FSLIC argues that section 553 procedures are not applicable to rules encompassing audit specifications and auditor qualifications because they are regulations incidental to the exercise of FSLIC\u2019s investigative authority. The agency cites the following APA provision in section 555:</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">(c) Process, requirement of a report, inspection, or other investigative act or demand may not be issued, made, or enforced except as authorized by law. A person compelled to submit data or evidence is entitled to retain or, on payment of lawfully prescribed costs, procure a copy or transcript thereof, except that in a nonpublic investigatory proceeding the witness may for good cause be limited to inspection of the official transcript of his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">We see no relevance in subsection 555(c). Its purpose and effect is to afford certain procedural protections to a person subject to agency investigation, <em>i. </em>e., an assurance of lawfulness in the investigation, and the right to retain, procure, or at least inspect the data or evidence he has been compelled to submit.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">A point not argued by FSLIC but more troubling to the court stems from the cases that recognize a distinction between agency action that is subject to the APA, and the exercise of investigative authority that the APA was not intended to regulate.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> These decisions in effect imply a classification \u2014 of investigative acts \u2014 that is set apart from either adjudication or rule-making. The distinction is based not on the terms of the APA but, apparently, upon an implication, supported by a single reference in the legislative history,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and upon what might fairly be described as a sense of manifest and historically recognized need for agencies to be able to issue subpoenas and conduct other investigative activities without constraint of the procedural requirements that the APA established for essentially regulatory actions. Assuming the validity of the distinction, it may prove difficult to differentiate between regulatory actions that are subject to APA procedures and investigative activity that may have only incidental regulatory impact. In this case, however, it is clear that the challenged rules are regulatory in nature and thus within the compass of APA procedures. FSLIC has not required merely the production of a financial report,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> but rather has outlined with considerable specificity the actions that it expects the regulated industry to undertake in order to produce an audit report satisfactory to the agency. The APA definition of a rule specifically includes requirements bearing on accounting practices.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-24\">Again there may not always be a bright line between accounting rules and reporting requirements. However the regulations before us are fairly within the general catego<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>ry of prescription of accounting practices,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and the applicability of section 553 procedures is not to be gainsaid by a far-reaching expansion of a category of investigative activities that lie wholly outside the APA.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">\n<em>Subsection 553(a)(2): public contracts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A0t\">We note, but bypass, FSLIC\u2019s reliance on 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(a)(2), which excepts from the section 553 procedures \u201ca matter relating to agency management or personnel or to public property, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts.\u201d FSLIC argues first that the agreement between the agency and Guardian, which forms the foundation of the insurer/insured relationship, is a \u201ccontract\u201d within this exception,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and then that the exception of subsection 553(a)(2) extends not only to rules establishing the initial terms and conditions of the agreement, but also to all subsequent rules affecting the insured institutions.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We are doubtful whether the term \u201ccontract,\u201d as it is used in subsection 553(a)(2), reaches beyond the ordinary meaning of a bargained-for, voluntary agreement. To extend the exception to an agreement that is mandatory as this one is (NHA section 403),<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> would open the door to substantive regulation without pub-lie participation. However, we find it unnecessary to enter a formal ruling on the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-16\">\n<em>Subsection 553(b)(A): interpretative rules, general statements of policy, and rules of agency procedure</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b728-17\">This case turns on subsection 553(b), which provides in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b728-18\">Except when notice or hearing is required by statute, this subsection does not apply\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b728-19\">(A) to interpretative rules, general statements of policy, or rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b) (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-20\">1. Although the term \u201cinterpretative rule\u201d is not expressly defined by the APA, its essential meaning is readily distinguished from that of a \u201csubstantive\u201d or \u201clegislative\u201d rule. A substantive or legislative rule has the force of law; an interpretative rule is merely a clarification or explanation of an existing statute or rule.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The Attorney General\u2019s Manual defines interpretative rules as \u201crules or statements issued by an agency to advise the public of the agency\u2019s construction of the statutes and rules which it administers.\u201d <footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Judicial review of a sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>stantive or legislative rule is limited by the provisions of APA section 706, but a court is free to make an independent inquiry into the correctness or propriety of an interpretative rule, although substantial deference is accorded to the agency\u2019s interpretation.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Naturally there are instances when it is difficult to classify a given rule as substantive or interpretative. We find that in certain particulars the regulations in this case are clearly interpretative in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Regulation 563.17-1, promulgated with conceded procedural regularity,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> interprets the relevant provision of the NHA, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1726(b), as authorizing FSLIC to \u201cat any time make, or cause to be made, an audit of an insured institution\u201d to be conducted \u201cby auditors and in a manner satisfactory to [FSLIC] in accordance with general policies from time to time established by the Board.\u201d 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 563.17-1(a)(2). We agree with this interpretation of the statute. Subsection 1726(b) provides that insured institutions must \u201cpermit and pay the cost of such examinations as in the judgment of [FSLIC] may from time to time be necessary for its protection and the protection of other insured institutions . .\u201d The term \u201cexaminations\u201d encompasses not only \u201cbank examinations,\u201d a term of art that has developed over the years,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> but also such other financial investigations as FSLIC in its judgment deems necessary for its protection and the protection of other insured institutions. This includes audits required by Regulation 563.-17-l(a)(2). The statutory phrase requiring the institutions to \u201cpermit such examinations as in the judgment of [FSLIC] may . be necessary\u201d gives broad discretion to require audits by persons other than FSLIC staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">2. Challenged Regulation 571.2 requires that an insured institution \u201cmust satisfy the audit requirement of \u00a7 563.17-1(a) ... by means of an audit by a public accountant or internal auditor.\u201d In substance the FSLIC has exercised an option to require that audits be performed by accountants from the private sector. That option is given to the government by this provision in Regulation 563.17-l(a)(2): \u201c[FSLIC] may at any time make, <em>or cause to be made, </em>an audit of an insured institution. . . . \u201d (Emphasis supplied.) However, the instruction in Regulation 571.2 that audits be conducted exclusively by non-agency accountants is not an interpretative rule. It purports to change the course of agency policy. Nevertheless, it stays within the subsection 553(b)(A) exception because it is in essence a rule of \u201cagency . . procedure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-11\">When Regulation 571.2 was originally published it contained the introductory sentence; \u201cCommencing January 1, 1968 the Board\u2019s examiners will not include an audit in the scope of a periodic examination.\u201d 31 Fed.Reg. 5821 (1966). That sentence is unquestionably one of agency procedure. Since the regulation went on to state the necessary consequence of the new procedural rule, the introductory sentence was superfluous and has been deleted in the current regulation. Audits are still required by Regulation 563.17-1, and they will not be performed by staff auditors; thus, the insured institutions necessarily must \u201csatisfy the audit requirement ... by means of an audit by a public accountant or internal auditor.\u201d That provision, which remains unchanged in the challenged regu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>lation, is in substance no more than the procedural rule stated in terms of its inevitable result.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">Also procedural is the provision in Regulation 571.2 delegating authority from FSLIC to the Board\u2019s Chief Examiners for the various regional districts.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">3. What remains of the challenged regulations are the provisions that specify the criteria that audits and auditors must fulfill in order to produce an audit report \u201cin a manner satisfactory to [FSLIC].\u201d 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 563.17-l(a)(2). We conclude that these aspects of the regulations constitute \u201cgeneral statements of policy\u201d within APA subsection 553(b)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">The term \u201cgeneral statements of policy,\u201d has been explicated in the Attorney General\u2019s Manual as embracing \u201cstatements issued by an agency to advise the public prospectively of the manner in which the agency proposes to exercise a discretionary power.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> As this court has had occasion to note, a critical test of whether a rule is a general statement of policy is- its practical effect in a subsequent administrative proceeding: \u201cA general statement of policy does not establish a \u2018binding norm.\u2019 It is not finally determinative of the issues or rights to which it is addressed.\u201d <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. v. FPC, </em>164 U.S.App.D.C. 371, 376, 506 F.2d 33, 38 (1974). When the agency applies the policy in a particular situation, it must be prepared to defend it, and cannot claim that the matter is foreclosed by the prior policy statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">A general statement of policy that has not been issued under section 553 as a binding rule must leave the administrator free to exercise his informed discretion in the situations that arise. The challenged regulations in this case effectively preserve the administrator\u2019s discretion. Regulation 571.2, as it is supplemented by OES Bulletin PA-7a, does use directive language in specifying the criteria that audits and auditors must fulfill in order to produce an audit report that is satisfactory to the agency. However, Regulation 571.2(d)(1) states:</p>\n<p id=\"b730-14\">The Chief Examiner shall determine whether an auditor is satisfactory to [FSLIC], whether an audit was conducted in a manner satisfactory to [FSLIC], and whether a report of audit is to be accepted. If at any time, it is found that a public accountant or internal auditor has not followed recognized rules of ethics or conduct, was not in fact independent, has knowingly made any material misstatement of fact or circumstance or any material misrepresentation of any kind, or has otherwise failed to meet any of the requirements set out in this statement, in bulletins issued by the Office of Examinations and Supervision,[<footnotemark>27</footnotemark>] or in instructions issued by the Chief Examiner, the Chief Examiner <em>may </em>reject the audit</p>\n<p id=\"b730-15\">12 C.F.R. \u00a7 571.2(d)(1) (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-16\">While failure to comply with any of the agency\u2019s directives \u201cmay\u201d result in the rejection of the audit, the Chief Examiner has discretion to accept a non-conforming audit report, or for that matter to prescribe additional requirements in a particular case. The form of a regulation is obviously not controlling; substance and effect will determine whether a rule is a \u201cgeneral statement of policy.\u201d If it appears that a so-called policy statement is in purpose or likely effect one that narrowly limits administrative discretion, it will be taken for what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>it is \u2014 a binding rule of substantive law.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> In this case the record amply supports our determination that the administrative discretion of the Chief Examiner has been preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">In 1975, Guardian refused to comply with explicit directions in an OES bulletin outlining the nature of the accountant\u2019s \u201cengagement letter\u201d that was required for an audit to be acceptable to FSLIC.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The cognizant Chief Examiner notified Guardian that the 1975 audit would be unacceptable unless Guardian complied with the directive.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Guardian refused to comply. Instead, it had the nonconforming audit performed. The Chief Examiner, in an exercise of his discretion, accepted the audit report for 1975 while cautioning Guardian that its compliance with agency directives was expected in the future.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">The mandatory tone of the specifications for audits and auditors doubtless encourages compliance. However, an opportunity for an individualized determination is afforded. Nor is there merit to the argument that such specific and detailed requirements cannot qualify as a \u201cgeneral\u201d statement of policy. In the APA context, the term \u201cgeneral\u201d includes detailed \u25a0 requirements provided that they are of general as contrasted with particular applicability.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">The mere existence of some discretion is not sufficient, although it is necessary, for a rule to be classified as a general statement of policy. Thus, stringent substantive commands are not removed from section 553 because they have some provision for discretionary waiver.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> A matter of judgment is involved in distinguishing between rules, however discretionary in form, that effectively circumscribe administrative choice, and rules that contemplate that the administrator will exercise an informed discretion in the various cases that arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-10\">After taking into account several attributes of the challenged regulations, our judgment is that they qualify as general statements of policy within subsection 553(bXA). First, the agency\u2019s statutory discretion in these matters is extremely broad. The exercise of agency judgment is not dependent on a predicate of factual determinations that require information from outside the agency\u2019s area of expertise. Second, the challenged provisions have the quality of filling in the details of one aspect of a comprehensive regulatory framework; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>compulsory notice and comment procedures for all such matters would have the potential to mire the agency in fruitless delay, expense, and inefficiency. Further, the standards outlined by these -regulations are not unfamiliar, but are in large part reiterative of guidelines promulgated for the accounting profession by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The rules are not without some substantive impact, as appellant points out, but that alone does not undercut the conclusion that, in essence, they are general statements of policy.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">While it is our judgment that the exception for general statements of policy is applicable, the case is not wholly free from doubt. If the agency were to decide, in light of experience, that it wished to proclaim these rules as binding instructions, notice and comment would be appropriate. If the same result were reached without formality, but in the course of administrative application, so that the agency has prohibited latitude to deviate, the interests affected would at least have the opportunity to invoke subsection 553(e) of the APA to petition for a modification, an opportunity in effect to assure some agency consideration of comments. Even an agency rule adopted after notice and comment is subject to some opportunity for reconsideration.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> When there has been no procedure for comment in the first instance, a petition to modify may serve an appropriate objective. On the other hand, this is definitely not to be construed as an invitation or authority to an institution to file a petition every time it feels aggrieved by some policy or instruction. Otherwise institutions might file grievances every time they are treated either differently from other institutions (a claim of discrimination) or in the same way as other institutions (a claim that there is a binding instruction).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">The FSLIG must, as a practical matter, develop standard instructions and approaches. The institutions being supervised often have similar, if not identical, problems. The only difficulty that arises is a procedural problem when an agency proceeds, as here, without notice and comment and argues that all that is involved is a general statement of policy. It is to preserve that exception that emphasis is put on the discretion to deviate from the general policy in extraordinary cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">There is, at the end, a concern that this case makes a mountain out of a molehill, that all that is involved is some straightforward supervision of financial institutions, which is certainly necessary, and that actual examinations necessarily involve both general instructions to and individual discretion by examiners. Appellant\u2019s resistance to the \u201cburden\u201d of making payment for examinations by independent auditors does not merit such lengthy consideration. On the other hand, courts and agencies alike are controlled by the legislation pertaining to procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-10\">The fact that even this case, which at first blush seems to relate purely to a matter of mechanics, is identified as one that is not free from difficulty, and calls for judgment, leads us to advert to the observation of Congress: \u201cNone of these exceptions is to be taken as encouraging agencies not to adopt voluntary public rule making procedures where useful to the agency or beneficial to the public.\u201d <footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>own court, not bound by APA requirements, has adopted notice and comment practice even for its own procedural rules.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> This course was recommended by a reflective commission composed of members appointed by the President, the Chief Justice, and Congressional leaders.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> There is increasing recognition that opportunity for outside comment does enhance perspective, and has benefits that typically outweigh modest impediments to administration. An agency would acquire the additional advantage of avoiding both litigation and the risk of upset by a court taking a different view of the requirement for notice and comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b725-12\">. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b725-13\">. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1724 <em>et seq. </em>(1976).
