Although we rest our decision on a ground different from that relied upon by the district court, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b511-14\">The trustees of the estate of James Campbell (taxpayer) have been in the business of leasing trust owned land since 1901. Taxpayer\u2019s holdings included both industrial property being developed for lease, and improved agricultural land leased for sugar cane cultivation and livestock grazing. Taxpayer also owned a sea fishery adjacent to its agricultural property.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-15\">The state of Hawaii condemned taxpayer\u2019s sea fishery and various portions of taxpayer\u2019s agricultural property. Taxpayer used the condemnation proceeds to build a storm drainage and water system, grade land, and excavate a roadway in Campbell Industrial Park (the Park), trust owned land taxpayer was developing for lease to industrial concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-16\">The Internal Revenue Service did not consider these improvements to be replacement property under section 1033 and informed taxpayer that taxes would have to be paid on the condemnation proceeds. Taxpayer paid the additional taxes plus interest, in the amount of $106,050, filed a timely claim for refund, and upon denial of the claim, instituted this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-17\">The district judge granted a refund. 411 F.Supp. 964 (D.Hawaii 1976). He. found that, because Hawaii\u2019s historically plantation economy had changed to a mixed industrial, commercial, resort, and agricultural economy, little agricultural land in Hawaii was available for purchase, and no prospective agricultural tenants could be found who would be willing to pay the rent required to allow taxpayer a reasonable return on an investment in newly acquired agricultural land. Additionally, because Hawaii had a declared public policy of absorbing ownership of Hawaiian sea fisheries into the public domain, it was virtually impossible for taxpayer to reinvest in agricultural land with an adjacent sea fishery. The court further found that the risk attendant to taxpayer\u2019s investment in the Park was no different from the risk which would have been undertaken had taxpayer reinvested the condemnation proceeds in other agricultural property, that the cost to taxpayer of managing the industrial property was substantially the same as had been the cost of managing the condemned property, and that, since taxpayer did not provide substantial management services to either the industrial or agricultural tenants, the services provided at the Park were the same as those that taxpayer had provided to the agricultural tenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>As a result, the district court held that, by investing the condemnation proceeds in the Park, taxpayer had maintained a substantial continuation of its prior commitment of capital. Believing, however, that the improvements were not of the \u201csame general class\u201d as the condemned agricultural land, the court held that the improvements did not qualify for nonrecognition of gain as \u201cproperty similar or related in service or use\u201d within the meaning of section 1033(a)(3)(A).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rather, the court concluded that the improvements qualified for nonrecognition as property of \u201clike kind\u201d within the meaning of section 1033(g)(1),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and therefore granted the refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Pursuant to section 1033, gain realized because of the condemnation or other involuntary conversion of property is not recognized if the converted property is replaced by similar property within a specified time. Replacement property may qualify either under subsection (a) as property \u201csimilar or related in service or use,\u201d or under subsection (g) as property of \u201clike kind.\u201d We hold that given taxpayer\u2019s substantial continuation of its prior commitment of capital, the district court erred in concluding that improvements to the Park were not similar or related in service or use to its prior investment in agricultural land. Since we find that taxpayer qualifies for relief under subsection (a), we do not reach the question of whether the district court correctly granted relief under subsection (g)-<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-15\">While some investments may fall within the purview of both subsection (a) and subsection (g), the inquiries to determine the applicability of each subsection differ. Subsection (g) directs attention to the nature or character of the condemned property and its replacement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>section (a), however, we look to the taxpayer\u2019s relationship to his old and new investments.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Long ago, we established the proper analysis for determining the applicability of subsection (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">The test is a practical one. The trier of fact must determine from <em>all </em>the circumstances whether the taxpayer has achieved a sufficient continuity of investment to justify non-recognition of the gain, or whether the differences in the relationship of the taxpayer to the two investments are such as to compel the conclusion that he has taken advantage of the condemnation to alter the nature of his investment for his own purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"ABq\"><em>Filippini v. United States, </em>318 F.2d 841, 844-45 (9th Cir.) (discussing subsection (a)\u2019s identically worded predecessor in the 1939 code) (emphasis in original) (footnote omitted), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>375 U.S. 922, 84 S.Ct. 267, 11 L.Ed.2d 165 (1963), <em>aff\u2019g </em>200 F.Supp. 286 (N.D.Cal.1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\"><em>Filippini </em>requires that we consider a broad range of factors in determining whether a taxpayer has maintained a sufficient continuity of investment. When the taxpayer holds both the condemned and the replacement properties for the production of rental income, the inquiry specifically includes, among other things, \u201c \u2018the extent and type of the lessor\u2019s management activity, the amount and kind of services rendered by him to the tenants, and the nature of his business risks connected with the properties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Filippini v. United States, supra, </em>318 F.2d at 845 (quoting <em>Liant Record, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>303 F.2d 326, 329 (2d Cir. 1962)). We must also consider the more general factors that influence the choice of any investment \u2014 the character of the particular properties and the market of which each is a part. <em>Filippi-ni v. United States, supra, </em>318 F.2d at 845.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-11\">Applying this test to the facts in this case, we believe that taxpayer is entitled to relief under subsection (a). \u201c[WJhether the acquired property is \u2018similar or related in service or use\u2019 to the condemned property turns upon whether in all the circumstances it represents a substantial continuation of the taxpayer\u2019s prior commitment of capital, or a departure from it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 844. The district judge found \u201cthat the improvements made by the [taxpayer] represent a substantial continuation of [its] prior commitment of capital.\u201d We agree. Although taxpayer invested the condemnation pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>ceeds into its already owned industrial park rather than into agricultural land, taxpayer\u2019s relationship to its investments remained essentially the same. The district court found, and the government does not dispute, that the risk attendant to taxpayer\u2019s investment in the industrial park was not greater than the risk concomitant with an investment in agricultural land. Taxpayer\u2019s management also remained substantially the same, without great variance in cost or service. Moreover, given the change in the Hawaiian economy, reinvestment in agricultural property was unreasonable, and purchase of another sea fishery was virtually impossible. Thus, the district court did not err in concluding that taxpayer had substantially maintained a continuation of its prior commitment of capital.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">The government argues, however, that our decision in <em>Filippini </em>requires that the replacement property be of the \u201csame general class\u201d as the condemned property before it can qualify under subsection (a). In <em>Filippini, </em>the taxpayer purchased urban property and erected an office building using money received from the condemnation of substantially rural property. The district court compared the characteristics and uses of the two properties and, after finding that the properties were dissimilar and not even of the \u201csame general class,\u201d refused to allow nonrecognition of the taxpayer\u2019s gain. <em>Filippini v. United States, </em>200 F.Supp. 286, 294-95 (N.D.Cal.1961). While we affirmed the district court\u2019s judgment, we specifically rejected resolution of the issue by simplistic talismanic rules. Instead we adopted the test referred to earlier which compares all of the circumstances surrounding the two investments. That taxpayer\u2019s condemned agricultural land is not of the \u201csame general class\u201d as its improvements to the Park is thus not determinative. Rather, taxpayer\u2019s relationship to the two investments controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">The government also argues that the district court\u2019s determination regarding the continuation of taxpayer\u2019s prior commitment of capital is irrelevant because it pertains to taxpayer\u2019s relationship to the industrial park and not to the replacement property itself, i. e., the grading, excavation and other improvements to the Park. We reject the government\u2019s narrow construction of our test. The improvements to the Park have significance only as part of the Park, and their relationship to the taxpayer necessarily is a function of the investment in the industrial park as a whole. We therefore conclude that the district court\u2019s inquiry was not misdirected. As we have stated before, the purpose of section 1033 \u201cis to relieve the taxpayer of unanticipated tax liability arising from involuntary conversion of his property . . . . The statute is to be liberally construed to accomplish this purpose.\u201d <em>Filippini </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>318 F.2d at 844; <em>see also S.E. Ponticos, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>338 F.2d 477, 479 (6th Cir. 1964); <em>Loco Realty Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>306 F.2d 207, 215 (8th Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">The record amply demonstrates that taxpayer\u2019s investment of the condemnation proceeds represents a sufficient continuity of taxpayer\u2019s original investment. The improvements were therefore similar or related in service or use to the prior investment, and taxpayer is entitled to relief under section 1033(a). On that basis, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b512-6\">.

The Internal Revenue Service originally took the position that the statutory phrase, \u201csimilar or related in service or use\u201d meant that the property acquired had to have a close \u201cfunctional\u201d similarity to the property converted. Under this test the physical characteristics and the end use of the converted and replacement properties had to be similar. <em>See Loco Realty Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>306 F.2d 207, 211-14 (8th Cir. 1962). We and several other courts of appeals, however, rejected this approach. <em>Filippini v. United States, </em>318 F.2d 841, 844-45 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>375 U.S. 922, 84 S.Ct. 267, 11 L.Ed.2d 165 (1963); <em>Clifton Inv. Co. v.

The Service therefore reconsidered its position in regard to property held for investment, and now focuses attention on \u201cthe similarity in the relationship of the services or uses which the original and replacement properties have to the taxpayer-owner.\u201d Rev. Rul. 64-237, 1964-2 C.B. 319, 320. The tax court also adopted this test. <em>See Wheeler v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>58 T.C. 459, 463 (1972); <em>Johnson v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>43 T.C. 736, 741 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-13\">Since the tests under section 1033(a) and section 1033(g) differ, replacement property may qualify under the former but not the latter. For example, in Rev. Rul. 71-41, 1971-1 C.B. 223, the Service found that, while the gas station that the taxpayer constructed and held for rental purposes did not constitute property of \u201clike kind\u201d to the condemned land and warehouse held for rental purposes, the gas station was sufficiently similar to the condemned property to be considered \u201csimilar or related in service or use.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
