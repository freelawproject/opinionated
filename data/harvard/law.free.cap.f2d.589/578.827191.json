This court has jurisdiction to review the FCC\u2019s action under \u00a7 402(a) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-13\">Under the Communications Act a broadcaster must apply for renewal of its broadcast license every three years and the FCC must review its overall performance during the preceding term and determine whether \u201cthe public interest, convenience and necessity would be served\u201d by a renewal authorization. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 307(d). In requiring periodic renewal, Congress also provided for a competitive spur to existing licensees by affording new parties an opportunity to apply for the same license. <em>See </em>47 U.S.C. \u00a7 301; Report and Order, 66 FCC 2d at 420. It has been recognized, however, that there are \u201clegitimate renewal expectancies\u201d on the part of the license holders. <em>Greater Boston Television Corp. v. FCC,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>143 U.S.App.D.C. 383, 396, 444 F.2d 841, 854 (1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>403 U.S. 923, 91 S.Ct. 2229, 29 L.Ed.2d 701 (1971). In order to balance the need for a competitive spur with the legitimate renewal expectancies, the FCC adopted a <em>Policy Statement on Comparative Hearings Involving Regular Renewal Applicants ; </em>22 FCC 2d 424, <em>reconsideration denied, </em>24 FCC 838 (1970). Under the policy statement, a renewal applicant would be preferred over challengers if it provided substantial service with respect to the needs and interests of its service area. By <em>Notice of Inquiry, </em>the FCC instituted a proceeding to determine whether it should attempt to quantify the concept of substantial service. 27 FCC 2d 580 (1971). The result of that proceeding is presently under review.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-19\">In the <em>Notice, </em>\u201cpercentage guidelines\u201d were proffered as <em>prima facie </em>indicators of substantial service. The guidelines were:</p>\n<p id=\"b643-20\">(i) With respect to local programming, a range of 10-15% broadcast effort (including 10-15% in the prime time period 6-11 p. m., when the largest audience is available to watch).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-21\">(ii) The proposed figure for news is 8\u2014 10% for the network affiliate, 5% for the independent VHF station (including a figure of <em>8-10% </em>and 5% respectively in the prime time period).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-22\">(iii) In the public affairs area, the tentative figure is 3-5% with, as stated, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>a 3% figure for the 6-11 p. m. time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">27 FCC 2d at 582. Although the Commission expressed the view that percentage guidelines appeared to be useful and helpful, it also indicated that <em>ad hoc </em>review would still be necessary. <em>Id. </em>at 582-83. The FCC also indicated that the guidelines necessarily would have to be continually reviewed and revised. <em>Id. </em>at 583. The Commission stressed, however, that it was not committed to the percentage guideline approach and that it was still determining the feasibility of the guidelines and was open to other alternatives and suggestions. <em>Id. </em>at 585.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Six months after the <em>Notice </em>was issued this court invalidated the 1970 <em>Policy Statement </em>holding that the policy providing that qualifications of challengers might not be considered unless a licensee\u2019s performance was first deemed insubstantial was contrary to law. <em>Citizens Communications Center v. FCC, </em>145 U.S.App.D.C. 32, 41-45, 447 F.2d 1201, 1210 \u2014 14 (1971). The court recognized, however, that \u201clicensees should be judged primarily by their past performance\u201d and that \u201csuperior performance\u201d should entitle the license to a \u201cplus of major significance\u201d in a comparative renewal proceeding. 145 U.S.App.D.C. at 44, 447 F.2d at 1213. Accordingly, the court recommended that the FCC act through rulemaking proceedings to \u201cclarify in both quantitative and qualitative terms what constitutes superior service.\u201d 145 U.S.App.D.C. at 44 n.35, 447 F.2d at 1213 n.35. The court, however, did not imply that specific standards were required or that percentage guidelines were necessary. The matter was appropriately left to the agency\u2019s discretion in implementation.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Following the <em>Citizens Communication Center </em>decision, a <em>Further Notice of Inquiry </em>was issued by the FCC and interested parties were invited to comment on the appropriateness of the percentage figures set forth in the original notice in light of the court\u2019s decision. 31 FCC 2d 443 (1971). Two days of oral argument were held in 1972 and <em>Second and Third Further Notice(s) of Inquiry </em>were issued soliciting further comments. 43 FCC 2d 367, 1043 (1973). In April of 1977 the Commission issued its <em>Report and Order, supra. </em>The Commission concluded that it has the authority to promulgate quantitative standards for substantial service but declined to do so. 66 FCC 2d at 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">The Commission concluded that \u201cincreasing the amount of [local and informational] programming would not necessarily improve the service a station provides its audience.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 427. The FCC noted that a beneficial level of concreteness could not be obtained while allowing for the necessary degree of flexibility required. <em>Id. </em>at 427-28. The FCC expressed its concern that quantitative standards would restrict licensee discretion without any guarantee as to qualitative standards. <em>Id. </em>at 428-29. Thus, the Commission concluded that quantitative standards would not provide significantly greater certainty as to what constituted substantial service. <em>Id. </em>In sum, the Commission stated that quantitative standards \u201care a simplistic, superficial approach to a complex problem and we will not adopt them.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 429. For the future, the Commission indicated that it would review all elements of the renewal applicant\u2019s past performance in a comparative renewal proceeding, with a particular emphasis on the incumbent\u2019s responsiveness to the recognized problems, needs, and interests of the community. <em>Id. </em>at 430.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-10\">Petitioners ask this court to conclude, as a matter of law, that adoption of quantitative standards is compelled by the Communications Act and the First Amendment. Although petitioners present their case as a legal argument, they actually seek the impermissible substitution of their policy judgment for that of the Commission by this court. See <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 416, 91 S.Ct. 814, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971); <em>SEC v. Chenery Corp., </em>332 U.S. 194, 209, 67 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>1575, 91 L.Ed. 1995 (1947); <em>Action for Children\u2019s Television v. FCC, </em>183 U.S.App.D.C. 437, 457, 564 F.2d 458, 478 (1977). The standard for judicial review to be applied is whether the FCC\u2019s action was \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). This court must determine \u201cwhether the challenged action was based on \u2018consideration of the relevant factors\u2019 and is supported by a reasoned opinion.\u201d <em>Action for Children\u2019s Television, supra, </em>183 U.S.App.D.C. at 457, 564 F.2d at 478; <em>see Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc., supra, </em>401 U.S. at 416, 91 S.Ct. 814. This court also must conclude that the agency\u2019s action did not exceed its statutory and constitutional authority. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 706(2)(B), (C). From the record in this case it is readily apparent that the FCC action was reasonable and within its statutory and constitutional authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">The decision not to promulgate quantitative standards was a policy judgment traditionally left to agency discretion. Nothing in the Communications Act imposes any requirement that the FCC promulgate quantitative programming standards. In granting broadcast licenses the FCC must find that the \u201cpublic convenience, interest or necessity will be served thereby.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 307(a). Within these broad confines, the Commission is left with the task of particularizing standards to be used in implementing the Act. Thus, the petitioners\u2019 claim that the FCC\u2019s decision violated the requirements of the statute is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">As to petitioners\u2019 First Amendment claims, their approach would do more to subvert the editorial independence of broadcasters and impose greater restrictions on broadcasting than any duties or guidelines presently imposed by the Commission. The Act provides broadcasters with broad programming discretion and prohibits the Commission from exercising the power of censorship. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 326; <em>see FCC </em>v. <em>Pacifi-ca Foundation, </em>- U.S. -, --, 98 S.Ct. 3026, 57 L.Ed.2d 1073 (1978). In interpreting the Act, the Supreme Court has held that \u201cit seems clear that Congress intended to permit private broadcasting to develop with the widest journalistic freedom consistent with its public obligations.\u201d <em>Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Democratic National Committee, </em>412 U.S. 94, 110, 93 S.Ct. 2080, 2090, 36 L.Ed.2d 772 (1973). Petitioners claim that the lack of guidelines violates First Amendment principles because broadcasters are allegedly left to the \u201csubjective\u201d standards used in the <em>ad hoc </em>comparative renewal proceedings. In addition to the fact that the broadcasters themselves disagree with the petitioners, it is apparent that the limitation on the broadcasters\u2019 discretion that the guidelines would cause would not be balanced by a benefit of certainty or \u201cobjective\u201d standards in the comparative renewal process. As was indicated above, even if the percentage guidelines were adopted, an <em>ad hoc </em>hearing would be required to weigh the effect of other factors in each individual case. In addition, the quantitative guidelines would limit editorial discretion without any guarantee of improved service. Thus, the Commission\u2019s decision was within its constitutional authority and quantitative standards are not required by the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">It is readily apparent from the discussion of the Commission\u2019s decision, <em>supra, </em>that the agency made a policy judgment that was within its discretion. The FCC\u2019s action was based on an adequate record and its policy judgment was fully explained in its <em>Report and Order. </em>66 FCC 2d at 427 \u2014 30. On the basis of the record before the court, this court must conclude that the Commission\u2019s decision concerning quantitative program standards was reasonable and not arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">Finally, the petitioners seek a remand of this proceeding because they claim that the FCC failed to consider an alternative whereby a licensee\u2019s performance would be judged by the extent to which it reinvested its profits \u201cto the service of the viewing and listening public.\u201d Although the possibility of such a standard was suggested and comments were invited in the Commission\u2019s <em>Further Notice of Inquiry, </em>31 FCC 2d at 44, the FCC notes that no party to the proceedings posed reinvestment as an alternative. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>Instead, reinvestment was suggested as a modification to the percentage guidelines program. Because the program was not adopted, the possibility of reinvestment standards was not considered as an alternative. Thus, standards concerning reinvestment of profits, as an alternative to quantitative program standards, were not raised before or considered' by the Commission and therefore, the issue is not properly before this court for review. <em>Alianza Federal de Mercedes v. FCC, </em>176 U.S.App.D.C. 253, 260, 539 F.2d 732, 739 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">Having concluded that the FCC\u2019s action was a reasonable exercise of its discretion and not in excess of its statutory and- constitutional authority, the order of the Commission challenged by National Black Media Coalition, <em>et al. </em>is</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b643-16\">. In fact, the FCC has recommended to Congress that the comparative renewal process itself be abolished. See <em>Report of the Federal Communications Commission to the Subcommittee of Communications of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce [of the House of Representatives] Re the Comparative Renewal Process, </em>at p. 41 (November 1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b644-7\">. This court has recently stated that a licensee\u2019s lawful renewal expectancy in the context of a comparative renewal proceeding is confined to the \u201clikelihood that [it] will prevail in a fully comparative ' inquiry.\u201d <em>Central Florida Enterprises, Inc. v. FCC, </em>No. 76-1742, slip op. at 37 (D.C. Cir. 25 Sept. 1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
