Although advanced in a somewhat novel factual context, we find appellant\u2019s contentions to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-19\">On January 1, 1975, defendant Seidlitz assumed the position of Deputy Project Director for Optimum Systems, Inc. (OSI), a computer service company which was under contract to install, maintain, and operate a computer facility at Rockville, Maryland, for use by the Federal Energy Administration (FEA). Under the arrangement between OSI and FEA, persons working for FEA in various parts of the country could use key boards at communications terminals in their offices to send instructions over telephone circuits to the large computers in Rockville, and the computers\u2019 responses would be returned and reflected on a CRT (cathode ray tube) terminal which is a typewriter-like device with a keyboard and display screen similar to a television screen upon which the information is displayed as it is sent and received.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mr. Seidlitz helped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>to prepare the software<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which was installed at the Rockville facility as part of the project, and he was also responsible for the security of the central computer system. During his tenure, he had full access to the computers and to a software system known as \u201cWYLBUR\u201d which resided within them.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In June, 1975, Seidlitz resigned this job and returned to work at his own computer firm in Alexandria, Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">William Coakley, a computer specialist employed by FEA, was assigned temporarily to the OSI facility. On December 30, 1975, in an attempt to locate a friend who might be using the OSI system, he had the computer display the initials of everyone who was then using the WYLBUR software. Among the initials displayed by the computer were those of his supervisor, who was standing nearby and who was not using the computer. Suspicious that an unauthorized \u201cintruder\u201d might be using these initials in order to gain access to the system,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Coakley asked Mr. Ewing, an OSI employee, if Ewing could determine what was happening. He also asked Mr. Wack, an OSI supervisor, if he (Wack) could determine whether the mysterious user was at a remote terminal or at one of the terminals within the OSI complex which were directly wired to the computer and did not employ telephone circuits. Ewing instructed the computer to display for him the data it was about to transmit to the possible intruder, and it proved to be a portion of the \u201csource code\u201d of the WYLBUR software system.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Using other data provided by the computer, Wack concluded that the connection was by telephone from outside the complex. At his request, the telephone company manually traced the call to the Alexandria office of the defendant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Wack was told that the trace was successful, but the telephone company informed him that it could not divulge the results of the trace except in response to a legal subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-13\">The following day, OSI activated a special feature of the WYLBUR system known as the \u201cMilten Spy Function,\u201d which automatically recorded, after they had been received by the machinery at Rockville, any requests made of the computer by the intruder. The \u201cspy\u201d also recorded, before they were sent out to the intruder over the telephone lines, the computer\u2019s responses to such requests. Mr. Wack again asked the telephone company to trace the line when it was suspected that the unauthorized person, employing the same initials, was using the computer to receive portions of the WYL-BUR source code. This manual trace on December 31 led once more to the defendant\u2019s office in Virginia, although OSI was not so informed.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-14\">Advised by OSI of the events of December 30 and 31, the FBI on January 3<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, 1976, secured, but did not then execute, a warrant to search the defendant\u2019s Alexandria office.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> At the FBI\u2019s suggestion, the tele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>phone company conducted two additional manual traces when alerted to incoming calls by OSI, but in each instance the calls were terminated before the traces had progressed beyond the telephone company\u2019s office in Lanham, Maryland, which served 10,000 subscribers. The phone company then installed \u201coriginating accounting identification equipment\u201d in the Lanham office, the function of which was to automatically and quickly ascertain, without intercepting the contents of any communication, the telephone number of any of the 10,000 area telephones from which any subsequent calls to the OSI computers originated. Two such calls were made on the morning of January 9, and the equipment attributed both of them to a phone at the defendant\u2019s Lanham residence. That afternoon, the FBI executed the warrant to search Seidlitz\u2019 Alexandria office, seizing, among other items, a copy of the user\u2019s guide to the OSI system and some 40 rolls of computer paper upon which were printed the WYLBUR source code.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> A warrant was then issued to search the Seidlitz residence in Lanham,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> where officers found a portable communications terminal which contained a teleprinter for receiving written messages from the computer, as well as a notebook containing information relating to access codes<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> previously assigned to authorized users of the OSI computers.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The indictment handed down on February 3,1976, charged that the defendant had, on December 30 and 31, transmitted telephone calls in interstate commerce as part of a scheme to defraud OSI of property consisting of information from the computer system.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> A motion to suppress the evidence seized from the office and the residence was considered at a hearing on April 30,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>safter which the district judge rendered an oral opinion rejecting the defendant\u2019s argument that the searches were invalidated by the use of illegal electronic surveillance to obtain the information contained in the affidavits supporting the warrants. Specifically, the district judge ruled that (1) as to the information obtained by use of the \u201cspy\u201d, Section 605 of the Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 605, does not apply, and neither Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510, <em>et seq., </em>nor the Fourth Amendment were violated, since the information was obtained with the consent of a party to the defendant\u2019s telephonic communications, and (2) with respect to the tracing of the telephone calls, neither Title III nor the Fourth Amendment are offended when, as in the \u201cpen register\u201d cases, the number of the telephone from which a call is placed is determined by a process which does not entail the interception of the contents of the communication. Over defense objection, much of the challenged evidence was admitted at trial, and the telephone traces, as well as the operation of the \u201cMil-ten Spy\u201d, were described to the jury. In the face of this evidence, the defendant conceded that he had retrieved the informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>tion from the computers, but claimed to have acted only out of concern for the security of the OSI system. In negation of fraudulent intent, Seidlitz testified that he acquired the data with the sole intention of presenting the printouts to OSI officials to prove to them that the steps taken to, prevent unauthorized use of the computers were inadequate. Additionally, it was his position at trial that the WYLBUR software was not a trade secret or other property interest of OSI sufficient to qualify as \u201cproperty\u201d within the meaning of the wire fraud statute. On appeal he renews the \u201cillegal surveillance\u201d claims and also argues that the evidence before the jury was insufficient to establish either his fraudulent intent or that WYLBUR constituted \u201cproperty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">In considering the surveillance questions, we assume that if, as the defendant contends, either the \u201cspy\u201d activities or the traces were conducted illegally, then the evidence seized at both the office and the residence should have been suppressed, since the affidavits upon which the warrants were issued contained information attributable to the \u201cspy\u201d and the telephone traces which was essential to the finding of probable cause to search.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Furthermore, if the statutory or constitutional standards upon which the defendant relies were transgressed, then the jury should not have been informed of the deployment of the \u201cspy\u201d' and the traces of the telephone calls.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">It can safely be said, however, that even if, as the defendant argues, the Milten Spy or the telephone traces resulted in the \u201cinterception\u201d of his communications with the computers, these communications were wire or telephone communications since in each instance the defendant was exchanging messages with the computers over commercial telephone circuits.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> For this reason the district court correctly concluded that Section 605 of the Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 605, could have no bearing whatever upon the legality of these activities. While at one time Section 605 did contain standards for determining the legality of the interception of telephone conversations, the statute was amended by Section 803 of Pub.L. 90-351, 82 Stat. 223, in 1968, for the express purpose of excluding from its scope the interception of wire communications and of transferring the regulation of such activity to certain provisions of Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. <em>See United States v. Clegg, </em>509 F.2d 605, 611-612 (5 Cir. 1975); <em>United States v. Falcone, </em>505 F.2d 478, 482 (3 Cir. 1974), <em>cert, denied </em>420 U.S. 955, 95 S.Ct. 1338, 43 L.Ed.2d 432 (1975); S.Rep.No.1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess. 107 (1968), <em>reprinted in </em>[1968] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 2112, 2196. Today Section 605 pertains to the interception of only radio communications, and there is no indication that radio communications of any kind were involved in the apprehension and conviction of the defendant. The appropriate inquiry, then, is whether any of the questioned activities amounted to the kind of interceptions of wire communications condemned by Title III.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">The language, the legislative history, and the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the relevant provisions of Title III support the district court\u2019s conclusion that the telephone traces in this case were not the sort of \u201cinterceptions\u201d of communications <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>proscribed by the statute. \u201cIntercept\u201d is defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510(4) to mean \u201cthe aural acquisition of the <em>contents </em>of any wire or oral communication through the use of any electronic, mechanical, or other device\u201d (emphasis added); \u201c \u2018contents\u2019 * * includes any information concerning the identity of the parties to [the] communication or the existence, substance, purport, or meaning of [the] communication.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510(8). The evidence adduced at the suppression hearing conclusively shows that neither the manual traces conducted on December 30 and 31, nor the traces which were achieved by use of the special equipment later installed, entailed interference with or observation of the contents of the defendant\u2019s dialogues with the computers. That Congress intended to exempt such procedures from the coverage of the statute is borne out by the Senate Report which accompanied the legislation, and explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-5\">\u201c[t]he proposed legislation is not designed to prevent the tracing of phone calls * *. The proposed legislation is intended to protect the privacy of the communication itself and not the means of communication.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">S.Rep.No.1097, <em>supra, </em>at 90; U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, <em>supra, </em>at 2178. <em>See Michigan Bell Tel. Co. v. United States, </em>565 F.2d 385, 387-389 (6 Cir. 1977). Especially in view of <em>United States v. New York Telephone Co., </em>434 U.S. 159, 98 S.Ct. 364, 54 L.Ed.2d 376 (1977), which held that \u201cpen registers\u201d (which similarly \u201coverhear\u201d none of the substance of a telephone communication, 434 U.S. at 161, n. 1, 98 S.Ct. at 364, n. 1) do not run afoul of the statute, we perceive no reason to invalidate the telephone traces on statutory grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">We also concur in the disposition by the court below of the challenge under Title Ill to the information obtained through the use of the Milten Spy. First, the statute proscribes only the \u201caural\u201d acquisition of the contents of wire communications, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510(4), <em>supra, </em>and there is no evidence to suggest that the \u201cspy\u201d relied in any fashion upon sounds in retrieving information from the computers in written form. <em>Cf. United States v. New York Telephone Co., supra, </em>434 U.S. at 166-167, 98 S.Ct. 364. We find no merit in the defendant\u2019s suggestion that, in the absence of either a statutory definition of the word \u201caural\u201d or of legislative history to indicate that Congress even considered the relationship of Title III to computer systems, we should ignore the plain meaning of the term \u201caural\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and should hold that, regardless of whether a device detects sound, its ability to interpret the substance of a transmission brings it within the restrictions of the statute. Canons of statutory construction require that we attribute to legislatively undefined words their commonly accepted meaning and that we give effect to what must be presumed to have been the purposeful inclusion in the legislation of a qualifying term such as \u201caural\u201d which restricts the statute\u2019s scope.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Second, to the extent that the Milten Spy disclosed, <em>before </em>they were sent out over the telephone lines, the substance of the replies generated by the computer to the intruder\u2019s commands, the information was not a \u201cwire communication\u201d at the time of its retrieval, and its disclosure thus did not violate the statute. Under Title III, a \u201cwire communication\u201d is a communication made \u201cin whole or in part\u201d through the facilities of a common carrier, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510(1), and the portion of the WYLBUR source code requested by Seidlitz was obtained by the \u201cspy\u201d before it had travelled through such facilities. While arguably this reasoning might not apply to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>the spy\u2019s duplication, after they had been received by the computer, of any of the instructions Seidlitz sent by telephone, it unquestionably legitimizes under the statute that portion of the retrievals which identified the outgoing information as the WYLBUR source code. Finally, Title III specifically authorizes the interception of a wire communication by a party to the communication or by a person acting with the consent of a party to the communication. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(2)(c), (d). In our opinion OSI, which leased, housed, programmed, and maintained the computers and subscribed to the relevant telephone numbers, was for all intents and purposes a party to the communications initiated by the defendant, since in a very real sense the company used the computers solely as a medium for imparting to customers, via telephone lines, its own expertise. Insofar as OSI installed on its line a computer which was capable of recording the messages exchanged in the course of responding to a remote user\u2019s requests, we consider this case analogous to those which recognize that a party may, consistent with Title III, use a device to capture and record both sides of his telephone conversation with another party. <em>See, e. g., United States </em>v. <em>Turk, </em>526 F.2d 654 (5 Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 823, 97 S.Ct. 74, 50 L.Ed.2d 84 (1976); <em>Smith v. Cincinnati Post &amp; Times-Star, </em>475 F.2d 740 (6 Cir. 1973); <em>Smith v. Wunker, </em>356 F.Supp. 44 (S.D.Ohio 1972). <em>Cf. United States v. Bragan, </em>499 F.2d 1376 (4 Cir. 1974).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">The last of the objections raised in the court below to the evidence secured by the Milten Spy and the telephone traces was that it was detected and obtained in contravention of the Fourth Amendment. The district judge rejected this contention on the ground that even though the \u201cspy\u201d and the traces were utilized without prior judicial authorization, the evidence was obtained by searches to which the appropriate persons had consented. We need not review the soundness of that ruling or the implicit conclusion that the \u201cspy\u201d and the traces raised questions under the Fourth Amendment,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> since in our opinion the activities complained of were, at most, conducted by private persons \u2014 OSI and the telephone company \u2014 to which the constitutional prohibition against warrantless searches does not apply. \u201c[I]t is no part of the policy underlying the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to discourage citizens from aiding to the utmost of their ability in the apprehension of criminals,\u201d and consequently the Fourth Amendment and the exclusionary rule by which it is enforced come into play only where it appears from all of the circumstances that in a particular case the challenged evidence was obtained as a result of a search conducted by government officers or by private persons acting as agents or instrumentalities of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>government. <em>Coolidge </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, </em>403 U.S. 443, 487-490, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 29 L.Ed.2d 564 (1971). <em>See also Burdeau v. McDowell, </em>256 U.S. 465, 475-476, 41 S.Ct. 574, 65 L.Ed. 1048 (1921); <em>United States v. Mekjian, </em>505 F.2d 1320 (5 Cir. 1975); <em>United States v. Pryba, </em>163 U.S.App.D.C. 389, 502 F.2d 391 (1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 1127, 95 S.Ct. 815, 42 L.Ed.2d 828 (1975); <em>Corngold </em>v. <em>United States, </em>367 F.2d 1 (9 Cir. 1966) <em>(en </em>banc). <em>Cf. United States v. Crabtree, </em>545 F.2d 884 (4 Cir. 1976). Emphasizing that FEA\u2019s Mr. Coakley, upon discovering the suspicious initials, asked OSI\u2019s Ewing \u201cif there was some way that he could determine what this account was doing,\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and that he asked OSI\u2019s Wack \u201cif he could determine where the call was coming from,\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> the defendant would have us find that the subsequent determination by OSI that the intruder was receiving the WYL-BUR source code, as well as the telephone company\u2019s identification of the originating phone numbers, were actions for which the government should be held accountable and to which the Fourth Amendment applies. In our opinion, however, these nonspecific, innocuous remarks by a civilian employee of the FEA were in stark contrast to the active involvement by a Secret Service agent which tainted the search in <em>Lustig v. United States, </em>338 U.S. 74, 69 S.Ct. 1372, 93 L.Ed. 1819 (1949), cited by the defendant,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and they do not amount to the kind of conduct on the part of the government which has been held sufficient to deprive a citizen\u2019s search of its private character.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Under the criteria uniformly considered by the courts in assessing the degree of federal involvement in an otherwise private search for purposes of the Fourth Amendment, the instant \u201csearches\u201d and their fruits are not subject to scrutiny under the exclusionary rule.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">While we base our affirmance of the denial of the suppression motion upon our consideration of the statutory and constitutional arguments advanced by the appellant, and addressed by the court below, we think it appropriate to observe that we discern a certain speciousness which infects all of the illegal surveillance contentions made by the defendant with respect to the evidence which was obtained through use of the Milten Spy. Unlike the typical telephone user who employs the telephone merely as a convenience to converse with other persons over distances, Seidlitz used the telephone to tamper with and manipulate a machine which was owned by others, located on their premises, and obviously not intended for his use. Unlike the party to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>personal telephone call who may have little reason to suspect that his words are being covertly recorded, Seidlitz, a computer expert, undoubtedly was aware that by their very nature the computers would record the data he sent and received, and that OSI, also expert in the use of computers, could detect such exchanges if alerted to the presence of an intruder. In this sense the use by the witnesses below of the term \u201cintruder\u201d to describe an unauthorized user of the computers is aptly applied to the defendant, since by telephonic signal he in fact intruded or trespassed upon the physical property of OSI as effectively as if he had broken into the Rockville facility and instructed the computers from one of the terminals directly wired to the machines. Under these circumstances, having been \u201ccaught with his hand in the cookie jar\u201d, we seriously doubt that he is entitled to raise either statutory or constitutional objections to the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">We have carefully reviewed the other issues raised by the appellant and find them to be without merit. Viewed in the light most favorable to the government, <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942), there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could find that the WYLBUR system was \u201cproperty\u201d as defined in the instruction given by the trial judge which is not contested on appeal. Even though software systems similar to OSI\u2019s WYLBUR were in use at non-OSI facilities, the evidence that OSI invested substantial sums to modify the system to suit its peculiar needs, that OSI enjoyed a multi-million dollar competitive advantage because of WYLBUR, and that OSI took steps to prevent persons other than clients and employees from using the system permitted a finding that the pilfered data was the property of OSI and not, as the defendant contends, property in the public domain subject to appropriation by persons such as himself. In a similar vein, the defendant disputes the sufficiency of the evidence to establish fraudulent intent, but in essence his argument is only that he feels the jury should not have discredited his own explanation of the purpose for which he acquired the WYLBUR data. It is of no consequence that Seidlitz was not shown by the government to have used the data retrieved from the OSI computers in his own business or to have attempted to sell it to others, <em>see United States v. Painter, </em>314 F.2d 939 (4 Cir. 1963), <em>cert. denied, </em>374 U.S. 831, 83 S.Ct. 1873, 10 L.Ed.2d 1054 (1963); <em>United States v. Bagdasian, </em>291 F.2d 163 (4 Cir. 1961), <em>cert, denied, </em>368 U.S. 834, 82 S.Ct. 60, 7 L.Ed.2d 36 (1961), and the circumstantial evidence in this case is ample to support a finding of the requisite intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">On appeal, the defendant raises other objections relative to the searches of his office and residence, but these points were neither fairly raised in the motion to suppress evidence nor urged upon the trial court at the suppression hearing. Absent plain or fundamental error, we need not consider on appeal legal points which were available to the appellant but not presented for the district court\u2019s consideration. <em>United States v. Braunig, </em>553 F.2d 777, 780 (2 Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 959, 97 S.Ct. 2686, 53 L.Ed.2d 277 (1977); <em>United States v.

A remote user would dial on an ordinary telephone one of the several unpublished telephone numbers to which OSI subscribed and which were assigned to the computers. He would then connect the telephone to his terminal so that messages could be relayed between the terminal and the computers in the form of signals traveling over the telephone line. Because any of a number of commercially available terminal units could accomplish such a link to the computers, the user, as a security precaution, had to enter on his terminal keyboard a special access code before he would be permitted full use of the system.

This \u201caccess code\u201d would be communicated to the central computers which, if they recognized the code as belonging to an authorized user, would proceed to perform the work the individual sent along.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b218-6\">.

The WYLBUR software system facilitated the computers\u2019 exchanges with FEA users at the remote terminals. It contained no classified FEA information, but rather enabled the computers to perform tasks assigned to them by FEA personnel.

It also stated that, as a result of an investigation of former OSI employees and interviews with OSI personnel, the FBI, prior to the receipt of the trace information, had ascertained Seidlitz\u2019 business address and concluded that he was the chief suspect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b219-7\">.

The affidavit in support of the application for this warrant in essence contained the same statements made in the application for the pri- or warrant. See n. 8, <em>supra. </em>In addition, it related that the FBI had been informed that Seidlitz maintained a communications terminal at his home, that the search of the office had not uncovered the terminal, and that the telephone company\u2019s trace of the calls that morning indicated that they were made from the defendant\u2019s residence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"A7J\">. <em>See </em>n. 2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b219-12\">.

Section 605 of the Communications Act has been interpreted to require the exclusion of evidence obtained in violation thereof, <em>Nardone </em>v. <em>United States, </em>302 U.S. 379, 58 S.Ct. 275, 82 L.Ed. 314 (1937), and an express exclusionary rule is contained in Title III of the Omnibus Act at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2515. A judicially-fashioned rule of exclusion applies where surveillance does not comport with Fourth Amendment requirements. <em>Katz v.

Interceptions of two-party conversations were discussed in the context of the Fourth Amendment in the cases cited by the district court to support its conclusion. In each instance, government law enforcement officers had arranged and actively participated in the challenged surveillance. <em>See United States v. White, </em>401 U.S. 745, 91 S.Ct. 1122, 28 L.Ed.2d 453 (1971); <em>United States v. Bernstein, </em>509 F.2d 996 (4 Cir. 1975); <em>United States v. Dowdy, </em>479 F.2d 213 (4 Cir. 1973). <em>White </em>and <em>Dowdy </em>do support the view that the voluntary participation in such surveillance by one of the parties to a telephone call will satisfy the Fourth Amendment, and as already indicated, we tend to agree that even if Seidlitz\u2019 data transmissions were made with a legitimate expectation of privacy (a question we do not decide and about which we have serious reservations), the fact that OSI voluntarily recorded them obviates Fourth Amendment concerns as to the \u201cspy\u201d. But we are not sure that a similar approach is valid with respect to the traces of the telephone numbers, and the parties have not briefed this aspect of the constitutional issue. Rather than decide either the \u201copen\u201d question of whether the Fourth Amendment applies to such traces, <em>see United States v. New York Tel. Co., supra, </em>434 U.S. at 165, n. 7, 98 S.Ct. 364, n. 7, or the more perplexing question of whether the recipient of a call can, under the Fourth Amendment, consent to a warrantless trace of the caller\u2019s telephone, we choose to rest our opinion as to the constitutionality of the \u201cspy\u201d and the traces on the ground set forth in the text.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b223-5\">.

The facts reveal that a federal Secret Service agent, who was charged with enforcing the counterfeiting laws, joined the unlawful search of a hotel room by city police after it had already begun. While there, he sifted through the items uncovered by the local officers (who were aware of his interest in the case), selecting those articles which were later used as evidence in a federal counterfeiting prosecution of one of the occupants of the room. The Court found that the agent \u201chad an active hand\u201d in the search, and held that the trial court should have suppressed the evidence obtained by him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b223-8\">.
