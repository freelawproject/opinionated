The bankruptcy judge held that it does not create a statutory lien and voided as a preferential transfer the repossession of certain materials from the bankrupt, Lowery Brothers, Inc. (Lowery), by Davis Water &amp; Waste Industries, Inc. (Davis). On appeal, the district court reversed, holding that Florida Statutes section 713.15 creates a statutory lien valid against a trustee in bankruptcy. We affirm the ruling of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">The relevant facts in this case are not in dispute. Lowery was a contractor retained by ITT Development Corporation (ITT) and Atlantis Development Corporation (Atlantis) to perform certain underground and utility construction on the Palm Coast project in Flagler County, Florida. Lowery commenced work on the Palm Coast project in 1970. It abandoned its work on the project in mid-August 1974 and was formally notified in a letter from ITT and Atlantis dated August 12, 1974, that it should leave the construction site. Prior to its abandonment of the project, Lowery had purchased various supplies and equipment for the construction of water and sewer collection and distribution systems from Davis on open account. While some of these materials had been incorporated into the Palm Coast project prior to Lowery\u2019s abandonment, other materials had not yet been so incorporated and were still situated on the jobsite. At the time of its abandonment, Lowery owed Davis approximately $124,000 for materials Davis had furnished to Lowery for the project. In early September 1974, Davis, relying on Florida Statutes section 713.-15, repossessed the unincorporated materials; it later issued Lowery a credit for the repossessed materials in the amount of $47,-768.09, the original purchase price for those items. On October 30, 1974, Lowery filed its petition for voluntary bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-10\">On January 10,1975, Edward S. Avdoyan, the trustee for Lowery (Trustee), brought this action to avoid Davis\u2019s repossession of the materials as an improper preference under section 60(b) of the Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 96(b) (1976). Davis answered that Florida Statutes section 713.15 created a valid statutory lien which would prevent the Trustee from avoiding Davis\u2019s act of repossession. Both parties moved for summary judgment, and on August 18, 1975, the bankruptcy judge granted the Trustee\u2019s motion, holding that Florida Statutes section 713.15 does not create a statutory lien under the Act and that Davis\u2019s repossession of materials <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>from the Palm Coast jobsite constituted a preferential transfer within four months of Lowery\u2019s bankruptcy and thus was avoidable by the Trustee. In reversing the bankruptcy judge, the district court read section 713.15 as establishing a statutory lien within the meaning of the Act, held that this lien could not be avoided by the Trustee, and directed the entry of final judgment for Davis. The Trustee appealed the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">Although the parties briefed and argued the issue of whether the elements of an avoidable preference are present, we need not decide this point since our finding of a valid statutory lien disposes of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">The Act provides a special status to the holder of a statutory lien. The holder of such a lien is protected against the avoidance powers of a bankruptcy trustee so long as the tests of sections 67(b), (c)(1)(A) and (c)(1)(B) of the Act are met.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 67(b) provides that the avoiding power given a trustee by section 60 of the Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 96 (1976), is ineffective against a \u201cstatutory lien\u201d except under the circumstances set forth in section 67(c). \u201cStatutory lien\u201d is defined by section l(29a) of the Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 l(29a) (1976), as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b917-12\">\u201cStatutory lien\u201d shall mean a lien arising solely by force of statute upon specified circumstances or conditions, but shall not include any lien provided by or dependent upon an agreement to give security, whether or not such lien is also provided by or is also dependent upon statute and whether or not the agreement or lien is made fully effective by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-13\">While the Act defines the term statutory lien, it nowhere defines the term \u201clien\u201d itself; instead, one must examine the law of the state whose statute is at issue in order to determine whether it establishes a \u201clien\u201d under state law and thus under the Act. <em>City of New York v. Hall, </em>139 F.2d 935, 936 (2d Cir. 1944); <em>City of New Orleans v. Harrell, </em>134 F.2d 399, 400 (5th Cir. 1943); <em>Commercial Credit Co. v. Davidson, </em>112 F.2d 54, 55 (5th Cir. 1940); <em>City of Dallas v. Ryan (In re Brannon), </em>62 F.2d 959, 961 (5th Cir. 1933); <em>In re Trahan, </em>283 F.Supp. 620, 622 (W.D.La.), <em>aff\u2019d per curiam, </em>402 F.2d 796 (5th Cir. 1968), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Bernard v. Beneficial Finance Co., </em>394 U.S. 930, 89 S.Ct. 1189, 22 L.Ed.2d 459 (1969); 4 <em>Collier on Bankruptcy </em>167.20 at 219-20, It 67.25 at 347 \u2014 48, 167.281[2.1] at 420-21 (14th ed. J. Moore &amp; L. King 1978); <em>see In re Wallace Lincoln-Mercury Co., </em>469 F.2d 396, 400 (5th Cir. 1972). Therefore, we must examine Florida law and determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>whether Florida Statutes section 713.15 creates a lien. If it does, we then must determine whether this lien is a statutory lien as defined by section l(29a) of the Act. If it is a statutory lien, we finally must decide whether it survives the test of section 67(c)(1)(A) and (B) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">There is no reported case in which a Florida court has decided whether section 713.15 creates a lien.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, we must anticipate how a Florida court would resolve this question were it confronted by it. In order to do so, we must turn to general tenets of Florida law and to an analysis of section 713.15 and the Florida Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">Florida courts have defined a lien as \u201ca charge upon property for the payment of a debt or duty.\u201d <em>Phillips v. Atwell, </em>76 Fla. 480, 488, 80 So. 180,182 (1918). \u201cA lien is a qualified right or a proprietary interest, which may be exercised over the property of another. It is a right which the law gives to have a debt satisfied out of a particular thing.\u201d <em>City of Sanford v. McClelland, </em>121 Fla. 253, 257, 163 So. 513, 514 (1935). Section 713.15 gives the seller of materials the right to repossess them from their purchaser upon the completion or abandonment<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of an improvement<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> without or prior to the incorporation of the materials therein if the seller has not received payment for the materials. Although it is unclear from the language of the statute exactly when this right of repossession comes into existence, that is, whether it is a conditional right to repossess the materials which arises at the time of original delivery or whether it only commences upon the act of completion or abandonment of the improvement, the right definitely exists after the time of abandonment or completion. Section 713.15 clearly creates a \u201ccharge upon property for the payment of a debt\u201d since it gives the supplier a right to repossess the materials it delivered for an improvement if the debt for the materials has not been satisfied, provides that title to the materials is revested in the supplier \u201cas if [the supplier] had never parted with their possession,\u201d and states that after repossession or replevin the underlying debt for the materials is extinguished. Similarly, the provision creates a right which a supplier such as Davis may exercise over the property of another<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> in order to satisfy his debt out of a particular thing, that being the unused materials still present on the improvement site. Thus, section 713.15 appears to fit the general characteristics of a lien as defined by the Florida courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-12\">As mentioned above, section 713.15 is a portion of the Florida \u201cMechanics\u2019 Lien Law,\u201d which is Part I of Chapter 713 of the Florida Statutes, entitled \u201cLiens, Generally.\u201d Thus, section 713.15 is categorized by the Florida Legislature under both \u201cLiens\u201d and \u201cMechanics\u2019 Liens.\u201d The title of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>law which enacted the original version of section 713.15 was:</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">AN ACT Providing for Mechanics\u2019 or Laborers\u2019 Liens Including Liens for Materials on Real Property, Providing Penalties for Misapplication of Funds and for Furnishing False Statements, to Make Uniform the Laws of this State with Other States with Reference Thereto, and to Repeal all Acts or Parts of Acts Inconsistent Herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">1935 Fla.Laws ch. 17097. In 1963 the original version of section 713.15 was revised as part of a law entitled: \u201cAN ACT relating to mechanics\u2019 lien law; revising chapter 84, repealing sections 84.01-84.35 and adding sections 84.011-84.371, all Florida Statutes; providing effective date October 1, 1963.\u201d 1963 Fla.Laws ch. 63-135.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">The Florida Constitution provides that \u201c[e]very law shall embrace but one subject and matter properly connected therewith, and the subject shall be briefly expressed in the title.\u201d Fla.Const. art. III, \u00a7 6. Thus, the title of an act defines its scope, <em>Finn v. Finn, </em>312 So.2d 726, 730 (Fla.1975); <em>Hillsborough County v. Price, </em>149 So.2d 912, 914 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1963), and the body of an act can contain no valid provision beyond the range of the subject set forth by the title of the act. <em>State v. Tindell, </em>88 So.2d 123, 124 (Fla.1956) (en banc). The purpose of this constitutional mandate is to make certain that both the state legislature and the public are given adequate notice as to what a law entails. <em>State v. McDonald, </em>357 So.2d 405, 407 (Fla. 1978). It is clearly relevant that section 713.15 is contained in a chapter entitled \u201cLiens, Generally,\u201d a part entitled \u201cMechanics\u2019 Lien Law,\u201d and was enacted in a law referring to \u201cMechanics\u2019 or Laborers\u2019 Liens Including Liens for Materials on Real Property.\u201d The subject of this law is mechanics\u2019 liens, as stated in its title. By constitutional provision only one subject may be included in this law. We consider the fact that the Florida Legislature chose to place section 713.15 in the mechanics\u2019 lien statute as an indication that the legislature felt that section 713.15 creates a lien under Florida law.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-10\">The history of section 713.15 and the Florida Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law gives a further indication that section 713.15 does create a mechanics\u2019 lien, or at least some form of lien. The 1885 Florida Constitution provided that: \u201cThe Legislature shall provide for giving to mechanics and laborers an adequate lien on the subject matter of their labor.\u201d Fla.Const. art. XVI, \u00a7 22 (1885). As a result, the legislature enacted Florida\u2019s original mechanics\u2019 lien law. 1887 Fla.Laws ch. 3747. In 1935 Florida was the only jurisdiction to adopt the Uniform Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 1935 Fla.Laws ch. 17097. Section 10 of that chapter provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b919-11\">Repossession of materials not used. If for any reason the completion of an improvement is abandoned, or though the improvement is completed, materials delivered are not used therefor, a person who has delivered materials for the improvement which have not been incorporated therein and for which he has not received payment may repossess and remove such materials; and thereupon he shall have no lien on the real property or improvements and no right under section 25-1 against persons secondarially [sic] liable, for the price thereof, but shall have the same rights in regard to the materials as if he had never parted with the possession. This right to repossess and remove the materials shall not be effected [sic ] by their sale, encumbrance, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>attachment, or transfer from the site of the improvement, except that, if the materials have been so transferred, the right to repossess them shall not be effective as against a purchaser or encumbrancer thereof in good faith whose interest therein shall have arisen since such transfer from the site of the improvement, or as against a creditor attaching after such transfer. The right of repossession and removal given by this section shall extend only to materials whose purchase price does not exceed the amount remaining due to the person repossessing; but where materials have been partly paid for, the person delivering them may repossess them as allowed in this section on refunding the part of the purchase price which has been paid.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">This predecessor to section 713.15 was the law until 1963, when it was repealed, 1963 Fla.Laws ch. 63-135, and replaced by the present language.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, with a slight variation in language, section 713.15 has been part of the scheme of the Florida Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law since 1935.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">In the ordinary materialman<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> situation the materialman furnishes materials to a contractor, who incorporates them into an improvement which is in progress. If the materialman is not paid for his materials, his recourse is his statutory lien on the improvement and the realty to which it is attached. Fla.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 713.05-.06 (1977). Section 713.15 covers the situation when an improvement is either completed or abandoned before the materials are incorporated therein. There is no reason for the materi-alman to need a section 713.05 or .06 lien on realty when his materials have not been incorporated; instead, he can simply go to the jobsite and peacefully repossess them. As stated by the committee which prepared the original version of section 713.15 in the Uniform Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act, \u201c[tjhis is equitable, since it saves the materialman from loss and leaves the owner in no worse position than before the delivery.\u201d Standard State Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act Committee, <em>supra </em>note 8, at 67 n.92. If the materialman so chooses, under section 713.15 he may bring an action for replevin of the materials in lieu of making a peaceful repossession.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Section 713.15 is an integral part of the Florida Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law structure\u2014 when materials have been incorporated into an improvement the materialman may use sections 713.05- 06 as his remedy, while if the materials are not yet so incorporated and the project is completed or abandoned the materialman may exercise one of the alternative remedies given him by section 713.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-11\">We note the observation of one commentator, who has stated that \u201c[wjhere materials are not furnished in accordance with the Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law, they are not covered by the provisions of \u00a7 713.15.\u201d 2 S. Raku-sin, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 24.03(A)(2), at 3b (1978) (footnote omitted). Were section 713.15 not deemed to create a form of lien by the Florida Legislature, it is highly unlikely that its application would depend upon compliance with the Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>further observe that section 713.15 gives the furnisher of materials still located on an improvement site:</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">a superior right to any other claim to the materials. The claimant\u2019s right to repossess or replevy the materials is not affected by their sale, encumbrance, or attachment according to the statute. The section may be considered a legislative pronouncement that there simply cannot be a subsequent good faith purchaser, or encumbrancer, without notice of the true ownership of <em>materials stored at a construction jobsite. </em>Likewise, \u00a7 713.17[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>] prohibits a person other than the seller of the materials from subjecting the materials to attachment, execution or any other legal process to enforce any debt due, during the time in which the materials are about to be applied to the improvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">2 S. Rakusin, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 24.03(D)(1) (emphasis in original).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In <em>County National Bank v. Fierman, </em>188 So.2d 384 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1966), the court held that because of the predecessor of section 713.17 the judgment creditor of a subcontractor could not levy against materials furnished a subcontractor and intended for use in an improvement. Thus, in the case before us no creditor of Lowery could have levied on the materials furnished it by Davis prior to Lowery\u2019s abandonment of work (after abandonment the materials were not \u201cabout to be applied to improve the real property\u201d as required by section 713.17), and after abandonment Davis could and did repossess the materials and have title revert to it \u201cas if [Davis] had never parted with their possession.\u201d A supplier has to take no action to preserve its right, such as a filing under a provision of the Mechanics Lien Law, replevin statute, or Uniform Commercial Code, <em>National Steel Products Co. v. Donald L. Myrick &amp; Associates, Inc., </em>353 So.2d 657, 659 (Fla. Dist.Ct.App.1977); 2 S. Rakusin, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 24.03(A); it merely has to go to a jobsite and peaceably repossess its materials (unless it chooses to replevy them). The priority status section 713.15 confers upon a supplier clearly appears to be that sort of special right generally referred to as a lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-12\">We observe that section 713.15 provides that after a supplier reclaims or replevies unincorporated materials \u201che shall have no lien on the real property or improvements and no right against any persons for the price thereof, but shall have the same rights in regard to the materials as if he had never parted with their possession.\u201d Thus, by employing this provision he precludes himself from any other relief. In light of <em>Associated Housing Corp. v. Keller Building Products of Jacksonville, Inc., </em>335 So.2d 362 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1976), in which the court upheld as a potentially valid affirmative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>defense the plaintiff\u2019s alleged failure to mitigate damages because of a failure to repossess or replevy under section 713.15, it appears that if a supplier fails to utilize the remedy provided him by section 713.15 he may be at least partially foreclosed from further relief because of a breach of his duty to mitigate damages. We feel that the Florida Legislature would be unlikely to preclude an important remedy, such as an action for debt, unless it provided what it viewed as a substitute right of equal or greater value. In fact, section 713.15 provides a remedy which is in some respects superior to a lien on realty or an action for debt, as such a lien or action may or may not be fully satisfied, while section 713.15 restores <em>ownership </em>of the unincorporated materials to their supplier.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In addition, various procedural steps must be followed before recovery may be had by way of a lien on realty or other action, while section 713.15 requires the mere act of repossession. The return of title to the supplier is clearly a significant aspect of section 713.15, and we believe this characteristic further indicates lien status.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">Our analysis of section 713.15 and our holding that it creates a lien is supported by the fact that an analogous statutory provision has been held to constitute a lien under the laws of Louisiana. In <em>In re Trahan, </em>283 F.Supp. 620 (W.D.La.), <em>aff\u2019d per curiam, </em>402 F.2d 796 (5th Cir. 1968), <em>cert, denied sub nom. Bernard v. Beneficial Finance Co., </em>394 U.S. 930, 89 S.Ct. 1189, 22 L.Ed.2d 459 (1969), the court had to determine whether the \u201cvendor\u2019s privilege\u201d granted the seller of merchandise by Louisiana law<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> creates a lien for the seller that is valid against a trustee in bankruptcy. In <em>Trahan, </em>at the time of bankruptcy the bankrupt possessed certain furniture which he had purchased on credit, for which he had not paid in full, and over which a vendor\u2019s privilege had been reserved. The district court, in reversing the decision of the bankruptcy referee, construed the vendor\u2019s privilege and held that it establishes a lien under state law. The court went on to hold that Louisiana article 3227 creates a statutory lien under the Act and that it is valid against the claims of a trustee in bankruptcy. While the court was construing a civil law statute, whereas the Florida provision before us operates in a common law system, we feel that the <em>Trahan </em>court\u2019s holding is relevant to our decision. Louisiana article 3227 provides <em>by statute </em>a form of secured status to the seller of personalty such that when he is not paid for his property he has a preferred status over other creditors so long as the purchaser retains possession of the property. Florida\u2019s section 713.15 provides a superior status to the supplier of materials to a construction site such that if the materials <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>are not incorporated into a completed or abandoned project their supplier may recover them and have a superior status over all other creditors so long as the materials remain on the improvement site. It \u201cpermits one who furnishes materials to recover them without running the risk of their being attached by someone else.\u201d <em>Handbook of National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws </em>525 (1932). The Florida provision grants rights superior even to those of the Louisiana one, since the Louisiana law gives a vendor a \u201cpreference on the price of his property\u201d while the Florida act returns possession and title of goods to their original supplier, and since the Florida statute generally grants superi- or status to a supplier even after materials are transferred by their original purchaser.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Like Louisiana\u2019s article 3227, section 713.15 creates by statute a superior status for the supplier of movable property which should be considered a lien under state law.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">We have considered the arguments of the Trustee and the decision of the bankruptcy judge, both of whom maintain that section 713.15 does not create a lien under Florida law. Both point to the fact that the language of section 713.15 does not denominate the remedy it provides the supplier of materials as a lien, and consequently argue that since the word lien is not used section 713.15 must not create a lien under Florida law. While it is true that the provision does not use the word lien in its general description of the alternative remedies it provides, this fact is not dispositive. As we have discussed, section 713.15 creates a right which fits the definition which Florida courts have given for the term lien. It has been an integral portion of the Florida Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law since 1935, and grants alternative remedies which are closely tied to that which is clearly denominated as a lien in the Florida Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law. It is clearly analogous to a Louisiana statute which has been held to constitute a lien. The right established by section 713.15 cannot be excluded from the status of a lien merely because it fails to refer to the remedies it provides as liens. <em>Cf. In re Trahan, </em>283 F.Supp. 620, 623 (W.D.La.), <em>aff\u2019d per curiam, </em>402 F.2d 796 (5th Cir. 1968), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Bernard v. Beneficial Finance Co., </em>394 U.S. 930, 89 S.Ct. 1189, 22 L.Ed.2d 459 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>The Trustee also argues that section 713.-15 does not create a lien because of definitions contained in the Florida Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law. The Trustee notes that the Florida Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law defines the term \u201clienor\u201d as \u201cany person having a lien or prospective lien upon <em>real property </em>by virtue of this chapter and includes his successor in interest.\u201d Fla.Stat. \u00a7 713.01(10) (1977) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The Trustee further observes that Florida Statutes section 713.02 sets forth various types of lienors, and that all liens to which it refers are upon real property and not personalty. Based on this fact he argues that all liens arising under the Florida Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law are on realty, and since section 713.15 creates no rights over realty, but rather covers materials, it must not create a lien. While this argument has a certain logical appeal, it does not persuade us. While section 713.-15 may not create an ordinary mechanics\u2019 lien under chapter 713, part I because it does not create a lien on real property,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> it still creates a lien-like right which we consider a lien. Section 713.15 may create a form of hybrid mechanics\u2019 lien, since it covers a mechanics\u2019 lien situation where a lien over realty is unnecessary but equity requires a superior, lien-type status for the supplier.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In any event, we are convinced that the right created by section 713.15 is- a lien despite the fact that it is not over realty and thus unlike the normal chapter 713, part I lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-14\">Based upon the analysis we have set forth, we hold that section 713.15 creates a lien under Florida law, and feel that a Florida court would so rule if this issue were properly brought before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-15\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b924-16\">Having decided that section 713.15 does create a lien under Florida law, we must next determine the federal law issue of whether it meets the Act\u2019s section l(29a) definition of a statutory lien. The lien created by section 713.15 exists only by virtue of statute; section 713.15 does not merely codify a consensual agreement for the giving of security or otherwise between the supplier and purchaser of construction materials. The lien arises upon the specified circumstances and conditions that a supplier has furnished materials for an improvement, has not been paid for these materials, and the improvement has been completed or abandoned prior to the incorporation of the materials therein. The lien is not a judicial lien since no judicial proceeding is necessary for its existence; the lien exists because of the abandonment or completion of an improvement project, and can be enforced without the invocation of any judicial process (so long as the supplier chooses to employ peaceful repossession, rather than re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>plevin, as his remedy).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We conclude that section 713.15 meets the definitional requirements of section l(29a), and is thus a statutory lien for the purposes of the Act.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">As noted above, section 67(b) of the Act provides that statutory liens are valid against a trustee in bankruptcy despite the avoidance power provisions of section 60 of the Act so long as the rules of section 67(c) of the Act are not violated. As we have now decided that Davis held a valid statutory lien over the materials it repossessed, the district court correctly reversed the bankruptcy judge and granted Davis\u2019s motion for summary judgment unless section 713.-15 falls afoul of the statutory lien avoidance tests of section 67(c). In this case, only the provisions of section 67(c)(1)(A) and (B) have any possible application to the lien created by section 713.15.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> As we shall now demonstrate, section 713.15 successfully weathers the storms of sections 67(c)(1)(A) and (B), and the district court was correct in its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">A. <em>Florida Statutes Section 713.15 and Section 67(c)(1)(A):</em></p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">The lien created by section 713.15 is triggered by the completion or abandonment of an improvement prior to the incorporation of unpaid-for materials therein. This act of abandonment or completion is unrelated to the factors set forth in section 67(cXl)(A), those being the time of the debtor\u2019s insolvency,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> the distribution or liquidation of the debtor\u2019s property, or the execution upon the debtor\u2019s property by one other than the section 713.15 lienor. While there might be some correlation between a debtor\u2019s insolvency and his abandonment of an improvement, it is clearly not a direct one, and, of course, a perfectly solvent debtor could complete work on a project prior to the use of materials provided by a particular supplier, thereby giving the supplier the right to repossess or replevy the materials through his section 713.15 statutory lien. Accordingly, we find that section 713.15 satisfies the requirements of section 67(c)(1XA) of the Act. <em>See generally </em>4 <em>Collier on Bankruptcy, supra </em>167.281[2.1].</p>\n<p id=\"b925-13\">B. <em>Florida Statutes Section 713.15 and Section 67(c)(1XB):</em></p>\n<p id=\"b925-14\">Section 67(c)(1)(B) provides a somewhat more complex test for the validity of a statutory lien, the bona fide purchaser standard. As noted above, section 713.15 gives a provider of materials an indefeasible right to exercise his statutory lien so long as the materials remain on the improvement site. It provides that the \u201cright to repossess and remove or replevy the materials shall not be affected by their sale, encumbrance, attachment or transfer from the site of improvement.\u201d <footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Since section 713.15 creates a lien <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>which cannot be overridden by a subsequent bona fide purchaser so long as the materials remain on the improvement site, in this case it meets the requirement of section 67(c)(1)(B). At any event, in the case before us the facts disclose that Davis\u2019s lien was choate and completely exercised more than one month prior to Lowery\u2019s date of bankruptcy,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> since Davis repossessed the disputed materials in early September 1974 while Lowery filed its petition for voluntary bankruptcy on October 30, 1974. Under the terms of section 713.15, as we construe it, Davis\u2019s lien (its right to repossess or replevy the materials) arose <em>no later than </em>the date of Lowery\u2019s abandonment of the Palm Coast project in early August 1974. As we have already observed, Davis was not required by section 713.15 to make any filings or otherwise act to perfect its lien, and in early September it exercised its rights under section 713.15 by peaceably repossessing the materials abandoned by Lowery .and crediting Lowery\u2019s account for the amount of the purchase price. Upon its repossession section 713.15 provides that Davis regained its title to the materials \u201cas if [Davis] had never parted with . . . possession [of the materials].\u201d On the date of Lowery\u2019s bankruptcy it thus had no claim of title to the materials, and could convey nothing to a bona fide purchaser. Since this was the situation, clearly Davis\u2019s lien was perfected and enforceable against one obtaining the rights of a bona fide purchaser at the date of bankruptcy, and thus was valid under section 67(c)(1)(B) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">We have examined Florida Statutes section 713.15 and determined that it creates a valid statutory lien which meets the standards of section 67(b) of the Bankruptcy Act. Accordingly, the district court correctly remanded the case for the granting of summary judgment for Davis and the entry of final judgment on its behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b916-7\">.

While section 713.15 does not clearly so state, it would appear that a supplier cannot recover for any deficiency between the original value of the materials he supplied and their value at the time of repossession. Since frequently the value of materials will decline over time (particularly after they are exposed to the elements for a period of time), and since a supplier may not recover for any deficiency in value, he may often incur a loss through the use of section 713.15. This loss presumably would be measured by the difference between the purchase price for the goods at the time of their delivery to the jobsite and the price at which they might be resold after repossession. Still, the statute provides a supplier with a direct return of the items he originally delivered to the improvement location, and thus is preferable to a general lien over the project. Just as a supplier bears the risk of loss, he may also earn the fruits of gain if the value of the materials should increase while they are kept on the jobsite (such gain is not a totally unreasonable prospect, since the value of some rare or valuable materials might increase over time despite their exposure to the elements and their arguable status as \u201cused\u201d merchandise). We express no opinion at this time as to whether a trustee in bankruptcy could somehow recover any appreciation in the value of the unincorporated materials over their original purchase price. Such a result, however, would seem consistent with the general philosophy underlying the Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b922-8\">.

As we have already mentioned, under section 713.15 a supplier may repossess or replevy materials even after their transfer by an original purchaser so long as their new acquirer obtained them while they were still situated on the construction site.

Rakusin, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 24.03(D)(1).
