In this case, as in <em>United States v. Marathon Pipe Line Company, </em>589 F.2d 1305 (7th Cir. 1978), decided this same day, a company was held liable to a civil penalty based on its ownership or operation of a discharging facility even though it was not at fault and the spill was caused by a third party\u2019s act or omission. In <em>Marathon, </em>the company argued that no more than a nominal penalty could be imposed in the absence of fault. Here, Tex-Tow argues that no penalty, nominal or substantial, can be imposed on a party that did not \u201ccause\u201d the spill. We sustain the penalty against this new attack for much the same reasons as in <em>Marathon, </em>as Tex-Tow\u2019s causation argument is very similar to Marathon\u2019s fault argument and suffers from the same defect that it ignores the absolute nature of the civil penalty liability, as well as the penalty\u2019s remedial and economic rather than deterrent objectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-13\">Tex-Tow operated a tank barge which was being loaded with a cargo of gasoline at a dock on the Mississippi River owned and operated by Mobil Oil Company. As the barge was filled with gasoline, it sank deeper into the water, settling on an underwater steel piling that was part of the dock structure. The piling punctured the hull of the barge, resulting in a discharge of 1600 gallons of gasoline into the river. Conced-edly Tex-Tow was not at fault as there is no reasonable way it could have known of the piling and it received no warning from Mobil. We will also assume for purposes of this opinion that Tex-Tow would have a third-party causation defense (on the basis of an act or omission by Mobil), if such a defense were available in the case of the civil penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-14\">\n<em>The Statutory Scheme</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-15\">The FWPCA was enacted \u201cto restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation\u2019s waters.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a). Toward that end, Congress set the goal of eliminating the discharge of all pollutants into navigable waters by 1985. \u00a7 1251(a)(1). Section 1321, dealing with oil and hazardous substance liability, sets a \u201cno discharge\u201d policy of immediate effect and prohibits any discharge in harmful quantities. \u00a7\u00a7 1321(b)(1) and (3). The section holds owners or opera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1313\">*1313</page-number>tors of discharging facilities<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> liable for clean-up costs, subject to the defenses of act of God, act of war, negligence of the United States Government, or act or omission of a third party. \u00a7 1321(f). If the discharged substance is nonremovable, the owner or operator is liable to a variable civil penalty dependent on the amount and toxicity of the substance spilled.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This \u201cliquidated damages liability\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is again subject to the four enumerated defenses. \u00a7 1321(b)(2)(B) (iii). Finally, section 1321(b)(6), the immediate focus of our concern here, makes owners and operators liable to a civil penalty of up to $5,000, with no provision for any defenses but with the amount of the penalty to be determined by the Coast Guard, which is instructed to take into account ability to pay and \u201cgravity of the violation.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1377-5\">\n<em>Statutory Interpretation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-6\">First, Tex-Tow argues that the third party causation defense contained in the provisions dealing with clean-up liability and liquidated damages liability should also be read into the civil penalty provision. We decline to do so, as did the court in <em>United States v. General Motors Corp., </em>403 F.Supp. 1151, 1157 (D.Conn.1975). As stated in <em>International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation v. General Telephone &amp; Electronics Corporation, </em>518 F.2d 913, 917\u2014 918 (9th Cir. 1975):</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-12\">There are two circumstances in which this court may look beyond the express language of a statute in order to give force to Congressional intent: where the statutory language is ambiguous; and where a literal interpretation would thwart the purpose of the over-all statutory scheme or lead to an absurd result. (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-13\">Neither of these circumstances is present here. The statutory language is not ambiguous, and a literal interpretation according no third party or other defenses to the civil penalty furthers the overall statutory scheme of shifting the cost of pollution onto the polluting enterprise. It is true that the statute affords narrow defenses to the two other liabilities, however absolute liability in the case of the civil penalty is not unduly harsh or unreasonable in view of the limited nature of the liability (maximum of $5,000) and the flexibility afforded by the statutory directive that the Coast Guard, in setting the amount of the penalty, take into account the charged party\u2019s ability to pay and the \u201cgravity of the violation,\u201d which has been interpreted by the Coast Guard to include degree of culpability.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1377-14\">Tex-Tow, however, asserts that a causation requirement must be implied in the civil penalty provision because no liability may exist in the absence of causation. We agree that causation is required even under a strict liability statute, however <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1314\">*1314</page-number>Tex-Tow has conceded that the presence of its barge at the pier was a cause in fact of the spill. The only question is whether legal, or proximate, cause also exists. This is \u201cessentially a question of whether the policy of the law will extend the responsibility for the conduct to the consequences which have in fact occurred.\u201d Prosser, The Law of Torts 244, \u00a7 42 (4th ed. 1971). Tex-Tow argues that the mere presence of its barge at the dock is not sufficient to constitute legal cause. We believe, however, that more than \u201cmere presence\u201d was involved here. Tex-Tow was engaged in the type of enterprise which will inevitably cause pollution and on which Congress has determined to shift the cost of pollution when the additional element of an actual discharge is present. These two elements, actual pollution plus statistically foreseeable pollution attributable to a statutorily defined type of enterprise,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> together satisfy the requirement of cause in fact and legal cause. Foreseeability both creates legal responsibility and limits it. An enterprise such as Tex-Tow engaged in the transport of oil can foresee that spills will result despite all precautions and that some of these will result from the acts or omissions of third parties. Although a third party may be responsible for the immediate act or omission which \u201ccaused\u201d the spill, Tex-Tow was engaged in the activity or enterprise which \u201ccaused\u201d the spill. Congress had the power to make certain oil-related activities or enterprises the \u201ccause\u201d of the spill rather than the conduct of a third party.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> With respect to the civil penalty Congress has exercised this power.</p>\n<p id=\"ajz-dedup-0\">The statistical foreseeability of an accident is a proper basis on which to affix legal responsibility. In <em>Mickle v. Blackmon, </em>252 S.C. 202, 166 S.E.2d 173 (1969) the statistical foreseeability of automobile accidents gave rise to a manufacturer\u2019s duty to design cars to minimize injury upon collision. In <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Wyeth Laboratories, Inc., </em>399 F.2d 121 (9th Cir. 1968), the statistical foreseeability of some adverse reactions to a polio vaccine gave rise to a manufacturer\u2019s duty to warn consumers, as marketing the vaccine without the warning was held to constitute a \u201cdefect\u201d under strict products liability law. Under the absolute liability standard here involved neither fault nor defect need be proved, so foreseeability is used not to establish these but rather to affix legal responsibility despite the absence of fault or defect and also to limit the scope of that liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-9\">We note that the question of ultimate liability remains unresolved, as Tex-Tow may still have an indemnity cause of action against Mobil under section 1321(h). However, the only court to consider the question has construed section 1321(h) as not extending the indemnity cause of action to recovery of the civil penalty. <em>Tug Ocean Prince, Inc. v. United States, </em>436 F.Supp. 907, 926 (S.D.N.Y.1977).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Such an interpretation is consistent with the economic or risk-shifting view of the civil penalty here taken, as the party engaged in the potentially polluting enterprise is in the best position to estimate the risk of accidental pollution and plan accordingly, as by raising its prices or purchasing insurance.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Economically, it makes sense to place the cost of pollution on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1315\">*1315</page-number>the enterprise (here water transport of gasoline) which statistically will cause pollution and in fact does cause pollution.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We do not, however, here decide the question of ultimate liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-5\">\n<em>Substantive Due Process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-6\">What we have already said respecting Tex-Tow\u2019s statutory interpretation argument goes far toward refuting Tex-Tow\u2019s second argument that imposing a civil penalty in a situation of third party causation is irrational. First, we note that the Supreme Court has not struck down an economic regulation on the substantive due process grounds here urged since 1937.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Second, Tex-Tow\u2019s claim of irrationality is grounded in the assumption that the purpose of the civil penalty is to <em>deter </em>spills. As we have already explained here and in <em>Marathon, </em>the civil penalty also has certain non-deterrent, economic purposes which are rationally served by an absolute liability standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-7\">There are several indicia in section 1321 itself of purposes other than deterrence: neither clean-up liability nor liquidated damages liability is premised on a finding of fault,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and, of course, civil penalty liability is absolute, although tempered by the statutory directive that \"gravity of the violation\u201d be considered in setting the amount of the penalty. There is also evidence of a <em>remedial </em>purpose to clean up spills once they occur rather than solely a <em>deterrent </em>purpose to prevent spills in the first instance. The section provides for govern ment clean-up of disaster spills, \u00a7 1321(d), and of other spills which the discharger does not clean up itself, \u00a7 1321(c)(1). To fulfill this remedial function, the Council on Environmental Quality<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> is directed to develop a National Contingency Plan, pursuant to which the ' EPA and the Coast Guard<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> are authorized, <em>inter alia, </em>to set up detection systems, purchase removal equipment, and train and maintain a strike force. \u00a7 1321(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-11\">The civil penalty is directly implicated in all these remedial functions as proceeds from civil penalty collections are to be placed in the revolving fund which finances these government activities. \u00a7 1321(k). It is reasonable to require those who \u201ccause\u201d damage, not by their conduct but by the activity they are engaged in, to pay for the costs of abating that damage. Forfeitures have been used to finance a regulatory scheme, <em>see, </em>e. <em>g. One Lot Emerald Cut Stones v. United States, </em>409 U.S. 232, 93 S.Ct. 489, 34 L.Ed.2d 438 (1972), and penalties or forfeitures have been sustained against due process attack even though the charged party was faultless and a third party was the immediate cause of the violation. <em>Calero-Toledo v. Pearson Yacht Leasing Co., </em>416 U.S. 663, 94 S.Ct. 2080, 40 L.Ed.2d 452 (1974) (yacht forfeited even though third parties violated the drug laws), <em>Edelberg v. Illinois Racing Bd., </em>540 F.2d 279 (7th Cir. 1976) (winnings forfeited although third parties drugged the horse). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1316\">*1316</page-number>The present case is stronger than these forfeiture cases as the activity of the charged owner or operator (water transportation of oil) <em>is </em>responsible for the pollution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-4\">We hold that the \u201ccause\u201d of a spill is the <em>polluting enterprise </em>rather than the <em>conduct </em>of the charged party or a third party. Accordingly, an owner or operator of a discharging facility is liable to a section 1321(b)(6) civil penalty even where it exercised all due care and a third party\u2019s act or omission was the immediate cause of the spill.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1376-11\">. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1321(b)(6) (1976).
