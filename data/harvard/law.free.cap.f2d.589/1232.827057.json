The Act provides that:</p>\n<p id=\"APl\">the absence of an entry in the Secretary\u2019s records as to the self-employment income alleged to have been derived by an individual in such year shall be <em>conclusive </em>that no such alleged self-employment income was deriv\u00e9d by such individual in such year unless it is shown that he filed a tax return of his self-employment income for such year before the expiration of the time limitation ....</p>\n<p id=\"azu-dedup-0\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(c)(4)(C) (1976) (emphasis supplied). The district court gave no effect to this conclusive presumption, ruling that it could be overcome by evidence other than an actual tax return which was timely filed. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-17\">The plaintiff, Shirley N. Shore, applied for retirement insurance benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 401 <em>et seq. </em>(1970). On July 29, 1975, she was informed that her claim had been denied by the Social Security Administration because she was not a \u201cfully insured individual\u201d within the meaning of section 214(a) of the Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under that provision, Shore must have had earnings of $100 or more during each of twenty-one calendar quarters; however, the records of the Social Security Administration showed that she had reported self-employment income in only sixteen quarters.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-18\">Thereafter, Shore filed a request for reconsideration of the Secretary\u2019s decision denying her claim. She alleged that she had \u201cnew and material evidence\u201d which demonstrated that she was self-employed during 1951 \u2014 1954\u2014years in which the Secretary\u2019s records did not show any income for her. She asked that her earnings records be corrected to show that she had income in thirty-two quarters and was therefore a \u201cfully insured individual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-19\">The evidence submitted to the Social Security Administration included a statement by Shore that she had filed income tax returns for the four years in question but that she had misplaced her copies of those returns.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A letter from the IRS stating that it did not retain returns for years prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1234\">*1234</page-number>to 1968 was attached. Statements by her husband and his brother revealed that she was their partner in Shore\u2019s Photo Shop from 1951 to 1954. The accountants for the partnership stated that they had prepared the individual income tax returns for Mr. and Mrs. Shore for the years 1951 to 1954, and that the income which Mrs. Shore reported for those years was the same as her husband\u2019s. Copies of Schedule C-a (form 1040) filed by Mr. Shore showed that he had reported income in excess of $100 for each quarter of the four years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-4\">After considering this evidence, the Social Security Administration refused to revise its original determination. The accountants\u2019 statements were not credited, because their \u201crecollection of the particulars of accounting services that took place many years ago is not convincing evidence\u201d. The Secretary also took the position that self-employment income not shown in the agency\u2019s records may be proven only by \u201can actual tax return\u201d timely filed for the year in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-5\">Shore\u2019s claim was then submitted to an administrative law judge for a decision based on the evidence in the file. On October 26, 1976, the administrative law judge concluded, as a matter of law, that Shore\u2019s evidence could not be considered and, therefore, denied her claims:</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-6\">since the claimant did not produce evidence in the form of tax returns or portions thereof timely filed for the years in question, the claimant cannot be credited with any self-employment income for Social Security purposes pursuant to section 205(c)(4)(C) of the Social Security Act, as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-11\">After the Secretary\u2019s decision had become final,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Shore brought this action in the Western District of Pennsylvania for review of that decision pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (1976). The case was referred to a magistrate, who concluded that the Secretary should have considered Shore\u2019s evidence of additional self-employment income during 1951-1954. He further concluded from a review of this evidence that the \u201cplaintiff has proven by a preponderance . that she was self-employed during the period in question.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In an Order dated November 30, 1977, the district court denied the Secretary\u2019s motion for summary judgment, granted Shore\u2019s motion for summary judgment and directed the Secretary to award benefits to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-12\">The Secretary has appealed from this Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-14\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-15\">The Secretary is required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(c)(2)(A) (1976) to maintain records of personal income. An individual\u2019s records are available to him<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and are subject to correction if an application is made within three years, three months and fifteen days after the year in question.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, once that time limitation has expired \u2014 as it has in this case \u2014 the statute provides that the Secretary</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-16\">. may . . . include in his</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-17\">records . . . any omitted item of</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-18\">self-employment income but</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-19\">only\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-20\">(F) to conform his records to\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1235\">*1235</page-number>(i) tax returns or portions thereof (including information returns and other written statements) filed with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-4\">except that no amount of self-employment income of an individual for any taxable year (if such return or statement was filed after the expiration of the time limitation following the taxable year) shall be included in the Secretary\u2019s records pursuant to this subpara-graph;</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-5\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(c)(5)(F) (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-6\">As we have indicated earlier, the statute also prescribes the evidentiary weight to be given to these records \u201c[a]fter the expiration of the time limitation following any year \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-7\">(C) the absence of an entry in the Secretary\u2019s records as to the self-employment income alleged to have been derived by an individual in such year shall be conclusive for the purposes of this sub-chapter that no such alleged self-employment income was derived by such individual in such year unless it is shown that he filed a tax return of his self-employment income for such year before the expiration of the time limitation following such year, in which case the Secretary shall include in his records the self-employment income of such individual for such year.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-11\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(c)(4)(C) (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-12\">The Secretary is authorized to make regulations governing \u201cthe nature and extent of the proofs and evidence ... to establish the right to benefits hereunder.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(a) (1976). The regulations promulgated by the Secretary track the statute in almost identical language. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.804(c) (1978)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> [following 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(c)(4)(C)]; 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.806(f) (1978)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> [following 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(c)(5)(F)]. In addition, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.807(b) (1978), provides, that:</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-13\"><em>Tax returns of self-employment income </em>\u2014(1) <em>Tax returns filed before expiration of time limitation. </em>Where action is taken to conform a record of earnings with a tax return of self-employment income filed by an individual with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue before the expiration of the time limitation following any taxable year (see \u00a7 404.804(c)), the Administration shall incorporate into its records the self-employment income of such individual for such year as <em>evidenced by such tax return or some portion thereof . .</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1299-14\">(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-15\">Shore has not argued that the regulations enacted under the statute are invalid; rather, she would have us interpret them to allow proof of self-employment income, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1236\">*1236</page-number>by the statutorily prescribed method, but by the best available evidence. The district court apparently adopted this view of the regulations. We are unable to agree that this is the proper interpretation of the statute and the regulations made pursuant to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-5\">The Secretary\u2019s interpretation of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.804(c), .806(f), .807(b) (1978), is that once the time limitation for correction of earnings records has expired, a claimant may establish that she had unrecorded self-employment income only by the submission of an actual income tax return which was timely filed. If the claimant\u2019s return for that year is not available, the Secretary\u2019s records are deemed conclusive. Shore, on the other hand, contends that this interpretation of the regulations would not be faithful to \u201cthe beneficent purposes of the [Act]\u201d. <em>Hess v. Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, </em>497 F.2d 837, 840 (3d Cir. 1974). Although the purpose of the Act would lead us to construe it in favor of a claimant when that is logically possible, there are other legislative concerns meriting consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-6\">The district court failed to consider the nature of the statutory scheme as it relates to claims based on self-employment income. This is evident from its reliance on our decision in <em>Kephart v. Richardson, </em>505 F.2d 1085 (3d Cir. 1974), in support of its ruling that \u201cthe absence of an entry in the Secretary\u2019s records does not bar recovery of benefits but is merely one evidentiary factor to be considered.\u201d In <em>Kephart, </em>we held that a claimant who \u201calleges that he did in fact work during a given period of time for which the government\u2019s records are silent . is entitled to substantiate his position and . . . this evidence must be given consideration by the Social Security Administration.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> However, the claimant in <em>Kephart </em>had alleged the receipt of unrecorded <em>wages. </em>Hence, Judge Weis in writing for the <em>Kephart </em>court was interpreting subsection (B) of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(c)(4) which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-10\">the absence of an entry in the Secretary\u2019s records as to the <em>wages </em>alleged to have been paid by an employer to an individual during any period in such year shall be <em>presumptive evidence </em>for the purpose of this subchapter that no such <em>alleged wages </em>were paid to such individual in such period;</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-11\">(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-12\">Here, on the other hand, we are concerned with \u201cself-employment income\u201d, not \u201cwages\u201d, and we are therefore governed by subsection (C) of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(c)(4). This marks a crucial difference, because under subsection (B), the absence of an entry of <em>wage </em>income creates a mere \u201cpresumption\u201d, whereas, under (C), the absence of an entry of <em>self-employment </em>income is \u201cconclusive\u201d.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This distinction between the evidentiary effect accorded to the absence of an entry of <em>wages </em>as opposed to <em>self-employment </em>income was articulated in <em>Singer v. Weinber-ger, </em>513 F.2d 176, 177-78 (9th Cir. 1975):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"a2n-dedup-0\">Section 405(c)(3) gives three different effects to the absence of entries of income in the Secretary\u2019s records: (1) within 3 years, 3 months, and 15 days after expiration of the qualifying year (\u00a7 405(c)(1)(A), (B)) the absence of entries of either wages or self-employment income is evidence that no such wages or earnings were received;2 (2) after the statutory limitation period, the absence of entry of wages in the Secretary\u2019s records creates a rebuttable presumption that no such wages were paid3 [citations omitted]; (3) after the limitation period, the absence of entry of self-employment income in the Secretary\u2019s records, <em>coupled with an absence of the claimant\u2019s tax returns showing such income, </em>creates a conclusive presumption that no such income was received.4</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1300-13\">Singer\u2019s attempt to prove self-employment income was foreclosed by the conclusive presumption against him. However, he was confronted with a rebut-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1237\">*1237</page-number>table, rather than a conclusive, presumption that he had not received wages during the quarters unrecorded by the Secretary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1301-5\">(emphasis supplied and footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-6\">The differing treatment accorded to wage and self-employment income by subsections (B) and (C) of section 405(c)(4) is explained by the degree of control that each group of claimants has over its reporting. Congress was concerned that if employees were not permitted to rebut the Secretary\u2019s records, they would be penalized for the negligence of their employers who had failed to report wage payments. This concern is not relevant to self-employed claimants, however, inasmuch as self-employed claimants control and are responsible for their own income tax and social security reporting.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1301-7\">The legislative history of the Act reveals that the provisions relating to the reporting of self-employment income resulted from a very different Congressional policy. The Report of the Senate Committee on Finance on the 1950 amendments to the Act indicates that the crucial factor in the decision to include self-employed persons in the retirement insurance system was the development of a workable mechanism for determining their earnings. Prior to 1950, self-employed persons were not covered by Social Security because \u201cthere was no agreement on a feasible method of obtaining . reports of their income.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Senate Report explains the rationale for extension of the Act\u2019s coverage:<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ac9-dedup-0\">Practicable administrative procedures for coverage of the self-employed have been developed. An individual would report his self-employment income by transferring certain information from the trade or business schedule of his income-tax return to a social-security schedule on the same return.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-13\">In testimony before the House Committee on Ways and Means, the Commissioner for the Social Security Administration stated that the use of income tax reporting was vital to the decision to include self-employed persons in the system:<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1238\">*1238</page-number>The self-employed were excluded from the original program largely because, at that time, there was no agreement on a feasible method of obtaining such reports of their income. Subsequent developments have indicated that most self-employed persons can report their income, for purposes of coverage, as a part of their income-tax returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-4\">In sum, the creation of an administratively feasible mode for determining the eligibility of self-employed claimants was a paramount legislative concern in 1950. Reliance on incopie tax returns was regarded as the only workable plan. This view is manifested in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 405(c)(5)(F), (c)(4)(C) (1976), which provides that social security records may be corrected only by reference to a timely filed income tax return.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1302-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-6\">The interpretation given to the regulations by the district court would impair the administration of reporting and claims processing for self-employed persons. Claimants who alleged that they had reported income for years in which IRS records are not available could rely on testimonial evidence of their income in those years. Since the Secretary would seldom be able to rebut this evidence, claims based on stale or anecdotal evidence would be approved.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This would deprive the Secretary\u2019s records of the \u201cconclusive\u201d effect which Congress had intended. It would also blur \u2014 if not eliminate \u2014 the distinction drawn by the Act between correction of the Secretary\u2019s records before and after the \u201ctime limitation\u201d of section 405(c)(4) has run.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The reliance on income tax reporting which Congress viewed as the key to a manageable system of retirement insurance for the self-employed would be significantly undermined.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has refused to require the Secretary to consider evidence of self-employment income other than a properly completed and filed tax return:<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1303-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1239\">*1239</page-number>Affirmance of the district court\u2019s decision is called for here in order to avoid frustration of the statutory standards of record keeping and reporting established by the Social Security Act. These standards are founded upon policies lying at the very heart of the operation of the Act. Appellant\u2019s reporting in no way measures up to these standards, and thus his claim to coverage must fail. A holding in this case that appellant adequately reported his partnership income would undermine unequivocal statutory provisions and the Secretary\u2019s power to enforce them.</p>\n<p id=\"avu-dedup-0\"><em>Martlew v. Celebrezze, </em>320 F.2d 887, 890 (5th Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-4\">There is a further consideration which also leads us to adopt the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.-804(c), .806(f), .807(b) (1978). The Secretary\u2019s interpretation of his department\u2019s regulations is entitled to great respect if it \u201csensibly conforms to the purpose and wording of the regulations.\u201d <em>Northern Indiana Public Service Co. v. Izaak Walton League, </em>423 U.S. 12, 15, 96 S.Ct. 172, 174, 46 L.Ed.2d 156 (1975).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> This is especially so where the administration of income reporting and claim processing is involved.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In these areas, the Social Security Administration has, by dint of long experience, come to have special expertise, and its view of what procedures are manageable must be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-14\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-15\">If we are to give effect to the Congressional mandate that income tax reporting is the only manageable method for ascertaining the income of self-employed claimants, we must uphold the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.-804(c), .806(f), .807(b) (1978), which conforms fully with that direction. For this reason, we hold that a claimant may show that she had self-employment income during quarters for which the Secretary\u2019s records show none, only by submitting a timely filed income tax return.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Since Shore did not, and cannot, produce her returns for the years 1951-1954, the Secretary\u2019s decision denying her benefits must be affirmed.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1303-17\">The order of the district court will be reversed with the directions that the district court vacate its order granting summary judgment for Shore and in lieu thereof, enter an order granting summary judgment in favor of the Secretary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1297-10\">.

Mr. Shore\u2019s income tax return for that same year disclosed self-employment earnings of exactly half that amount ($4,496). Because of the result which we reach in this case, there is no need for us to consider this evidence.

In <em>Breeden v.

One purpose, akin to the supposed rationale for statutes of limitation, is to guard against false claims after contradictory evidence is unavailable. But Congress did not write a statute of limitations for contradicting blank wage records, as it did for self-employment income reports. The different treatment afforded to blank wage records suggests a second purpose\u2014 that Congress intended <em>not </em>to penalize wage earners for the carelessness or dishonesty of their employers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1301-10\">.

Dr. Altmeyer described how the retirement insurance system would be administered in the case of self-employed persons:</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-15\">Therefore, there are no insuperable administrative problems which would prevent extension of coverage to the self-employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-16\">The Federal Security Agency and the Treasury Department believe that a one-page form can be devised which would be simple for the taxpayer and which would present no major difficulties in administration for the Federal Government.

But the immensity of the problem of providing Social Security \u201ccalled forth a highly complex and interrelated statutory structure.\u201d The mandate to the Secretary in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(c)(2) to maintain HEW records of self-employment income was necessary for the determination in an orderly manner of the innumerable requests for insurance benefits. Congress recognized that a beginning and end of time for establishing eligibility was an essential part of that need by prescribing a \u201ctime limitation\u201d within which changes and revisions in the Secretary\u2019s records might be made. See <em>Crawford v. Cohen, </em>295 F.Supp. 624 (D.S.C. 1969). One need only be reasonable to foresee the disaster in HEW if there were not a reasonable time limitation for ending disputes about eligibility benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1302-18\">. In <em>Martiew </em>the claimant had filed an income tax return without a completed Schedule C. Therefore, the Secretary\u2019s records did not show any self-employment income during that year. The claimant attempted to prove, by submitting his Form 1040, that he had reported self-employment income for that year. The Court upheld the Secretary\u2019s refusal to consider this evidence, stating that \u201conly a properly-completed Form 1040 income tax return (including a completed Schedule C or its substantial equivalent) is regarded as sufficient [evidence].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 888.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1303-6\">. Where \u201cthe Secretary\u2019s interpretation has been consistently followed . . .

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reached this result without extensive discussion in <em>Singer v.

This case does not present a factual context in which the claimant has submitted a <em>copy </em>of her income tax return with satisfactory evidence that the <em>original </em>was filed. Therefore, we do not decide that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-12\">. after the limitation period, the absence of entry of self-employment income in the Secretary\u2019s records, coupled with an absence of the claimant\u2019s tax returns showing such income, creates a conclusive presumption that no such income was received,</p>\n<p id=\"A03\">(footnote omitted). The plaintiff has relied on <em>Rasmussen v. Gardner; </em>374 F.2d 589 (10th Cir. 1967). That case, however, does not cite or discuss section 405(c)(4). The claimant contended that the income which <em>he had reported </em>as his own was in fact the income of a partnership with his wife, and that accordingly half of the <em>reported </em>income should have been credited to his wife. The hearing examiner denied the claim, because he found that no partnership existed. The court held that there was a partnership and therefore reversed. Hence, the issue decided by the court was whether a partnership existed. Moreover, the case involved reallocation of previously reported income, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(c)(5)(G) (1976), rather than a claim founded on earnings which had never been reported to the Social Security Administration.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
