In addition, the court sentenced Cox to thirty-one and one-half years\u2019 imprisonment under the Arkansas habitual criminal statute, Ark.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 43-2328(3) (1977). In this habeas corpus petition, Cox challenges both the conviction and the habitual criminal sentence. The district court denied his petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-12\">In challenging his burglary conviction, Cox argues that the trial court violated his constitutional rights by refusing to grant a continuance and by failing to advise him of his right to appeal. In addition, he contends he had ineffective assistance of counsel. The district court rejected these arguments, and we agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion on these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-13\">Cox challenges the habitual offender sentence on two grounds. First, he argues that the trial court denied him due process by failing to follow the procedures set forth in the Arkansas habitual criminal statute and case law interpreting that statute. Whether a state court complied with state law in its criminal proceedings is purely a matter of local concern and is not reviewable by a federal court under the due process clause. <em>Buchalter v. New York, </em>319 U.S. 427, 63 S.Ct. 1129, 87 L.Ed. 1492 (1943); <em>Wolfe v. Nash, </em>313 F.2d 393, 400 (8th Cir. 1963). Cox\u2019s challenge to the procedures followed by the trial court therefore raises no constitutional question for us to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-18\">Second, Cox argues that the trial court, by accepting a stipulation made by Cox\u2019s counsel without inquiring whether Cox concurred in the stipulation, violated his rights to due process and equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-19\">After the jury returned a verdict of guilty on the burglary charge, the trial court, following the procedures set forth in Ark.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 43-2330.1 (1977), told the jury that they would then hear evidence on the habitual offender charge. Under Arkansas law, the State bears the burden of proving prior convictions of the defendant, <em>McConahay v. State, </em>257 Ark. 328, 516 S.W.2d 887 (1975), and the defendant has a right to deny the existence of any prior convictions and to offer evidence in support of the denial, Ark.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 43-2330.1(2). In the present case, Cox\u2019s counsel stipulated to four prior convictions: two counts of cattle theft in 1962, and two counts of burglary and grand larceny in 1970. Thus, the State did not have to offer any evidence of Cox\u2019s prior convictions. After instructions by the court, the jury found that Cox had been convicted of four prior offenses and fixed his punishment at thirty-one and one-half years.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-20\">At a later hearing, Cox testified that he did not know his counsel would make a stipulation and that he did not consent to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-21\">The Ninth Circuit dealt with a similar case in <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Craven, </em>461 F.2d 1109 (9th Cir. 1972), <em>affirming </em>325 F.Supp. 1253 (N.D. Cal.1971). The defendant in that case admitted several prior convictions without being informed that the prior convictions could be used to enhance his sentence. The court held that the admission was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>\u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of a guilty plea and could not be accepted \u201cunless the defendant understands the consequences of the admission.\u201d 461 F.2d at 1109.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">We adopt the reasoning and conclusion of <em>Wright v. Craven </em>as it applies to the circumstances of the present case. The stipulation by Cox\u2019s counsel, like the admission in <em>Wright, </em>amounted to a waiver of Cox\u2019s right to have the State prove the prior offenses and of his right to rebut the State\u2019s evidence. As with a plea of guilty, \u201cnothing remains but to give judgment and determine the punishment.\u201d <em>Boykin v. Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969). Thus, the stipulation was the functional equivalent of a guilty plea, and the state trial court was required to question Cox to determine whether he knowingly and voluntarily agreed to the stipulation. <em>Id. </em>at 244, 89 S.Ct. 1709.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The admission into evidence of the stipulation, without inquiry into Cox\u2019s knowledge and consent, amounted to constitutional error.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The State had the burden of establishing the number and validity of Cox\u2019s prior convictions for purposes of sentencing under the Arkansas Habitual Criminal Act. <em>McConahay v. State, supra. </em>The constitutionally defective stipulation by Cox\u2019s counsel was the only evidence of those convictions at the state court trial. The error in receiving that stipulation was presumptively prejudicial unless the State can show that, absent the stipulation, it possessed at the time of trial evidence establishing at least the three prior convictions necessary to support Cox\u2019s sentence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">Attached to the record of the state court postconviction proceedings are certified docket entries relating to the following prior felony convictions of Cox:</p>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">1) Convictions in Arkansas state court, on October 3, 1962, following pleas of guilty to two counts of stealing cattle;</p>\n<p id=\"b460-12\">2) Arkansas convictions on July 11, 1966, following pleas of guilty to two counts of burglary; and</p>\n<p id=\"b460-13\">3) Arkansas convictions on February 19,1970, following a jury trial, of burglary and grand larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-14\">We assume that the state prosecutor could have introduced these docket sheets in evidence at the trial, absent the stipulation by defendant\u2019s counsel. However, the Arkansas Supreme Court has held that a docket sheet may not be used to establish a prior conviction for purposes of sentencing under the habitual criminal statute. <em>Reeves v. State, </em>258 Ark. 788, 528 S.W.2d 924, 928 (1975). Moreover, the evidence of a defendant\u2019s prior convictions for purposes of applying the Arkansas habitual criminal statute must establish that the defendant either received assistance from an attorney or validly waived counsel at the time of each prior conviction. <em>See Klimas v. State, </em>259 Ark. 301, 534 S.W.2d 202, 204, <em>cert. denied, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>429 U.S. 846, 97 S.Ct. 128, 50 L.Ed.2d 117 (1976); <em>McConahay </em>v. <em>State, </em>257 Ark. 328, 516 S.W.2d 887, 888 (1974); <em>Wilburn v. State, </em>253 Ark. 608, 487 S.W.2d 600, 602 (1972). Only the docket entry for Cox\u2019s 1966 conviction, which notes that he waived counsel, unambiguously performs that function here.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, the docket entries, standing alone, do not constitute sufficient evidence of Cox\u2019s prior convictions and, therefore, fail to overcome the presumption of prejudice from the erroneous admission of his counsel\u2019s stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Because of the stipulation by Cox\u2019s counsel, however, the State did not introduce at trial evidence of Cox\u2019s prior convictions. At the habeas proceeding, the State made no showing of its possession of proper evidence of Cox\u2019s convictions, because the district court inappropriately placed the burden upon Cox of establishing prejudice emanating from this constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Accordingly, we remand this case to the district court for a redetermination of whether Cox sustained any prejudice from the defective stipulation of prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">If the State fails to establish that it possessed evidence in proper form of at least three prior felony convictions of Cox, the district court should issue a writ of habeas corpus ordering Cox\u2019s release from the sentence imposed unless the State of Arkansas decides either to retry Cox or to resentence him to the two-year term assessed by the jury for the burglary offense, which sentence shall be increased by the minimum penalty for whatever prior convictions are validly established in accordance with the Arkansas habitual criminal statute. <em>Cf. Klimas v. State, supra, </em>534 S.W.2d at 207; <em>McConahay v. State, supra, </em>516 S.W.2d at 889 (reducing sentence to minimum for present conviction, plus three years for two unquestioned previous convictions; in the alternative, a new trial); <em>Wilburn v. State, supra, </em>487 S.W.2d at 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b459-14\">. The district court, however, granted Cox\u2019s request for credit against his sentence for his pretrial incarceration from March 29, 1973, until July 17, 1973. That ruling is not at issue on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b460-6\">. Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 does not apply to state court proceedings. Nevertheless, the stipulation to prior convictions by a defendant subject to a habitual criminal statute, such as that in Arkansas, produces as drastic an effect as any guilty plea. The trial court is required at least to question a defendant to determine whether the consequences of the admissions are understood and whether he consented to them. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Terrack, </em>515 F.2d 558 (9th Cir. 1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b460-7\">. The trial court sentenced Cox under Ark.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 43-2328(3), which provides that a person convicted of a fourth .or subsequent offense punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary</p>\n<p id=\"AGW\">shall be sentenced to imprisonment for the fourth or subsequent offense for a determinate term not less than the maximum sentence * <em>* </em>* for a first conviction of the offense for which the defendant is being tried, and not more than one and one half (IV2) times [that] maximum sentence * * ; provided, that [the sentence for the fourth or subsequent offense shall not be less than five years.]</p>\n<p id=\"b460-16\">Ark.Stat.Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 43-2328(1) and (2) provide for lesser determinate sentences upon a person\u2019s second or third conviction for an offense punishable by penitentiary imprisonment. Thus, the length of Cox\u2019s sentence depended upon the number of his prior convictions proven at trial, as well as the sentence prescribed for the crime charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-17\">As the burglary offense for which Cox stands convicted in this case carries a maximum first-offense sentence of 21 years, the prosecution had to prove at least three prior convictions of Cox to support his 31\u2018/2 year sentence under subsection 3 of the habitual criminal statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b461-9\">. The docket entries for Cox\u2019s 1962 and 1970 convictions note appearances by various counsel but fail to unambiguously indicate whether those attorneys represented Cox or one or more of his codefendants in those cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
