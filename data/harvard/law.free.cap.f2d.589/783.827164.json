The debts were properly garnisheed under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 659. The Navy has refused to pay over the monies, however, because a Tennessee court, at the former husband\u2019s request, issued an injunction barring the United States from releasing payments to Mrs. Stephens.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-23\">Still seeking relief, Mrs. Stephens has now sued in federal court to enforce her Virginia court judgments. Section 659, however, does not confer federal jurisdiction. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 660 (part of the same statutory scheme specifically providing for federal jurisdiction in other circumstances). And jurisdiction does not lie under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a)(2) since \u00a7 659 merely waives the defense of sovereign immunity to state proceedings, while not creating a federal cause of action. <em>Cf. Gully v. First Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>299 U.S. 109, 116, 57 S.Ct. 96, 81 L.Ed. 70 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-24\">We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-25\">We anticipate, however, that the government will move swiftly to resolve this dispute by instituting an interpleader action in federal court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1335. <em>See also Stephens v. United States Department of Navy, </em>586 F.2d 844 (6th Cir. 1978) (Order).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-26\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
