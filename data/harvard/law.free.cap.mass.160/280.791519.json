It appeared that the police court had jurisdiction, that it was a court competent to pass the order of adjournment with the defendant\u2019s consent, that the order was apparently for his benefit, that it was passed in his presence and without objection on his part, and that he recognized for his appearance at the time fixed; and there was nothing to show that he did not consent to the adjournment. <em>Held, </em>that his consent was to be presumed, and that the omission to set it forth in terms in the order did not render the proceedings invalid.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>Complaint, to the police court of the city of Brockton, for unlawfully exposing and keeping intoxicating liquors for sale with intent to sell the same without a license. In the Superior Court the defendant moved to dismiss, and, after verdict and before judgment, in arrest of judgment, because it appeared in the record that an examination or trial was continued by the police court for a period of more than ten days, without the consent of the defendant. The Superior Court overruled both motions, and the defendant appealed to this court. The material facts appear in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b301-5\"><em>T.

Under these circumstances her consent is to be implied or presumed. \u00a1No statute requires that her consent should expressly appear of record, and the omission to set it forth in terms does not render the proceedings invalid. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Lynn, 154 Mass. 405; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>147 Mass. 545; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ingersoll, </em>145 Mass. 381, 383; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>143 Mass. 84 ; <em>Jeffries </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>12 Allen, 145, 153, 154; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dillane, </em>11 Gray, 67; <em>Turns </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>6 Met. 224 ; <em>Cornett </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>20 Wall. 226, 250; <em>McNitt v.

The court having had jurisdiction of the case, there is the same presumption in favor of the regularity of its order of continuance, which was merely an intermediate step in the cause, as if it had been a court of general jurisdiction. 1 Smith\u2019s Lead.
