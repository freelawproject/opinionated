One of the minors, named Murphy, testified that he bought beer at the defendant\u2019s place of business of Frank Gavin, the defendant\u2019s bar-keeper, on July 4, 1892, on Thanksgiving night, 1892, and on January 8, 1893.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-11\">At the close of the evidence, the defendant asked the judge to rule that there was no evidence that intoxicating liquors had been illegally sold by the defendant during the time in question, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>the attention of the judge being called to the fact that the only evidence of sales was of beer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-3\">To this the judge replied that, as he remembered the evidence, John Gavin, the defendant\u2019s bar-keeper, had been asked by the district attorney, on cross-examination, whether he had sold intoxicating liquor to Murphy within the time covered by the indictment, to which the witness replied, \u201c Yes \u201d ; and that the district attorney then asked, \u201c What?\u201d and he answered, \u201c Beer.\u201d The judge thereupon declined to rule as requested; and.the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-4\">The judge instructed the jury that, if they found that John Gavin testified as above stated, they would be justified in finding \u201c beer,\u201d as used by the witnesses, to mean intoxicating liquor; and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-5\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b544-6\"><em>T&gt;.

No question seems to have been raised as to his competency to make the statement, and the evidence does not appear to have been objected to. The testimony was evidence that the beer sold by the witness was intoxicating. <em>Haines </em>v. <em>Hanrahan, </em>105 Mass. 480. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. White, 15 Gray, 407. <em>Carl </em>v. <em>State, </em>87 Ala. 17, 23. It follows that the presiding judge could not rule that there was no evidence that intoxicating liquors had been sold illegally.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">The minor Murphy testified that he had bought beer at the same place of the defendant\u2019s bar-keeper, Frank Gavin, at different times. The judge instructed the jury that, if they found that John Gavin testified as above stated, they would be justified in finding \u201cbeer\u201d as used by the witnesses to mean intoxicating liquor. So far as appears, the jury might have inferred that the bar-keeper referred to by the minor was the same who had testified, notwithstanding the minor\u2019s calling him Frank. If so, they well might infer that he meant the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>kind of beer with reference to all the occasions, that the barkeeper\u2019s evidence referred to one of these at least, and that the kind was shown by the bar-keeper\u2019s evidence. But if there were two bar-keepers, both named Gavin, the one who testified showed that intoxicating beer was kept for sale on the premises and had been bought by the same minor there. It is not a very violent inference that, when the minor testified to other purchases of beer on the premises, he meant the same kind of thing, whatever may be the limit of the jury\u2019s right to interpret the English language as commonly used apart from any elucidation from the circumstances. See <em>Myers </em>v. State, 93 Ind. 251; <em>Briffitt </em>v. <em>State, </em>58 Wis. 39; Black, Intoxicating Liquors, \u00a7 17. Whether the instruction extended to any other testimony than that of Murphy, is not made clear by the bill of exceptions. But if we are to take it as doing so, in the absence of any statement except that the government put in evidence that beer was sold upon the premises by the defendant\u2019s bar-keeper to minors, we cannot say that it was wrong. It appears that the bar-keeper had intoxicating beer for sale, and it does not appear that he had any other. t <em>Exceptions </em>overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
