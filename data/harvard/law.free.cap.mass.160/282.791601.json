Streets to W. Avenue \u201d; that the sewer was laid through private land below the point where it passed the defendant\u2019s house, without other authority than the statute and the landowners\u2019 unrecorded waiver under seal of damages, and that it was laid through the defendant\u2019s land at a place above his own house, and the defendant neither had licensed it nor had been paid for it. <em>Held, </em>that the order was sufficiently definite, and implied an adjudication of necessity; that the sewer was lawful below the defendant\u2019s house, and that it was immaterial that the waiver was not recorded; that if the sewer was unlawful where it crossed the land above, it was not made unlawful <em>throughout; </em>that the failure to keep the plan of the sewer in the city clerk\u2019s office had no bearing on the <em>proceedings; </em>and that a short answer to most of the defendant\u2019s objections was that they could be taken only by certiorari.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-9\">Appeal, from a judgment upon a complaint from the police court of Lynn, charging that the defendant on May 2, 1892, \u201c did own and maintain a certain building situated on a public street in said Lynn, in which said street there is a public sewer, without connecting with said public sewer as required by St. 1890, c. 182, \u00a7 1, of said Commonwealth, and the regulations of the board of health of said city of Lynn.\u201d Trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Dunbar, </em>J., who reported the case, at the defendant\u2019s request, for the determination of the Supreme Judicial Court, in substance as follows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-10\">On the day named in the complaint, the defendant owned and maintained a dwelling-house situated and abutting upon New Chatham Street, a public street in Lynn, through which street a sewer was then laid under an order of the city council of Lynn, as follows: \u201c Ordered, that the committee on drainage be and hereby is instructed to extend Section 3 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Eastern Intercepting Sewer from, its present terminus through Chatham and New Chatham Streets to Western Avenue.\u201d The sewer extended from Old Chatham Street and from a point near Saratoga Street through private land of the defendant never taken by the city by purchase, by the right of eminent domain, or otherwise, except as herein stated, or by any license from the defendant, unless his allowing the sewer to remain there should be construed as such license, and thence through New Chatham Street and past the building in question situated on New Chat-ham Street; thence, by other orders formally adopted, through Marianna Street and private land to Collins Street; thence across Collins Street and other private land into Goodwin\u2019s Court; and so on, through various streets and private lands of different proprietors, to the sea.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-5\">This sewer was constructed at the expense of the city, but the mayor and aldermen never adjudged this sewer to be necessary for the public convenience or public health. It was agreed that the city charter, which was duly accepted, being St. 1850, c. 184, in \u00a7 15 provides that \u201cthe city council shall have authority to cause drains and common sewers to be laid down through any streets or private lands, paying the owners such damage as they may sustain thereby.\u201d It was also agreed that the city from time to time had received in payment sums of money from people owning buildings upon the streets through which the sewer passed for the privilege of opening their particular drain into the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-6\">The private lands through which, the sewer was laid, both above and below the point where the dwelling-house was situated, were never taken by the city by purchase or by right of eminent domain except as herein stated, or by license from any of the owners of such lands, unless a waiver of damages under seal signed by them of the tenor following should be construed as such license: \u201cWe, the undersigned, in consideration of one dollar paid by the city of Lynn, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, do hereby waive any and all damages that have accrued or may hereafter accrue to us or either of us by the construction and maintenance by said city of a sewer through and in land belonging to us,\u201d which waiver was never acknowledged or recorded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-7\">The defendant never signed the waiver or any paper of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>purport, or gave the city any actual lic\u00e9nse whatever to lay the sewer through his land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-5\">No plan of the sewer was ever kept in the office of the city clerk, but a plan was kept in the office of the city engineer, which office was in the same building with the city clerk\u2019s office.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-6\">It was further agreed that there was in the city a duly and legally constituted board of health, and that the defendant was required seasonably, before the day named in the complaint, by the board, by due and proper notice, to connect his said dwelling-house, building, and premises with the sewer, which he refused to do before the complaint was made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-7\">The defendant requested the judge to rule that, if he should rule that the statute was constitutional, he should rule that the. jury would not be warranted in finding a verdict of guilty upon the foregoing facts. The judge declined so to rule, and the defendant submitted to a verdict of guilty, which was returned by the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-8\">If the ruling requested should have been given, the verdict was to be set aside and a new trial granted; otherwise, judgment was to be entered on the verdict.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b304-9\"><em>D. 0.

The constitutionality of the act now is admitted; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>155 Mass. 281. The commission of the offence also is admitted, subject only to the question whether the sewer was a public sewer.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-12\">The city council attempted to lay out the sewer under the authority conferred upon it by the charter. St. 1850, c. 184, \u00a7 15. If the charter was repealed by St. 1869, c. Ill, Pub. Sts. c. 50, \u00a7\u00a7 1-3, it is not argued that the order of the mayor and aldermen was invalidated by the assent of the common council. <em>Woodbridge </em>v. <em>Mayor, &amp;c. of Cambridge, </em>114 Mass. 483, 485.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-14\">The form of the order was as follows: \u201c Ordered, that the committee on drainage be and hereby is instructed to extend Section 3 of the Eastern Intercepting Sewer from its present terminus through Chatham and New Chatham Streets to West-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>era Avenue.\u201d It is suggested, without being pressed, that this order is void for indefiniteness. But no set form of words is required. Both ends of the sewer and the streets through which it is to run are fixed, and a present intention to establish the sewer is expressed. This is enough. <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>New </em>Bedford, 110 Mass. 433, 437. <em>Carr </em>v. Dooley, 122 Mass. 255, 257. <em>Sheehan </em>v. Fitchburg, 131 Mass. 523. It is argued with more confidence, that there should have been an express adjudication that the sewer was necessary for the public convenience or the public health. By Pub. Sts. c. 50, \u00a7 1, the authority conferred is to lay such drains \u201c as they adjudge to be necessary,\u201d etc. But it was assumed in the last two cases cited that a sewer might be laid out without an express adjudication of necessity. In <em>Woodbridge </em>v. Mayor, &amp;c. <em>of </em>Cambridge, also, the papers disclose no such adjudication. \u201c This necessity is sufficiently implied in their action on the subject; inasmuch as they can act only in such a case.\u201d <em>Townsend </em>v. Hoyle, 20 Conn. 1, 8. Mr. Dillon adds the weight of his opinion to the same view. Dillon, Mun. Corp. (4th ed.) \u00a7 601. <em>Wellesley </em>v. <em>Washburn, </em>156 Mass. 359, 360. See <em>Hildreth </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>11 Gray, 345, 352, 353; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Andover, </em>9 Pick. 146, 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The sewer is laid through private land, below the point where it passes the defendant\u2019s house, without other authority than the statute and the landowners\u2019 unrecorded waiver under seal of damages for the construction or maintenance of a sewer through and in their land. It is suggested that enough has not been done to make this part of the sewer lawful, and that the defendant, if he connects with it, may find himself incurring liability for trespass. But, without considering other questions, the charter and the Public Statutes both give a right to lay the sewer through private lands, paying the owners their damages, and the waiver, as it is called, disposes of the claim for damages. We do not see what more is to be done, or how it is material that the release of damages is not recorded. See <em>Isele </em>v. <em>Schwamb, </em>131 Mass. 337, 339; <em>Grover </em>v. <em>Flye, </em>5 Allen, 543. The sewer also is laid through the defendant\u2019s land at a place above his house, and the defendant neither has licensed it nor has been paid for it. But even if this made the laying of that portion of the sewer wrongful, it would not make the whole lay-out void. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>We hardly need to say that the failure to keep the plan in the city clerk\u2019s office (Pub. Sts. c. 50, \u00a7 14) has no bearing on these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">We have dealt with the defendant\u2019s arguments and objections in detail, but the short answer to most of them is that they are not open in this proceeding, but can be taken only by certiorari. <em>Brewer </em>v. <em>Boston, Clinton, &amp; Fitchburg Railroad, </em>113 Mass. 52, 56, 57. <em>Old Colony Railroad </em>v. <em>Fall River, </em>147 Mass. 455. <em>Taft </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>158 Mass. 526, 551.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
