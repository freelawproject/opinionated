After there shall have been paid under this contract three full years\u2019 premiums, if default shall be made in any payment within specified, the entire reserve on this policy, as calculated at that date according to the actuaries\u2019 table of mortality, with interest at the rate of four per cent per annum, and the net annual premiums method, after deducting the amount of any note, draft, indebtedness, or charge, with the interest thereon accrued against this policy, shall, on written demand made at the company\u2019s principal office in New York City, upon the blank forms furnished by the company on application therefor, within six months after such default, and during the life of the insured, be taken as a single premium to continue the insurance named in this policy in force at its full amount for such time beyond such default as such single premium will purchase that amount as (non-participating) paid up insurance at the company\u2019s present published rates, taken at the age (nearest birthday) of the insured at the date of said default, subject to all the conditions and agreements of this contract; provided, however, that if the death of the insured occurs within three years after such default, and during such continued time of insurance, there shall be deducted from the principal sum payable the amount of all payments that would have become due up to the time of said death had no default Occurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">The policy was dated May 28, 1887, and the premiums were duly paid thereon semiannually up to and including the premium due May 28, 1890; thereafter no premiums were paid. Ernest \u2022H. Porter, the insured, died on July 1,1891. Neither he nor any one in his behalf made a written demand upon the company for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>an extension of the policy pursuant to the fifth condition on the back. The principal contentions on the part of the plaintiff are that the defendant\u2019s agent (Waite) had waived the condition requiring such written demand, or that by his conduct the company was estopped from relying upon the failure of the insured to comply with this condition, or that the conditions on the back of the policy are not within the \u201c terms or conditions \u201d mentioned in the fifth condition on the face of the policy. We think that there is nothing in the last contention. By the eighth condition on the face of the policy, the conditions on the back are made a part of the contract as fully as if they were recited at length over the signatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">There was evidence on the part of the plaintiff from which the jury might find, as they did, that the neglect of the insured to make the demand for an extension of the policy pursuant to the fifth condition on the back was occasioned by what was said to the insured or to his agent by Waite, although Waite was called as a witness and contradicted this evidence; and the jury might also find from this evidence that the company had waived- this condition, or was estopped from setting it up if Waite, without the consent or knowledge of the company, or of its president and secretary or actuary, could waive it, or by his conduct could estop the company from relying upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The terms of the policy are clear. The contract is to become null and void if the premiums are not paid when due, except as provided in the special conditions on the back of the policy, and these conditions cannot be modified or waived except in writing signed by the president and secretary or actuary. The receipts for premiums given to the insured stated that \u201c No person except the president, secretary, assistant secretary, or actuary is authorized to make, alter, or discharge contracts, or waive forfeitures.\u201d It does not appear that Waite ever before had attempted to waive the conditions of the policy, or that the company or its directors, or that the president and secretary or actuary ever knew that Waite had ever made such an attempt, or claimed to have any such power. There is no evidence of any conduct of the company, or of any officers expressly authorized to waive any of the conditions of the policy, which can be held to estop the company unless Waite\u2019s conduct can have that effect; and we do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>see how Waite\u2019s conduct can have that effect unless he was authorized to waive the conditions, or was held out by the company as having such authority. We see no evidence that he was authorized to waive this condition, or was held out by the company as having such authority, and there has been no ratification by the company of any waiver by him. The condition we are considering concerns the continuance of the contract, and goes to the substance of the plaintiff\u2019s claim. Evidence that he had authority to send for the blanks on which the written demand was to be made, is not evidence that he had authority to waive such a demand. We think that the failure to perform a condition of a contract the performance of which is essential to the continuance of the contract cannot be waived by an agent when the contract itself declares that he shall not have power to waive it, or that only certain officers which do not include him shall have such power, unless after the contract was made authority has been given to the agent to waive the condition, or the company has knowingly permitted him to waive such condition. <em>Kyte </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Assurance Co. </em>144 Mass. 43. <em>Putnam Tool Co. </em>v. <em>Fitchburg Ins.
