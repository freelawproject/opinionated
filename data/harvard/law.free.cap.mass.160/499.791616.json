That the plaintiff is not a preferred creditor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b519-11\">The case was submitted to the Superior Court, and, after judgment for the defendant, to this court, on appeal, upon agreed facts, in substance as follows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b519-12\">The defendant is the administrator of the estate of Ella L. M. Starr, who died on October 8,1889, leaving property consisting of an undivided fourth part of a tract of land in Roxbury, subject to a life interest of Robert W. Molineux, father of the intestate, and subject to a mortgage for $600 and interest, given on October 11,1884, to one Amy R. Newell.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b519-13\">On January 6, 1890, the defendant petitioned the Probate Court\" for license to sell the land of his intestate for the payment of debts, and on January 21, 1890, after due notice and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>advertisement, and acting under a license duly obtained, he sold the land to the life tenant for the sum of eight hundred dollars, and on the same day delivered to the purchaser a deed thereof. At the same time, the mortgage and the note secured thereby \u2014 which, three days before, on payment by the defendant of the sum of $789.90, being the amount of the mortgage and accrued interest, out of his individual estate, had been assigned by Amy R. Newell to Anna W. Molineux -\u2014 were assigned by the last named to the purchaser of the land, at his request, for the protection of the title. Neither the advertisement of the sale, the purchaser\u2019s agreement, nor the deed from the defendant to the purchaser, made any mention of the mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-5\">From the proceeds of the sale of the land the defendant retained, in reimbursement of the money which he had expended out of his individual estate in procuring an assignment of the mortgage, the sum of seven hunded and eighty-six dollars. The balance was exhausted by the payment of the funeral expenses, and the charges of administration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-6\">On October 13, 1890, the defendant\u2019s first and final account as administrator was presented, and allowed by the Probate Court. In it he charged himself with the receipt of the eight hundred dollars received from the sale of the land, and credited himself with the payment of the mortgage note and interest, amounting to seven hundred and eighty-six dollars, and with the payment of claims entitled to a preference to an amount exceeding the balance of the sum so received.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-7\">The claim of the plaintiff, and the reasonableness of his charges, were admitted by the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b520-8\"><em>B.

The only property was an interest in real estate subject to a mortgage. This was sold by the defendant for eight hundred dollars, that being just about the amount of the mortgage and interest. The question more specifically is, whether the eight hundred dollars are to be applied to the mortgage in the first place. The plaintiff, going on the fact that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>defendant, as administrator, only had authority to sell the intestate\u2019s interest, assumes that the proceeds of the sale were received for the equity of redemption; and if this is so, the rest of his argument is plain sailing. But there was nothing to prevent the defendant from selling the land free of the mortgage, if he could arrange to do so. In fact, at the time of the sale the defendant had bought and owned the mortgage. Whether properly or not, the advertisement makes no mention of the mortgage, the purchaser\u2019s agreement and the deed to him made no mention of it, and after the sale the mortgage was assigned to the purchaser, seemingly as part of that for which he had paid his eight hundred dollars. The account evidently was not intended to express a different transaction, although it puts in the whole eight hundred dollars on one side, and the mortgage debt on the other. Putting it at the lowest, if the agreed statement was intended to authorize the Superior Court to draw inferences of fact, the court was well warranted in inferring that the eight hundred dollars was paid for the land free of the mortgage. If no power to draw inferences was intended to be given, the plaintiff cannot get paid unless the contrary appears as matter of law. Of course, if the land was sold free of encumbrances by arrangement with the holder of the mortgage, only what was left after paying the mortgage would belong to the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Although the case comes before us upon an agreed statement, and although the plea of <em>plena administravit </em>is not used in Massachusetts, (6 Dane\u2019s Abr. 144, <em>Cushing </em>v. Field, 9 Met. 180, 181,) substantially the defendant is in the position of one who prevails upon such a plea, since the few dollars of assets appear by the account to have been exhausted in paying preferred claims. Pub. Sts. c. 136, \u00a7 5. If, as we are inclined to take it, the statement was intended to give the Superior Court power to draw inferences of fact, the defendant prevails upon an issue of fact. Therefore he would be entitled to judgment, according to the modern English law. Wms, Ex. (7th ed.) 1979, 1980. 2 Wms. Saund. 217, note 1. 1 Rolle\u2019s Abr. Executors, 929 (B), pl. 2. See Y. B. 33 Hen. VI. 23, 24, pl. 1; 34 Hen. VI. 24, pl. 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Some American cases have' given the plaintiff judgment of assets <em>quando acciderint. Osterhout </em>v. Hardenbergh, 19 Johns. 266. <em>Nimmo </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>1 Hen. &amp; M. 470. <em>Burnes </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number><em>Burton, </em>1 A. K. Marsh. 349. And although that form of judgment has not been used in this State, <em>(Cushing </em>v. <em>Field, </em>9 Met. 180, 182,) yet as a judgment <em>de bonis testatoris </em>against an administrator here does not establish conclusively that he has assets in his hands sufficient to -pay it, it might be possible to enter such a judgment for the plaintiff. <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>142 Mass. 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">On the other hand, it was assumed in the Year Books cited that a judgment for the defendant on <em>plene administravit </em>is no bar in case of new assets coming to his hands, and if not, there is no objection to entering judgment for the defendant. Clearly it ought not to be a bar in such case, since the plea admits the debt. . <em>Shipley's case, </em>8 Co. Rep. 134. The plea is \u201c not a perpetual bar; for if it had been so found as was pleaded, yet assets coming after to the hand of the executor, the plaintiff should then have relief and satisfaction out of these since accrued assets.\u201d Wentw. Ex. (Am. ed. 1832) 344, 345. See also Markham and Prisot, JJ., in Y. B. 34 Hen. VI. 24. So after entry of judgment for so much as was found to be in the executor\u2019s hands, as was formerly the practice in the English Court of Common Pleas, <em>(Hargthorpe </em>v. <em>Milforth, </em>Cro. Eliz. 318, 2 Wms. Ex. (7th ed.) 1976,) it cannot be doubted that the residue of the debt could be recovered if new assets should come into his hands. In Townesend, Second Book of Judgments, 68, pi. 29, it is said that .the plaintiff could have <em>scire facias </em>on such a judgment upon assets <em>in futuro. </em>Acc. Fortescue, C. J. and Prisot, J., in Y. B. 34 Hen. VI. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">In addition to these general considerations, it is to be noticed that the language of the statute allowing the settlement of an account showing that the estate has been exhausted in paying preferred claims to be pleaded is, \u201c such settlement shall be a sufficient bar to any action \u201d by a common creditor; Pub. Sts. c. 136, \u00a7 5 ; and that the record in the case of <em>Parcher </em>v. <em>Bussell, </em>11 Cush. 107, shows that judgment was entered in this court for the defendant on <em>plene administravit. </em>In view of these facts, and as we are of opinion that, if new assets should come to the defendant\u2019s hands, the plaintiff could recover his debt under Pub. Sts. c. 136, \u00a7 11, notwithstanding the present judgment, we are of opinion that the proper form will be to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>enter judgment for the defendant on the agreed statement. If there were no agreed statement, it would be proper that the judgment should show the ground it goes on, and that the plaintiff prevails upon the general denial in the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-3\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
