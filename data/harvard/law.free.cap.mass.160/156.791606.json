The following paper, signed by W., was offered in evidence by the defendant: \u201c Bockland, Jan\u2019y 28, 1892. Received Mrs. Haley, five months rent paid to January 28, 1892.\u201d W. at the time of the trial was out of the Commonwealth. <em>Held., </em>that the paper was rightly excluded.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-9\">Complaint for keeping a liquor nuisance in the town of Rock-land, from October 1, 1891, to March 12, 1892. At the trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Mason, </em>C. J., there was evidence tending to show that the defendant kept the premises in question during the time covered by the complaint, and that while so kept the premises were used, with his knowledge and consent, for the sale of intoxicating liquor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-10\">The defendant denied that he kept the premises, but contended that they were kept by one Haley, with whom he was only a boarder. The premises were owned by one William Hackett. The following paper, shown to be in the handwriting of Hackett, was offered in evidence by the defendant, and it appeared that at the time of the trial Hackett was out of the Commonwealth: \u201c Rockland, Jan\u2019y 28, 1892. Received Mrs. Haley, five months rent paid to January 28, 1892. Received payment, William Hackett.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-11\">The paper was excluded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-12\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b176-13\"><em>W.

He was yet living, and therefore the receipt could not be admitted as a declaration against interest made by a person since deceased. Neither he nor Mrs. Haley was called to testify to the payment, and the admission of the receipt could not be urged on the ground that it was a part of the <em>res </em>gestee, accompanying the act of payment. It was not a voucher produced by a guardian or an executor in support of his account, verified by oath, as in <em>Shearman </em>v. <em>Akins, </em>4 Pick. 283, 293. As independent evidence standing alone, it was not competent against the Commonwealth. <em>McAvoy </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>137 Mass. 207. 1 Greenl.
