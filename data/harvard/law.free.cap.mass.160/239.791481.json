There was space enough for him to drive on the outside of the tracks without danger of collision with the cars. The evidence was contradictory whether he attempted to get out of the rail or drove straight ahead till the wagon and car collided. His view of the approaching car was unobstructed, and there was nothing to prevent him from turning out. The driver of the car <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>had a right to assume that he would turn out seasonably. When the driver became aware that the plaintiff was not going to turn out, it was his duty to do what he reasonably could to avoid a collision. The jury were so instructed, and may have found so. The jury were also rightly instructed that the plaintiff could not recover if the accident was due to his own negligence, and that if he was where he ought not to be, but was not negligent in being there, the driver was bound to do what he reasonably could to prevent injury to him. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n<attorneys id=\"APR\"><em>C.

Even if the plaintiff were in a place on the road where he had no right to be, that would be no excuse for defendant to rush upon him and injure him.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
