The first count was for an assault and battery; and the second count was for forcibly entering the plaintiff\u2019s close in Springfield. The case was submitted to the Superior Court, and, after judgment for the defendant, to this court, on appeal, upon agreed facts, in substance as follows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-13\">The plaintiff was in the rightful possession-of a tenement on the second floor of a house in Springfield. His tenement was reached by a flight of stairs, at the head of which was a door opening into a hall, at one end of which a door opened into the kitchen, and at the other end a door opened into the plaintiff\u2019s sleeping-room. The hallway was part of the plaintiff\u2019s premises, and the outer entrance was about midway of its length.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-14\">The defendant was a milkman in the employ of the Springfield Milk Association, and he delivered milk to the plaintiff at an early hour every morning. The hall and kitchen doors were left unlocked, so that the defendant could enter and leave the milk in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>the kitchen. For some time prior to the act complained of, the defendant had, with the plaintiff\u2019s permission, occasionally entered the plaintiff\u2019s sleeping-room through the door from the hall for the purpose of collecting the milk bills. Prior to the alleged trespass, the plaintiff had forbidden the defendant entering the sleeping-room any more. On the morning in question, after a night of suffering from sick headache, the plaintiff had fallen asleep, when the defendant, entering the sleeping-room from the hall, after having left milk in the kitchen as usual, and finding the plaintiff asleep, took hold of his arm and shoulders and used sufficient force to awaken him for the purpose of presenting a milk bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-3\">If, upon these facts, the defendant was guilty of a trespass, as alleged, the plaintiff was to be awarded such sum for damages as to the court should seem just; otherwise, judgment was to be entered for the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b55-4\"><em>A.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZI\">The declaration contains two counts: one for an assault and battery upon the plaintiff, and the other for forcibly entering the plaintiff\u2019s close. The agreed facts show that the defendant entered the plaintiff\u2019s close by his permission. The fact that, after the defendant entered by permission through the outer door into the hall, he went, against the commands of the plaintiff, into the plaintiff\u2019s sleeping-room, does not constitute a trespass upon the close. <em>Smith </em>v. Pierce, 110 Mass. 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">But the facts show a trespass upon the person of the plaintiff. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Clark, 2 Met. 23. On the facts agreed, it must be taken that the defendant, against the express commands of the plaintiff, entered the plaintiff\u2019s sleeping-room and \u201c took hold of his arm and shoulders and used sufficient force to awaken the plaintiff for the purpose of presenting a milk bill.\u201d If there were any circumstances which would justify this, they do not appear in the agreed statement of facts. Although this trespass is slight, the damages are not necessarily nominal, and they should be left to be assessed by the Superior Court. The judgment should be reversed, and, in accordance with the agreed statement, the plaintiff\u2019s damages should be assessed under the first count.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
