Hearing before <em>Braley, </em>J., who ruled, as matter of law, that the libel could not be maintained, ordered it dismissed, and reported the case for the determination of this court. If the ruling was right, the order was to be affirmed ; if wrong, a decree of divorce nisi, for desertion, was to be entered.

She in good faith consulted a clergyman of good standing, who informed her that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>her marriage with Peirce had \u201c run out,\u201d and that she had \u201c a perfect legal right to get married \u201d; and believing this to be true, she was married to Flagg. The ease discloses no mistake of fact on the part of the libellant, but a mistake of law, and in accordance with our decisions the justice who heard the libel rightly ordered it to be dismissed. <em>Moors </em>v.
