The statute is silent. Intimations in favor of the right of double proof are to be found in <em>Borden </em>v. Cuyler, 10 Cush. 476, 477, and in <em>Mead </em>v. <em>National Bank of Fayetteville, </em>6 Blatchf. C. C. 180, and in the decisions in <em>In re Farnum, </em>6 Law Rep. 21 (by Judge Sprague), and <em>Ex parte Nason, </em>70 Maine, 363. The United States Bankrupt Act of March 2, 1867, \u00a7 21, U. S. Rev. Sts. \u00a7 5074, is construed to allow the right in terms. <em>Emery </em>v. <em>Canal National Bank, </em>3 Cliff. 507, collecting the cases, and repeating some of the general arguments at length. Formerly an arbitrary rule was worked out by degrees in England that the creditor must elect. <em>Ex parte Rowlandson, </em>3 P. Wms. 405. <em>Ex parte Moult, </em>Mont. 321; Mont. &amp; Bligh, 28; 1 Deac. &amp; Ch. 44; 2 Deac. &amp; Ch. 419. <em>Goldsmid </em>v. <em>Cazenove, </em>7 H. L. Cas. 785, 805. But this rule, after being disapproved by the most eminent judges, <em>(Ex parte Bevan, </em>9 Ves. 223, 225 ; 10 Ves. 107, 109; Story, Part. (7th ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 384-386; Eden, Bankruptcy, (2d ed.) 181,) has been done away with by statute in cases like the present. <em>Ex parte Honey, </em>L. R. 7 Ch. 178. In view of the modern decisions and the general agreement of opinion, we think it unnecessary to argue elaborately for the right of a creditor who has required two contracts binding two distinct estates to insist upon both. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>See further <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Hooper, </em>3 Gray, 334, 342; <em>Vanuxem </em>v. <em>Burr, </em>151 Mass. 386, 388, 389; <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Whitmore, </em>63 Maine, 526, 528; and <em>Miller's River National Bank </em>v. <em>Jefferson, </em>138 Mass. 111, 113. <em>Decree of court of insolvency affirmed.</em></p>\n<attorneys id=\"ASu\"><em>W.
