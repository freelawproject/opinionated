The defendant\u2019s bills of fare which were used in the hotel at the time of the alleged sale were produced, and no milk appeared thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-6\">The defendant contended, and asked the judge to rule, that, under a proper interpretation of the statute, he had sold no milk contrary to law, and was not amenable to the statute; and that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>if the table girl took milk from the cans designed for the use of the hotel kitchen contrary to his instructions, he was not answerable therefor under this complaint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b555-5\">The judge declined to rule as requested, and instructed the jury that if the defendant\u2019s servant, in the ordinary course of her employment, acting in good faith and intending to obey the defendant\u2019s instructions, delivered to Kelly upon his order the milk in question as a part of Kelly\u2019s breakfast, for which breakfast Kelly paid thirty-five cents, and the milk was not of good standard quality, the defendant was responsible under the statute, notwithstanding the servant negligently and by mistake took the milk from a can which had been set apart for use in the kitchen; but that the defendant was not responsible if his servant, in furnishing the milk upon Kelly\u2019s order, intentionally acted in disobedience of the defendant\u2019s instructions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b555-6\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b555-7\"><em>P. H. </em>Hutchinson, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b555-8\"><em>F.

St. 1886, c. 318, \u00a7 2. Mo criminal intent on the part of the master or principal is necessary in order to render him liable for a sale in violation of the statute, and he may consequently be held liable for an inadvertent sale in the course of his employment on the part of his servant or agent in violation of the statute. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Gray, 150 Mass. 327. The instructions on this point were sufficiently favorable to the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Emmons, </em>98 Mass. 6; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>140 Mass. 441. The milk bought by the witness Kelly was purchased by and delivered to him as a part of his breakfast, and was just as much a sale as if a specific price had been put upon it, or it had been bought and paid for by itself. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>126 Mass. 256.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
