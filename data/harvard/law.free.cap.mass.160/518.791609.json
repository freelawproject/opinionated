The plaintiff then said that he proposed to show \u201c that during this time the habitual condition of that depression was that it was coated with ice.\u201d Whereupon the judge asked him, \u201c Do you mean to say that you propose to show that this part of the sidewalk was covered with ice and snow continually for months previous to this accident?\u201d The plaintiff answered, \u201cI mean to show that that part was habitually, but not continuously, coated with ice; because there would be times when there was not any ice on any sidewalk in the winter; but at various times during the winter I propose to show that there was ice in that depression; it was the usual condition of that depression.\u201d The judge then said: \u201c For the purpose of showing that the form of the sidewalk was such that snow and ice would accumulate, I have allowed you to prove ; but that snow and ice were there, \u2014 actually there on those occasions, in some form, \u2014 I do not think it is admissible \u201d ; and the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-6\">The plaintiff asked a witness who testified that the day before the injury to the plaintiff she saw ice in the depression, \u201c Is there anything which causes you to remember particularly the condition of \"that walk on that day?\u201d The defendant objected to the question. The plaintiff then stated that he desired to show by this witness that her attention was called to there being ice in this depression the day before the injury to the plaintiff on account of her slipping on the same; that he did not contend that the fact that she slipped on this ice had any tendency to show that the defendant was liable to the plaintiff in this action; but that the fact of her slipping on ice in the depression was a circumstance which caused her to particularly examine the depression at that time, and to remember its condition. The\u2019 judge excluded the question, but the witness was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>not precluded from stating the extent and particularity of the-examination which she made of the place; and the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-5\">The defendant introduced evidence that the snow-storm above referred to was the last snow-storm of the season; that it ceased on the afternoon of March 18; and that the sidewalk was shovelled off about four o\u2019clock in the afternoon of that day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-6\">A police officer testified that he was on duty on Pine Street and elsewhere from eight o\u2019clock in the morning to six o\u2019clock in the afternoon; that he went over the sidewalk in front of 13 Pine Street four or five times a day; and that he did not remember specifically the condition of the walk on March 22.

From the questions put by the judge to the counsel for the plaintiff, and his answers, it appears that one object at least in asking what was the condition of the depression as to snow and ice during the previous winter was to show that there were snow and ice there for more or less continuous periods at different times. That the judge understood that to be in substance the offer would, seem to be indicated by his reply, or at least is fairly to be inferred from it. He said that he had allowed it to be shown that the form of the depression was such that ice and snow would accumulate there, but he did not think it admissible to show that \u201c snow and ice were there, actually there on those occasions in some form.\u201d The counsel for the plaintiff not only did not dissent from this view of what he had offered to show, but seems to have acquiesced in it, and to have excepted to the ruling as thus made. The ruling was clearly correct, according to this understanding of the offer; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>and we do not think that the plaintiff is now entitled to argue, upon a ground riot called to the attention of the court, that the evidence was admissible. <em>Wheeler </em>v. Rice, 8 Cush. 205. <em>Hamilton Woollen Co. </em>v. <em>Goodrich, </em>6 Allen, 191. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Leach, </em>107 Mass. 364. If this view of the course of the trial is erroneous, as it may be, it results from the imperfect manner in which the question is presented by the plaintiff in his exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">2. It was admitted that by the question put to the witness, \u201cIs there anything which causes you to remember particularly the condition of that walk on that day ? \u201d the purpose was to show that she remembered it because she slipped on the ice in the depression. The fact that she slipped was also admitted to be incompetent of itself to affect the defendant\u2019s liability. The question was not generally whether the attention of the witness was particularly directed to the depression, and whether she made a particular examination of it. It is expressly stated in the exceptions that the witness was not precluded from stating the extent and particularity of the examination which she made. We think that, under the circumstances, it was within the discretion of the court to exclude the question as put.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">3. If the police officer was not able to remember specifically the condition of the sidewalk on the day of the accident, but was able to remember its condition between certain dates which included the day of the accident, it was competent for him so to testify. The weight of the testimony was for the jury, and how far each side of the day of the accident the limit should extend was for the court, in the exercise of a reasonable discretion, to decide. We cannot say that its discretion was not reasonably exercised, though the limit might perhaps without injustice have been made shorter.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">\n<em>.Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
