The prayer of the bill was for the payment into court by the defendants of the plaintiff\u2019s distributive share of the personal property, for' his benefit, and for a conveyance to him of his undivided interest in the real property, as well as for an injunction restraining the defendants from conveying away the real property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-5\">The defendants demurred, on the grounds, among others, that the bill did not state a case for <em>relief; </em>that it showed a valid judgment and decree of a court of competent jurisdiction in California, not revoked or annulled, in which the plaintiff\u2019s rights, if any, were fully adjudicated, the validity of which the plaintiff could not draw in question in the courts of this Commonwealth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-6\">The Superior Court sustained the demurrer, and ordered the bill dismissed; and the plaintiff appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b490-7\"><em>W. A. Williams, </em>( <em>G-. B. Warfield </em>with him,) for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b490-8\"><em>W. A. Gfile, (E. B.

The plaintiff seeks to avoid the effect of the decree by alleging that it was obtained by the fraud, misrepresentation, and gross and wanton negligence and mistake of the defendants. The question raised by the demurrer is whether, admitting the facts alleged in the bill to be true, this court has any power to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>grant the relief prayed for, while the original decree remains unreversed by the court which made it, or by any appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The Constitution of the United States, art. 4, \u00a7 1, provides: \u201c Full faith and credit shall be given in each State to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">In <em>Christmas </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>5 Wall. 290, it was held, in an action on a judgment recovered in another State, that the fact that the judgment had been obtained by fraud could not be pleaded in defence. See also <em>Maxwell </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>22 Wall. 77, 81; <em>Hanley </em>v. <em>Donoghue, </em>116 U. S. 1, 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">The same principle has been held to apply where it is sought in one State to set aside a decree rendered in probate proceedings in another. <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Saul, </em>138 U. S. 439, 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">As the question before us depends upon the construction of a provision of the Federal Constitution, the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States are binding upon us. <em>Eliot </em>v. <em>McCormick, </em>144 Mass. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">If fraud in obtaining the decree cannot be inquired into, it follows that neither mistake, misrepresentation, nor gross and wanton negligence can be. See <em>Broderick's will, </em>21 Wall. 503.</p>\n<p id=\"AbV\">The decree dismissing the bill must be <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
