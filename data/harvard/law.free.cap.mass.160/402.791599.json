The Superior Court, on the plaintiff\u2019s motion, permitted the plaintiff by amendment to change the <em>ad damnum </em>of the writ from $10,000 to $15,000, and refused to rule that it had no power to permit the <em>ad damnum </em>to be increased, and to this the defendant excepted. We have no doubt that the court had the power. <em>Ellis </em>v. Ridgway, 1 Allen, 501. <em>Hart </em>v. <em>Waitt, </em>3 Allen, 532. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
