By stipulation of the parties the plaintiffs\u2019 appeals to this court were consolidated because the questions presented are substantially the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">The relevant facts as found by the two trial courts may be summarized as follows: On February 27, 1976, notices from the board and the superintendent of schools were sent to all 223 nontenured teachers in the Waterbury school system, stating that because of \u201csevere economic pressures and budgetary restraints\u201d the board had decided, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 10-151, not to renew their employment contracts for the school year 1976-1977. When asked by the teachers for a statement of reasons and a hearing, the board replied that budget cuts were expected, that it was uncertain how many teachers would be needed for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>1976-1977 school year, and that no hearing would be scheduled until the teachers indicated under what authority they claimed the right to a hearing. The named plaintiff Jaye Cammisa and the rest of the nontenured teachers appealed to the Court of Common Pleas. The court <em>(McGuinness, J.) </em>concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 rights of employment and appeal were governed by \u00a7 10-151 of the G-eneral Statutes and not by the Waterbury charter as claimed by the plaintiffs; that their contracts were properly nonrenewed under \u00a7 10-151 (a), which provides a right to an administrative hearing but not a right of appeal to a court; that the plaintiffs had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies; and that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Of the 223 <em>Cammisa </em>plaintiffs who received notices of nonrenewal dated February 27, 1976 (just prior to the March 1 deadline specified in \u00a7 10-151 [a]), only seventy-one were ultimately denied employment by a second notice of non-renewal dated June 16, 1976. The named plaintiff Linda DeToto and the other teachers so notified appealed again to the Court of Common Pleas. The court <em>(Kline, J.) </em>agreed with the reasoning of the <em>Cammisa </em>decision and sustained the board\u2019s plea in abatement, except as to three plaintiffs who had acquired tenure prior to the sending of the second notice of nonrenewal.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">We first consider the issue of mootness. At oral argument it was established that most of the plaintiffs who received second notices of nonrenewal were in fact rehired or reinstated for the 1976-1977 school year, but that approximately twenty plaintiffs had not been rehired. As to those plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>practical relief can follow from our decision and their appeal, therefore, may be maintained. See <em>Phaneuf </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>166 Conn. 449, 452, 352 A.2d 291. The board contends that the appeal is moot as to the two remaining groups of plaintiffs: the 152 plaintiffs in <em>Cammisa </em>who received only first notices of nonrenewal, and the approximately forty-eight <em>DeToto </em>plaintiffs who received second notices of nonrenewal but who were subsequently rehired, presumably during the summer preceding the 1976-1977 school year. The board\u2019s claim is disputed on the ground that the plaintiffs in both categories suffered injury as a result of the board\u2019s actions, such as loss of seniority and fringe benefits. Such questions of fact bearing on mootness and appropriate forms of relief are not part of the record before us and must be determined by the trial courts on remand, for we have decided that they erred in rendering judgments for the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Although the plaintiffs raise numerous claims of error, a single issue is dispositive of the case: whether their employment and appeal rights are governed by the Waterbary charter or by \u00a7 10-151 of the General Statutes. Section 10-151 applies by its terms to all teachers employed by boards of education but also provides, in subsection (d), that \u201c [t]he provisions of any special act regarding the dismissal or employment of teachers shall prevail over the provisions of this section in the event of conflict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">The initial question of statutory construction is whether \u201cdismissal\u201d as used in \u00a7 10-151 (d) encompasses nonrenewal of a nontenured teacher\u2019s contract; we hold that it does. Elsewhere, in subsec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>tions (a) and (b), the statute speaks only of contract \u201crenewal\u201d and \u201ctermination\u201d for nontenured and tenured teachers. The word \u201cdismissal\u201d appears but once, in subsection (d). This suggests that the legislature intended the term to have its customary broad meaning of sending or removing from office or employment, whether by terminating a teacher\u2019s contract or by declining to renew it. See Webster, Third New International Dictionary. Nothing in the language of \u00a7 10-151 indicates that the legislature was less solicitous of the rights of nontenured teachers created by special acts than of the rights of tenured teachers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Two provisions of the Waterbury charter have been brought to our attention as controlling the dismissal of teachers in Waterbury. Section 903 (b),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> enacted as Special Act No. 244, Special Acts of 1939, states that teachers in office shall hold their office unless dismissed by the board for cause, and that a dismissed teacher shall have a right of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>appeal to the Court of Common Pleas. Section 904,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> enacted as Special Act No. 499, \u00a7 270, Special Acts of 1931, empowers the superintendent of schools to appoint teachers to positions authorized by the board, and to dismiss them at his discretion. Section 904 further provides that any dismissal by the \u2022superintendent shall be final unless reversed by a majority vote of the board, and that the teacher to be dismissed is entitled to written notice from the superintendent at least one week prior to the board meeting at whieh the superintendent reports the dismissal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">The crux of the board\u2019s argument is that even if \u201cdismissal\u201d as expressed in General Statutes \u00a7 10-151 (d) includes, nonrenewal of a nontenured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>teacher\u2019s contract, dismissal for \u201ccause\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 903 of the charter connotes fault on the part of the teacher, such as incompetence or misconduct, and was not intended to cover elimination of the teacher\u2019s position for budgetary reasons. The board claims to find support for this construction of \u00a7 903 in the wording of \u00a7 904, which authorizes the superintendent to appoint teachers only to authorized positions. Therefore, the board suggests, the superintendent\u2019s power to dismiss teachers must be similarly limited to dismissals from authorized positions. When an authorized position is eliminated, the charter does not apply and the board has the power to dismiss the teacher occupying it in accordance with \u00a7 10-151 of the General Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">We disagree. Sections 903 and 904 of the charter are interrelated and must be read together. Their manifest intent is that all Waterbury teachers remain employed subject only to being dismissed for cause upon prior notice, with a right of appeal. \u201cCause\u201d cannot be given the narrow meaning urged by the board, for such an interpretation would lead to anomalous results. In enacting \u00a7 903 and \u00a7 904 the legislature could not reasonably have intended that a Waterbury teacher whose contract is not renewed because of his incompetence or misconduct is entitled to one week\u2019s notice and an appeal to the Court of Common Pleas, but that a Waterbury teacher whose contract is not renewed solely because his job has been eliminated is not so entitled. The logical conclusion is that \u201ccause\u201d in \u00a7 903 includes elimination of an authorized position. While the strained construction proposed by the board harmonizes to a certain extent the nonrenewal provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 10-151 (a) with the dismissal provisions of the charter, such an intention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>to reconcile the two laws cannot fairly be ascribed to the legislature. Section 903 of the charter was enacted in 1939, two years before nonrenewal provisions were added to the predecessor of General Statutes \u00a7 10-151 by \u00a7 142f of the 1941 Cumulative Supplement to the General Statutes. Thus the legislature could not have intended the charter to mesh with a nonexistent nonrenewal provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">We construe the legislative intent of subsection (d) of \u00a7 10-151, which states that the provisions of any special act regarding the dismissal or employment of teachers shall prevail over the provisions of \u00a7 10-151 <em>in the event of conflict, </em>to be a mandate prohibiting interference with the employment rights of those teachers who, at the time of their employment, were governed and protected by special acts such as the Waterbury charter. A contrary interpretation would impose upon the Waterbury teachers a status of probationary employment not contemplated at the time of their employment and not provided for in the Waterbury charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">We conclude that as claimed by the plaintiffs there is a conflict between their employment and appeal rights under the Waterbury charter and under General Statutes \u00a7 10-151. In such a ease, \u00a7 10-151 (d) commands that the charter must prevail. It follows that the plaintiffs are entitled to an appeal to the Court of Common Pleas in accordance with the pertinent provisions of the Waterbury charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b471-7\"> In two eases relied on by the board, a contrary legislative intent was discerned on the basis of materially different statutory language. <em>Shannon </em>v. <em>Board of Education of Kingsport, </em>199 Tenn. 250, 286 S.W.2d 571; <em>Hortonville Education Assn. </em>v. <em>Hortonville Joint School District No. 1, </em>66 Wis. 2d 469, 225 N.W.2d 658.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b471-8\"> \u201cbemoval fob cause ; appeals.
