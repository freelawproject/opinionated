Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AKK\">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Superior Court dismissing an appeal by the town of Winchester from a decision of the Connecticut state board of labor relations.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">This case was initiated as a result of charges filed by the National Association of Municipal Employees, a division of local 208 of the National Association of Government Employees, hereinafter the union, alleging that the town, having recognized the union as the collective bargaining representative of Armand Sartirana, the town\u2019s only paid fireman, violated state law by refusing to bargain with the union and by eliminating Sartirana\u2019s position. Sartirana is the sole member of the bargaining unit involved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">The town has filed twenty numbered assignments of error, many of which are interrelated. Substantively, these assignments come down to three basic claims which are advanced as constituting reversible error. They are: (1) that one employee cannot constitute an appropriate unit, either logically or under applicable guiding decisions, (2) that the town did not violate the law when its town manager withdrew from negotiations with reference to Sartirana, the fire department employee involved, because under the charter the fire department was not under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>town manager\u2019s supervision and (3) that the town did not violate the Municipal Employee Relations Act (MERA) by eliminating the one paid position in the otherwise all volunteer fire department after the union sought to bargain on behalf of Sartirana, the incumbent in that position.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">We first take up that claim that involves the question of whether a single employee unit is an appropriate unit. This assignment is essentially that the town has no obligation under the law to bargain with the union if there is only one employee in the \u201cbargaining unit,\u201d since bargaining cannot be collective where there is only one employee. The town specifically asserts that the Superior Court erred in holding that \u201c[w]hile federal courts have consistently held that bargaining with a one-man unit is improper, under the Municipal Employee Relations Act, \u00a7\u00a7 7-467 to 7-477, inclusive, of the General Statutes, a one-man unit is an appropriate unit for collective bargaining.\u201d It is the town\u2019s position that one employee cannot constitute an appropriate bargaining unit, \u201ceither logically or under applicable guiding decisions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">The findings of the board disclose the following facts which are necessary for us to set out to discuss and decide this assignment of error: The town is a \u201cmunicipal employer\u201d within the meaning of the Municipal Employee Relations Act, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 7-467-7-477. The union is an \u201cemployee organization\u201d within the meaning of the MERA. The town has a fire department manned largely by volunteers, some 130 in number, headed by a chief and deputy chiefs. Under the town charter the town manager is directly in charge of most departments, but the board of selectmen is in charge of the admin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>istration of the fire department. For over twenty-five years prior to 1975 there had been a paid daytime driver who responded to all still alarms and some others, and who had other duties including custodial duties. This paid driver was appointed by the selectmen upon recommendation by the chief and his deputies. In 1971 the incumbent paid driver contemplated retirement and at that time Sartirana was and had been a volunteer fireman for a number of years. Sartirana asked the chief and others to recommend him for the job. They did so and the selectmen appointed Sartirana to the job at an annual salary of $7400, which was paid by the town. In 1975 his salary was $10,117. Early in 1974 Sartirana joined the union. On May 18, 1974, the union filed a representation petition with the defendant board. The negotiations between Dennis Moore, the town manager, and the union began in February, 1975. The board agent held an informal conference with Moore and a representative of the union. As a result of this conference, Moore signed an agreement recognizing the union and agreeing to negotiate with it for a unit consisting only of Sartirana, the paid driver. On June 27,1975, counsel for the town issued his opinion concerning the town manager\u2019s authority to recognize the union as bargaining representative for Sartirana. His opinion was that the town manager could not, on his own authority, bind the town in any agreement affecting the fire department and that, therefore, the \u201cRecognition Agreement\u201d was not an agreement binding on the town. The town manager forthwith terminated negotiations with the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Thereafter, the selectmen voted to eliminate the paid driver\u2019s position which was held by Sartirana. This action of the selectmen was preceded by cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>tain events referred to by the board, which need not be set out here on this assignment of error but which will be referred to below. An appeal was taken from this action to the defendant board which ordered the town to reinstate the position of paid driver, to reinstate Sartirana to that position, to reimburse him for his losses and to resume negotiations with the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">We must determine whether one employee constitutes an \u201cappropriate\u201d bargaining unit under the Connecticut Municipal Employee Relations Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The town claims that we should reverse the trial court and hold that such a bargaining unit is not permitted, and it points to federal law which, it argues, requires that result. On the other hand, the board, while recognizing the state of the federal law, argues that such a bargaining unit is \u201cappropriate\u201d and states that federal precedent should not be followed here. The facts relating to this assignment of error are not in issue. The Superior Court held that \u201cunder the Municipal Employee Relations Act, \u00a7\u00a7 7-467 to 7-477, inclusive, of the General Statutes, a one-man unit is an appropriate unit for collective bargaining.\u201d It is this conclusion of law we are to review. While the conclusion reached by the trial court is to be tested by the finding it cannot stand if it is legally or logically inconsistent with the facts found or if it involves some erroneous rule of law applicable to the case. <em>Belford </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>170 Conn. 46, 55, 364 A.2d 194; <em>Sea Beach Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Water Resources Commission, </em>164 Conn. 90, 93, 318 A.2d 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>\u201cThe Connecticut Municipal Employee Eelations Act, like the Connecticut Labor Relations Act originally enacted in 1945, is closely patterned after the National Labor Eelations Act, as amended, which a comparison of the two acts clearly demonstrates.\u201d <em>Windsor </em>v. <em>Windsor Police Department Employees Assn., Inc., </em>154 Conn. 530, 536, 227 A.2d 65. This court has stated that it is for this reason that \u201cthe judicial interpretation frequently accorded the federal act is of great assistance and persuasive force in the interpretation of our own act.\u201d <em>Imperial Laundry, Inc. </em>v. <em>Connecticut State Board of Labor Relations, </em>142 Conn. 457, 460, 115 A.2d 439; <em>Windsor </em>v. <em>Windsor Police Department Employees Assn., Inc., </em>supra. In speaking of the similarity of language that exists between the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151-161; the Connecticut State Labor Relations Act and the MERA, we have often noted that the language of these three is essentially the same: \u201c[T]he judicial interpretation frequently accorded the federal act is of great assistance and persuasive force in the interpretation of our own acts.\u201d <em>West Hartford Education Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>DeCourcy, </em>162 Conn. 566, 579, 295 A.2d 526, and eases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Turning to the relevant portion of the NLRA and the MERA, we find language that is essentially the same. This is apparent from an examination of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and General Statutes \u00a7 7-468<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>are concerned with the right of employees to organize and bargain collectively. Language which is essentially the same is also disclosed from an examination of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 159<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and General Statutes \u00a7 7-471<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> where those sections set out the power of the respective boards to decide the unit \u201cappropriate\u201d for the purposes of collective bargaining. \u201cLegislative intent is found not in what the legislature meant to say hut in the meaning of what it did say.\u201d <em>Dana-Robin Corporation </em>v. <em>Common Council, </em>166 Conn. 207, 221, 348 A.2d 560; <em>Schwab </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>154 Conn. 479, 482, 226 A.2d 506. No word in a statute should he treated as superfluous. <em>Levin-Townsend Computer Corporation </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>166 Conn. 405, 409, 349 A.2d 853. \u201c[N]o part of a legislative enactment is to he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>treated as insignificant or unnecessary, and there is a presumption of purpose behind every sentence, clause or phrase in a legislative enactment.\u201d <em>Charlton Press, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>153 Conn. 103, 109, 214 A.2d 354. \u201cIn construing a statute a court considers its legislative history, language, purpose and the circumstances surrounding its enactment. <em>Delinks </em>v. <em>McGowan, </em>148 Conn. 614, 618, 173 A.2d 488; <em>Cassidy </em>v. <em>Tait, </em>140 Conn. 156, 160, 98 A.2d 808.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sober, </em>166 Conn. 81, 91n, 347 A.2d 61. In the federal sector it has been said that the purpose of the NLBA is to seek the peaceful adjustment of labor-management disputes as a substitute for industrial strife and the promotion of industrial stabilization through the collective bargaining agreement. <em>United Steelworkers of America </em>v. <em>Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation Co., </em>363 U.S. 574, 578, 80 S. Ct. 1347, 4 L. Ed. 2d 1409. This is also the essential thrust of our State Labor Relations Act and the MERA.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">The federal act has consistently been interpreted by the national labor relations board (NLRB) as refusing recognition of a unit of one person as an \u201cappropriate\u201d unit for collective bargaining. See, e.g., <em>In re Pacific Car and Foundry Co., </em>73 N.L.R.B., No. 35, 19 L.R.R.M. 1328; <em>In re International Salt Co., Inc., </em>74 N.L.R.B., No. 204, 20 L.R.R.M. 1258; <em>In re Luckenbach Steamship Co., 2 </em>N.L.R.B. 181, 193, 1 L.R.R.M. 91; <em>National Container Corporation of Wisconsin, </em>99 N.L.R.B., No. 172, 30 L.R.R.M. 1207. The NLBB cases also point out in so holding that the principle of collective bargaining requires as a logical condition that there be more than one eligible person desiring to bargain. See, e.g., <em>In re International Salt Co., Inc., </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Federal courts have taken a similar position. One court has said that \u201c[i]t is fundamental that \u2018the principle of collective bargaining presupposes that there is more than one eligible person who desires to bargain. The Act therefore does not empower the Board to certify where only one employee is involved.\u2019 \u201d <em>National Labor Relations Board </em>v. <em>WGOK, Inc., </em>384 F.2d 500, 503 (5th Cir.). \u201cAn employer may voluntarily bargain with respect to one employee, but a one-man unit is not a certifiable bargaining unit.\u201d <em>National Labor Relations Board </em>v. <em>Transamerican Freight Lines, Inc., </em>275 F.2d 311, 314 (7th Cir.). One circuit has pointed out that \u201c[t]he parties appear to be in agreement that a unit which consists of a single person is not an appropriate bargaining unit. See <em>National Labor Relations Board </em>v. <em>Transamerican Freight Lines, . . . </em>[Inc., 275 F.2d 311, 314 (7th Cir.)]; <em>Westinghouse Electric Corporation, </em>. . . [179 N.L.R.B., No. 49, 72 L.R.R.M. 1316].\u201d <em>National Labor Relations Board </em>v. <em>Crispo Cake Cone Co., </em>464 F.2d 233, 234 (8th Cir.). In <em>Westinghouse Electric Corporation, </em>supra, the board had occasion to consider a complaint alleging an unlawful refusal to bargain where the charging union was certified for a unit containing two truck drivers, one of which had voluntarily terminated his employment. In dismissing the complaint the board said: \u201cThe Board, having duly considered the matter, has determined that it would not effectuate the policies of the Act to proceed further in this matter, inasmuch as the Board will not require an employer to bargain in a unit consisting of only one employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">This court has not been given nor can it find any federal cases that are contrary to the NLRB\u2019s position. It is important to point out that, while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>the town urges the applicability of federal law, there is no claim before us that federal jurisdiction has preempted state jurisdiction in this area. The judicial interpretation accorded the federal act is, as we have earlier noted, of great assistance and persuasive force in the interpretation of our own acts because our statutes dealing with labor relations are closely patterned after the NLBA and because the language of the three acts is essentially the same. See, e.g., <em>West Hartford Education Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>DeCourcy, </em>162 Conn. 566, 295 A.2d 526. We are not given any valid reason why, in construing the MEBA, we should change this position.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">The board argues that one employee is not expressly or impliedly excluded from collective bargaining by the MERA. The same can be said of the federal act and yet that act has been interpreted consistently, without judicial reversal, as set out above. The board has the power under General Statutes \u00a7 7-471 (3) to decide the unit \u201cappropriate\u201d for the purpose of collective bargaining. This section of the statute empowers the board to do so, \u201cin order to insure to employees the fullest freedom in exercising the rights guaranteed by sections 7-467 to 7-477, inclusive, and in order to insure a clear and identifiable <em>community of interest among employees </em>concerned.\u201d (Emphasis added.) These words do not appear in the NLRA section giving the national labor relations board the power to designate the \u201cappropriate\u201d unit for collective bargaining. In this section of the MERA, which is the affirmative grant of power to the board to designate such a unit, it is indeed significant that the language used not only is pluralistic in tenor but is literally pluralistic. The words and phrases involved here are to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>construed \u201caccording to the commonly approved usage of the language.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a). The noun \u201ccommunity\u201d has, among its meanings, \u201ca body of individuals organized into a unit\u201d; \u201ccommon or joint . . . experience, or pertinence.\u201d Webster, Third New International Dictionary. The preposition \u201camong\u201d indisputably has a \u201cmore than one\u201d meaning. The word \u201cemployees\u201d which follows \u201camong\u201d in \u00a7 7-471 (3) was meant to mean what it plainly states, more than one employee, and this is especially so in this context. There can be no \u201ccommunity of interest\u201d where there is only a single employee. In examining the MERA, it is evident that the prepositions \u201cbetween\u201d and \u201camong\u201d were both used. Because of the usage of both of these prepositions, the legislature can be presumed to have had the common meaning of each in mind and thus to have intended to be selective in their use. In interpreting the meaning of a statute, we attempt to determine the intent of the legislature as expressed by the common and approved usage of the words in the statute. General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a); <em>Waterbury Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>Furlong, </em>162 Conn. 390, 406, 294 A.2d 546; <em>Hartford Electric Light Co. </em>v. <em>Water Resources Commission, </em>162 Conn. 89, 100, 291 A.2d 721. General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (f) provides that \u201c[w]ords importing the singular number may extend and be applied to several persons or things and words importing the plural may include the singular.\u201d This statute cannot logically be invoked here to make the word \u201cemployees\u201d singular, as it appears after the words \u201cto insure a clear and identifiable community of interest among . . .\u201d in \u00a7 7-471 (3). \u201cCourts cannot, by the process of construction, abrogate a clear expression of legislative intent.\u201d <em>Buxton </em>v. <em>Ullman, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>147 Conn. 48, 57, 156 A.2d 508, appeal dismissed, 367 U.S. 497, 81 S. Ct. 1752, 6 L. Ed. 2d 989. To ignore the plain meaning of words contained in a statute does not comport with tenets of basic statutory construction. <em>Thibeault </em>v. <em>White, </em>168 Conn. 112, 115, 358 A.2d 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">The trial court examined General Statutes \u00a7 7-471 (1)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which sets out the powers of the board when, in accordance with prescribed regulations of the board, a petition has been filed. That section provides that a petition may be filed \u201cby an employee or group of employees or any employee organization acting in their behalf alleging that <em>a substantial number of employees\u201d </em>wish to be represented as permitted in that section. (Emphasis added.) The trial court held that the word \u201cemployees\u201d there was not to be construed as plural, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>in doing so cited the common statutory construction rule of \u00a7 1-1 (f) that \u201cthe plural number may include the singular.\u201d That statute uses the word \u201cmay\u201d and here it is clearly directory and not mandatory. Therefore, the legal principle set forth in \u00a7 1-1 (f) cannot be said to \u201crequire\u201d that singular and plural forms have interchangeable effects, and \u201cdiscrete applications\u201d of this principle are favored except where a contrary intent or reasonable understanding is indicated. 2A Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th Ed.) \u00a7 47.34; see also <em>First National Bank </em>v. <em>Missouri, </em>263 U.S. 640, 657, 44 S. Ct. 213, 68 L. Ed. 486. No such contrary intent or reasonable understanding is affirmatively indicated here. Rather, the plain meaning of \u201ca substantial number of employees\u201d is pluralistic. A single employee can hardly be \u201ca substantial number of employees\u201d under \u00a7 7-471 (1) (A). Legislative intent is not to be found in what the legislature meant to say, but in the meaning of what it did say. <em>Hartford Electric Light Co. </em>v. <em>Water Resources Commission, </em>supra, 98. \u201cIt is not the function of courts to read into elearly expressed legislation provisions which do not find expression in its words.\u201d <em>International Business Machines Corporation </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>167 Conn. 123, 134, 355 A.2d 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">A one-person unit is not an appropriate unit for collective bargaining under the MERA.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The town did not have the duty to bargain collectively with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>the union under General Statutes \u00a7 7-469.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, the town, having no duty to bargain collectively, did not violate the MEBA by termination of the negotiations with the union for that reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">The town claims error in the conclusion that it violated the MEBA by eliminating the single paid position in the otherwise all volunteer fire department after the union sought to bargain on behalf of Sartirana, who was the incumbent in that position. The board concluded that the town had violated the MEBA by eliminating the position of paid daytime driver. The Superior Court concluded that the board, under Connecticut statutes and decisions, could reasonably have found by substantial evidence that this was a violation of the MEBA. We agree that the board was correct here.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Against the background of the facts found by the board recited above, the board also found certain other facts hereinafter set out which bring into proper context this assignment of error. These facts are: Over the years the chief of the fire department and fire officers became \u201csomewhat dissatisfied\u201d with Sartirana\u2019s performance and attitude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>and with the friction that developed between Sartirana and some volunteer firefighters. Because of this the chief suggested that Sartirana come to a meeting of the officers in October, 1974, to talk over the situation and straighten it out if possible. Sartirana was not told of the purpose of the meeting. Sartirana attended the meeting but became indignant when he learned of its purpose; he insisted upon the presence of a \u201crepresentative\u201d and walked out. The following day, after the chief and Sartirana talked, a \u201creasonably satisfactory understanding\u201d was worked out and no further action was taken. Sartirana had joined the union early in 1974 and on March 18, 1974, the union had filed a representation petition with the board. After the board agent, the town manager and a representative of the union had conferred, the town manager signed an agreement recognizing the union and agreeing to negotiate with it for a unit consisting of the paid driver. Although negotiations between the town manager and the union began in February, 1975, the chief and his deputies did not know of Sartirana\u2019s joining the union or of the negotiations until May 5, 1975, when the town manager asked the chief to participate in the negotiations. In March and April, 1975, the chief and deputies prepared a proposed budget for the department for 1975-1976 and attended hearings on it before the town selectmen. This proposed budget contained an item for the salary of the paid driver and at no time during this process did anyone raise any question concerning the position of the paid driver. On May 12, 1975, the fire department officers held a meeting to discuss the possible elimination of the paid driver\u2019s position. What occurred at this meeting was summarized in a memorandum sent by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>officers to the selectmen. That memorandum stated that the position of daytime driver was no longer \u201ceconomically feasible\u201d due to the small number of alarms, that there was a sufficient number of men working in Winsted to cover as volunteer drivers if the position was eliminated, that the motion to eliminate the position of daytime driver had been passed unanimously and that a motion to transfer the daytime driver to another municipal position at his present salary had been passed unanimously. There was no satisfactory evidence that there had been any significant incident, or any new basis for dissatisfaction with Sartirana\u2019s performance, or any worsening of the town\u2019s fiscal condition between the time of the budget preparation and May 12,1975. The only event which occurred during that time that would be likely to cause the officers\u2019 change of position was the discovery of Sartirana\u2019s union affiliation and the negotiations being conducted on his behalf. Thereafter, the selectmen adopted a budget for 1975-1976 which included the item for Sartirana\u2019s salary. At a meeting on May 15, 1975, the selectmen discussed the recommendation of the fire department and voted to take no action on it. The fire department officers were upset by the selectmen\u2019s failure to accept their recommendation and a meeting of the two groups was held on June 23. At this meeting, the fire department officers expressed dissatisfaction with the action of the selectmen and repeated their criticism of Sartirana\u2019s performance. Mention was also made of the negotiations with the union and statements that as volunteers they had no time to tend to such matters. Shortly before a selectmen\u2019s meeting scheduled for June 30, the chief and one of his deputy chiefs wrote letters of resignation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>from their posts, and those letters were brought to the meeting by the chief\u2019s son and another deputy chief. At that meeting the deputy chief told the selectmen that the union was the reason for the resignations, that the union was the core of the problem and that the position had to go if Sartirana wanted a one-man union but that there would be \u201cno problem if he stays, but not in the Union.\u201d At this meeting the selectmen voted to eliminate the paid driver\u2019s position. The selectmen were not persuaded to eliminate the position by the fire officers\u2019 arguments addressed to economy or to Sartirana\u2019s shortcomings but by opposition on the part of those officers to Sartirana\u2019s representation by the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 7-468 (a) articulates the basic legislative statement of employees\u2019 rights under the MERA. See footnote 3, supra. This section is essentially the same as that statement in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157 of the NLRA. See footnote 2, supra.

It is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. <em>Consolidated Edison Co. </em>v. <em>National Labor Relations Board, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>59 S.

It means something more than a mere scintilla and must do more than create a suspicion of the existence of the fact to be established. <em>Purity Food Co. </em>v. <em>Connecticut State Board of Labor Relations, </em>17 Conn.

This, of course, presented a factual issue and depends upon the circumstances of each case. <em>National Labor Relations Board </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number><em>Hudson Transit Lines, Inc., </em>429 F.2d 1223, 1231 (3rd Cir.), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 911, 91 S. Ct. 876, 27 L. Ed. 2d 810.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Although we have determined that a one-member unit is not an appropriate unit under the MERA, that does not mean under the circumstances that Sartirana, who is an \u201cemployee\u201d under \u00a7 7-467, is without any rights under the MERA. General Statutes \u00a7 7-468 (a) affirmatively sets out the rights of employees in the exercise of which they \u201cshall be protected.\u201d See footnote 3, supra. Included is \u201cthe right of self-organization, to form, join or assist any employee organization, to bargain collectively . . . and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.\u201d It can readily be seen from a comparison of the two statutes that \u00a7 7-468 (a) and 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157; see footnote 2, supra; are \u201cessentially the same.\u201d See <em>West Hartford Education Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>DeCourcy, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">The \u201cright to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations\u201d involves not a single right, but a number of rights. <em>National Labor Relations Board </em>v. <em>Burnup &amp; Sims, Inc., </em>379 U.S. 21, 23, 85 S. Ct. 171, 13 L. Ed. 2d 1. This also is true of \u00a77-468 (a). The \u201cself-organization\u201d that Congress sought to protect under the NLRA was the \u201cself-organization\u201d of employees in dealing with their employer with regard to wages and working conditions. <em>National Labor Relations Board </em>v. <em>Sterling Electric Motors, Inc., </em>109 F.2d 194, 198 (9th Cir.). The right of self-organization is an \u201cundisputed right.\u201d <em>Republic Aviation Corporation </em>v. <em>National Labor Relations Board, </em>324 U.S. 793, 797, 65 S. Ct. 982, 89 L. Ed. 1372. \u201cEmployees have as clear a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>right <em>to organize </em>and select their representatives for lawful purposes as the respondent [Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corporation] has to organize its business and select its own officers.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>National Labor Relations Board </em>v. <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corporation, </em>301 U.S. 1, 33, 57 S. Ct. 615, 81 L. Ed. 893.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Under the NLRA, guards are \u201cemployees\u201d within the statutory definition of that term and they possess the same rights as nonguard employees. The only limitation as to guards is not on employee rights but rather on the power of the NLRB to certify bargaining units containing both guard and nonguard employees or containing only guards represented by or affiliated with the same union representing bargaining units containing nonguard employees of the same employer. <em>National Labor Relations Board </em>v. <em>Bel-Air Mart, Inc., </em>497 F.2d 322, 326 (4th Cir.). In the <em>Bel-Air Mart </em>case one James Pilachowsld was employed as a uniformed guard at the employer\u2019s discount store where his duties entailed greeting customers, being on the lookout for shoplifters, maldng sure all doors were closed and locked at nighttime on closing, taldng deposits to the bank and observing employees to prevent theft by them. He attended a union meeting and a few days later he and other guards and supervisory personnel were warned by the personnel manager that \u201cthey were \u2018considered management\u2019 and that they \u2018were to offer no opinion to the girls as to whether or not they [the clerks] should join [the union].\u201d\u2019 Id., 323. After he attended another union meeting, he was discharged for \u201cviolating company policy.\u201d There was no question that Pilachowski was discharged solely for the reason that he attended the two union meetings. By attending the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>union meeting Pilachowski was exercising rights reserved to him by the NLRA, despite the limitation on the type of bargaining unit he could join. Accordingly, in <em>Bel-Air Mart </em>the court (p. 326) struck down the argument \u201cthat Congress could not have intended that the word \u2018employee\u2019 mean one thing for purposes of determining a proper bargaining unit and something else in determining which employees are protected from being fired for union activity.\u201d Essentially, <em>Bel-Air Mart </em>declares, as pertinent to the case before us, that while the NLRA does not permit the certification of a disqualified union, that still does not deprive an \u201cemployee\u201d affected by such disqualification of his rights under \u00a7 7 of the NLRA (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157) but only certain rights under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 159 (b) (3). Id., 327; see also <em>Rock-Hill-Uris, Inc. </em>v. <em>McLeod, </em>236 P. Sup. 395 (S.D. N.Y.), aff\u2019d, 344 F.2d 697 (2d Cir.). Sartirana, therefore, has rights under the MERA as an \u201cemployee\u201d despite our conclusion that a one-member unit is not an appropriate unit. Under \u00a7 7-470 (a) (1) the town was proscribed from \u201c[i]nterfering, restraining or coercing employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section 7-468.\u201d Under that latter statute the exercise of the right of self-organization protects the activity of employees seeking \u201cto form, join or assist any employee organization, to bargain collectively. . . .\u201d It was for the exercise of such rights that Sartirana\u2019s position as daytime driver was eliminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">It is true that the Connecticut State Labor Relations Act does not interfere with the normal exercise of an employer\u2019s right to discharge his employees, but the discharge must not amount to a subterfuge to circumvent the provisions of the act. <em>Biosogno </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>150 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>Conn. 597, 602, 192 A.2d 550. Certain employer conduct may be so \u201cinherently destructive of employee interests\u201d that it may be deemed proscribed without the need for proof of an underlying improper motive. <em>National Labor Relations Board </em>v. <em>Great Dane Trailers, Inc., </em>388 U.S. 26, 33, 87 S. Ct. 1792, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1027. No need for proof of an improper underlying motive is necessary where employer conduct carries with it such unavoidable consequences which the employer not only foresaw but which he must have intended and thus it bears \u201cits own indicia of intent.\u201d Ibid. <em>Great Dane </em>points out that if the conduct in question falls within this \u201c \u2018inherently destructive\u2019 category, the employer has the burden of explaining away, justifying or characterizing \u2018his actions as something different than they appear on their face,\u2019 and if he fails, \u2018an unfair labor practice charge is made out.\u2019 \u201d Id., 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">The United States Supreme Court has stated that even if the employer does come forward with counter explanations for his conduct in such a situation, the NLRB may \u201cnevertheless draw an inference of improper motive from the conduct itself and exercise its duty to strike the proper balance between the asserted business justifications and the invasion of employee rights in the light of the [National Labor Relations] Act and its policy.\u201d <em>National Labor Relations Board </em>v. <em>Great Dane Trailers, Inc., </em>supra, 33-34, citing <em>National Labor Relations Board </em>v. <em>Erie Resistor Corporation, </em>373 U.S. 221, 229, 83 S. Ct. 1139, 10 L. Ed. 2d 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Our function on the issue of the propriety of the board\u2019s decision on the termination of the position of paid daytime driver is to determine whether the Superior Court was correct in concluding, as it did, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>that there was substantial evidence to enable the board to conclude as it did. We agree that there was substantial evidence for such a conclusion. It should be noted that it is not the function of the court to pass upon the credibility of witnesses, weigh the evidence or reject reasonable board inferences simply because other inferences might also be drawn and we also recognize that the board\u2019s findings of fact must often depend on circumstantial as well as direct evidence. <em>Singer Co. </em>v. <em>National Labor Relations Board, </em>429 F.2d 172, 179 (8th Cir.); see also <em>National Labor Relations Board </em>v. <em>Melrose Processing Co., </em>351 F.2d 693, 698 (8th Cir.).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">The town\u2019s claim of error that it did not violate the law when its town manager withdrew from negotiations with reference to Sartirana because under the town charter the fire department was not under the town manager\u2019s supervision requires no discussion because the other assignments of error above are dispositive of the appeal. <em>Center Drive-In Theatre, Inc. </em>v. <em>Derby, </em>166 Conn. 460, 461n, 352 A.2d 304; <em>Masti-Kure Products Co. </em>v. <em>Appel, </em>161 Conn. 108, 111, 285 A.2d 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment as on file except that the plaintiff town of Winchester does not have to resume negotiations with the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.'</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b375-5\"> The board claims that the town has waived its right \u201cto raise this objection on appeal.\u201d This is not so. The court below found that the town made that claim of law, and it ruled against the town on that claim.
