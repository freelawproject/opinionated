In her complaint she alleged that the collision, and her resultant injuries, were caused by the negligence of Kurt and Monarca.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Monarca answer included a special defense alleging that at the time the collision occurred Anita was instructing Kurt in the use and operation of the car, that Kurt was negligent in the manner described in Anita\u2019s complaint, that according to General Statutes \u00a7 14-214<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Anita was responsible for the operation of the vehicle while Kurt was driving, and that, therefore, Kurt\u2019s negligence was <em>imputed </em>to her as the person responsible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>for and in control of the vehicle, thereby barring her recovery<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> against the defendant Monarca.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Anita demurred to the special defense, arguing, inter alia, that neither the General Statutes (\u00a7 14-36,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u00a7 14-214) nor the common law requires that the negligence of the operator be imputed to the owner-occupant-instructor. The demurrer was sustained by the court <em>(Rubinow, </em>J.) in a thorough and well-reasoned memorandum of decision. Monarca then moved for permission to file a new special defense. The motion was granted and a defense was filed, alleging that any damages suffered by Anita were the proximate result of her own negligence. This was the basic posture of the case which ultimately went to trial and resulted in a plaintiff\u2019s verdict. Although the complaint and answer were amended several more times before trial, the defendant made no attempt to reintroduce the defense of imputed negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>The defendant\u2019s sole claim on appeal is that it was error for the court to sustain the plaintiff\u2019s demurrer to his special defense. Before we reach this claim, however, we first respond to the plaintiff\u2019s assertion that the. defendant, by electing to file the new special defense of contributory negligence, waived his right to appeal the ruling sustaining the demurrer to the original special defense of imputed negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">.A demurrer is a means of challenging the legal sufficiency of a pleading. The ground for the demurrer may be that the facts, as pleaded, do not constitute a legally recognizable claim for relief, or the demurrer may be intended to reach procedural defects in the pleading such as misjoinder of actions or nonjoinder of parties. Practice Book, 1963, \u00a7 106 ;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> see 1 Stephenson, Conn. Civ. Proc. \u00a7 117; James, Civil Procedure \u00a7 4.1. A demurrer may be filed by either party: a defendant can demur to the complaint; a plaintiff can demur to a special defense or counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">At common law, a ruling on a demurrer was equivalent to a final judgment; there was no opportunity to amend or to plead over. 1 Stephenson, supra, \u00a7 119 (a); James, supra. Thus, a party was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>forced to elect between filing a demurrer or answering and defending on the merits. Today, however, a party whose demurrer is overruled has a right to plead over. General Statutes \u00a7 52-95; Practice Book, 1963, \u00a7 113. If a demurrer to a plaintiff\u2019s complaint is sustained, the plaintiff may amend the complaint, as of right, within fifteen days. Practice Book, 1963, \u00a7 131. Although no such right is expressly granted to defendants, amendments are generally freely allowed. 1 Stephenson, supra, \u00a7 119 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The ruling on a demurrer, especially where the issue involved is the legal sufficiency of the cause of action or special defense, is likely to have a substantial impact on the ultimate disposition of the case. Nevertheless, a party against whom the ruling is made is often foreclosed from appealing it after final judgment. It has long been the law in Connecticut that when a demurrer is <em>overruled, </em>the correctness of the ruling may always be raised on appeal. <em>Hunter\u2019s Appeal, </em>71 Conn. 189, 41 A. 557 (1898). When a demurrer is <em>su,stained, </em>however, it is the rule that unless the party whose pleading has been ruled insufficient chooses to stand on the pleadings and appeal from the judgment rendered thereon, the filing of any further pleading will be regarded as a waiver and withdrawal of the disputed pleading, and the right to appeal the ruling will be lost. <em>Good Humor Corporation </em>v. <em>Ricciuti, </em>160 Conn. 133, 135-36, 273 A.2d 886 (1970); <em>Panaroni </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>158 Conn. 92, 103, 256 A.2d 246 (1969); <em>Rossignol </em>v. <em>Danbury School of Aeronautics, Inc., </em>154 Conn. 549, 554, 227 A.2d 418 (1967); <em>Grady </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>145 Conn. 579, 584, 145 A.2d 124 (1958); <em>West </em>v. <em>Lewis Oyster Co., </em>99 Conn. 55, 67, 121 A. 462 (1923); <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>74 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>125, 127-28, 49 A. 909 (1901); <em>Boland </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neil, </em>72 Conn. 217, 220, 44 A. 15 (1899); 1 Stephenson, supra, \u00a7 119 (b), (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">There is much to justify this rule when applied to a plaintiff. Because two complaints cannot coexist in the same action, the filing of a substituted or amended complaint must of necessity remove the original pleading from the file. See <em>Good Humor Corporation </em>v. <em>Ricciuti, </em>supra, 137. Moreover, a plaintiff against whom a demurrer has been sustained can stand on the pleadings, allow the entry of judgment and appeal the ruling. If the appeal is not successful, a new complaint grounded on another legal theory can usually be filed. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-592; <em>Ross Realty Corporation </em>v. <em>Surkis, </em>163 Conn. 388, 392-93, 311 A.2d 74 (1972); <em>Bassett </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>116 Conn. 29, 30-31, 163 A. 456 (1932); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>108 Conn. 484, 488, 143 A. 898 (1928); but cf. <em>Stamford Dock &amp; Realty Corporation </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>124 Conn. 341, 342n, 200 A. 343 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">The situation is different, however, when the rule is applied to defendants, and it is a demurrer to a <em>special defense </em>which has been sustained. First, because several special defenses can be filed in response to a single complaint, the filing of a new special defense does not implicitly withdraw a defense previously filed. Second, a defendant who chooses to stand on the pleadings and appeal the ruling on a demurrer must forever forego the right to a trial on the merits if the appeal is lost. Thus, it is clearly desirable to distinguish between a complaint on the one hand and a special defense on the other before applying the rule that amending the pleadings after a demurrer is sustained waives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>the right to appeal the ruling on the original pleading.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The cases which have relied on the rule and found the right to appeal waived do not appear to have made such a distinction. E.g. <em>Panaroni </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra (demurrer to defense); <em>West </em>v. <em>Lewis Oyster Co., </em>supra (demurrer to defense and cross-complaint); <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra (demurrer to defense).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Under some circumstances, after a demurrer to a special defense has been sustained it may be possible to defend on the merits without waiving the right to appeal the ruling on the demurrer. For example, if the state of the pleadings is such at the time the demurrer is sustained that the defendant need not amend the answer in any way before going to trial, then the issue can be preserved for appeal. <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>83 Conn. 634, 636, 78 A. 314 (1910) ;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc. \u00a7 65. Also, in <em>Falzone </em>v. <em>Gruner, </em>132 Conn. 415, 418, 45 A.2d 153 (1945), there is dictum to the effect that a defendant who files a \u201csecond\u201d or \u201cadditional special defense,\u201d rather than an entirely new answer, does not waive the right to a review of a ruling sustaining a demurrer. Although this alternative would appear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>to provide some recourse for a defendant confronted by the waiver rule, it has the drawback of characterizing a waiver by the label applied to a new pleading, and a defendant will often find it difficult to amend without waiving.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Another possibility is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>to reintroduce the issue during the course of the trial, as in a proffer of evidence in support of the defense ruled out or in a - request to charge the jury. An adverse evidentiary ruling or a refusal to charge can then he claimed as error on appeal. See 1 Stephenson, supra, \u00a7 119 (c).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Thus, although some defendants may have the good fortune to obtain a review of a ruling sustaining a demurrer, many more will be foreclosed by the necessity of amending their pleadings. This is not consistent with our long-standing policy of permitting a defendant to raise all available defenses in the same action. <em>Hunter\u2019s Appeal, </em>supra, was the first case to allow an appeal from the overruling of a demurrer where the demurring party had pleaded over and the ease had gone to trial on the merits. Up until that time, pleading over after the overruling of a demurrer was considered a waiver of the demurrer and of any error in the ruling of the court. In justifying its decision to alter the prevailing practice, the court emphasized that then General Statutes (Rev. 1888) \u00a7 1014 (now General Statutes \u00a7 52-95) \u201cgives an absolute right to plead over [after demurrer overruled], with the manifest intent of enabling a defendant to take every objection which might lie open to him, in one and the same suit, instead of either confining him to an election between matters of law and matters of fact, or leaving any relaxation of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>rule of the common law to the discretion of the court. To make this right fully valuable, it must be protected by a corresponding right of review.\u201d <em>Hunter\u2019s Appeal, </em>supra, 198-99. Therefore, to be consistent with this reasoning, a similar right of review should be provided where a demurrer to a special defense has been <em>sustained </em>and the defendant has amended the pleadings to change the focus of the defense. Decisions subsequent to <em>Hunter\u2019s Appeal, </em>however, have limited its application to appeals from the overruling of a demurrer, thereby forcing many defendants to an election between defense or appeal. The sustaining of a demurrer to a special defense may, in effect, leave a defendant nearly as defenseless as the overruling of a demurrer to a complaint; in the latter instance, however, one can try to defend oneself and retain a right to review, while in the former case this is often impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">In view of the foregoing, we hold that a defendant does not necessarily waive the right to appeal a ruling sustaining a demurrer to a special defense by subsequently amending the pleadings. There may, of course, be circumstances in which amendment does constitute a waiver, as when the amendment is for the purpose of correcting a formal defect in the original pleading. See 1 Stephenson, Conn. Civ. Proc. \u00a7 116 (a). Whether review has been waived by amendment can only be determined by looking to the facts of each particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">On the facts of the case before us, we hold that the defendant did not waive his right to review by filing a defense alleging contributory negligence after the plaintiff\u2019s demurrer to his defense of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>imputed negligence was sustained. The second defense was based on an entirely new theory; it was not merely an attempt to correct a defect in the defense successfully demurred to. The two defenses could both have been filed in the original answer, and thus the filing of the second defense need not constitute a withdrawal of the first. Cf. <em>Good Humor Corporation </em>v. <em>Ricciuti, </em>supra, 137. The defendant has a right to appeal the ruling on his special defense of imputed negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Having determined that the defendant did not waive his right to appeal the ruling on the demurrer by introducing another special defense, we now review the substance of his claim. The issue presented is whether, under the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 14-36 (a) and 14-214, the negligence of a learner will be imputed to an instructor, thereby barring recovery by the instructor against a third party. The lower court, in its memorandum of decision, concluded that the statutes in question were intended to impose penal, not civil, liability, and that they should not be construed to impose a civil disability on a nonnegligent instructor who had complied with the statutes. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">General Statutes \u00a7 14-36 (a) permits an unlicensed operator to \u201coperate a motor vehicle while <em>under the instructions of, and accompanied by, </em>a person who is at least eighteen years of age and has been licensed for not less than two years preceding such instruction to operate a motor vehicle of the same class as the motor vehicle being operated, <em>who shall have full control of the motor vehicle as provided by law. . . .\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>section (d) of \u00a7 14-36 provides that anyone who violates subsection (a) shall be fined not more than fifty dollars for a first offense and, for any subsequent offense shall be fined not more than one hundred dollars or imprisoned not more than thirty days or both. Section 14-214 of the General Statutes permits a licensed operator to instruct an unlicensed operator, and explicitly requires that \u201c[a]ny person so instructing another in the use of any motor vehicle except a motorcycle shall be so seated as to control the operation of the motor vehicle and shall be responsible for the operation thereof.\u201d The section further provides that \u201c[violation of any provision of this section shall be an infraction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The obvious purpose of these statutes is to prevent inexperienced operators from driving without instruction and supervision and, also, to ensure that licensed operators who undertake to instruct and supervise will take this responsibility seriously. To this end, criminal sanctions may be imposed for noncompliance.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">The statutes before us, especially \u00a7 14-214, impose an additional burden of care on licensed drivers who undertake the instruction and supervision of unlicensed drivers. Criminal liability is imposed to induce compliance with the statutory standard of conduct. A statute which creates a liability where formerly none existed \u201cshould receive a strict construction and is not to be extended, modified ... or enlarged in its scope by the mechanics of construction.\u201d <em>Edmundson </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>169 Conn. 630, 633, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>363 A.2d 1031 (1975). Penal statutes should be construed strictly and not extended by implication to create a liability which no language of the act purports to create. <em>Dennis </em>v. Shaw, 137 Conn. 450, 453, 78 A.2d 691 (1951). Since neither of the statutes relied upon by the defendant makes any reference to civil liability, they should not be construed to impose such liability on an instructor. <em>Forker </em>v. Pomponio, 60 N.J. Super. 278, 283-84, 158 A.2d 849 (1960); <em>Sardo </em>v. <em>Herlihy, </em>143 Misc. 397, 400, 256 N.Y.S. 690 (1932). If, under these statutes, the plaintiff-instructor cannot be held vicariously liable to the defendant for the negligence of her instruetee, it is obvious that such negligence cannot be imputed to her to bar her recovery from that defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">There are, moreover, other considerations which necessarily influence our decision in this case. Although we hold that \u00a7\u00a7 14-36 (a) and 14-214 do not make an instructor vicariously liable in tort for the negligence of a learner, we note that the imposition of vicarious liability is not unknown under Connecticut law.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The justification for imputing negligence to an innocent party is the social necessity to provide injured plaintiffs with financially responsible defendants. 2 Harper <em>&amp; </em>James, Torts \u00a7 23.6, p. 1274; Prosser, Torts (4th Ed.) \u00a7 73. Although public policy may thus justify the imposition of liability on an innocent defendant \u2014 and, in fact, the widespread availability of insurance somewhat mitigates the potential harshness of such a rule \u2014 there is no corresponding justification for imputing negligence to bar recovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>by a faultless plaintiff. See <em>Weber </em>v. <em>Stokely-Van Camp, Inc. </em>274 Minn. 482, 486, 144 N.W.2d 540 (1966). \u201cThe whole doctrine of vicarious liability stems from considerations other than the defendant\u2019s personal fault, for it assumes his innocence. ... If the principle of liability or disability for individualized fault is taken as the norm, and vicarious liability or disability is regarded as an exceptional solution (to be justified only for reasons of policy sufficient in each case to warrant the exception), then there would be little justification indeed for imputing negligence to an innocent plaintiff in most eases.\u201d 2 Harper &amp; James, supra, p. 1275; see also James, \u201cImputed Contributory Negligence,\u201d 14 La. L. Rev. 340 (1954); Mignone, \u201cImputed Negligence Revisited,\u201d 45 Conn. B.J. 187 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The general trend today is away from imputing contributory negligence. The new rule stated in Restatement (Second), 2 Torts \u00a7 485 rejects the doctrine in general, applying it only to master-servant and joint enterprise relationships and to actions for death or loss of services. We share this view. Our own legislature has recently expressed its approval of this trend with enactment of General Statutes \u00a7 52-572i, which provides that the family car doctrine shall not be applied to impute contributory or comparative negligence to the owner of any motor vehicle or motorboat.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">We hold that the negligence of a learner cannot be imputed to an instructor to bar the instructor\u2019s recovery against a negligent third party. Such a recovery may be barred by the instructor\u2019s <em>own </em>negligence in instructing and supervising the learner, but the negligence of the learner alone will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>not bar recovery. The court below was correct in sustaining the plaintiff\u2019s demurrer to the defendant\u2019s first special defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b136-7\"> The complaint originally also included Salvatore and Josephine Monarca as owners of the Monarca vehicle. The action against them was withdrawn before the case went to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s action against Kurt was settled out of court for $8,000, and the subsequent judgment against Monarca for $40,000 was reduced accordingly. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-216a.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b136-9\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 14-214. instruction of unlicensed person. Any licensed operator, being eighteen years of age and having had an operator\u2019s license to operate a motor vehicle of the same class as the motor vehicle being operated for at least two years preceding the date of such instruction, may instruct a person sixteen or more years of age, not a licensed operator, in the operation of a motor vehicle. Any person so instructing another in the use of any motor vehicle except a motorcycle shall be so seated as to control the operation of the motor vehicle and shall be responsible for the operation thereof. Violation of any provision of this section shall be an infraction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">This statute is essentially the same as the one in effect at the time of the collision in this ease.

The plaintiff must, in any event, prove the cause of action alleged in the complaint.

The first defense was a general denial and the second was found insufficient on demurrer. The court determined that going to trial under the general issue after a demurrer to the second defense had been sustained did not waive the right to appeal the ruling on the demurrer after final judgment. <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>83 Conn. 634, 78 A. 314 (1910).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b142-6\"> The facts of <em>Falzone </em>v. <em>Gruner, </em>132 Conn. 415, 45 A.2d 153 (1945), reveal the difficulty a defendant might encounter in attempting to amend pleadings without waiving the right to a review. In Falzone,' the complaint alleged three grounds of negligence. It appears that the defendant filed a special defense, alleging that the plaintiff\u2019s decedent was acting pursuant to an agreement with the defendant when she was injured, and, \u201c[a]fter a demurrer to this defense was sustained, he filed a substituted answer in which he denied the essential allegations of the complaint and pleaded by way of special defense that the decedent was contributorily negligent.\u201d Id,, 417. After a trial on the merits, the defendant sought to appeal the ruling on the demurrer. This court denied review, on grounds that \u201c[t]he defendant, by subsequently filing an entirely new answer, instead of merely a 'second\u2019 or 'additional special defense,\u2019 obviated any necessity of considering the demurrer, for he thereby waived any right to a review of the ruling that the original special defense was defective.\u201d Id., 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">It is almost impossible to ascertain from this description what the defendant should have \u2014 or could have \u2014 done to preserve his appeal. It is clear that the special defense of contributory negligence was sufficiently different from the original special defense to constitute, on its face, a \u201csecond\u201d or \u201cadditional\u201d special defense. The court states that the defendant\u2019s waiver consisted in \u201cfiling an entirely new answer, instead of merely a 'second\u2019 or 'additional special defense.\u2019 \u201d Was it simply the failure to <em>label </em>the contributory negligence defense properly which constituted the waiver? Was it the fact that the special defense was <em>part of </em>an entirely new answer rather than the <em>only </em>addition to the pleadings? It would be impossible to answer these questions- without an opportunity to examine the actual pleadings in the case, and even if this were possible, it might not provide an answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">Thus, a defendant trying to amend pleadings so as to fall within the exception suggested by <em>Falzone </em>must first confront the question of what the exception is. If one need only label the defense properly, it should be fairly easy to comply, although this is clearly placing form over substance. If, however, the only way to preserve the right to appeal is by not \u201cfiling an entirely new answer,\u201d but by limiting the amendment of the pleadings to the addition of a second special defense, then it may be impossible to mount an effective defense and still fall within the exception.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b143-7\"> Stephenson suggests that this is the proper method for preserving the right to review. It seems unlikely, however, that a review of a ruling at trial would aeeomplish the same purpose as a review of the ruling on the demurrer. If a demurrer is sustained, the claim demurred to will not be an issue at trial. Therefore, it is difficult to imagine that a trial court would be found in error for refusing to admit evidence or refusing to charge on an issue which was not part of the ease as tried.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b146-8\"> For the purpose of this opinion, we need not reach the question of whether, under these statutes, an instructor may be held criminally liable for misconduct by the operator without regard to the instructor\u2019s own conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b147-7\"> The family purpose doctrine is a prime example.
