They have appealed from the judgments, claiming, inter alia, that they were denied effective assistance of counsel as a result of their joint representation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>The charges involved in the three cases arise from the theft of items from several trailers located at a construction site in Putnam. The state\u2019s witnesses testified that on the morning of February 2, 1971, it was discovered that the trailers had been broken into and that an adding machine, typewriter, calculator, copying machine, pump and torches were missing. Although the investigating police officer dusted the scene for fingerprints, none were found. There were no eyewitnesses to the crime, and no physical evidence was found at the scene which would serve to connect the defendants with the break-ins or the larceny. The defendants did not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Crucial to the state\u2019s case, therefore, was the testimony of Charles Bates, tending to establish the defendants\u2019 involvement in the incident. Bates, a former employee at the Putnam construction site, testified to three incriminating conversations allegedly occurring shortly before and immediately after the time at which the thefts were estimated to have occurred. According to Bates, on February 1, 1971, he drove to the construction site in the company of Marion and Tetreault to pick up tax forms. While driving back to Marion\u2019s apartment, one of the two defendants allegedly asked Bates \u201cif they had anything good in the trailers\u201d; and he told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>them there was a copying machine, some adding machines and typewriters in at least one of the trailers. Later that same day, while all three defendants were present, one of them allegedly asked Bates if they could use his truck to pick up some \u201cstuff\u201d at the construction site. In relating the contents of those two conversations, Bates could not identify the speaker in either instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The third conversation to which he testified on direct examination involved an alleged confession to the crime purportedly made by Marion in the early morning of February 2, 1971. According to Bates, Marion explained that they had been to the home of A1 Robidoux, a junk dealer, to \u201cget rid of\u201d some items taken from the construction site. Robidoux later testified for the defense that he had bought these items from someone identified only as \u201cJerry,\u201d and generally disassociated himself from the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">It was during this testimony of Bates, the defendants now claim, that a conflict of interest arose and that error was committed in allowing one counsel to continue his representation of the three defendants. The transcript reveals that although the special public defender representing the defendants initially objected to Bates\u2019 testimony regarding the first conversation he had with Marion and Tetreault on the grounds that it was inadmissible hearsay, when the state\u2019s attorney claimed the question, defense counsel withdrew his objection. No further objections were made by the defendants\u2019 attorney throughout the remaining portions of Bates\u2019 testimony and, on cross-examination, no attempt was made by defense counsel to exonerate any defendant or to impute the incriminating statements to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>specific defendant. At <em>the </em>close of the presentation of all the evidence, the defendants\u2019 counsel made no request to charge and no exceptions were taken to the charge as given by the court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">It is significant to note at this point that the defendants do not necessarily claim they were denied adequate assistance of counsel on the basis of their attorney\u2019s inadequate preparation or ineptitude exhibited by representation at trial which was not \u201c \u2018within the range of competence displayed by lawyers with ordinary training and skill in the criminal law.\u2019 <em>Gentry </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>. . . [167 Conn. 639, 646, 356 A.2d 902].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>170 Conn. 273, 287, 365 A.2d 1167. Rather, they contend that the hearsay testimony of Bates placed defense counsel in an irreconcilable conflict, which virtually compelled him to allow such testimony into evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>without objection, since to do otherwise might result in implicating one client whom he represented to the detriment of the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Although the representation of codefendants simultaneously by one attorney \u201cis not per se violative of constitutional guarantees of effective assistance of counsel\u201d; <em>Holloway </em>v. <em>Arkansas, </em>435 U.S. 475, 482, 98 S.

For joint representation to amount to a denial of a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel, however, he must present some factual basis establishing that a conflict of interest actually existed between himself and the other codefendants; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>DeBerry, </em>487 F.2d 448, 452 (2d Cir.); <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>supra, 328-29; since a claim of conflict cannot be sustained when grounded upon nothing more than mere spec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>ulation and conjecture. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gallagher, </em>437 F.2d 1191, 1194 (7th Cir.); <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>supra.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Prior to trial, the defendants\u2019 counsel advised the court that he had discussed the possibility of a conflict with the defendants and was aware of none at the time.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court was not alerted to the inculpatory testimony of Bates relative to the oral extrajudicial statements allegedly made by one of the defendants, and no further factual inquiry was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>conducted.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Ordinarily, a court is obligated to take adequate steps to determine whether the risk of conflict is too remote to require separate counsel if . counsel makes representations of a probable risk of a conflict of interests. <em>Holloway </em>v. <em>Arkansas, </em>supra, 483. Although the right to conflict-free representation may be waived; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Villarreal, </em>554 F.2d 235, 236 (5th Cir.); <em>State </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>174 Conn. 287, 293, 386 A.2d 243; we will indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver of fundamental constitutional rights. <em>Craig </em>v. <em>United States, </em>217 F.2d 355, 359 (6th Cir.). Only when the record clearly discloses that a constitutional right was waived \u201cintelligently, understandingly and in a competent manner\u201d will a claim of waiver be sustained. <em>State </em>v. <em>Beaulieu, </em>164 Conn. 620, 630, 325 A.2d 263; <em>State </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>supra. On the basis of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>the court\u2019s limited inquiry regarding the possibility of a conflict, we cannot conclude that the defendants waived their right to conflict-free representation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">\u201cA conflict of interest is present whenever one defendant stands to gain significantly by counsel adducing probative evidence or advancing plausible arguments that are damaging to the cause of a codefendant whom counsel is also representing.\u201d <em>Foxworth </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>516 F.2d 1072, 1076 (5th Cir.). In the present ease, the strategy employed by defense counsel during the testimony of Bates \u201cluminates the cross-purposes under which he was laboring.\u201d <em>Glasser </em>v. <em>United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 73, 62 S. Ct. 457, 86 L. Ed. 680. Defense counsel failed to question Bates concerning the absence of Coman when the alleged conversations took place, even though a number of defense witnesses testified later in the trial relative to an alibi defense raised by Coman.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Nor was any attempt made by counsel to impute two of the incriminating statements to any particular defendant or request an instruction on this issue.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>United States </em>v. <em>DeYoung, </em>523 F.2d 807, 809-10 (3rd Cir.). Further, the conflict arising in the joint representation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>three defendants becomes evident upon a review of counsel\u2019s failure to challenge the out-of-court confession to the crime allegedly made by the defendant Marion on the basis of the principle enunciated in <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 88 S. Ct. 1620, 20 L. Ed. 2d 476. <em>Bruton </em>held that the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment, as applied to the states through the fourteenth amendment, is violated when a codefendant\u2019s out-of-court hearsay statement implicating a defendant is admitted into evidence and the defendant is either unavailable at trial or refuses to take the stand and subject himself to cross-examination by the codefendant. <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neil, </em>402 U.S. 622, 626, 91 S. Ct. 1723, 29 L. Ed. 2d 222. An examination of the <em>Bruton </em>rule makes it readily apparent that counsel\u2019s decision regarding the advisability of having one or more of the defendants testify was not unaffected by his divided loyalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Under the circumstances, we conclude it is reasonably probable that the interests of the defendants were inconsistent and that counsel\u2019s defense of each defendant was thereby trammeled and restricted in violation of the sixth amendment\u2019s mandate requiring effective assistance of counsel. Since \u201c[t]he right to have the assistance of counsel is too fundamental and absolute to allow courts to indulge in nice calculations as to the amount of prejudice arising from its denial\u201d; <em>Glasser </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 76; and since the record does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>show that without the testimony of Bates there was clear evidence of the defendants\u2019 guilt, new trials are ordered. The potential for conflict of interest in representing multiple defendants is so grave that it ordinarily should not be permitted except in exceptional cases where the court takes adequate steps to determine whether the risk of conflict of interest is too remote to require separate representation and where it is established that the probability of a conflict arising is not reasonably foreseeable.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">There is error, the judgments are set aside and new trials are ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b234-11\"> Although the defendants were originally represented at an earlier trial by three different attorneys, a mistrial was declared a day after trial had begun when it was learned that one of the state\u2019s witnesses was also being represented by the defendant Coman\u2019s attorney. Since the defendant Marion\u2019s attorney was a member of the same law firm, both attorneys withdrew and a continuance was granted in order to give the defendants the opportunity to procure new counsel. At a pretrial hearing before <em>Barber, J., </em>Marion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>explained that his one attempt to obtain private counsel indicated to him that his financial situation was inadequate to afford the required fee. The special public defender representing the defendant Tetreault was then appointed by the court to represent Marion as well. Coman revealed that he was in similar financial straits but suggested to the court that in a month or so he should be working again and thus possibly be able to retain his own counsel at that time. Stating \u201cI don\u2019t think we can wait that long,\u201d the court appointed the special public defender representing the defendants Tetreault and Marion to represent Coman also.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b237-7\"> The court, in its charge to the jury, made no specific reference to the law applicable to declarations or admissions made by eodefendants implicating one another nor was it requested to do so. The following, however, is a portion of the charge apparently relating to the testimony of Bates: \u201cI think at this point I should also state to you our rule as to the so-called admissions of an accused, that is statements claimed to have been made by the accused in the hearing of another person who takes the stand and testifies to what the accused is claimed to have said. In this case some such statements were testified to by witnesses for the State. Now, if you believe this testimony and so find that an accused made such a statement, you are not to give it the same weight as though the accused had himself gotten on the witness stand and made the same statement, but you are to consider it not as the equivalent in value of the direct testimony of the accused but as some evidence circumstantial in its nature of a fact which you may if you find it reasonable and logical so to do, but otherwise should not find to be inconsistent with the present claim of innocence of that accused. That is, as evidence affecting the particular accused making the statement or the admission, if you find that he did make it in the same sense that any other relevant faet which you find to be inconsistent with the claim of an accused is evidence against him.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b239-7\"> In a recent ease, one court has taken the position that \u201c[w]hile the potential for prejudice is not so inherent as to require a per se rule of conflict, it is nonetheless sufficiently pervasive, that only a minimal showing of conflict should be required to invoke constitutional protection.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lawriw, </em>568 F.2d 98, 101 (8th Cir.). Appellate courts have differed, however, on how strong a showing of conflict is required before the reviewing court will conclude that a constitutional deprivation has occurred. Compare, for example, <em>Foxworth </em>v. Wainwright, 516 F.2d 1072, 1077 (5th Cir.) (requiring an actual, significant conflict) with <em>Lollar </em>v. <em>United States, </em>376 F.2d 243, 246-47 (D.C. Cir.) (resolving any question as to conflict in favor of the defendant when there are \u201cindications in the record that stir doubts\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b239-8\"> The full text of this colloquy is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-9\">\u201cDefense Counsel: And the second matter, Tour Honor, is, for the record, I represent three accused.
