Code, \u00a7\u00a7 242, 243, subd. (c), 12022, subd. (b)), battery against a different peace officer, resisting arrest with a weapon (Pen. Code, \u00a7 148, subd. (b)), assault on a peace officer with a deadly weapon (Pen. Code, \u00a7 245, subd. (c)), possession of cocaine for sale (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11351), transportation of cocaine (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11352, subd. (a)), possession of marijuana (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11357, subd. (b)) and driving without a license (Veh. Code, \u00a7 12500, subd. (a)). The court also found that defendant had suffered a prior serious felony conviction for residential burglary (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 459-460, 667) and a prior conviction for possession of a controlled substance. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11351).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">On appeal, defendant contends (1) there is insufficient evidence to support his convictions for battery, assault, and resisting arrest; (2) the court erroneously withdrew from the jury\u2019s consideration an element of these offenses; (3) tiie court gave incomplete instructions on these offenses; (4) there was insufficient evidence of injury to support one conviction for battery; (5) the court failed to instruct on lesser included offenses; (6) the court erred in failing to instruct on the type of evidence necessary to convict defendant of driving without a license; (7) the trial court erred in imposing fines without determining defendant\u2019s ability to pay; and (8) the court erred in imposing a consecutive term for a battery conviction. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b503-12\">On September 8, 1992, at 2 a.m., Officer Michael Edward Sullivan stopped a vehicle driven by defendant because it did not have an operational rear license plate light. Sullivan asked defendant for his license, but defendant failed to produce one, saying he did not have one. At that time Sullivan noticed that defendant\u2019s pupils were dilated, his speech was excited, and his mouth was dry. He determined that defendant was under the influence of a stimulant and asked him to exit the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>At this point, Officer Kevin Mank arrived as backup. Officer Sullivan pat-searched defendant and noticed a plastic baggie protruding from his waistband. Police later discovered that the bag contained bindles of cocaine and a small amount of marijuana. When Sullivan asked defendant about it, defendant panicked and attempted to run away. Sullivan grabbed defendant by the back of the shirt, but he broke free. Officer Mank then tackled him.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">Defendant said he was giving up, but when Mank began to alight, defendant pushed him and ran off again. Mank caught up with and tackled him, but defendant struggled to get away, hitting and kicking Mank. Officer Sullivan then hit defendant with his baton.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Eventually, defendant appeared to calm down and go limp. However, when Officer Mank attempted to handcuff him, defendant got up and again started to struggle with him. He struck Officer Sullivan in the face, grabbed Mank\u2019s baton, and hit Sullivan in the hand. Sullivan tackled him. Mank also jumped on defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">At this time a backup officer arrived. Officer Sullivan again struck defendant with his baton, and the three officers were finally able to arrest and handcuff defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">During the course of their struggles with defendant, both Sullivan and Mank hit defendant with either their fists or batons. The plastic bag seen from defendant\u2019s waistband was retrieved and a bag of cocaine bindles was found in his pockets.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">\n<em>The Defense</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">Defendant did not testify. His only evidence was addressed to the assault, battery, and resisting arrest charges and was designed to establish that Officer Sullivan used excessive force against him. In particular, defendant presented two witnesses, each of whom testified to a different instance when Officer Sullivan allegedly used excessive force. Officer Sullivan denied that he used excessive force on these occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-11\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b504-12\">\n<em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b504-13\">Defendant contends there is insufficient evidence to support his convictions for assault, simple battery, battery causing an injury, and resisting a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>peace officer. In particular, he claims there is insufficient evidence that Officers Sullivan and Mank were \u201cpeace officers\u201d and that Officer Mank suffered an injury. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">In determining the sufficiency of evidence, we must review the whole record in the light most favorable to the judgment to see whether it contains substantial evidence\u2014i.e., evidence that is credible and of solid value\u2014from which a rational trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bloom </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 1194, 1208 [259 Cal.Rptr. 669, 774 P.2d 698]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 557, 576 [162 Cal.Rptr. 431, 606 P.2d 738, 16 A.L.R.4th 1255]; see <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia </em>(1979) 443 U.S. 307, 318 [61 L.Ed.2d 560, 573, 99 S.Ct. 2781].) We presume in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the jury could reasonably have deduced from the evidence. <em>{People </em>v. <em>Bloyd </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 333, 346-347 [233 Cal.Rptr. 368, 729 P.2d 802].) \u201cWhether the evidence presented at trial is direct or circumstantial, ... the relevant inquiry on appeal remains whether <em>any </em>reasonable trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>{People </em>v. <em>Towler </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 105, 118 [181 Cal.Rptr. 391, 641 P.2d 1253].)</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">B. <em>Status of Victims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">Defendant notes that the assault, battery, and resisting offenses make the status of the victim as a \u201cpeace officer\u201d an element of these offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">We first discuss the definition of \u201cpeace officer.\u201d Chapter 4.5 of title 3 of part 2 of the Penal Code, commencing with section 830, is entitled \u201cPeace Officers.\u201d Section 830 defines a \u201cpeace officer\u201d and provides, in relevant part, \u201c[a]ny person who comes within the provisions of this chapter and who otherwise meets all standards imposed by law on a peace officer is a peace officer, and notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person other than those designated in this chapter is a peace officer.\u201d Section 830.1 provides, in relevant part that \u201cany police officer, <em>employed in that capacity and appointed by the chief of police or the chief executive of the agency, </em>of a city . . . is a peace officer.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">As defendant points out, the emphasized language was added to the statute in 1990. (See Stats. 1990, ch. 1695, \u00a7 9.) Before then, the statute provided, in relevant part, \u201cany police officer of a city ... is a peace officer.\u201d (See former \u00a7 830.1, Stats. 1981, ch. 744, \u00a7 1, pp. 2914-2915.)</p>\n<p id=\"b505-11\">The apparent purpose of this change was to clarify any possible ambiguity in the former definition by explicitly excluding therefrom (1) persons whose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>occupational duties may overlap with those of a police officer (e.g., private security guard, private investigator, etc.), <em>but </em>who are not officially employed by a city agency; and (2) persons who are officially employed by a city agency, but who do not have the occupational duties of a police officer. With this purpose in mind, we construe the statutory definition to confer peace officer status on any person officially hired to be a police officer by a city agency (i.e., appointed as and given the duties of a police officer by an official of a city agency authorized to do so).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Here, Officers Sullivan and Mank each testified that he was employed by and worked for the San Jose Police Department as a police officer. Each also testified that on the night in question, he was in uniform, driving a police cruiser on regular police patrol in a specific area of the city to which he had been officially assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">This testimony is substantial direct evidence that both Sullivan and Mank were employed <em>as </em>police officers (i.e., \u201cin that capacity\u201d). Moreover, since we presume that official duty has been regularly performed (Evid. Code, \u00a7 664), we may here reasonably presume that official duty had been regularly performed in the assignment of police vehicles, specific patrol areas, and general police patrolling responsibilities to these officers. Given the officers\u2019 actual employment as police officers by the San Jose Police Department, and the regular assignment of police duties to them by the department, the evidence supports a logical and reasonable inference, based on probability not possibility, that these officers had been officially hired as and given the duties of police officers by the San Jose Police Department, an agency of the city.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (See Evid. Code, \u00a7 600, subd. (b); <em>Aguimatang </em>v. <em>California State Lottery </em>(1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 769, 800 [286 Cal.Rptr. 57].) This inference supports a finding that the officers were \u201cpeace officers.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>\u2022 Indeed, this is both an obvious inference and, we believe, the only reasonable one. Not surprisingly, at trial, defense counsel made no effort to rebut this inference or raise a material question concerning the officers\u2019 status as \u201cpeace officers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">C. <em>Existence of Injury</em></p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The record reveals that during the altercation with defendant, Officer Mank bruised both his knees and received numerous cuts and abrasions on his hands. He also was exposed to defendant\u2019s blood. As a result, Mank went to the San Jose Emergency Room, where professional medical personnel cleaned his wounds, gave him supplies for scrubbing himself later, \u201cchecked out [his] knees to make sure there was no ligament damage or anything[,]\u201d and \u201ctreated the contusions on [his] knees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">Defendant points out that he was charged with a battery against Officer Mank that caused \u201cinjury,\u201d and that section 243, subdivision (f)(6), specifically defines \u201cinjury\u201d as \u201cany physical injury which requires professional medical treatment.\u201d He argues that under this definition, an injury is not something that \u201ccan be cured or alleviated with common household remedies, with self-help or by doing nothing\u201d but must be \u201csufficiently severe a physician would recommend or perform affirmative acts in intervention, such as minor surgery, suturing, skin grafts, administration of prescription medicines or the like.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> With this view in mind, he claims that there is insufficient evidence that his battery on Officer Mank inflicted an injury \u201cwhich required[d] professional medical treatment.\u201d (\u00a7 243, subd. (f)(6).)</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">The People argue, and we agree, that defendant\u2019s construction of \u201cinjury\u201d in section 243, subdivision (f)(6), is unreasonably narrow and, in effect, equates \u201cinjury\u201d in that section with serious or great bodily injury in subdivision (f)(5), thereby destroying the legislative distinction between the two. (See \u00a7 243, subd. (f)(5); see <em>People </em>v. <em>Hawkins </em>(1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 1373, 1375 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 434] [\u201cserious\u201d and \u201cgreat\u201d bodily injury are \u201csubstantially the same\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">In our view, where, as here, it is undisputed that the officer/victim suffered injuries that were, in fact, treated by professional medical personnel at an emergency room, there is sufficient evidence to support a finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>he suffered an \u201cinjury\u201d within the meaning of section 243, subdivision (f)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">\n<em>Instructional Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Defendant contends that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on whether Sullivan and Mank were \u201cpeace officers,\u201d failed to fully instruct on how to determine whether the officers were \u201cengaged in the performance of their duties\u201d when the offenses were committed, failed to instruct on the lesser included offenses of simple battery and assault with a deadly weapon, and failed to instruct the jury that it could not convict him of driving without a license unless there was proof independent of his own statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">A. <em>Definition of \u201cPeace Officer\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">The trial court instructed the jury that it must find that defendant assaulted, battered, and resisted a \u201cpeace officer.\u201d  Defendant, however, claims it failed to instruct them, in accordance with the statutory definition, that a \u201cpolice officer\u201d is a \u201cpeace officer\u201d only if he or she is \u201cemployed\u201d as a police officer and \u201cappointed by the chief of police or the chief executive of the [city\u2019s] agency.\u201d (See \u00a7 830.1, subd. (a).) Noting that instead, the court instructed them that \u201c[a] San Jose Police Department officer <em>is </em>a peace officer,\u201d he argues that the court \u201ccompletely\u201d withdrew from the jury the factual question of whether Officers Sullivan and Mank were \u201cpeace officers.\u201d (Italics added.) This error, he claims, is reversible per se.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">It is difficult to fault the trial court. In 1988, before section 830.1 was amended to its present state, our Supreme Court expressly upheld the validity of an instruction virtually identical to that given here. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 432, 443-444 [250 Cal.Rptr. 604, 758 P.2d 1135].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We further note that the court gave the most current CALJIC instructions, none of which reflect the 1990 amendment, even though at least one was revised in <em>1993. </em>(See CALJIC Nos. 9.20 (1989 rev.), 9.80 (1990 new), and 9.22 (1993 rev.).) At trial, no one suggested that the instructions were defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">Nevertheless, we agree with defendant that the 1990 amendment to section 830.1 renders the instruction in the language of the former statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>inadequate. An appropriate instruction should address the purpose of and thus reflect the amendment. Nevertheless, we disagree with defendant\u2019s claim that the instruction given <em>completely </em>withdrew from the jury the issue of whether Sullivan and Mank were \u201cpeace officers.\u201d The jury was required to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Officers Sullivan and Mank were \u201cpeace officers.\u201d Moreover, in defining \u201ca San Jose Police Department Officer [as] a peace officer,\u201d the court implicitly required a finding that Sullivan and Mank were not only police officers but officers of the San Jose Police Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Cummings </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 1233, 1315 [18 Cal.Rptr.2d 796, 850 P.2d 1], our Supreme Court recognized \u201ca clear distinction between instructional error that entirely precludes jury consideration of an element of an offense and that which affects only an aspect of an element.\u201d The distinction affects the applicable standard of review. Whereas the former type of error appears to be reversible per se <em>(id. </em>at p. 1315; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Hernandez </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 194, 210-211 [249 Cal.Rptr. 850, 757 P.2d 1013]), the latter is subject to review under the harmless error analysis of <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18, 24 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 710-711, 87 S.Ct. 824, 24 A.L.R.3d 1065], <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dyer </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 26, 64 [246 Cal.Rptr. 209, 753 P.2d 1]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wilkins </em>(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 761, 779 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 743], see <em>Pope </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1987) 481 U.S. 497, 502-503 [95 L.Ed.2d 439, 446-447, 107 S.Ct. 1918]<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> ; <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Clark </em>(1986) 478 U.S. 570, 576-579 [92 L.Ed.2d 460, 469-471, 106 S.Ct. 3101].)</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Applying the <em>Chapman </em>test here, we conclude that the failure to explicitly instruct in accordance with the amended definition of \u201cpeace officer\u201d was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Given the officers\u2019 undisputed testimony about their employment and official duties on the night in question, the lack of any evidence to the contrary, and the jury\u2019s implicit finding beyond a reasonable doubt that Sullivan and Mank were, in fact, police officers of the San Jose Police Department, we consider it inconceivable that a rational juror, properly instructed, would nevertheless have found that Sullivan and Mank either were not employed as police officers or were not officially hired and given the duties of police officers by the San Jose Police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>Department. Stated differently, no reasonable juror could have found that Sullivan and Mank were not \u201cpeace officers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">B. <em>Target Offenses</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Defendant notes that because the assault, battery, and resisting arrest offenses proscribe conduct against a peace officer who is \u201cengaged in the performance of his or her duties\u201d (see \u00a7\u00a7 243, subd. (c); 245, subd. (c); 148, subd. (a)), the jury had to find that Officers Sullivan and Mank were engaged in the performance of their duties when defendant committed the offenses against them. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Wilkins, supra, </em>14 Cal.App.4th at p. 776.)</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Here, the court instructed the jury that a peace officer is engaged in the performance of his duties if he is making or attempting to make a lawful arrest or a lawful detention. The court further instructed the jury on lawful arrests, lawful detentions, probable and reasonable cause, and the prosecution\u2019s burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Sullivan and Mank were engaged in the performance of their duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">Defendant points out, however, that to establish the engaged-in-etc. element of the offenses, the prosecution sought to prove that Sullivan had properly detained defendant for driving without a rear license plate light (Veh. Code, \u00a7 24601<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>) and was attempting to arrest him for being under the influence of some drug (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11550<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>). Given the prosecution\u2019s theory, defendant contends the trial court had a sua sponte duty to instruct on these target offenses. He argues that without such instructions the jury was unable to assess the propriety of the detention and attempted arrest. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">Officer Sullivan testified that (1) he stopped defendant\u2019s car because the rear license plate light was inoperative; and (2) after observing that defendant\u2019s pupils were dilated, his speech was excited, and his mouth was dry, he concluded that defendant was under the influence of a drug. Defendant introduced no evidence at trial to controvert this testimony. Indeed, his defense was that the officers used excessive force against him. Thus, the factual basis for determining the engaged-in-etc. element was undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">Given the officer\u2019s testimony, the target offenses were obvious. Moreover, they require no specialized legal knowledge to comprehend but are simple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>crimes, whose elements are obvious and would be commonly and easily understood by those familiar with the English language. In short, we cannot see, and defendant does not explain, how the failure to instruct on the target offenses prevented the jury from being able to determine the propriety of the detention and attempted arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Under certain factual situations, courts may have a sua sponte duty to give additional instructions concerning the engaged-in-etc. element. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Wilkins, supra, </em>14 Cal.App.4th 761, discussed below, at p. 672.) Here, however, additional instructions were not so necessary for the jury\u2019s understanding of this element (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Wickersham </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 307, 323 [185 Cal.Rptr. 436, 650 P.2d 311]) or essential to its determination that the court had a sua sponte duty to give them.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Assuming for purposes of argument only that as a matter of technical legal propriety the court should have instructed on the target offenses, we would find the error harmless even under <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>386 U.S. at page 24 [17 L.Ed.2d at pp. 710-711]. Given the jury\u2019s finding beyond a reasonable doubt that Officer Sullivan was engaged in the performance of his duties when he detained and attempted to arrest defendant for the express and undisputed reasons he gave, we conclude no rational juror, instructed on the target offenses, could have found that Sullivan was <em>not </em>engaged in the performance of his duties.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">Defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>People </em>v. <em>Mouton </em>(1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 1313 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 423] and <em>People </em>v. <em>Wilkins, supra, </em>14 Cal.App.4th 761 is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">In <em>Mouton, </em>the prosecution sought to prove the defendant guilty of murder on the theory that he aided and abetted another in the commission of three possible crimes\u2014carrying a concealed weapon, brandishing a weapon, assaulting with a deadly weapon\u2014and that the killing was the natural and probable consequence of any one of these target crimes. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mouton, supra, </em>15 Cal.App.4th at p. 1318.) On appeal, the court concluded that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on these target offenses. <em>{Ibid.) </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>The court explained that each target offense was an element of the charged murder because the jury had to determine beyond a reasonable doubt whether the defendant committed it and then whether the murder was the natural and probable consequence of committing it. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1319.) Without appropriate instructions, the jury was not required to make these findings and lacked proper guidance in determining the defendant\u2019s ultimate guilt for the charged murder. <em>(Ibid.) </em>However, the court did not find the error reversible per se. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1320.) It reversed because the legal definition of one of the target offenses\u2014assault with a deadly weapon\u2014was not one commonly understood without appropriate instructions. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1319-1321.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">Here, to find that Officer Sullivan was engaged in the performance of his duties, the jury did not have to determine whether defendant committed the target offenses. Indeed, whether he did or did not was irrelevant. Moreover, as noted above, the target offenses here were obvious and easily understood without specific instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Wilkins, supra, </em>14 Cal.App.4th 761, an officer arrested the defendant inside his home without a warrant. In instructing the jury on whether the officer was \u201cengaged in the performance of his duties,\u201d the trial court explained only the need for probable cause to make an arrest. On appeal, the court concluded that the trial court should also have instructed the jury that an arrest inside a home without a warrant required exigent circumstances. The failure to do so removed part of the engaged-in-etc. element from the jury\u2019s consideration. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 776-779.) However, the court went on to find the error harmless under <em>Chapman. (Id. </em>at p. 779.)</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Here, the particular facts did not mandate further instruction on the nature of a detention or arrest, and defendant makes no claim that the court\u2019s instructions were improper, incomplete, or inappropriate under the specific facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">C. <em>Lesser Included Offenses</em></p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">Defendant points out that the court instructed the jury that if it believed that the officers used excessive force against defendant, then it should acquit him of the battery and assault charges. Defendant argues, however, that even if the jury believed his defense, it still could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>convicted him of the lesser included offenses of simple battery and simple assault with a deadly weapon. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Hood </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 444, 450 [82 Cal.Rptr. 618,462 P.2d 370] [simple assault a lesser of assault on peace officer]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Curtis </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 347, 357 [74 Cal.Rptr. 713, 450 P.2d 33] [simple battery a lesser of battery on a peace officer].) Thus, he argues that the court had a sua sponte duty to give these instructions and erred in failing to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">The People note that the trial court expressly acknowledged its general duty to instruct on lessors but was concerned that giving them here would contradict the defense of excessive force. When the court asked for defense counsel\u2019s thoughts on the matter, she said she was \u201cnot requesting for any lessers[.]\u201d The court then said, \u201cThat\u2019s in accordance with what you said yesterday. I said it this morning, but\u2014okay.\u201d Under the circumstances, the People argue that defendant\u2019s claim on appeal is barred by the doctrine of invited error. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">\u201cThe obligation to instruct on lesser included offenses exists even when a defendant, as a matter of trial tactics, objects to their being given. But the doctrine of invited error will operate to preclude a defendant from gaining reversal on appeal because such an error was made by the trial court at the defendant\u2019s behest. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Duncan </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 955, 969 [281 Cal.Rptr. 273, 810 P.2d 131].)</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Defendant suggests that counsel\u2019s mere failure to request \u201clesser\u201d instructions does not constitute invited error. This may be so as a general rule. However, counsel here did not merely fail to request them. Rather, the court invited discussion on whether they should be given, indicating concern that they might harm the defense. In this context, defense counsel\u2019s comment was the equivalent of saying she did not want lesser instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">Defendant further argues that the doctrine does not apply because defense counsel was laboring under an erroneous belief, apparently shared by the trial court, that \u201clesser\u201d instructions would contradict the defense. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">It is true that the doctrine applies only where the record affirmatively shows that counsel acted for tactical reasons and not out of ignorance or mistake. <em>{People </em>v. <em>Cooper </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 771, 830-831 [281 Cal.Rptr. 90, 809 P.2d 865].) However, defendant misunderstands this requirement. As our Supreme Court explained in <em>People </em>v. <em>Cooper, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at page 831, to establish invited error, \u201cthe record must show <em>only </em>that counsel made a conscious, deliberate tactical choice between having the instruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>and not having it If counsel was ignorant of the choice, or mistakenly believed the court was not giving it to counsel, invited error will not be found. If, however, the record shows this conscious choice, it need not additionally show counsel correctly understood all the legal implications of the tactical choice. Error is invited if counsel made a conscious tactical choice. A claim that the tactical choice was uninformed or otherwise incompetent must, like any such claim, be treated as one of ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Here, even if, as defendant now suggests, defense counsel mistakenly believed the \u201clesser\u201d instructions contradicted the defense, such a mistake would not preclude application of the doctrine. Moreover, the record does not convince us that this was the reason for defense counsel\u2019s choice against having lesser instructions. She could reasonably have wanted to avoid a compromise verdict and rely on an all-or-nothing defensive tactical strategy.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Bunyard </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 1189, 1235 [249 Cal.Rptr. 71, 756 P.2d 795].)</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">D. <em>Independent Evidence of Guilt</em></p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Defendant notes that to prove defendant guilty of driving without a license, Officer Sullivan testified that when he stopped defendant and asked for his license, defendant said he did not have one. Defendant now contends the court erred in failing to give the corpus delicti instruction sua sponte: \u201cNo person may be convicted of a criminal offense unless there is some proof of each element of the crime independent of any confession or admission made by him outside of this trial.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (CALJIC No. 2.72.) He claims the error compels reversal because there was <em>no evidence </em>apart from his statement to support a finding that he did not have a driver\u2019s license at the time he was stopped. We conclude that any instructional error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">It is well settled that the trial court has a duty to instruct the jury sua sponte that the corpus delicti of an offense must be proved independently of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>admissions. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Beagle </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 441, 455 [99 Cal.Rptr. 313, 492 P.2d 1].) \u201cThe omission, however, does not constitute reversible error if upon a reweighing of the evidence it does not appear reasonably probable that a result more favorable to defendant would have been reached in the absence of the error.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>In reweighing the evidence, we are mindful that the corpus delicti may be proved by circumstantial evidence and need not be beyond a reasonable doubt. Rather, a slight or prima facie showing, permitting the reasonable inference that a crime was committed, is sufficient. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Diaz </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 495, 529 [11 Cal.Rptr.2d 353, 834 P.2d 1171].) Moreover, this inference need not be the only reasonable inference. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Towler </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 105, 115 [181 Cal.Rptr. 391, 641 P.2d 1253].)</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The People note that during her opening statement, defense counsel stated, \u201cMy client, Mr. Lara, was the driver of that car. There is no dispute there. [][]. . .He asks my client for his license. My client says, T don\u2019t have a license on me.\u2019 \u201d Given counsel\u2019s concession about what defendant said, the People argue that defendant waived any corpus delicti issue concerning whether he possessed a driver\u2019s license. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Although counsel may, by express statement or unequivocal conduct, concede a fact at trial, perhaps thereby making the corpus delicti rule inapplicable as to that fact (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Peters </em>(1950) 96 Cal.App.2d 671, 675-677 [216 P.2d 145]), defense counsel here did not concede the ultimate fact. Rather, she conceded at most that defendant made the statement to Officer Sullivan.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">The People next argue that defendant waived the issue by failing to object to the admission of his extrajudicial statement. If defendant were claiming that the People failed to establish the corpus delicti before his extrajudicial statement was admitted, then his failure to object might defeat such a claim. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Wright </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 367, 404 [276 Cal.Rptr. 731, 802 P.2d 221]; cf. also <em>People </em>v. <em>Sally </em>(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 1621, 1628 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 161].) However, the claim here is instructional, not evidentiary, error.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">Moreover, \u201c[a]lthough the normal practice is to establish the corpus delicti first, before confessions or admissions are introduced, the <em>order of proof </em>may be varied. [Citations.]\u201d (1 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (2d ed. 1988) Elements of Crime, \u00a7 137, p. 153, italics in original.) For this reason, trial court must give the corpus delicti instruction quoted above sua sponte. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 154.)</p>\n<p id=\"b516-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>Finally, the People claim that the corpus delicti rule was abrogated by the Truth-in-Evidence provisions of article I, section 28, subdivision (d), of the California Constitution (hereafter article I, section 28(d)).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Presumably, therefore, the corpus delicti instruction need no longer be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Culton </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 363, 373-376 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 189], Justice Timlin agrees with the People\u2019s position in a concurrence to his own lead opinion. Although the issue is complex and intriguing, we need not necessarily address it, for we conclude that even if it were error to omit the corpus delicti instruction, the error was harmless. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Kirkpatrick </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 988, 1008 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 818, 874 P.2d 248] [if defendant fails to show harm, claim may be rejected without discussing propriety of underlying cause]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Clark </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 41, 160 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 554, 833 P.2d 561] [same]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kelly </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 495, 548 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 677, 822 P.2d 385] [same].)</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Here, the record indicates that Officer Sullivan stopped a car that defendant was driving and asked if he had a driver\u2019s license. Defendant gave a response but did not produce one. Although the evidence is slight, one reasonable inference therefrom is that defendant was driving in violation of Vehicle Code section 12500, subdivision (a). Thus, we disagree with the premise of defendant\u2019s claim: that a properly instructed jury could not have found the corpus delicti of the offense. In our view, it is not reasonably probable the jury would have reached a more favorable verdict had the corpus delicti instruction been given. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243].)</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">VI, VII<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">The order directing defendant to pay attorney fees is stricken.

Such a construction would deny peace officer status to those who may be hired via a proper and legitimate delegation of appointing authority. Rather, as discussed above, we read the statutory language in light of its purpose, which is to define \u201cpeace officers\" to include only those police officers, who are officially hired as such by a city agency.

We consider this verbal formulation essentially the same- as the <em>Chapman </em>standard, where the question is whether on the whole record the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt <em>(Chapman </em>v. <em>California supra, </em>386 U.S. at p. 24 [17 L.Ed.2d at pp. 710-711].)

(See <em>People </em>v. <em>Cummings, supra, </em>4 Cal.4th at p. 1314.) As noted above, the jury was extensively instructed on the engaged-in-etc. element and required to find it beyond a reasonable doubt.
