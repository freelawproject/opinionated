Issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-9\">At the trial on Majr 15, 1889, the plaintiff showed, as it was claimed in his behalf, that in 1877 he was indebted to the firm of Washington Butcher\u2019s Sons, provision dealers, in the sum of $700, and, to secure them for this amount and for future indebtedness, he gave them a note with warrant of attorney for $1,200, with the assurance, however, from the firm, that the judgment should not be used to his prejudice, but held as a security only, and that if used, the real estate bound by it should be bought in by the firm and held for plaintiff\u2019s benefit until his indebtedness should be paid, when they would reconvey to him; that he subsequently became embarrassed, and Albert Miller, one of the firm of Washington Butcher\u2019s Sons, suggested that the property of plaintiff should be sold at sheriff\u2019s sale, bought in by the firm for plaintiff\u2019s benefit, and when the debt was paid a reconveyance should be made to him; that the plaintiff consented, and the property was struck down for $50 to Miller.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-10\">It was further shown that the plaintiff\u2019s son was in possession of the property for some time after the sheriff\u2019s sale, as tenant under the purchasers, until dispossessed by the latter; that although receipts were given for money paid as rent, it was not to be so considered by the parties. The sheriff\u2019s vendee afterwards conveyed to one O\u2019Rourke, but the latter had previously been informed of the agreement with reference to the sale of the property at sheriff\u2019s sale. At the time of the sale the plaintiff\u2019s indebtedness was about $900: $240 was paid while the plaintiff and his son held possession after the sale by the sheriff. The property cost the plaintiff $3,500. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>The sheriff\u2019s vendees had charged the costs of the sheriff\u2019s sale to the plaintiff and had credited to him the amount received for the property from O\u2019Rourke.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-5\">At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, on motion of defendant, the court entered judgment of nonsuit.

Thompson, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b239-9\">Counsel submitted: That there was nothing in plaintiff\u2019s testimony that showed any facts that would make the purchaser at the sheriff\u2019s sale a trustee ex maleficio. On the contrary, the testimony was: 1. That there was an indebtedness of $900, for which the Butchers had a judgment. 2. That there was a sheriff\u2019s sale, at which the plaintiff in execution bought and paid the purchase money. 3. That there was a rental of the premises by the purchaser to defendant\u2019s son, -who paid rent. 4. That plaintiff, who occupied the premises, under the lease to his son, was dispossessed under a landlord and tenant proceeding. 5. That some years afterward the plaintiff paid the Butchers the amount of his indebtedness to them, as appeared by a statement of account in which he was given credit for the amount realized from the sale to O\u2019Rourke. Upon these facts two nonsuits had been granted.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b239-10\">Per Curiam:</author>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
