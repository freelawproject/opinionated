Brunner, defendant above named, subject to said charge, who is the present owner thereof, and that said charge of five thousand dollars is now due and still unpaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b443-8\">That Gabriel Wolfersberger, the executor nominated in said last will and testament, and to whom letters testamentary were duly issued thereon, has since died, and that letters of administration de bonis non cum testamento annexo have been duly granted by the register of wills of said county of Lebanon to George S. Capp, the plaintiff above named.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b443-9\">That the bond referred to in the said deed from John Wolfersberger to John Wealand has been lost, if a bond ever existed; that proper and diligent search has been made for the said bond, and it cannot be found, nor can any evidence of its existence be found except the reference to it in said deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b443-10\">If the court be of the opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to recover, then judgment to be entered for the plaintiff in the sum of five thousand dollars, with interest from September 5, 1889; but if not, then judgment to be entered for the defendant. The costs to follow the judgment and either party reserving the right to sue out the proper writ of error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>After argument, the court, McPherson, J., filed the following opinion :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-4\">This action is intended to settle a doubt, whether the bond referred to in the deed of September 3, 1863, did not contain the names of some other persons than the children of the testator to whom he bequeathed this money; and whether, therefore, there may not be a conflict between the children and these possible beneficiaries, thus making it unsafe for the defendant to pay voluntarily in accordance with the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-5\">Several explanations of the facts may be conceived. One is, that no bond at all may have been given; but, while this finds some support in the absence of all external evidence about so valuable a paper, it need not be insisted upon. Assuming that a bond was given but has been lost, the question then is, who were the ultimate beneficiaries therein ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-6\">1. The bond may have contained the names of other persons than the children of John Wolfersberger. The objections to this theory are, that the deed recites the names of no such persons ; that the natural heirs would thus be passed by without apparent reason; that a claim likely to have been carefully guarded has not been heard of for more than twenty-five years; and, specially, that such a supposition requires us to hold that, after the decedent had by deed given away this portion of his property to one set of persons, he still assumed to dispose of it by will to other and different persons. This presumes wrongdoing on his part, and is only to be adopted if no other reasonable explanation can be found.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-7\">It might also be fairly argued that, even if the bond did contain the names of other persons than his children, yet it was testamentary in its character and was therefore revoked by his subsequent will. We lay no stress upon this suggestion, however, but mention it merely to indicate another method of avoiding the presumption of wrong-doing by the decedent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-8\">2. The bond may have contained the names of the children. This is probable enough, would harmonize the deed, bond and will, and would relieve the case of difficulty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-9\">3. The bond may have contained no names at all of the ultimate beneficiaries, but merely followed the deed in declaring that the principal was to be paid after the widow\u2019s death \u201c to those entitled thereto,\u201d thus leaving them to be specified either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>by the intestate laws or by John Wolfersberger\u2019s will. This explanation seems to us much the most likely, and is the one we think should be adopted. It is in accord with the language of the deed, and with the almost universal custom which repeats in the conveyance which secures a bond the names of the obligees. It leaves to John Wolfersberger the full control of the principal sum, and does not require us to presume a gift to unknown and unnamed donees. It relieves us from concluding that the decedent gave by deed to one set of persons the right to this considerable sum, and afterwards attempted by will to wrongfully take it away and give it to others. And, finally, it keeps this money in its natural channel, leaving it to pass by his will to those whom presumably he would most wish to benefit, and from whom, so far as can be seen, be had no reason or desire to divert it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-5\">One further question remains, viz.: the jurisdiction of the Common Pleas, and this we think is undoubted. Clearly, the charge is imposed by the deed and not by the will; the will simply designates the persons who are to share it, after the death of the widow. But as the charge itself was created by contract in the lifetime of the decedent, and as the executor is expressly directed by the will to receive it, this suit is by the proper person and in the proper court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-6\">We direct judgment to be entered in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of five thousand dollars with interest from September 5, 1889.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-7\">Judgment having been entered as directed, the defendant took this appeal, assigning the entry of judgment for the plaintiff, on the case stated, for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b445-8\"><em>Mr. Grant </em>Weidman, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-9\">Counsel cited: Frankem v.
