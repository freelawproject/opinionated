Issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-15\">At the trial on December 10, 1888, before Swartz, P. J., the plaintiff offered in evidence a note for $2,000, dated May 1,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-16\">1885, made by I. H. Todd and indorsed by J. H. Boone. The plaintiff then rested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-17\">. The defendant, in his case in chief, testified as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>\u201cI know Edwin Boone, the cashier of the National'Union Bank of Reading, and Jeremiah H. Boone, formerly of Norris-town; I have heard read the note in evidence in this suit; I gave that note to George C. Mitchell, who was the confidential clerk of Jeremiah H. Boone, upon the understanding and agreement that it was merely a matter of form, to cover up an overdraft of Jeremiah Boone in the National Union Bank of Reading; I never received consideration for it to the extent of one cent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-5\">At the close of the testimony the court, Swaetz, P. J., instructed the jury that there was no questions of fact arising, and therefore there was nothing for them to do but to render a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for the amount of the note, with interest from the date of its maturity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-6\">A verdict was thereupon rendered in favor of the plaintiff for 82,894.10. A rule for a new trial having been discharged, judgment was entered, when the defendant took this appeal assigning, inter alia, the instruction to the jury as error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b337-7\"><em>Mr. George M. </em>Corson, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b337-8\">Counsel cited: Hutchinson v.

Ocean Bank, 20 Pa. 384, that \u201c the maker of an accommodation note cannot sot up the want of consideration as a defence against it in the hands of a third person, though it be there as a collateral security merely. He who chooses to put himself in the front of a negotiable instrument-ior the benefit of his friend, must abide the consequence, .... and has no more right to complain, if his friend accommodates himself by pledging it for an old debt, than if he had used it in any other way.....Accommodation paper is a loan of the maker\u2019s credit, without restriction as to the manner of its use.\u201d This language was repeated emphatically in Hart v. Trust Co., 118 Pa. 565. These are two only of a long line of cases holding the same doctrine, and the responsibility of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>makers of accommodation paper ought by this time to be generally understood. The rule above stated is decisive of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
