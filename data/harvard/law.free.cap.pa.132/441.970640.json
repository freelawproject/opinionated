All of which lie expects to be able to prove at tlie trial of said cause.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-14\">On May 22,1889, a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence was taken.

Lichten were engaged in a business known as the Reticher Cured Feed Company, in the city of Philadelphia; that when deponent received said sum he borrowed it from the plaintiffs for the use of said business; that in a very short time thereafter he paid to said plaintiffs a check of about $160 on account of said loan. Deponent further says that soon after the payment made by him, his partner, Moses H. Lichten, who was a member of plaintiffs\u2019 firm, and a member also of said Reticher Feed Company, paid to the plaintiffs the balance of said due-bill. Deponent further says that he has been absent for some weeks from Philadelphia, and is now at Chicago, 111., and will be absent on business until July next; that not having the books or memoranda at hand he cannot give the dates of payment, but he says positively, that said due bill is fully paid; that before leaving the city of Philadelphia he called on the plaintiffs, who then informed him that he did not owe one cent to said firm, that said due bill was fully paid; that if necessary, on his return he can give the dates of payment; that in the absence of his books he cannot give dates, but he can say that said due bill was paid in the manner as stated, and that said plaintiffs admitted to him in the early part of May, 1889, that it was paid, and that they have no claim thereon. Deponent further says, that he believes that said suit is brought by some other person in the name of plaintiffs\u2019 firm without their knowledge and consent, and not by them, simply to annoy and harass deponent, and he says this because he knows the instrument on which suit is brought is paid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-8\">On June 29, 1889, the rule granted was discharged; where<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>upon the defendant took this appeal, specifying that the court erred \u201c in entering judgment for $423.06 on the ground that the original and supplemental affidavits were insufficient.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b467-5\"><em>Mr. J.

Judgment was therefore, on June 15, 1889, entered for the plaintiffs, because of its insufficiency. It seems, however, that for some reason, presumably on account of the defendant\u2019s alleged absence from the city at the time, leave was a few days afterwards given to file a supplemental affidavit, as of the date the judgment was entered, nunc pro tunc, and a rule was also entered to show cause why the judgment should not be opened, and the defendant let into a defence. This rule was subsequently discharged; and the question now turns upon the sufficiency, not only of the original, but of the original and supplementary affidavits ; for as the latter was filed as of the day judgment was entered, nunc pro tunc, the judgment must be taken to have been entered upon the insufficiency of both. This was doubtless the purpose of the court in making the order for filing the supplementary affidavit as of that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-11\">This affidavit was made by the defendant when he was absent from home, and when he had no access to his books to refresh liis recollection as to the dates of the respective pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>menta, and it must be conceded that it is not as full, precise, and satisfactory as it might have been, under other circumstances, but we think it sets up a sufficiently substantial defence. Admitting the execution of the obligation in suit on the day of its date, July 5, 1883, the affiant states that he borrowed the money for the use of the Reticher Cured Feed Company, of which he was a member; that in a very short time thereafter he paid to the plaintiffs $160 on account of the loan, by a check of that amount, and that his partner afterwards paid the balance; that before leaving Philadelphia to go to Chicago, where the affiant was when the affidavit was made, he called upon the plaintiffs with reference to this claim, and that they freely admitted to him that the debt was fully paid; that the defendant was not indebted to them in any sum whatever; and that they had no claim upon the cause of action embraced in the statement filed, or upon any other. He further states that owing to his absence from home and want of access to his books, he is unable to give the dates of the respective payments, but avers his willingness upon his return, if necessary, to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">The averments contained in the affidavit are of actual payments on the debt in suit, made by the defendant himself or his partner, to the plaintiffs themselves, and of admissions of the plaintiffs to that effect. We think this is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The judgment is reversed, and a procedendo awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">On March 28, 1890, an order for a re-argument was refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
