Palmer, deceased, dated May 16, 1885, instituted upon the petition of John K. Creevey, praying that an issue be granted to decide the questions: 1. Whether the said decedent at the date of the said alleged will had sufficient mental capacity to make a will; 2. Whether the said alleged will was the last will and testament of said deceased; 3. Whether the said alleged will was executed by said deceased under undue influence, the court, Hanna, P. J., entered an order that the appeal be sustained, the issue granted, and precept awarded. Thereupon tire counsel for the contestant prepared a precept directed to the Court of Common Pleas No. 3, making the contestant the plaintiff and the proponents of the will defendants in the issue, in accordance with the opinion of Mr. Justice Green, in Yardley v. Cuthbertson, 108 Pa. 447.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-11\">On June 29, 1889, Jobn S. Hallman, administrator of Mary J.

N. 384, continuing: This is the same case of Yardley v. Cuthbertson, 108 Pa. 446, referred to in appellant\u2019s paper-book. The views of Mr. Justice Green, in that case, cited by appellant, were ex pressly declared to be obiter dicta only. The whole subject has been thoroughly discussed in the later case of Ruddach v. Reichenbach, 17 W. N. 549, in which Judge Allison suggests that it is a fair inference that Mr. Justice Green\u2019s attention was not called to the act of assembly on which this point turns. Judge Allison further refers to a learned article, written by Judge Penrose, of the Orphans\u2019 Court, in the Legal Intelligencer of Noyember 20, 1885.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b322-11\"> The article referred to, is reprinted in 17 W.
