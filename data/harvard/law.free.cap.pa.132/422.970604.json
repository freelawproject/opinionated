That the real estate aforesaid be parted and divided among the several persons entitled thereto according to law and the practice in chancery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-5\">5. This cause is referred to Joseph Savidge, Esq., as master and commissioner: (1) To state an account of the mesne profits arising and accruing from the real estate aforesaid from the fourth day of August, 1886, and to submit a decree in conformity with liis findings.

Lynch. The latter died intestate in September, 1885, leaving a widow, Virginia Reed Lynch, the plaintiff below; and testator\u2019s widow died in August, 1886. By his last will and testament, Patrick Lynch devised the real estate in question to his wife for life, remainder to his son for life, remainder in fee to the issue of his son, if any, living at the time of the first life-tenant\u2019s decease, etc., and, in default of such issue living at that time, then to the Right Rev. Bishop Wood, for charitable uses. The testator\u2019s son never had any issue, and, of course, the devise to them never took effect. The ultimate limitation to Bishop Wood, for charitable uses, was absolutely void, because the will was executed less than thirty days before testator\u2019s death; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>and, according to the provisions of the act of April 26, 1855, \u00a7 11, the ultimate remainder, which otherwise would have gone to Bishop Wood, in trust, etc., went \u201cto the residuary legatee or devisee, next of kin, or heirs, according to law.\u201d There being no residuary legatee other than Bishop Wood, the remainder in question passed under the intestate law to Daniel J. Lynch, the testator\u2019s only son and heir at law. The effect of that was to give Daniel the remainder in fee, subject to the life-estate of his mother, but determinable by the birth of issue living at the time of her decease. He never had any issue; consequently, the contingent limitation over to them never became operative, and he died seised of the remainder in fee, subject only to the life-estate of his mother. That remainder passed, under the intestate law, to his next of kin, his paternal uncles and aunts, subject to the statutory interest therein of his widow, Virginia Reed Lynch, the appellee: Cote\u2019s App., 79 Pa. 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">There is no question as to who his next of kin are. That has been settled by the finding of the master. Some of them are brothers and sisters of the half blood of intestate\u2019s father, Patrick Lynch, and one is a brother of the whole blood; but, inasmuch as \u00a7 8 of the act of April 8, 1833, makes no distinction between those of the whole and those of the half blood, they all inherit and take equally, all being of the blood of the first purchaser: Danner v. Shissler, 31 Pa. 289; Parr v. Bank-hart, 22 Pa. 291. The four children of Mary Boyle, deceased, paternal aunt of the intestate, take by representation the share that their mother would be entitled to if living. The specifications of error are not sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Decree affirmed, and appeal dismissed, at the costs of appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
