The account, which was signed by the defendant, and was sued upon subject to a credit of $2,190.97, to which the defendant would have been entitled as a distributee under the will of the decedent, had he paid the amount claimed, was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-6\">Jacob H.

While it is true that such an account was signed and was given Andrew Sommer, yet it incorrectly states the condition of the accounts between me and him, a full investigation of books and papers showing that so far from my being indebted at that time to him in the sum of the said statement, he was indebted to me over and above all possible charges, in the sum of $1,245.81. In addition to this, he owes me $259.65, cash dividends received by him on collateral policies of insurance which he holds, for which dividends he has not given me any credit. His estate is also indebted to me, as is admitted by the plaintiff in his statement, in the sum of $2,190.97, and I shall ask on the trial of the cause for a certificate in my favor for these three amounts, or in the aggregate $3,696.38 with interest. The error in making up the account arose from a charge to me of $4,106.03, amount of loss in a certain business, which should have been $2,008.01; from an erroneous credit of $193.13 to Andrew Sommer; and from a calculation of interest which was incorrect, and which helped to make a balance which subsequent investigation proved to be entirely incorrect. The plaintiff also holds paid-up policies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>of insurance on my life, amounting to $6,610, which should be delivered to me, but which he claims to hold as collateral for the pretended debt, although admitting that I paid the premiums on these policies until they became paid up by their terms.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-5\">A rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence having been taken, the rule was discharged on January 12, 1889, when the plaintiff took this appeal assigning the discharge of said rule for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b59-6\"><em>Mr. George P.
