No representation of any kind upon the subject of the title of the assured to the real estate having been made, the policy, written upon the knowledge of the company\u2019s agent, was to be interpreted as made in view of the facts of the case, and as intended to cover such interest as the assured had therein.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b260-12\">2. That interest was a leasehold only, but an insurable interest; and presumably it was the interest which an application, if one had been made, would have shown; wherefore, the policy was not void for the alleged reason that an entire premium was paid, and the assured had no title to the buildings, a portion of the property covered by the insurance.</syllabus>\n<judges data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b260-13\">Before Sterrett, Green, Clark, Williams, McCollum and Mitchell, JJ.</judges>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-14\">No. 300 January term 1889, Sup.

Elcock, </em>for the appellant:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-5\">1. There was no application made. There was no representation as to title, or value, or anything whatever, the policy being written by the defendant after its agent had inspected and examined the property. Any question, therefore, of title, or estate, or information, was waived: Cumberland V. M. Prot. Co. v. Schell, 29 Pa. 31; Howard F. Ins. Co. v. Bruner, 23 Pa. 50. No inquiry was made as to the interest of the assured; so there was no misleading: Wells v. Insurance Co., 9 S. &amp; 11. 103. Unless a statement of interest is required, either in the application or in the policy, the insured need make none; and unless it is otherwise provided, it is sufficient that he has an insurable interest: Walsh v. Fire Ass\u2019n, 127 Mass. 383; Tyler v. Insurance Co., 12 Wend. 507; Inslow v. Deale, 18 Md. 26. There was no change in the risk; none is averred.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-6\">2. How would indorsing on the policy that the assured was a tenant with the right to purchase the fee, change or vary the risk ? The letter of the contract is to insure an unknown risk. The contract is to be taken strongly against the one who writes it and has the advantage of inquiry to guard all his rights: Grandin v. Insurance Co., 107 Pa. 26; Imperial F. Ins. Co. v. Dunham, 117 Pa. 460; Dwelling-house Ins. Co. v. Hoffman, 125 Pa. 626. Whilst the plaintiff had an insurable interest in the real estate, as every lessee has: Hope M. Ins. Co. v. Brolaskey, 35 Pa. 282; Imp. F. Ins. Co. v. Murray, 73 Pa. 13; Miltenberger v. Beacom, 9 Pa. 198, yet the plaintiff claims for nothing but its actual loss on machinery and other personal property on the premises. The waiver of the right to recover as to the leasehold, however, is not to be construed as against the plaintiff\u2019s absolute rights.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b263-7\"><em>Mr. Isaac S. Sharp </em>(with him <em>Mr. S. H. </em>Alloman), for the appellee:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-8\">1. \u201c The assured warrant.....that they have not omitted to state to this company any information material to the risk,\u201d and that \u201c if the assured is not the sole and unconditional owner of the property; or, if any building intended.to be insured stands on ground not owned in fee-simple by the assured,\u201d the policy shall be void. It is an admitted fact that the build<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>ings intended to be insured, stood on ground leased to the policy holder, and, therefore, of cotirse, not owned by it in fee-simple. It would seem to be an insult to the court\u2019s intelligence to argue that this rendered the policy void as regards the real estate. As, then, the policy is void as to the realty, the consideration was .entire, and this rendered the contract of insurance void as to the personalty: Fire Association v. Williamson, 26 Pa. 196; Gottsman v. Insurance Co., 56 Pa. 210.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-6\">2. Nor is the principle applicable here, that an examination of the premises by an agent of the company nullifies the implied erroneous representations of the assured. This is true as to the physical condition of the property, because the knowledge which the company has of the true state of facts, estops them from saying that they were misled by an incorrect statement. But how can a physical \u00e9xamination of a property charge the company with knowledge that the insured has only a leasehold, and thus estop them from saying that they did not know what the insured\u2019s title was? This would be absurd. No view of the premises could show the title of the assured. The physical condition of the property is what is <em>referred to in </em>Howard F. Ins. Co. v. Bruner, 23 Pa. 50; Cumberland V. M. Prot. Co. v. Schell, 29 Pa. 31. And it is conceded that the company\u2019s agents did not know the nature of the assured\u2019s interest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-7\">3. How would a business man, whose znind does not reach after technicalities, understand such an izzstrument? Would he zzot say, without hesitation, that if a man wanted to insuz\u2019e a part, or a conditional interest, in property, or insure a building standing on leased ground, by this form of policy, he must have the fact indorsed upon it that his interest is partial or conditional, or that the ground on which the building stands is leased ? If his attention were called to the terms of the policy, no other thought would present itself to his mind. And this is the test that should be applied to such an instrument; its language should be taken in a popular sense : Wood on Insurance, ed. 1886, 143, 144.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b264-8\">\n<em>Opinion,</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"ANA\"><em>Mr. </em>Justice Williams :</author>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">A glance at the facts of this case will prepare the way for the application of the legal principles that control it. The action is on a policy of insurance. The insured was a manu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>factoring company occupying brick and frame buildings on Oakford street, in the city of Philadelphia, as a lessee. Its machinery and tools were in these buildings, in which its business was conducted. It had no title, legal or equitable, to the real estate, and no interest in it except as lessee. Its property was therefore all personal, and insurable as such, consisting of the leasehold interest in the real estate, and the machinery and tools used in the business. The tool company wanted insurance on its property. In some manner, not explained by the testimony, this fact became known to the representative of the British America Assurance Company, and that company issued a policy for $2,500, $1,000 of which was on the buildings, and the remainder on the tools and machinery contained therein. The do fence now taken is, that the policy is partly upon real estate and partly on personal property, for which an entire premium was paid, and that, as the assured had no title to the land, the policy is void as to it, and being void in part is void in whole, so that no recovery can now be had. This position rests on one of the almost innumerable conditions, stipulations, and provisos which appear on the policy, and which asserts that if the assured is not the sole and unconditional owner of the property, or if the building stands on ground not owned in fee-simple by the assured, or if the interest of the assured is not truly stated in the policy, then the policy shall be void. Is this condition applicable to the case presented on this policy ?</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">A policy of insurance, like any other contract, is to he read in the light of the circumstances that surround it. This policy was issued without any application or written request describing the interest of the assured in the buildings. No actual representation of any sort upon the subject, oral or written, is alleged to have been made by or on behalf of the assured. We ought to assxime that a policy written under such circumstances was written upon the knowledge of the representative of the insurer, and intended to cover in good faith the interest which the insured had in the buildings. Fraud is never to be presumed, and in this case no fraudulent representation is shown -or alleged, unless it can be deduced from the statements of the insurer, made, as we must presume, on the knowledge of its representative, and for which the insured is in no manner responsible. W e must also remember that this policy is to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>interpreted most strongly against the company whose contract it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Applying these principles to the question now raised, we conclude that the policy written on the knowledge of the insurer was made in view of the facts of the case, and was intended to cover such interest in the buildings as the insured had. This was a leasehold only, but it was an insurable interest. Presumably it is the interest which an application, if one had been made, would have shown, for it is the only interest which the tool company ever had or claimed to have. To such an interest, the proviso whose protection is invoked is not applicable. The policy covering only the interest of the lessee, the ownership of the fee becomes immaterial. The lessee cannot control its transfer, and has no right to be heard upon any subject relating to its ownership, so long as its possession under its lease is not disturbed. This view of the case renders it unnecessary to refer to the cases cited in support of the general doctrine, that a false affirmation of ownership, on which insurance is induced, will relieve the insurer from liability on the policy. The court below erred in entering judgment non obstante veredicto on the reserved point, and</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Judgment is now entered on the verdict.</p>\n<judges id=\"b266-7\">Mr. Justice Mitchell dissented.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
