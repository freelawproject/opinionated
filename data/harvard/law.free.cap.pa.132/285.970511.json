David R. Eichert claimed under a deed executed by Ins mother, Catharine Eichert, to himself; the other defendants held under him. The plaintiffs introduced evidence which tended to show that Catharine Eichert, at the time the deed to the defendant was executed, was an imbecile and incapable of managing her own affairs. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs. No exceptions were taken either to the rulings or the charge of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-6\">A rule for a new trial was subsequently discharged, and on June 17, 1889, judgment was entered upon the verdict. On the same day,.the defendant entered a rule on the plaintiffs to commence their second action of ejectment within six months. This rule was discharged on June 22, 1889, and on the same day the plaintiffs filed a disclaimer to all right, title and interest in the undivided one seventh of the premises in dispute, and on the same day a writ of habere facias possessionem was issued,, on the praecipe of the plaintiffs, for six undivided sevenths of the property. The defendant then entered a rule upon the plaintiffs to set aside the writ, which rule the court subsequently discharged. Thereupon the defendant took this appeal, specifying that the court erred: 1. In discharging the motion made by the defendant for a new trial. 2. In entering judgment upon the verdict for the plaintiffs. 3. In discharging the rule upon the plaintiffs to commence their second action of ejectment within six months, or show cause why the same cannot be brought. 4. In discharging the rule to set aside the writs of habere facias possessionem and fieri facias for costs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b310-7\"><em>Mr. William W.

The property in dispute was claimed by the plaintiffs in right of their wives, and the necessity of having the names of the latter placed upon the record is obvious. This was a mistake amendable below and here. It is a technical matter. The allowance of the amendment in this court can do the defendant no injury, and we will permit it to be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">The appeal itself is without merit. The case comes up without an exception to anything, and is in effect a motion for a new trial. There is nothing for us to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
