Ford, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">{\u00b6 1} This appeal originated from the Lake County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division. Appellant, Jamie L. Eckliff, the biological mother, appeals from an April 29, 2005 judgment entry in which the trial court adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision and ordered that appellee, Timothy J. Walters, the biological father, did not owe any child support arrearages.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">{\u00b6 2} On September 8, 2003, Lake County Department of Jobs and Family Services (\u201cLCDJFS\u201d) filed a complaint for child support against appellee for the parties\u2019 minor child, Alexis, who was born in 1996.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On October 7, 1997, appellee was ordered to pay $232.20 per month, plus processing fees, in child support for the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">{\u00b6 3} On June 5, 2003, appellant\u2019s husband adopted the minor child, with appellee\u2019s written consent. At the time of the adoption, appellee owed $14,861.02 in back child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">{\u00b6 4} On September 8, 2003, LCDJFS filed a complaint for child support and reimbursement against appellee for support of the minor child up to the date the adoption was finalized.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">{\u00b6 5} The trial court held a hearing on the matter on September 2, 2004, before a magistrate. The parties stipulated that the amount of arrearages appellant owed was $14,861.02. The magistrate issued her decision on September 22, 2004, which the trial court adopted on April 29, 2005. It is from this judgment that appellant appeals, raising the following three assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b760-10\">{\u00b6 6} \u201c[1] The trial court committed an abuse of discretion and erred to the prejudice of appellant by prohibiting * * * testimony from appellee as to whether or not he understood whether the past due child support could be waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-11\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c[2] The trial court committed an abuse of discretion and erred to the prejudice of [appellant] by finding that an alleged oral contract existed whereby appellant waived all child support arrearage in exchange for appellee signing the consent to adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-12\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c[3] The trial court committed an abuse of discretion and erred to the prejudice of appellant by allowing a past due support amount of $14,861.02 to be reduced to zero when the evidence was clear that [appellee] had failed to visit with the minor child or pay support for the minor child for over one year prior to an adoption proceeding regarding the minor child being filed in Lake County Probate Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>{\u00b6 9} In her first assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred when it sustained appellee\u2019s objections with regard to whether he believed that back support could legally be waived. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">{\u00b6 10} A trial court\u2019s admission of evidence is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>In re Anthony, </em>11th Dist. No. 2002-A-0096, 2003-Ohio-5712, 2003 WL 22429035, at \u00b6 25. An abuse of discretion is more than an error of law or judgment, but rather a finding that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140. In determining whether the trial court abused its discretion, we may not merely substitute our judgment for that of the trial court. <em>Pons v. Ohio State Med. Bd. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 619, 621, 614 N.E.2d 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">{\u00b6 11} At the hearing, appellee was asked on cross-examination, \u201c[I]s it your testimony that my client actually told you that if you sign this form, that she would waive any future or past support?\u201d He responded that it was. However, when asked if those were her exact words, he said, \u201cWhile we were discussing this, I asked her if I would pay any future or past support and her answer was no.\u201d Appellant\u2019s attorney then stated, \u201cAnd so she is kind of giving you legal advice; isn\u2019t she?\u201d At that point, appellee\u2019s attorney objected, and the trial court sustained the objection. Appellant\u2019s attorney then inquired, \u201cAnd did you ever ask an attorney for an attorney\u2019s advice on that issue?\u201d Again, appellee\u2019s attorney objected, and the trial court sustained it. Finally, appellee was asked if he \u201cever talk[ed] to anybody about whether or not that was an accurate statement, that you could waive your past support?\u201d Appellee\u2019s attorney objected once more, and the trial court sustained the objection for the third time.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">{\u00b6 12} Appellant claims that when appellee said, \u201cI asked her if I would pay any future or past support,\u201d he revealed that he did not know whether the agreement was legal. We disagree. Appellee\u2019s response could be interpreted to mean that when she asked him to sign the consent, and he responded by asking her if he would still have to pay future and past support, he was asking her if she would agree to that, not whether it was legal.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">{\u00b6 13} Moreover, we agree with appellee\u2019s contention that \u201c[a]n agreement between biological parents to exchange a consent to adoption for forgiveness of arrearages in current child support is an enforceable agreement,\u201d citing <em>Tressler v. Tressler </em>(1972), 32 Ohio App.2d 79, 61 O.O.2d 85, 288 N.E.2d 339, in support of this proposition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>{\u00b6 14} In <em>Nelson v. Nelson </em>(1990), 65 Ohio App.3d 800, 804, 585 N.E.2d 502, this court disagreed with the rationale of <em>Tressler, </em>stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cWhile this court is aware that our sister courts permit absolution of the father\u2019s \u2018natural duty of support\u2019 by way of agreement and/or the doctrine of laches, we do not fully endorse the rationale expressed there. To the contrary, this court adopts the more traditional philosophy that court-ordered support is for the benefit of the children rather than the custodial parent and, consequently, cannot be waived by the parents.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">{\u00b6 16} Despite disagreeing with the rationale of <em>Tressler, </em>we further reasoned:</p>\n<p id=\"AaL\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c[I]t would be unreasonable in all circumstances to permit the parents, either individually or jointly, to absolve themselves of [their] duty of support by entering into an agreement between themselves to that effect subsequent to a court order. However, the father can \u2018relieve himself from <em>liability </em>to the mother for support of their minor children\u2019 by agreement. (Emphasis added.) 47 Ohio Jurisprudence 3d (1983) 75, Family Law, Section 614. This in essence, allows the parents to enter into an agreement which would, at best, have retroactive application for the past support. In other words, the mother can \u2018forgive\u2019 the father for the past arrearages by agreement * * Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">{\u00b6 18} Thus, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to allow appellant to question appellee regarding whether he believed that a waiver of back support was legal, since it is legal to waive back support. Thus, it was irrelevant as to what his belief was. Therefore, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">{\u00b6 19} In his second assignment of error, appellant maintains that the trial court erred by finding that an oral agreement existed between the parties. After a thorough review of the record, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">{\u00b6 20} In <em>Dinunzio v. Murray, </em>11th Dist. No. 2003-L-213, 2005-Ohio-4047, 2005 WL 1861966, at \u00b6 31, this court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cIn civil cases, \u2018judgments supported by some competent, credible evidence going to all the essential elements of the case will not be reversed by a reviewing court as being against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u2019 <em>C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr. Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 279 [8 O.O.3d 261], 376 N.E.2d 578, at the syllabus. In reviewing a manifest weight argument, \u2018the determination of credibility of testimony and evidence must not be encroached <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>upon by a reviewing tribunal.\u2019 <em>Seasons Coal Co., Inc. v. Cleveland </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 77, 81 [10 OBR 408], 461 N.E.2d 1273. Thus, there is a presumption that the findings of fact as determined by the trier of fact are correct. <em>State ex rel. Pizza v. Strope </em>(1990), 54 Ohio St.3d 41, 46, 560 N.E.2d 765.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cIt has long been held that if the parties voluntarily enter into [an agreement], * * * the agreement becomes a valid and binding contract between the parties.\u201d <em>Phillips v. Phillips, </em>5th Dist. Nos. 2004CA00105 and 2004CA00005, 2005-Ohio-231, 2005 WL 121657, at \u00b6 22. It is also well settled that a settlement agreement may be either written or oral and may be entered into prior to a hearing. Id. at \u00b6 26. In effect, a settlement agreement is a contract designed to terminate a claim by preventing or ending litigation, and such agreements are valid and enforceable by either party. <em>Brown v. Dillinger, </em>9th Dist. No. 05CA0040-M, 2006-Ohio-1307, at \u00b6 10, quoting <em>Continental W. Condominium Unit Owners Assn. v. Howard E. Ferguson, Inc. </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 501, 502, 660 N.E.2d 431.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">{\u00b6 23} The necessary elements of a valid contract include \u201c \u2018an offer, acceptance, contractual capacity, consideration (the bargained for legal benefit and/or detriment), a manifestation of mutual assent and legality of object and of consideration.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kostelnik v. Helper, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 1, 2002-Ohio-2985, 770 N.E.2d 58, at \u00b6 16, quoting <em>Perlmuter Printing Co. v. Strome, Inc. </em>(N.D.Ohio 1976), 436 F.Supp. 409, 414. It is imperative that there was a \u201cmeeting of the minds\u201d as to the essential terms of the agreement. <em>Kostelnik, </em>id. Although it is preferable to memorialize a settlement in writing, \u201can oral settlement agreement may be enforceable if there is sufficient particularity to form a binding contract.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 15. This is because \u201c \u2018people must be held to the promises they make.\u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 17, quoting 1 Corbin on Contracts (Perillo Rev.Ed.1993) 530, Section 4.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">{\u00b6 24} Essentially, appellant argues that the testimony establishes that there was never a meeting of the minds between the parties. Appellant contends that \u201c[w]hen cross-examined regarding the exact details about waiving support, * * * appellee could not remember appellant\u2019s words exactly, but \u2018thought that she <em>probably </em>* * * was waiving support if he agreed to sign the consent form.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">{\u00b6 25} However, a review of the record shows that appellee testified on direct examination that appellant told him, two days before he signed the consent to adopt, that if he signed it, \u201cthere would be no back or future child support involved.\u201d On cross-examination, when asked if those were appellant\u2019s exact words, he responded, \u201cProbably \u2014 okay. While we were discussing this, I asked her if I would pay any future or past support and her answer was no.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>{\u00b6 26} Appellant further maintains that appellee could not even remember his own words regarding the support waiver conversation. At the hearing, appellee admitted on cross-examination that he could not remember the exact words that he used.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">{\u00b6 27} Appellant also argues that when appellee signed the consent form, he did not mention support, and he did not ask for support waiver language to be included in the consent form. We note that this contention is without merit, since oral agreements are enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">{\u00b6 28} Additionally, appellant contends that in contrast to appellee\u2019s testimony regarding the alleged agreement between the parties, appellant\u2019s testimony was unequivocal. Appellant testified that she never told appellee that he would not have to pay back support. She said that she told him that he would not have to pay from the date he signed the consent form. Appellant also recalled that she asked appellee after the adoption if he honestly believed that he was not responsible for the back support and that he told her, \u201cNo, he [was] definitely responsible for this money.\u201d Lastly, she indicated that she actually went to LCDJFS to file for back child support while the adoption was pending, not after the adoption had been completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">{\u00b6 29} However, we agree with appellee that the trial court was in the best position to determine each witness\u2019s credibility. Appellant testified that there was no oral agreement to waive back support. Appellee testified that there was. The trial court obviously determined that appellee was more believable than appellant and concluded that there was an oral agreement between the parties. Therefore, appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">{\u00b6 30} In her third assignment, appellant contends that because appellee had not paid support or visited the child in the previous year immediately preceding the filing of the adoption, his consent to the adoption was not necessary, and thus, there was no consideration to establish a valid agreement. Again, we disagree with appellant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">{\u00b6 31} Because it is an issue of contract law, appellate courts \u201c \u2018must determine whether the trial court\u2019s order is based on an erroneous standard or a misconstruction of the law. The standard of review is whether or not the trial court erred.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lepole v. Long John Silver\u2019s, </em>11th Dist. No. 2003-P-0020, 2003-Ohio-7198, 2003 WL 23100327, at \u00b6 14, quoting <em>Continental W., </em>74 Ohio St.3d at 502, 660 N.E.2d 431.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-10\">{\u00b6 32} At the hearing, appellee testified on cross-examination that he paid very little support for the minor child since she was born and none in the year before the adoption was filed in the probate court. He also admitted that he never visited the child within the year before the adoption was filed. Further, appellee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>stated that he had never been served with notice of the adoption, and appellant agreed that she received his notice at her house.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">{\u00b6 33} Whether or not a parent\u2019s consent is required under R.C. 3107.07, the law still requires that he be served with notice of the hearing and the adoption. R.C. 3107.07(A) provides that \u201c[cjonsent to adoption is not required of * * * [a] parent of a minor, when it is alleged in the adoption petition and the court finds <em>after proper service of notice and hearing, </em>that the parent has failed without justifiable cause to communicate with the minor or to provide for the maintenance and support of the minor as required by law or judicial decree for a period of at least one year immediately preceding * * * the filing of the adoption petition * * (Emphasis added.) Thus, if appellant was not properly served with notice of the adoption and hearing, the only way the adoption could have gone forward on the day of the hearing was if appellee consented to the adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">{\u00b6 34} Appellant contends that the trial court \u201cfound that [ajppellee\u2019s signing of the consent for adoption was necessary for the adoption to proceed, and hence, had to be the consideration of the contract.\u201d However, after reviewing the trial court\u2019s order, the trial court did not determine that appellee\u2019s consent was necessary. In fact, the trial court stated that \u201c[l]ittle evidence was offered to the [mjagistrate on this issue and certainly not enough for him to make a final decision.\u201d With respect to this issue, the trial court went on to state that \u201cif service had not been perfected, then certainly father did have sufficient basis to constitute valuable consideration for a contract, for it is without doubt that without service, the [ejourt could not proceed on the date scheduled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">{\u00b6 35} However, the trial then explained that \u201cthere are different issues if one assumes that service upon father had been perfected.\u201d Because even if he had been served, it may be possible that he had \u201cjustifiable cause\u201d pursuant to R.C. 3107.07, either for not paying support or not visiting the child. If so, waiving that defense would have been sufficient consideration to form a legally binding contract. The trial court noted that \u201c[tjhe [mjagistrate was presented with no evidence that father did not have \u2018justifiable cause\u2019 for his failure to pay, and the [ejourt cannot presume that to be the case, and that [djefendant does not have a viable defense. Certainly, if he did have what he believed to be a viable defense or \u2018justifiable cause,\u2019 then his surrender or waiver of such defense would constitute sufficient consideration for the alleged agreement.\u201d The trial court then concluded that appellant\u2019s argument that appellee\u2019s consent was without consideration had no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">{\u00b6 36} We agree with the trial court\u2019s analysis of the law. Whether or not appellant was served, his consent to the adoption was sufficient consideration as a matter of law, since by consenting, he waived his right to raise any \u201cjustifiable causes\u201d as to why he did not pay support or visit the minor child in the year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>preceding the filing of the adoption. Therefore, we cannot say that the trial court erred or misconstrued the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">{\u00b6 37} Therefore, appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is also without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">{\u00b6 38} Accordingly, appellant\u2019s three assignments of error lack merit. The judgment of the Lake County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b766-7\">Grendell and O\u2019Toole, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b760-13\">.
