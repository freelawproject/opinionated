McGinnis, who were sued by a competitor, Message Factors, Inc. (\u201cMFI\u201d), in 2003. Factfinder and McGinnis claimed coverage under the \u201cadvertising injury\u201d liability provision of Factfinder\u2019s insurance policy with Westfield.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-12\">{\u00b6 2} The trial court granted summary judgment for Westfield. In granting Westfield\u2019s motion, the court held that Westfield was not required to defend or indemnify Factfinder or McGinnis in the MFI lawsuit. Because we hold that MFI has pleaded a claim that is arguably within the policy coverage for an \u201cadvertising injury,\u201d we reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Background Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">{\u00b6 3} In February 1989, McGinnis entered into a license agreement with MFI for the exclusive use of MFI\u2019s proprietary methods, trade dress, and trademarks related to market-research services in Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana. McGinnis operated a business called Message Factors/Cincinnati under the licensing agreement. In June 2000, MFI canceled the license agreement. In October of 2003, MFI sued Message Factor/Cincinnati and McGinnis for, among other things, breach of the license agreement and \u201cmisappropriation\u201d of trade dress, trademarks, and proprietary methods.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">{\u00b6 4} In July 2000, McGinnis changed Message Factors/Cincinnatfs name to Factfinder Marketing Research, Inc. After notification of the lawsuit, Factfinder and McGinnis sought representation from Westfield under a business owner\u2019s policy effective during the period from December 19, 1999, to December 20, 2002. They argued that MFI had sought damages for an \u201cadvertising injury.\u201d West-field agreed to defend them pursuant to a reservation of rights, which enabled it to file a declaratory-judgment action asking the trial court to declare that Factfinder and McGinnis were not entitled to coverage under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">{\u00b6 5} Factfinder and McGinnis filed a counterclaim against Westfield seeking a declaration that there was coverage under the policy. Westfield moved for summary judgment, as did Factfinder and McGinnis. The trial court granted Westfield\u2019s motion and declared that there was no coverage under the policy for the claims brought against Factfinder and McGinnis by MFI. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">Review of Insurance Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">{\u00b6 6} The trial court was required to consider the allegations in the MFI complaint in light of the coverage provisions and exclusions in the policy issued by Westfield to Factfinder.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">The Policy</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">{\u00b6 7} The Insurance Services Office (\u201cISO\u201d) is an organization that drafts the standard-form commercial general-liability policy. The ISO first introduced standard-form coverage for \u201cadvertising injury\u201d in 1973.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The ISO amended the policy language for advertising-injury coverage in 1986 and 1998. The Westfield policy at issue in this case contains the 1986 amended policy language.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>{\u00b6 8} The liability portion of the relevant policy requires Westfield to defend Factfinder against any \u201csuit\u201d seeking \u201cdamages because of * * * advertising injury\u201d where that \u201cadvertising injury is caused by an offense committed in the course of advertising [Factfinder\u2019s] goods, products or services[,] but only if the offense was committed in the \u2018coverage territory\u2019 during the policy period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">{\u00b6 9} The policy defines \u201cadvertising injury\u201d as an injury arising out of one or more of the following offenses: \u201ca. Oral or written publication of material that slanders or libels a person or organization or disparages a person\u2019s or organization\u2019s goods, products or services; b. Oral or written publication of material that violates a person\u2019s right of privacy; c. Misappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing business; or d. Infringement of copyright, title or slogan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">{\u00b6 10} MFI filed the lawsuit against McGinnis and Factfinder<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in federal district court. The complaint alleged that MFI and McGinnis, both providers of market research, entered into a written license agreement in 1989. Subject to terms and conditions set out in the agreement, MFI granted McGinnis \u201c[a]n exclusive license to utilize Licensed Marks, proprietary services, the know-how, technology, methods, standards and procedures of MFI for the purposes of promoting, advertising and marketing market research, survey, and evaluation\u201d in Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana. As consideration, McGinnis agreed to pay a licensing fee to MFI and to exclusively use MFI\u2019s licensed technology and marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">{\u00b6 11} The complaint further alleged that on at least nine occasions in 1999 and 2000, McGinnis had violated the license agreement by providing market-research services that used the licensed material without paying a licensing fee. The resulting reports had \u201cthe appearance, feel, content, manner of presentation, manner of analysis and terminology of MFI reports\u201d and incorporated MFI\u2019s \u201ctrade dress.\u201d \u201cIn using MFI\u2019s trademark, service mark, trade dress, and trade name in connection with his own work product and reports made without the permission of MFI and beyond the scope of the License Agreement, McGinnis acted with the purpose of taking the benefit of the favorable reputation and valuable goodwill which MFI has established in its trademark, service mark, trade dress and trade name, and causing his work product and reports to be palmed off as made, authorized, sponsored, or endorsed by, originated with, or otherwise connected with MFI.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">{\u00b6 12} MFI sought several types of damages. First, MFI sought payment of the licensing fees. Second, MFI sought damages for its loss of good will and reputation caused by the palming off. Third, MFI sought to disgorge McGinnis of his \u201cimproperly obtained fees and profits.\u201d MFI also sought an injunction to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>restrain McGinnis from future \u201cmisappropriation]\u201d of MFI\u2019s \u201ctechnologies, know-how, methods, service marks, trademarks, trade dress, trade names or other items protected by the [licensing] Agreement or the law of the United States or of Ohio.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">{\u00b6 13} MFI did not specifically refer to the federal or state intellectual-property laws it was relying upon, but the complaint set out a claim for trade-dress/trademark infringement under the federal trademark statute, the Lanham Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The complaint also set out a claim for the misappropriation of trade secrets and breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Appellate Review of the Trial Court\u2019s Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">{\u00b6 14} Factfinder and McGinnis argue that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to Westfield on Westfield\u2019s duty to defend them in the MFI action. In this case, the parties do not dispute any underlying facts. We are presented only with a question of law concerning the correct construction of the Westfield insurance policy. We review this issue de novo.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">{\u00b6 15} Under Ohio law, an insurer\u2019s duty to defend against an insured claim is broader than the duty to indemnify. In determining the duty to defend, a court reviews the allegations in the complaint and any allegations arising after the filing of the complaint.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Where the allegations state a claim that is potentially or arguably within the policy coverage, the insurer must accept the defense of the claim, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the action or the insurer\u2019s liability to the insured.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The insurer must initially accept the defense of a claim even where there is \u201csome doubt\u201d about whether a theory of recovery within the policy coverage has been pleaded.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> When an insurer must provide a defense on one claim, it must defend the insured on all the other allegations, regardless of whether they are related to the insurance-policy coverage.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Conversely, a duty to defend does not attach when the conduct alleged is indisputably outside the scope of coverage.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>{\u00b6 16} An insurance policy is a contract, and the role of the court when asked to interpret the terms of any contract is to give effect to the intention of the parties.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We examine the contract as a whole, presuming that the parties\u2019 intent is reflected in the policy language.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u201cCommon words in a contract will be given their ordinary meaning unless manifest absurdity results or unless some other meaning is clear from the face or overall contents of the agreement.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> If the language of an insurance contract is ambiguous, courts will interpret the ambiguity against the drafter of the policy, generally the insurer.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">{\u00b6 17} The trial court did not explain the basis for the summary judgment, but Westfield had argued (1) that the MFI complaint did not assert a claim for an \u201cadvertising injury\u201d under the insurance policy, (2) that even if it did assert a claim for an \u201cadvertising injury,\u201d MFI did not allege that the injury was \u201ccommitted in the course of and was causally connected to\u201d the advertising of Factfinder\u2019s goods, products, or services, and (3) that, in any event, two exclusions prohibited coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">{\u00b6 18} To resolve this controversy, we must review the MFI complaint and determine only whether the complaint (1) stated a claim for an offense covered under the advertising-injury provisions of the insurance policy and (2) alleged that the advertising injury was caused by Factfinder in the course of advertising. If these two conditions were met, then we must determine whether any exclusion applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">{\u00b6 19} MFI alleged claims for trade-dress infringement, trademark infringement, and misappropriation of trade secrets. \u201cTrade dress\u201d refers to \u201c \u2018the total image or overall appearance of a product,\u2019 including size, shape, color, texture and graphics.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \u201cTrademark\u201d is defined as \u201cany word, name, symbol, or device or any combination thereof\u2019 used by a person \u201cto identify and distinguish his or her own goods, including a unique product, from those manufactured or sold by others and to indicate the source of the goods, even if that source is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>unknown.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The protection of trade dress and trademarks serves to \u201csecure to the owner of the mark the goodwill of his business and to protect the ability of consumers to distinguish among competing producers.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">{\u00b6 20} A trade secret is secret information that is the subject of efforts to keep it from being generally known and that \u201cderives independent economic value\u201d from not being generally known.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">{\u00b6 21} Factfinder and McGinnis argued that MFI\u2019s allegations of trade-dress and trademark infringement and misappropriation of trade secrets triggered coverage under the advertising-injury provision for the \u201cmisappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing business.\u201d \u201cMisappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing business\u201d is not defined in the policy or under Ohio law. Because the terms are found in the advertising-injury liability portion of the policy, the terms must be interpreted as having a connection to advertising.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">{\u00b6 22} The \u201cmisappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing business\u201d provision, as part of the 1986 standard policy language, has been interpreted by courts in other jurisdictions. These courts have generally found that trade-dress and trademark infringement can be covered under the policy as an advertising injury caused by the \u201cmisappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing business,\u201d where the misappropriated intellectual property draws the public\u2019s attention to the product and makes the source of the product readily identifiable.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">{\u00b6 23} Some courts have defined \u201cadvertising idea\u201d to mean \u201cany idea or concept related to the promotion of a product to the public.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The provision has been held to trigger coverage where the insured was sued for trademark or trade-dress infringement.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">{\u00b6 24} Some courts have interpreted \u201cstyle of doing business\u201d as including \u201cthe manner in which a company promotes, presents, and markets its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>products to the public.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> \u201cStyle of doing business\u201d encompasses \u201cthe physical appearance of a product \u2014 the ornamental features that distinguish it from similar products and identify its source.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The provision has been held to trigger coverage where the insured was sued for trade-dress or trademark infringement.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">{\u00b6 25} The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>Advance Watch Co. v. Kemper Natl. Ins. </em>Co.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> held that trade-dress and trademark infringement were not covered as a \u201cmisappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing business.\u201d The court was interpreting the scope of \u201cadvertising injury\u201d coverage under Michigan insurance law.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The <em>Advance Watch </em>court relied in part on the fact that trade-dress and trademark infringement are specific, statutory torts, separate from the common law tort of misappropriation. But this restrictive holding has been criticized as ignoring the ordinary meaning of the term \u201cmisappropriation.\u201d <footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The word \u201cmisappropriate\u201d commonly means \u201cto appropriate wrongly.\u201d <footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">{\u00b6 26} In this case, we resolve this ambiguity in the provision in favor of insurance coverage, as required under Ohio law. Thus, we decline to follow the holding of <em>Advance Watch </em>because the common meaning of \u201cmisappropriation\u201d incorporates the idea of trade-dress and trademark infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">{\u00b6 27} MFI expressly alleged that McGinnis had wrongly used its trade dress and trademarks in materials presented to clients and had misled the clients as to the origin of the products and services. We conclude that these allegations arguably fall under the misappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing business, as it has come to be defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">{\u00b6 28} Conversely, MFI\u2019s allegation of trade-secret misappropriation does not trigger coverage under the \u201cmisappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing business\u201d provision. MFI alleged that the trade secrets involved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>proprietary methods of analyzing market research and not secret ideas for advertising the products and services.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">{\u00b6 29} But Westfield\u2019s duty to defend arises even if only some of the claims fall within the coverage terms. Because the trade-dress- and trademark-infringement claims fall under the coverage provided for an advertising injury, we hold that Factfinder and McGinnis have satisfied the first prong of our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Advertising Nexus</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">{\u00b6 30} The harder question is whether MFI alleged that McGinnis caused the advertising injury by misappropriation committed in the course of advertising Factfinder\u2019s services or products. Under the policy, the advertising injury must have a causal connection with advertising activities. \u201cAdvertising\u201d is not defined in the policy but is defined in Webster\u2019s Dictionary as \u201cthe action of calling something (as a commodity for sale, a service offered or desired) to the attention of the public especially] by means of printed or broadcast paid announcements.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">{\u00b6 31} MFI\u2019s complaint does not use the words \u201cadvertising\u201d or \u201cmarketing.\u201d But Factfinder and McGinnis argue that trade-dress and trademark infringement inherently involve advertising because there can be no trade-dress or trademark infringement without the occurrence of advertising. The court in <em>Poof Toy Prod. v. United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co.</em><footnotemark><em>30</em></footnotemark><em> </em>came to the same conclusion, explaining that this \u201cresults from a required element in every trademark/trade dress case, that the mark or dress is likely to cause confusion to the consumer or deceive the consumer as to the origin or manufacturer of the goods. To have (or potentially cause) this effect, one must clearly advertise (announce to the intended customers) the mark or dress.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">{\u00b6 32} In <em>Westfield Cos. v. OKL Can Line,</em><footnotemark><em>32</em></footnotemark><em> </em>this court addressed the same issue in dicta, stating that we agreed in principle with this \u201cabstract concept\u201d of intellectual property law. We were not required to adopt this concept, because the insurance contract in that case specifically defined \u201cadvertisement\u201d as \u201ca notice\u201d that was intended to attract customers.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The marketing of the allegedly infringing products on a website satisfied this definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>{\u00b6 33} In this case, we adopt the <em>Poof Toy\u2019s </em>conclusion that trade-dress/trademark infringement necessarily involves advertising. But that is not the end of our analysis. There must be a limit to the \u201cinherently advertising rule\u201d to avoid coverage in circumstances clearly not anticipated by the parties. The insurance policy expressly requires a nexus between the advertising activity and the advertising injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">{\u00b6 34} We hold that the nexus exists in this case. MFI alleged that McGinnis\u2019s use of its trade dress and trademarks in reports and services provided to clients caused a \u201cpalming off\u2019 injury at least nine times, and MFI further alleged that the palming off was ongoing and would \u201cirreparably damage MFI\u2019s business reputation and goodwill.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">{\u00b6 35} Thus, McGinnis, through Factfinder, presented the infringing trade dress and trademarks to a segment of the purchasing public, and it was this \u201cadvertising\u201d that is allegedly causing MFI\u2019s damages, at least in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Exclusions</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">{\u00b6 36} Having determined that the alleged Lanham Act violations arguably fall within the policy\u2019s \u201cadvertising injury\u201d coverage, we must now decide whether any exclusions in the policy preclude coverage. Westfield relied on two exclusions in its motion for summary judgment, the \u201cknowledge of falsity\u201d and \u201cbreach of contract\u201d exclusions. We address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">{\u00b6 37} The knowledge-of-falsity exclusion bars coverage for advertising injury \u201carising out of oral or written publication of material by or at the direction of the insured with knowledge of its falsity.\u201d Westfield claims that McGinnis had to know that he had no right to represent to others that Factfinder was using or continuing to use MFI\u2019s services after MFI terminated the licensing agreement in 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">{\u00b6 38} We hold that the exclusion does not apply for two reasons. First, under Ohio law, \u201can exclusion in an insurance policy will be interpreted as applying only to that which is <em>dearly </em>intended to be excluded.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The \u201coral or written publication of material\u201d language of this exclusion mimics the language in the first two definitions of an advertising injury. This same language is absent from the second two definitions of an advertising injury, including an advertising injury arising from the \u201cmisappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing business.\u201d We decline to hold that this exclusion clearly applies to the \u201cmisap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>propriation of advertising ideas or style of doing business\u201d liability provision in the absence of the duplicate language.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">{\u00b6 39} Second, MFI alleged that McGinnis acted intentionally or <em>negligently </em>in infringing its trade dress and trademark. MFI could prevail on these Lanham Act claims without proving knowledge of the infringement.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Thus, Westfield would have to defend and potentially indemnify Factfinder and McGinnis for nonintentional infringement that fell outside of the exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">{\u00b6 40} Next, we address whether the Lanham Act claims, which are based upon tort principles, are excluded under the breach-of-contract exclusion. The breach-of-contract exclusion bars coverage for advertising injury \u201carising out of breach of contract, other than the misappropriation of advertising ideas under an implied contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">{\u00b6 41} The term \u201carising out of\u2019 has been interpreted broadly under Ohio law to mean \u201cflowing from,\u201d \u201chaving its origin in,\u201d or \u201cgrowing out of.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> \u201cThe phrase indicates a requirement of a causal relationship but not one of proximate cause.\u201d <footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">{\u00b6 42} Applying this broad definition of \u201carising out of,\u201d we hold that the parties clearly intended to exclude coverage when the infringement causing the advertising injury also violated a written licensing agreement governing the same trade dress and trademarks. If the jury finds that Factfinder and McGinnis breached the licensing agreement and at the same time infringed, then the claim would not be covered for indemnification purposes. This exclusion would not apply to MFI\u2019s infringement allegations arising after the termination of the licensing agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">{\u00b6 43} But at this point in the litigation, we do not know what the jury will find. We do know that MFI has alleged an advertising injury that is potentially within the policy coverage. Therefore, Westfield must continue to defend Factfinder and McGinnis.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">{\u00b6 44} The trial court erroneously granted summary judgment for Westfield and denied summary judgment to Factfinder and McGinnis on the duty to defend. Thus, we sustain Factfinder and McGinnis\u2019s assignment of error and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>reverse the judgment of the trial court. We also enter judgment in favor of Factfinder and McGinnis on the duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b435-6\">Gorman, P.J., and Painter, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b426-11\">.
