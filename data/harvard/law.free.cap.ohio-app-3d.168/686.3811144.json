Plaintiff-appellee is the state of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-13\">STATEMENT OF THE FACTS AND CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b717-14\">{\u00b6 2} On April 8, 2005, the Ashland County Grand Jury indicted appellant on two counts of burglary in violation of R.C. 2911.12(A)(3), felonies of the third degree, one count of safecracking in violation of R.C. 2911.31(A), a felony of the fourth degree, one count of attempted burglary in violation of R.C. 2923.02(A) and 2911.12(A)(1), a felony of the third degree, and one count of possession of cocaine in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A), a felony of the fifth degree. Appellant also was indicted on one count of theft of drugs in violation of R.C. 2913.02(A)(1), a felony of the fourth degree, one count of petty theft in violation of R.C. 2923.02(A)(1), a misdemeanor of the first degree, and one count of possession of criminal tools in violation of R.C. 2923.24(A), a felony of the fifth degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>{\u00b6 3} At his arraignment on April 11, 2005, appellant entered a plea of not guilty to the charges contained in the indictment. An amended indictment was filed on April 22, 2005, containing the same charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">{\u00b6 4} Subsequently, on April 27, 2005, appellant withdrew his former not-guilty plea and pleaded guilty to one count each of safecracking, attempted burglary, possession of cocaine, and petty theft. Appellant also pleaded guilty to one count of burglary in violation of R.C. 2911.12(A)(4), a felony of the fourth degree.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The remaining charges were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">{\u00b6 5} As memorialized in a judgment entry filed on June 16, 2005, appellant was sentenced to an aggregate prison sentence of three years and three months. In addition, appellant was ordered to pay fines totaling $2,000 and to pay restitution as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">{\u00b6 6} \u201ca. The sum of Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($250.00) to Margaret Negrete, 1236 Myers Avenue, Ashland, Oh 44805, to be collected and distributed by the Clerk of Courts;</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cb. The Sum of Three Hundred Fifty Dollars ($350.00) to Mr. and Mrs. Alan Lease, 707 West 10th Street, Ashland, Oh 44805, to [be] collected and distributed by the Clerk of Courts; and</p>\n<p id=\"b718-9\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cc. The sum of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) to Mr. and Mrs. Charles Griffith, 1213 Center Street, Ashland, Oh 44805, for damages to the door. Said amount is subject to verification and shall be collected and distributed by the Clerk of Courts pursuant to a future order of the Court. The Court is specifically reserving jurisdiction to conduct a future hearing with regard to this award in light of the fact that the damages at the Griffith residence have not actually been corrected at this point in time and that there may a dispute regarding this restitution figure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b718-10\">{\u00b6 9} Appellant\u2019s driver\u2019s license also was suspended for a period of five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-11\">{\u00b6 10} Appellant now raises the following assignments of error on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b718-12\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cThe trial court erred by imposing a $5,000 restitution [order] without any evidence to support it. R.C. 2929.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-13\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cThe trial court erred by imposing non-minimum, consecutive prison terms in the absence of jury findings of the factors set forth in R.C. 2929.14(C) and (E)(2).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b719-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>{\u00b6 13} This court, on May 9, 2006, granted appellant\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw his second assignment of error. Thus, only appellant\u2019s first assignment of error remains for determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">{\u00b6 14} Appellant, in his first assignment of error, argues that the trial court erred in ordering appellant to pay $5,000 in restitution to the Griffiths for damage to a door. Appellant specifically argues that the award is speculative and not limited by the victim\u2019s economic loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">{\u00b6 15} R.C. 2929.18(A) states:</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cFinancial sanctions that may be imposed pursuant to this section include * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cRestitution by the offender to the victim of the offender\u2019s crime * * * <em>in an amount based on the victim\u2019s economic loss. </em>If the court imposes restitution, the court shall order that the restitution be made to the victim in open court, to the adult probation department that serves the county on behalf of the victim, to the clerk of courts * * *. If the court imposes restitution, at sentencing, the court shall determine the amount of restitution to be made by the offender. * * * If the court decides to impose restitution, the court shall hold a hearing on restitution if the offender * * * disputes the amount.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cThe amount of the restitution must be supported by competent, credible evidence from which the court can discern the amount of the restitution to a reasonable degree of certainty.\u201d <em>State v. Gears </em>(1999), 135 Ohio App.3d 297, 300, 733 N.E.2d 683. A trial court abuses its discretion in ordering restitution in an amount that was not determined to bear a reasonable relationship to the actual loss suffered. <em>State v. Williams </em>(1986), 34 Ohio App.3d 33, 516 N.E.2d 1270. The amount of restitution in a trial court\u2019s restitution order must be specified. <em>State v. Church, </em>161 Ohio App.3d 589, 2005-Ohio-2984, 831 N.E.2d 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-10\">{\u00b6 19} At the sentencing hearing in this matter, Mr. Griffith testified that he had paid $3,500 for a mahogany door that was damaged by appellant. Mr. Griffith further testified that even though he had insurance, he had a $500 deductible to pay. The following testimony was adduced when Mr. Griffith was asked by the trial court whether his insurance company had paid all but $500 of the damage:</p>\n<p id=\"b719-11\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cMR GRIFFITH: We have not even submitted a claim. Our insurance agent said wait until the springtime, send her the estimate, and then we will have to pay the deductible. The door is only a couple years old. It\u2019s a mahogany door with the leaded glass. You know, I work hard, Judge, for that money to do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>things to my home to keep it nice so our family has a nice place to stay, and then to let somebody like him come in and destroy it \u2014 not only destroyed the material things \u2014 I\u2019m going to say this again. It\u2019s not all the monetary things, but I think not only prison, but he needs to be judged on the money part he damaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">{\u00b621} \u201cTHE COURT: So to clarify at this point, the door has not been replaced?</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cMR GRIFFITH: No, I was waiting to see, you know, if you \u2014 have the right to make restitution to me and my wife.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">{\u00b6 23} At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court ordered appellant to pay $5,000 in restitution to the Griffiths for damage to the door, but stated that it was reserving jurisdiction with respect to that award \u201cin light of the fact that the damages have not actually been corrected at this point in time at the Griffith residence.\u201d Appellant objected on the record to the retention of jurisdiction and requested an evidentiary hearing on the amount of restitution. The trial court, however, declined to hold such a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">{\u00b6 24} We find that there is nothing in the record supporting the trial court\u2019s tentative award of $5,000 in restitution to the Griffiths. There is no evidence that the damaged door was fixed or replaced at that cost. Moreover, the trial court, both on the record and in its judgment entry, failed to specify the exact amount of restitution ordered. Rather, the trial court, in its June 16, 2005 judgment entry, stated that the $5,000 amount was \u201csubject to verification\u201d and that it was \u201cspecifically reserving jurisdiction to conduct a future hearing with regard to this award in light of the fact that the damages at the Griffith residence have not actually been corrected at this point in time and that there may be a dispute regarding this restitution amount.\u201d Such a reservation of jurisdiction was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">{\u00b6 25} For the foregoing reasons, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained. We hereby reverse the trial court\u2019s restitution order and remand the matter to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing to determine a fixed amount of restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-10\">{\u00b6 26} In remanding this matter, we note that in <em>State v. Martin </em>(2000), 140 Ohio App.3d 326, 747 N.E.2d 318, the trial court ordered the defendant to pay restitution in the amount of $9,800 to cover the victims \u201ceconomic loss.\u201d The victim was later compensated for his loss when his own insurance provider settled his claim for $9,800. The Fourth District Court of Appeals, in <em>Martin, </em>held that because the victim had been fairly compensated by his insurance carrier, he did not suffer any \u201ceconomic detriment,\u201d and, therefore, the defendant could not \u201cproperly be ordered to pay restitution to the victim, since it would result in an economic windfall.\u201d <em>Martin, </em>supra, at 327, 747 N.E.2d 318. See, also, <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number><em>Johnson, </em>Washington App. No. 03CA11, 2004-Ohio-2236, 2004 WL 944384. In <em>Johnson, </em>the court held that the trial court erred in ordering the appellant to pay $5,305 in restitution to a bank when the bank had received $305 from its insurance company after its $5,000 deductible. The court noted that the bank, therefore, had suffered only $5,000 in economic harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">{\u00b627} Thus, on remand, we note that the Griffiths are not entitled to reimbursement from appellant for any damage to their door that was paid for by their insurance carrier.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">{\u00b6 28} The judgment of the Ashland County Court of Common Pleas is hereby reversed and this matter is remanded for a hearing on the amount of restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b721-7\">Wise, P.J., and Gwin, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b718-14\">. The count of burglary was a lesser included charge of the charge of burglary, a felony of the third degree, contained in the indictment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b721-18\">. However, we note that in <em>State v. Kreischer, </em>Perry App. No. 03 CA 20, 2004-Ohio-6854, 2004 WL 2958339, this court held that a trial court was authorized under R.C. 2929.18(A)(1) to order the defendant, who was convicted of assault, to pay money in restitution to the victim\u2019s <em>insurance carrier </em>for money paid for the victim's losses. See <em>State v. Kreischer, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 391, 2006-Ohio-2706, 848 N.E.2d 496, affirming this court\u2019s judgment. However, the Ohio Supreme Court, in <em>Kreischer, </em>noted that R.C. 2929.18 was amended effective June 1, 2004, to delete all references to third parties and that its decision was limited in scope due to the amendment. This court, in its <em>Kreischer </em>decision, considered former R.C. 2929.18(A)(1), not the amended version.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
