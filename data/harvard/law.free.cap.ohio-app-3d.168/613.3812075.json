FCCS\u2019s claims stemmed from appellant\u2019s alleged failure to properly attend to L.W.\u2019s extensive medical needs.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The public defender\u2019s office was appointed as L.W.\u2019s guardian ad litem. Separate counsel was appointed to represent appellant. Shortly after being appointed, appellant\u2019s counsel withdrew from the case at appellant\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">{\u00b6 2} Over several days, the trial court, through a magistrate, conducted a hearing to consider the neglect and dependency allegations, at which appellant appeared pro se. On June 17, 2004, the magistrate filed a decision finding by clear and convincing evidence that L.W. was a neglected and dependent child. The magistrate made L.W. a ward of the court and committed her to the temporary custody of FCCS. That same day, the trial court approved and adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision as its own.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">{\u00b6 3} On June 25, 2004, appellant, pro se, filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision. On July 30, 2004, the magistrate supplemented the June 17, 2004 decision with findings of fact and conclusions of law. The trial court immediately approved and adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision as its own, including the findings of fact and conclusions of law contained therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">{\u00b6 4} On August 4, 2004, the trial court appointed new counsel to represent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>appellant. Sometime in August 2004, L.W. passed away.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On September 7, 2004, the magistrate held a hearing on various outstanding motions. By decision filed September 23, 2004, the magistrate terminated L.W.\u2019s wardship, terminated FCCS\u2019s temporary custody, and closed the matter. The trial court, that same day, approved and adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision as its own.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">{\u00b6 5} Subsequently, the trial court, on October 15, 2004, held a brief hearing on appellant\u2019s motion for a continuance of the objections hearing. Both the guardian ad litem and appellee state of Ohio opposed the continuance. Noting L.W.\u2019s death and the recent appointment of counsel, the court granted the continuance to allow appellant\u2019s counsel time to prepare amended objections to the magistrate\u2019s July 30, 2004 decision. The court granted the state\u2019s oral motion to set a date certain of November 26, 2004 for the filing of amended objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">{\u00b6 6} On November 26, 2004, appellant, through counsel, filed amended objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> alleging that the magistrate had erred in denying appellant\u2019s request for court-appointed counsel at the adjudicatory hearing; failing to afford appellant latitude for appearing pro se at the adjudicatory hearing; denying appellant opportunities to secure testimony and request discovery; refusing consideration of appellant\u2019s various dispositional motions; quashing certain subpoenas issued by appellant; prohibiting appellant from cross-examining his own witness; and finding L.W. to be a neglected and dependent child. Appellant alleged that proper legal representation and discovery rulings would have enabled him to refute or mitigate many of the unfavorable factual findings made by the magistrate. Appellant also asserted that the case had been tainted by ongoing \u201cunlawful prejudicial behavior out of court,\u201d including the court\u2019s acceptance of \u201cfalse information\u201d regarding L.W.\u2019s medical condition and the breach of healthcare confidentiality laws by L.W.\u2019s healthcare providers.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">{\u00b6 7} On December 13, 2004, the trial court held a nonevidentiary hearing on the amended objections. The guardian ad litem contended that appellant\u2019s objections were rendered moot by L.W.\u2019s death. In response, appellant argued that by operation of Juv.R. 40(E)(4)(c) (which permitted the trial court to adopt the magistrate\u2019s decision and enter judgment without waiting for timely objections), a finding of mootness would deprive him of his due process right to have his objections heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>{\u00b6 8} By decision and entry filed March 2, 2005, the trial court denied as moot appellant\u2019s amended objections in light of L.W.\u2019s death. More particularly, the court found that even if it were to rule in appellant\u2019s favor, the court could not provide appellant any relief with respect to L.W.\u2019s custody. In addition, the court also determined that appellant\u2019s amended objections were untimely, having been filed outside the 14-day period for filing objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">{\u00b6 9} Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal from the trial court\u2019s March 2, 2005 judgment. Prior to the filing of appellant\u2019s brief, appellee guardian ad litem filed a motion to dismiss on grounds that L.W.\u2019s death rendered the appeal moot. Appellant\u2019s memorandum contra argued that the motion to dismiss was premature, as he had yet to file his brief. Thereafter, appellant filed his merit brief, setting forth the following four assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-6\">I. The court erred in finding the objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision moot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-7\">II. The court erred in entering a conditional entry of neglect and dependency while objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision were pending.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-9\">III. The court erred in ruling that the amended objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision were not timely filed, as the court itself set the deadline for that filing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-11\">IV. The court erred in accepting jurisdiction over a matter which had previously been dismissed and refiled four times.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-13\">{\u00b6 10} Both the state and guardian ad litem have opposed appellant\u2019s assignments of error. By journal entry filed August 16, 2005, this court resolved to consider the motion to dismiss along with the merits of the appeal. For the reasons that follow, we dismiss the appeal as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-14\">{\u00b6 11} As a general matter, courts will not resolve issues that are moot. <em>In re Brown, </em>Franklin App. No. 03AP-1205, 2005-Ohio-2425, 2005 WL 1177943, at \u00b6 15. Actions are moot \u201cwhen they are or have become fictitious, colorable, hypothetical, academic or dead. The distinguishing characteristic of such issues is that they involve no actual genuine, live controversy, the decision of which can definitely affect existing legal relations. * * * \u2018A moot case is one which seeks to get a judgment on a pretended controversy, when in reality there is none, or a decision in advance about a right before it has been actually asserted and contested, or a judgment upon some matter which, when rendered, for any reason cannot have any practical legal effect upon a then-existing controversy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Grove City v. Clark, </em>Franklin App. No. 01AP-1369, 2002-Ohio-4549, 2002 WL 2025334, at \u00b6 11, quoting <em>Culver v. Warren </em>(1948), 84 Ohio App. 373, 393, 39 O.O. 506, 83 N.E.2d 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-15\">{\u00b6 12} There are exceptions to the mootness doctrine that permit a trial court to hear an otherwise moot case. <em>Robinson v. Indus. Comm., </em>Franklin App. No. 04AP-1010, 2005-Ohio-2290, 2005 WL 1109747, at \u00b6 7, citing <em>Nextel West </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number><em>Corp. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Zoning Appeals, </em>Franklin App. No. 03AP-625, 2004-Ohio-2943, 2004 WL 1244339, at \u00b6 14. A court may hear an otherwise moot case when the issues are capable of repetition, yet evade review, when a debatable constitutional question remains to be resolved, or when the issues involved concern a matter of great public or general interest. <em>Grove City, </em>2002-Ohio-4549, at \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">{\u00b6 13} However, there are limitations to the exceptions. The exception for a case that is capable of repetition yet evades review applies only in exceptional circumstances, when both (1) the challenged action is too short in duration to be fully litigated before its cessation or expiration and (2) there is a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party will be subject to the same action again. <em>Robinson, </em>2005-Ohio-2290, at \u00b6 8, citing <em>State ex rel. Calvary v. Upper Arlington </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 229, 231, 729 N.E.2d 1182. \u201c \u2018[T]here must be more than a theoretical possibility that the action will arise again.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>James A. Keller, Inc. v. Flaherty </em>(1991), 74 Ohio App.3d 788, 792, 600 N.E.2d 736. Similarly, the exception for a case that concerns a debatable constitutional question or a matter of great public or general interest should be used with caution and only on rare occasions. Id. at \u00b6 10. \u201cOrdinarily, however, such an action should be taken only by the highest court in the state, rather than an intermediate appellate court.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>2005-Ohio-2425, at \u00b6 18; <em>Robinson, </em>2005-Ohio-2290.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">{\u00b6 14} Appellant first contends, relying on R.C. 2311.21, that L.W.\u2019s death did not render the matter moot. Appellant suggests that R.C. 2311.21 operates to except this matter from the doctrine of mootness. The guardian ad litem argues that, rather than excepting the matter from the mootness doctrine, R.C. 2311.21 operates to extinguish it as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">{\u00b6 15} R.C. 2311.21 provides that \u201c[u]nless otherwise provided, no action or proceeding pending in any court shall abate by the death of either or both of the parties thereto, except actions for libel, slander, malicious prosecution, for a nuisance, or against a judge of a county court for misconduct in office, which shall abate by the death of either party.\u201d \u201cIn the realm of litigation, the term \u2018abatement\u2019 denotes the \u2018destruction of a cause of action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Taylor v. Taylor </em>(July 15, 1992), Hamilton App. No. C-910126, 1992 WL 166076, quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (4th Ed.Rev.1968) 16. The guardian ad litem analogizes the instant case to a divorce action in which one of the parties dies before the court has decided any of the issues. In such a case, abatement results as a matter of law from the death of a party to the action, even though R.C. 2311.21 does not explicitly so provide. <em>Gregg v. Gregg </em>(2001), 145 Ohio App.3d 218, 221, 762 N.E.2d 434. \u201cThe justification for this appears to be uniformly accepted, at least <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>by Ohio courts, as a matter of reason and common sense: the action abates because, with the death of one of the parties, circumstance has effectively accomplished the primary object of the lawsuit, i.e., the dissolution of the marital relationship.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>Hamilton App. No. C-910126, citing <em>Caprita v. Caprita </em>(1945), 145 Ohio St. 5, 9, 30 O.O. 238, 60 N.E.2d 483. Similarly, argues the guardian ad litem, L.W.\u2019s death accomplished the primary objective of the instant lawsuit \u2014 -the determination of her custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">{\u00b6 16} Pursuant to R.C. 2311.21, at the death of either party, an action is merely suspended, assuming both that the cause of action survives and that the action is not one of those enumerated in the statute. If the cause of action survives and is not extinguished by the death of a party to the action, a proper party may be substituted in the place of the deceased party, and the action may then proceed. Assuming, without deciding, that L.W. was a \u201cparty\u201d to the instant action for purposes of R.C. 2311.21, L.W.\u2019s death clearly extinguished the instant action. The state\u2019s primary focus in a dependency action is on the child\u2019s condition and environment. <em>In re Darst </em>(1963), 117 Ohio App. 374, 24 O.O.2d 144, 192 N.E.2d 287. In a neglect action, the state\u2019s primary objective is to determine whether a child is receiving proper parental care. <em>In re Reese </em>(1982), 4 Ohio App.3d 59, 62, 4 OBR 109, 446 N.E.2d 482. Here, \u201cas a matter of reason and common sense,\u201d the action abated with L.W.\u2019s death, as circumstance has effectively accomplished the primary objectives of the lawsuit. Further, even if the cause of action survived, this is not a case in which the action could proceed with a substituted \u201cparty.\u201d The subject of the action was L.W.; sadly, that subject no longer exists. Accordingly, we cannot find that R.C. 2311.21 operates to except this matter from the doctrine of mootness.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">{\u00b6 17} Appellant also argues that the dispute at issue may be heard because the issues are capable of repetition, yet evade review. Appellant concedes that the issue of physical custody is moot; however, he asserts that a finding of mootness without consideration of his objections leaves him without remedy to correct the record. Appellant posits two potential adverse consequences arising from these circumstances: (1) if his surviving child becomes the subject of juvenile court proceedings in the future, L.W.\u2019s adjudication could be used as evidence against him, and (2) potential remedies to which he may be entitled in civil actions against entities and persons involved with L.W.\u2019s medical care could be impaired by L.W.\u2019s adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">{\u00b6 18} Appellant\u2019s concerns are insufficient to fall within the \u201ccapable of repetition yet evading review\u201d exception to the mootness doctrine. Both of the scenarios appellant describes are entirely speculative. There is no indication that appellant will ever be subject to a neglect or dependency action with regard to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>surviving child or that any civil remedies to which he may be entitled will be impaired by the adjudication in the instant action.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">{\u00b6 19} Appellant also claims that his case may be heard because debatable constitutional questions raised in his objections remain unresolved. Appellant does not specify which of his objections raise constitutional questions. Our review reveals only one potential constitutional issue \u2014 that appellant was denied the right to appointed counsel at the adjudicatory hearing. As noted previously, action on an unresolved constitutional question is ordinarily taken only by the highest court of the state rather than an intermediate appellate court, whose decision does not have binding effect over the entire state. <em>Brown, </em>2005-Ohio-2425. Further, the issue of the magistrate\u2019s alleged denial of appointed counsel was thoroughly addressed, and, for all intents and purposes, resolved by the trial court at the December 13, 2004 hearing on the objections. The court noted that either prior to or just after commencement of the adjudicatory hearing, it had informed appellant, in open court, that he had a right to appointed counsel at the adjudicatory hearing and that the court would appoint counsel to represent him despite any contrary advisement by the magistrate. The court further noted that appellant had declined the offer of appointed counsel, indicating instead that he wished to proceed pro se. Thus, there being no unresolved constitutional question, we decline to except this case from the doctrine of mootness.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">{\u00b6 20} Our determination that the appeal is moot is bolstered by the decisions of other Ohio appellate courts. In <em>In re Maria M., </em>Wood App. No. WD-03-092, 2004-Ohio-3798, 2004 WL 1595006, a juvenile who was adjudicated as dependent appealed a trial court judgment that continued her temporary custody with a foster family. The juvenile reached the age of 18 during the pendency of the appeal. The court dismissed the appeal as moot upon determining that the juvenile court had lost jurisdiction over the case when the juvenile reached the age of majority and that none of the limited exceptions to the mootness doctrine applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">{\u00b6 21} In <em>In re Gerken </em>(Nov. 9, 1990), Wood App. No. WD-90-9, 1990 WL 174324, temporary custody of a child was awarded to a children services agency following an emergency-shelter hearing on an abuse complaint. Following an adjudicatory hearing, a trial court entered judgment finding that the child was an abused child and had been sexually abused by her stepfather. At the subsequent dispositional hearing, the trial court ordered that temporary custody remain with the children services agency. Following the stepfather\u2019s appeal, the child turned 18. The court determined that the juvenile court no longer had jurisdiction over the child, as she had reached the age of 18. Accordingly, the court found any issues regarding the juvenile court\u2019s alleged errors in the dispositional phase of the proceedings to be moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>{\u00b6 22} Finally, in <em>In re Miller </em>(July 9, 1998), Ashland App. No. 97-COA-01223, 1998 WL 429830, a 16-year-old boy was adjudicated as a dependent child. The boy was placed in the temporary custody of a children services agency, which later placed him with his father. When the boy reached the age of 18, temporary custody was terminated. Sometime after his 18th birthday, the boy died. The boy\u2019s mother filed an appeal challenging the trial court\u2019s rulings on temporary custody, emergency protective orders, and the placing of the boy with his father. The court held that the issues were moot in light of the boy\u2019s emancipation and subsequent death.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">{\u00b6 23} As in the foregoing cases, L.W.\u2019s death rendered the issues raised in appellant\u2019s objections moot. Accordingly, appellee guardian ad litem\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal is hereby granted. The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b652-7\">Klatt, P.J., and French, J., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b652-8\">Deshler, J., retired, of the Tenth Appellate District, sitting by assignment.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b646-9\">.
