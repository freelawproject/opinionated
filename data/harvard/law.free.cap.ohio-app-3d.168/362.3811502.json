Abrams, appeals the summary judgment entered by the trial court in favor of his former employers on his claims for wrongful termination. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-16\">\n<em>Abrams\u2019 Employment with ACT and CCI</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b394-17\">{\u00b6 2} In 1995, Abrams was hired as a sales manager for American Computer Technology (\u201cACT\u201d). ACT sold computer hardware and software, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>SHOP-TRAC, its own software program. Jerry McMahon was the majority owner and chairman of the board of ACT.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">{\u00b6 3} By the following year, Abrams was hired for a similar position at Computer Creations, Inc. (\u201cCCI\u201d), a computer-networking company also owned by McMahon. Abrams was named vice president of marketing for both ACT and CCI. Robert Kennedy, the former owner of CCI, became president of ACT in April 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">{\u00b6 4} In early 1997, ACT halted development of its SHOP-TRAC software. McMahon instructed Abrams to send letters to each of ACT\u2019s customers to notify them of the change and of the company\u2019s commitment to continued support for the software\u2019s existing users. Despite McMahon\u2019s instructions, Abrams failed to notify a majority of ACT\u2019s customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">{\u00b6 5} McMahon learned that Abrams\u2019 failure to contact customers about the software had caused some of them to panic. Customers had begun to call the company to ask whether it was going out of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">{\u00b6 6} As McMahon attempted to reassure customers of ACT\u2019s viability and continuation of support for its product, he discovered widespread customer dissatisfaction with Abrams. Customers reported that they did not trust Abrams and had no confidence in him. According to McMahon, \u201c[s]ome customers felt [that Abrams had] misled them and deliberately lied to them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">{\u00b6 7} In early April 1997, Kennedy told McMahon that some employees in ACT\u2019s Cincinnati office had discovered potentially \u201cpirated\u201d software, that is, software that may have been copied or used without authorization. Kennedy asked McMahon if he knew whether employees had sold the same software to different customers. McMahon said that he knew nothing about it and instructed Kennedy to further investigate the matter. Kennedy also told Abrams about the pirating issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">{\u00b6 8} On May 9, 1997, Abrams and Kennedy met with an attorney, Thomas Jennings, to discuss the possibility of merging ACT with CCI. During the meeting about the merger, the men briefly discussed the pirated software issue and certain company financial statements. Jennings billed CCI for his services.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">{\u00b6 9} In June 1997, McMahon told Abrams that he needed to improve his overall performance. Specifically, McMahon wanted Abrams to enhance his relationships with current customers, to obtain new customers, and to provide training for the company\u2019s newer employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-12\">{\u00b6 10} McMahon soon learned that Abrams\u2019 deficiencies went beyond customer dissatisfaction. Abrams had not been forthright about his expense reports or his whereabouts during work hours. He had given unauthorized account credits to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>certain customers. And without authorization, Abrams had instructed a company programmer not to bill for services rendered to a particular customer.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">{\u00b6 11} McMahon met with Abrams and Kennedy on June 17, 1997. Kennedy and Abrams jointly prepared an agenda for the meeting that included the pirating issue. At the meeting, Abrams brought up the pirating issue, and McMahon again told Kennedy to look into the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">{\u00b6 12} Abrams was terminated in July 1997. At the time, Abrams was 50 years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">{\u00b6 13} The day after his termination, Abrams called Jennings to tell him what had happened and to ask for his advice. But Jennings told Abrams that he could not represent him personally because he represented ACT and CCI.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">\n<em>Abrams Filed Suit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">{\u00b6 14} According to Abrams\u2019 complaint, his termination was the result of (1) age discrimination, (2) his actions in alerting his employers to illegal activities within the companies, and (3) his consultation with a lawyer. Following a hearing, the trial court entered summary judgment in favor of ACT, CCI, McMahon, and Kennedy on each of Abrams\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">{\u00b6 15} In a single assignment of error, Abrams now argues that the trial court erred in its entry of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">\n<em>Our Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b396-12\">{\u00b6 16} We review the granting of summary judgment de novo.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Summary judgment may be appropriately granted only if there exists no genuine issue of material fact, the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and the evidence, when viewed in favor of the nonmoving party, permits only one reasonable conclusion, and that conclusion is adverse to the nonmoving party.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-13\">\n<em>Age-Discrimination Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b396-14\">{\u00b6 17} R.C. 4112.02 prohibits an employer from discharging an employee without just cause on the basis of the employee\u2019s age. The ultimate inquiry in an age-discrimination case is whether an employee was discharged on account of age.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>{\u00b6 18} A discharged employee may establish a prima facie case of age discrimination under R.C. 4112.02 by different methods. An employee may show discriminatory intent indirectly by means of the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>analysis or by direct evidence that discriminatory intent had motivated the termination.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">1. No Indirect Evidence of Discriminatory Intent</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">{\u00b6 19} In the absence of direct evidence, a discharged employee may establish a prima facie violation of R.C. 4112.02 under a four-part test adopted in Ohio from the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Using that analysis, an employee must demonstrate that he (1) was a member of the statutorily protected class, (2) was discharged, (3) was qualified for the position, and (4) was replaced by a substantially younger person.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">{\u00b6 20} In this case, the defendants conceded that Abrams had met the first three prongs of the test. But they argued, and the trial court agreed, that Abrams had failed to establish the fourth prong because he presented no evidence that he had been replaced by a substantially younger person.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">{\u00b6 21} This court has held that \u201c[a] person is \u2018replaced\u2019 only when another employee is hired or reassigned to perform that person\u2019s duties. A person is not replaced when another employee is assigned to perform the plaintiffs duties in addition to other duties, or when the work is redistributed among other existing employees already performing related work.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">{\u00b6 22} Abrams argues that he was replaced by Pete Griffith, a man in his twenties. Abrams contends that, following his termination, Griffith assumed his sales duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">{\u00b6 23} Griffith was hired as a salesman in February 1998, about six months after Abrams\u2019 termination and three months after Abrams had filed his age-discrimination claim. About a month before Griffith was hired, Warren Kappler, a man in his fifties, was hired as a salesman.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">{\u00b6 24} Abrams\u2019 suggestion that he was little more than a salesman was belied by the evidence. The duties of the new salesmen were far less involved than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>Abrams\u2019 duties as vice president of marketing. Griffith and Kappler were hired simply to provide more \u201csales horsepower\u201d in the Cincinnati area.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">{\u00b6 25} Abrams\u2019 duties, on the other hand, were much broader in scope. Abrams supervised the sales forces in both Cincinnati and Dayton and was actively involved in the hiring and firing of salespeople. While selling was a portion of his duties, Abrams testified that his \u201cnumber one job at the company was to provide direction in terms of where we were going in the market place, what products, what technology we were going to apply.\u201d Abrams provided guidance to the salespeople, generated leads for them, and taught them how to sell larger products to make more money.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">{\u00b6 26} In describing his roles at ACT and CCI, Abrams testified, \u201cI think my contribution was significant from the standpoint of providing business planning and marketing direction and identifying the technologies that we wanted to sell and apply to the marketing and customers. I think it had to do with providing sales management to our sales force. I think it had to do with training, showing them other ways of putting together projects, doing it more completely, more profitably. I think it had to do with focusing on the, not only the market, but our specific products that we were going to deal with.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">{\u00b6 27} Abrams\u2019 own description of his roles established that he was not simply a salesman. And following Abrams\u2019 termination, no one was hired or reassigned to assume his significant leadership responsibilities. Because Abrams was not replaced, he could not establish indirectly a prima facie case of age discrimination under R.C. 4112.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">2. No Direct Evidence of Discriminatory Intent</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">{\u00b6 28} Abrams argues that he was not required to demonstrate that he had been replaced under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>analysis, because the record contained direct evidence that his discharge was motivated by discriminatory intent. In support of his claim, Abrams points to remarks made by McMahon and Kennedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">{\u00b6 29} About a month before he fired Abrams, McMahon told Abrams that he was concerned about a certain employee\u2019s back problems because, at the employee\u2019s age, \u201che didn\u2019t want to have the exposure and liability that might come up from these back problems.\u201d In discussing a second employee, McMahon indicated, \u201c[W]e\u2019ve got younger guys up in Dayton that can handle that stuff.\u201d Abrams acknowledged that, at the time of his termination, both men still worked for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">{\u00b6 30} Abrams testified that several conversations he had had with Kennedy in the months before his termination \u201ccentered around [their] industry being a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>young industry, [their] employees being young. [Kennedy] had mentioned that he and [Abrams], * * * along with Mary [Koogler], were the oldest people there.\u201d Kennedy had said to Abrams, \u201cGeez, you\u2019re even older than I am.\u201d Abrams conceded the truth of Kennedy\u2019s observation about the youth of those employed in the computer industry: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more younger people in the industry than older people.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">{\u00b6 31} Age-related comments that are isolated, vague, or ambiguous, or that refer to other employees, cannot support a finding of age discrimination.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Here, McMahon\u2019s remarks about other employees and Kennedy\u2019s isolated and vague remarks about the comparably younger workers in the computer industry were unrelated in time or fact to Abrams\u2019 termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">3. No Prima Facie Case of Discrimination</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">{\u00b6 32} Abrams failed to demonstrate, either by the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>standard or by direct evidence, that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to the likelihood that his termination was motivated by discriminatory intent. Consequently, we hold that the trial court properly entered summary judgment in favor of the defendants on Abrams\u2019 age-discrimination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">\n<em>Whistleblower Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">{\u00b6 33} According to Abrams, his employers terminated him in retaliation for his reporting matters related to potentially false financial statements and pirated software.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">{\u00b6 34} Under R.C. 4113.52, Ohio\u2019s Whistleblower Statute, an employer may not take disciplinary or retaliatory action against an employee who reports certain violations.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The statute addresses a situation in which an employee, in the course of his employment, becomes aware of a legal violation that the employer has the authority to correct, and the employee reasonably believes that the violation is either a criminal offense that is likely to cause an imminent risk of physical harm or a hazard to public health or safety, or a felony.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">{\u00b6 35} Under those circumstances, the employee must orally notify his supervisor or other responsible officer of the employer of the violation and subsequently file with that person a written report that provides sufficient detail to identify and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>describe the violation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> If the employee satisfies those requirements and the employer fails to correct or make a good-faith effort to correct the violation within 24 hours, the employee may then file a written report with outside authorities.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cClearly, the provisions of R.C. 4113.52(A)(1) contemplate that the employer shall be given the opportunity to correct the violation. The statute mandates that the employer be informed of the violation both orally and in writing. An employee who fails to provide the employer with the required oral notification and written report is not entitled to statutory protection for reporting the information to outside authorities.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">{\u00b6 37} In this case, even had there been a violation to report, Abrams was required to provide his employer with both oral and written notice of the violation. The record reveals that Abrams did neither. In his deposition, Abrams admitted that his supervisor, Kennedy, had verbally informed him about the pirating issue and had asked him to look at certain financial statements. And Abrams had not given written notice to Kennedy or McMahon of his concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">{\u00b6 38} Abrams, though, contends that he had met the notice requirement of R.C. 4113.52 in two ways. First, Abrams points to a letter written by Jennings, the lawyer whom he and Kennedy had consulted about a possible merger of ACT and CCI. Jennings\u2019s letter had summarized their May 1997 meeting and had included a remark about the potential exposure stemming from the financial statements and pirated software. Second, Abrams claims that the written agenda he prepared for a June 1997 meeting with McMahon had addressed the same violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">{\u00b6 39} Abrams\u2019 argument that these instances somehow satisfied both the verbal and the written notification requirements of R.C. 4112.52 is less than ingenuous. It was Kennedy, Abrams\u2019 supervisor, <em>who told him </em>and McMahon about the pirating issue. Abrams made no oral report of the matter. Moreover, Jennings\u2019 summary of their earlier meeting was <em>prepared by </em>Jennings, the company lawyer, and was addressed to <em>both Kennedy and Abrams. </em>Finally, Kennedy and Abrams had <em>co-authored </em>the agenda for the June 17 meeting with McMahon. Abrams made no written report of any violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>{\u00b6 40} To be afforded protection as a whistleblower, an employee must strictly comply with the mandates of R.C. 4113.52.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In other words, if an employee does not \u201cwhistle\u201d both orally and in writing, he is not a whistleblower. Here, because Abrams failed to properly notify his employers of potential legal violations and deprived his employers of the opportunity to make corrections, he did not properly blow the whistle.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">{\u00b6 41} Because no genuine issue of material fact remained with respect to Abrams\u2019 failure to comply with the mandates of R.C. 4113.52, the trial court properly entered summary judgment in favor of the defendants on Abrams\u2019 whistleblower claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">\n<em>Public Policy Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">{\u00b6 42} In Ohio, an at-will employee may be terminated without reason, so long as the termination is not contrary to law.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> An exception to the employment-at-will doctrine exists when a termination is contrary to the clear public policy of Ohio.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">{\u00b6 43} To prove wrongful termination in violation of public policy, a plaintiff must demonstrate four elements: (1) that a clear public policy existed and was manifested in a state or federal constitution, in a statute or administrative regulation, or in the common law (the clarity element); (2) that dismissing employees under circumstances like those involved in the plaintiffs dismissal would jeopardize the public policy (the jeopardy element); (3) that the plaintiffs dismissal was motivated by conduct related to the public policy (the causation element); and (4) that the employer lacked an overriding legitimate business justification for the dismissal (the overriding-justification element).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The clarity and jeopardy elements pose questions of law and are to be determined by the court.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>{\u00b6 44} In this case, Abrams argues that he was terminated in retaliation for consulting Jennings in violation of Ohio\u2019s clear public policy. Abrams points to this court\u2019s decision in <em>Chapman v. Adia Servs., Inc., </em>in which we held that an employer violates public policy by terminating an employee for consulting an attorney regarding an issue that affects the employer\u2019s business interests.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">{\u00b6 45} In <em>Chapman, </em>we identified three sources of public policy that encouraged an employee to consult with an attorney about possible claims that would affect an employer\u2019s business interests: the \u201cOpen Courts\u201d provision in Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution; Ethical Considerations 1-1 and 2-1 of the Ohio Code of Professional Responsibility, which state that all persons should have ready access to legal representation; and the common law, which recognizes an individual\u2019s need for legal representation for the redress of wrongs.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">{\u00b6 46} The public-policy sources identified in <em>Chapman </em>reflect Ohio\u2019s interests in encouraging an individual\u2019s access to legal redress for injuries done to the individual. But those interests are not implicated when an individual, in his capacity as an officer of a corporation, consults with the corporation\u2019s attorney about matters affecting the corporation\u2019s interests. We discern no public interest that would be furthered by protecting a corporate officer from termination following his consultation with corporate counsel. It would be illogical for an employee to seek protection for consulting the attorney for an entity whose interests were diametrically opposed to his own interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">{\u00b6 47} Here, in Abrams\u2019 pretermination consultation with Jennings, he was not seeking to explore his own rights. Instead, Abrams was acting as a vice president seeking advice about the corporations\u2019 potential exposure. And Abrams\u2019 post-termination call to Jennings confirmed the attorney\u2019s conflict of interest: Jennings refused to counsel Abrams with respect to potential claims against the corporations that Jennings represented. Under these circumstances, we conclude that Abrams failed to demonstrate that he was wrongfully discharged in violation of public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">{\u00b6 48} Because Abrams failed to demonstrate that genuine issues of fact remained with respect to his wrongful-termination claims, we hold that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>court properly entered summary judgment in favor of the defendants. We overrule the assignment of error and affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b403-6\">Doan, P.J., and Gorman, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b396-15\">.
