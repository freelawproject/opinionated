Newman contends that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to qualify Michael Davis as a medical expert witness at the hearing on her motion. However, Davis\u2019s expertise is based upon his skills as an administrative case manager and not upon any training, experience, or education in diagnosing or treating brain injuries. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in deciding that he was not qualified to render an expert opinion on the medical effects that Newman has suffered as a result of her head injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-12\">{\u00b6 2} Newman also contends that the trial court erred in denying her motion for relief from judgment. Because Newman has failed to show that she is entitled to relief based on excusable neglect, and because the motion was not filed in a timely manner under Civ.R. 60(B), the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-13\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b663-14\">{\u00b6 3} Newman suffered injuries in 1999 when a falling piece of wood struck her head while she was shopping at the Farmacy. Newman has received treatment for her injuries from physicians and a psychologist. She has also received case-management advice from Michael Davis, a \u201cbrain injury specialist,\u201d for the past several years.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-15\">{\u00b6 4} Newman initially filed a complaint against the Farmacy in 2001, alleging negligence. Her first complaint was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice. Newman then filed a second complaint containing the same allegations as the first.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>{\u00b6 5} The Farmacy sent written discovery requests to Newman\u2019s counsel. After Newman failed to respond, the Farmacy filed a motion to compel, which the court granted. The Farmacy next filed a motion to dismiss, and the court scheduled a hearing to address the motion. Prior to the hearing, Newman\u2019s counsel filed a motion to withdraw, alleging that Newman had not been responsive or in communication with counsel. The court granted that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">{\u00b6 6} On September 2, 2004, Newman appeared without counsel at the hearing on Farmacy\u2019s motion to dismiss. Newman informed the court that she would attempt to retain new counsel, and the hearing was rescheduled for September 23, 2004, at Newman\u2019s request. Neither Newman nor new counsel attended the September 23, 2004 hearing. The court then dismissed the case with prejudice by an entry dated September 28, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">{\u00b6 7} On September 27, 2005, Newman, through newly retained counsel, filed a Civ.R. 60(B) motion for relief from judgment, which contended that she was entitled to have the dismissal entry vacated on grounds of excusable neglect. After a hearing on November 28, 2005, the court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">{\u00b6 8} On appeal, Newman asserts the following assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-8\">I. The trial court abused its discretion in ruling inadmissible the opinions and testimony of plaintiffs case manager and certified brain injury specialist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-10\">II. The trial court abused its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s motion for relief from judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-12\">II. Expert Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b664-13\">{\u00b6 9} Newman contends that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to qualify Michael Davis as an expert. The trial court permitted Davis to testify as a fact witness but excluded a portion of his testimony relating to Newman\u2019s competence to attend to legal matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-14\">{\u00b6 10} A trial court has broad discretion regarding the admissibility of expert testimony; a reviewing court should not disturb such an admissibility decision absent an abuse of that discretion. <em>Miller v. Bike Athletic Co. </em>(1998), 80 Ohio St.3d 607, 616, 687 N.E.2d 735, citing <em>Calderon v. Sharkey </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 218, 24 O.O.3d 322, 436 N.E.2d 1008. The term \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d connotes more than an error of judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>Wilmington Steel Prod., Inc. v. Cleveland Elec. Illum. Co. </em>(1991), 60 Ohio St.3d 120, 122, 573 N.E.2d 622. When applying the abuse-of-discretion standard of review, we are not free to merely substitute our judgment for that of the trial court. <em>In re Jane Doe 1 </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 135, 137-38, 566 N.E.2d 1181, citing <em>Berk v. Matthews </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 161, 169, 559 N.E.2d 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>{\u00b6 11} Evid.R. 702, which governs the admissibility of expert testimony, states: \u201cA witness may testify as an expert if all of the following apply: (A) The witness\u2019 testimony either relates to matters beyond the knowledge or experience possessed by lay persons or dispels a misconception common among lay persons; (B) The witness is qualified as an expert by specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education regarding the subject matter of the testimony; (C) The witness\u2019 testimony is based on reliable scientific, technical, or other specialized information.\u201d Evid.R. 702. The proponent of the testimony bears the burden of establishing the witness\u2019s qualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">{\u00b6 12} Newman attempted to qualify Davis as an expert based on the fact that he is certified as a \u201cbrain injury specialist\u201d and he has attended numerous seminars, conferences, symposia, and classes on brain injuries since 1986. Davis also has many years of experience as a consultant and ease manager for brain-injury sufferers, and has given many presentations on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">{\u00b6 13} It is clear that Davis does have experience working with people suffering from brain injuries. However, his work has been limited to case-management services like coordinating benefits, finding rehabilitation experts, and assisting brain-injury sufferers in retaining appropriate legal counsel. He does not diagnose or provide therapeutic treatment to his clients. In fact, Davis has no formal education or experience in any medical field. And while a degree is not a per se requirement, see <em>State v. Baston </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 418, 423, 709 N.E.2d 128, the experience or specialized knowledge the witness has must \u201cfit\u201d the field about which the witness proposes to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">{\u00b6 14} While Davis\u2019s curriculum vitae listed a number of conferences that he has attended, neither he nor the curriculum vitae described the technical or specialized training that he received by attending them. Without some description of the content of the numerous conferences he has attended, it is impossible to tell whether Davis has developed significant skills in the diagnosis of brain injuries. Likewise, since he did not explain the requirements for being certified as a brain-injury specialist, this information falls short of establishing his expertise.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">{\u00b6 15} Davis\u2019s experience as an administrative case manager does not qualify him as an expert to testify on the medical effects of brain injuries. Nor does it qualify him to issue an opinion on whether Ms. Newman is competent to handle her daily affairs. Such qualifications would require at least some experience or training in the medical or scientific field. We acknowledge that the Ohio Supreme Court has stated, \u201cNeither special education nor certification is necessary to confer expert status upon a witness,\u201d <em>State v. Hartman </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 274, 285, 754 N.E.2d 1150. However, we conclude that in this case, Davis\u2019s experience does not fit the subject area, i.e., some training or experience in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>medical or scientific fields is required before Davis could testify about the medical effects, including her competency, that Newman has suffered as a result of her injury. A lengthy exposure to individuals suffering from brain injuries does not by itself qualify an individual to offer expert testimony as to the causes and/or effects of such injuries. Accordingly, the court did not abuse its discretion in failing to qualify Davis as an expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">III. Relief from Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">{\u00b6 16} Newman contends that the trial court erred in denying her motion for relief from judgment. Under Civ.R. 60(B), the court may relieve a party from a final judgment due to \u201c(1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect; (2) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(B); (3) fraud (whether heretofore denominated intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation or other misconduct of an adverse party; (4) the judgment has been satisfied, released or discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application; or (5) any other reason justifying relief from the judgment. The motion shall be made within a reasonable time, and for reasons (1), (2) and (3) not more than one year after the judgment, order or proceeding was entered or taken.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">{\u00b6 17} In order to prevail on a motion for relief from judgment under Civ.R. 60(B), the movant must demonstrate (1) the existence of a meritorious claim or defense, (2) entitlement to relief under one of the grounds stated in Civ.R. 60(B)(1) through (5), and (3) the timeliness of the motion. <em>Buckeye Fed. S. &amp; L. Assn. v. Guirlinger </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 312, 314, 581 N.E.2d 1352; <em>GTE Automatic Elec., Inc. v. ARC Industries, Inc. </em>(1976), 47 Ohio St.2d 146, 1 O.O.3d 86, 351 N.E.2d 113, paragraph two of the syllabus. If the movant does not satisfy all three requirements, the court must overrule the motion. <em>Svoboda v. Brunswick </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 348, 351, 6 OBR 403, 453 N.E.2d 648.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">{\u00b6 18} The question of whether relief should be granted is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court and its determination should be reversed only upon a showing of an abuse of such discretion. <em>Rose Chevrolet, Inc. v. Adams </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 17, 20-21, 520 N.E.2d 564. This is the same standard of review that we applied above.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">A. Meritorious Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">{\u00b6 19} In order to prevail on her motion for relief from judgment, Newman must first show that she has a meritorious claim or defense. \u201cUnder Civ.R. 60(B), a movant\u2019s burden is only to allege a meritorious defense, not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>prove that he will prevail on that defense.\u201d <em>Rose Chevrolet, Inc. v. Adams </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 17, 20, 520 N.E.2d 564.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">{\u00b6 20} In support of her motion, Newman contends that she suffered injuries on the premises of the Farmacy as a result of negligence on the part of the Farmacy. The Farmacy has conceded the existence of a meritorious claim but contends that Newman has yet to prove her claim. Nevertheless, we conclude that Newman has presented a meritorious claim for Civ.R. 60(B) purposes because, if proven, her claim would entitle her to a judgment against the Farmacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">B. Entitlement to Relief/Excusable Neglect</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">{\u00b6 21} Next, we must determine whether Newman established grounds for relief under Civ.R. 60(B)(1) based on excusable neglect. Newman contends that her neglect in failing to (1) comply with discovery orders, (2) retain new counsel prior to the dismissal, and (3) appear at the hearing on the motion to dismiss should be excused because it was the result of her physical- and mental-health issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">{\u00b6 22} The determination of whether excusable neglect occurred must, of necessity, take into consideration all the surrounding facts and circumstances. <em>Rose Chevrolet, Inc. v. Adams </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 17, 21, 520 N.E.2d 564, citing <em>Colley v. Bazell </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 243, 249, 18 O.O.3d 442, 416 N.E.2d 605. Although courts should strive to decide cases upon their merits rather than upon procedural grounds, that principle must be balanced against the competing principle that litigation must be brought to an end. <em>Rose Chevrolet, </em>36 Ohio St.3d at 21, 520 N.E.2d 564.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">{\u00b6 23} The term \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d is an elusive concept that has been difficult to define and to apply. <em>Kay v. Marc Glassman, Inc. </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 18, 20, 665 N.E.2d 1102. The Ohio Supreme Court has stated that the inaction of a defendant is not excusable neglect if it can be labeled as a \u201ccomplete disregard for the judicial system.\u201d Id., quoting <em>GTE Automatic Elec., Inc. v. ARC Industries, Inc. </em>(1976), 47 Ohio St.2d 146, 153, 1 O.O.3d 86, 351 N.E.2d 113. Neglect is not excusable if the conduct falls substantially below what is reasonable under the circumstances. <em>GTE, </em>47 Ohio St.2d at 152, 1 O.O.3d 86, 351 N.E.2d 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-10\">{\u00b6 24} In addition to her own testimony, Newman presented witnesses Michael Davis and Roger Patton to support her contention that the neglect in this case was due to her physical- and mental-health issues. Davis testified that Newman had difficulties with daily functioning and could not focus on more than one task at a time. He testified that in his opinion, Newman is often depressed and will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>not attend to the basic demands of life when she enters such a state. He believes that she did not attend to this lawsuit because of her condition. However, he also testified that Newman was capable of conducting basic functions such as eating, driving, dressing, and taking care of her minor children.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">{\u00b6 25} Patton, a friend of Newman\u2019s, testified that he believes Newman has sustained a life-changing injury and that she has become obsessive and no longer speaks concisely since the injury. Patton attended the September 2, 2004 hearing with Newman, and he knew that Newman was required to attend the September 23, 2004 hearing. He further testified that he was surprised to hear that Newman had failed to attend that hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">{\u00b6 26} Newman testified that as a result of her condition, she sees a psychologist and a neurologist. She testified that she understood that this case had been refiled. She further understood from the hearing on September 2, 2004, that she had to act promptly or the case would be dismissed again, and this time the dismissal would be final. Newman stated that she did not attend the September 23, 2004 hearing because she had \u201cshut down\u201d as a result of the prescription narcotics she was taking. She further testified that she did not have enough time to retain new counsel before the September 23, 2004 hearing, even though the court had granted her more time than she had originally requested. She did not retain her present attorney until August 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">{If 27} Taking into consideration all of the surrounding facts and circumstances, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Newman failed to establish excusable neglect. Newman\u2019s prior counsel served his motion to withdraw on Newman on July 21, 2004. Therefore, she had from late July 2004 until the first hearing on September 2, 2004, to retain new counsel. She failed to retain new counsel by this time, and the trial granted her additional time by continuing the hearing to September 23, 2004, a time period beyond which Newman had requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">{\u00b6 28} Furthermore, Newman\u2019s appearances at the September 2, 2004 hearing and the November 28, 2005 hearing indicate that she has retained the ability to function and respond to time demands. In fact, she indicated that she had phoned the court prior to the September 23, 2004 hearing to obtain another continuance, and claimed that the staff member she spoke with had told her not to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">{\u00b6 29} In addition, Davis testified that Newman was capable of performing basic functions such as eating, driving, dressing, and even taking care of her children. Therefore, even though Newman may suffer from some mental and physical conditions, she was still aware of the September 23, 2004 hearing, and she knew that she was required to appear. Because the record indicates that Newman was capable of attending to this case, the trial court acted reasonably in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>concluding that her neglect is inexcusable. This conclusion alone supports denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">C. Timeliness</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">{\u00b6 30} In order to satisfy the time requirement for filing a motion for relief from judgment, the motion must be filed \u201cwithin a reasonable time, and [where the grounds of relief are Civ.R. 60(B)(1), (2) or (3),] not more than one year after the judgment, order or proceeding was entered or taken.\u201d Civ.R. 60(B). The determination of what constitutes a reasonable time is left to the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion. <em>Miamisburg Motel v. Huntington Natl. Bank </em>(1993), 88 Ohio App.3d 117, 128, 623 N.E.2d 163. Here, the trial court found that the motion was not filed within a \u201creasonable time,\u201d because it was filed just one day before the one-year time limit expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">{\u00b6 31} The movant has the burden of proof to show that the motion was filed timely and \u201cmust submit factual material which on its face demonstrates the timeliness of the motion.\u201d <em>Adomeit v. Baltimore </em>(1974), 39 Ohio App.2d 97, 103, 68 O.O.2d 251, 316 N.E.2d 469. To sustain this burden, \u201cgood legal practice dictates that the movant * * * present allegations of operative facts to demonstrate that [s]he is filing [her] motion within a reasonable period of time.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">{\u00b6 32} Newman contends that because of her repeated unsuccessful efforts to retain new legal counsel over the course of the one year following the dismissal of the case, the trial court should have considered her motion timely, even though it was filed just one day before the one-year limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">{\u00b6 33} The record indicates that Newman\u2019s prior counsel filed his motion to withdraw on July 21, 2004. Newman had an ample amount of time to secure new counsel from July 21, 2004, until September 2005. We conclude that because Newman had been given two chances to retain new counsel, and had more than a year in which to do so, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting Newman\u2019s contention that her unsuccessful attempts to secure counsel justified the delay in filing her motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-10\">{\u00b6 34} Newman has failed to satisfy two of the three requirements necessary for the success of her motion for relief from judgment. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b669-12\">Kline and McFarland, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
