Robinson and Crystal Robinson were divorced on April 4, 2004. Todd<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was ordered to pay support for the parties\u2019 two minor children. The amount of support was determined after crediting Todd with $8,600 in annual support that he pays for another child. The decree also awarded Crystal one-half of the amount that had accumulated in Todd\u2019s deferred-compensation account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>during the marriage, from August 25, 2001, to March 26, 2004. The court found that the value of the plan as of June 30, 2002, was $9,953.80.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">{\u00b6 3} Several months after the decree, Crystal filed charges in contempt, alleging that Todd had withdrawn funds from his deferred-compensation account while their divorce action was pending, largely exhausting the balance and in violation of temporary orders that the court had entered pursuant to Civ.R. 75(1). Crystal further alleged that Todd had failed to pay her the marital share of the account that she was awarded in the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">{\u00b6 4} Todd also filed a postdecree motion, asking the court to modify the child-support obligation imposed on him in the decree. Todd alleged that his income had since been reduced by a change of jobs and that the decline in income is a change of circumstances that warrants modification for purposes of R.C. 3119.79.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">{\u00b6 5} The motions were referred to a magistrate. The magistrate heard evidence that Todd had quit his prior job with the city of Springfield for health reasons and had since taken a lower-paying position as a security guard. The magistrate recalculated Todd\u2019s child-support obligation accordingly, but in the process, the magistrate failed to credit Todd with any support that he pays for another child.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">{\u00b6 6} On Crystal\u2019s motion, the magistrate found that Todd withdrew monies from his deferred-compensation account while the divorce action was pending in 2003 on three occasions, in violation of the court\u2019s temporary orders, and that the sum of those withdrawals was $10,864.13. The magistrate found Todd in contempt and ordered him to pay Crystal one-half of that amount, $5,432.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">{\u00b6 7} Both parties filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision. The trial court overruled the objections and adopted the decision. Todd filed a notice of appeal. Crystal filed a notice of cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">TODD\u2019S FIRST ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b509-11\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cThe court erred in calculating defendant\u2019s child support obligation where the court did not take into account support paid by defendant for other children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-12\">{\u00b6 9} At the April 11, 2005 hearing before the magistrate on his motion to modify his child-support obligation, Todd was unable to recall the amount of annual support that he pays pursuant to court order for his other child. Therefore, the magistrate entered \u201c0.00\u201d at item 9 of the Child Support Worksheet, which is titled \u201cAnnual court-ordered support paid for other children.\u201d The trial court overruled Todd\u2019s objection to the zero credit, finding that Todd had failed to provide the magistrate the information necessary for the credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>{\u00b6 10} R.C. 3119.79(C) provides that if the court finds a substantial change of circumstances not contemplated when the last support order was issued, \u201cthe court shall modify the amount of child support required to be paid under the child support order to comply with the schedule and the applicable worksheet through the line establishing the actual annual obligation,\u201d subject to the deviation factors identified in R.C. 3119.22.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">{\u00b6 11} Rule 14 of the Local Rules of Practice of the Domestic Relations Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Clark County states:</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cAll motions to modify prior orders of the court shall contain a statement of the order sought to be modified, nature of the modification sought and the specific change in circumstances which justify modification. Motions to modify child support orders shall be accompanied by completed child support calculation sheets.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">{\u00b6 13} The motion to modify his child-support obligation that Todd filed on December 1, 2004, merely alleges that \u201cthere has been a change in circumstances that warrant this modification.\u201d The particular circumstances are not identified. No child-support worksheet was filed with the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">{\u00b6 14} Todd\u2019s failure to comply with the court\u2019s Local Rule 14(C) by filing a child-support worksheet containing the credit for other support he claims he is due, coupled with Todd\u2019s inability to offer evidence of what he pays for his other child, warranted the magistrate\u2019s failure to award Todd a credit for other support. Likewise, the domestic relations court did not abuse its discretion when it overruled Todd\u2019s objection to the magistrate\u2019s failure to award the credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">{\u00b6 15} Todd contends in his brief that when his objection to the magistrate\u2019s decision was heard by the court, he proffered evidence of the amount of support he pays for the other child, pursuant to Civ.R. 53(E)(4)(b). However, as Todd concedes, the matter was heard in chambers, and no record was made of the proceeding. Unless a party requests that proceedings be recorded, the court is not required to record the proceedings. R.C. 2301.20. Therefore, any prejudice that Todd suffered from the lack of a record is chargeable to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">{\u00b6 16} The domestic relations court\u2019s final order adopting the magistrate\u2019s decision was filed on August 10, 2005. On September 9, 2005, Todd filed his notice of appeal from that judgment, and on that same date, he filed a motion for reconsideration in the trial court, asking it to reconsider its denial of a credit for the support that Todd claims he pays for his other child. Todd also asked the court to reconsider its decision to order him to pay Crystal $5,432 for his violation of the court\u2019s temporary orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>{\u00b6 17} The Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure make no provision for a motion for reconsideration of a final order. Therefore, any order the court might have entered on the motion for reconsideration that Todd filed, granting or denying it, would be a legal nullity. <em>Pitts v. Ohio Dept. Of Transp. </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 378, 21 O.O.3d 238, 423 N.E.2d 1105. On appeal, any such order or judgment must be vacated for a lack of jurisdiction. Id. Counsel are urged to avoid such feckless applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">{\u00b6 18} Nevertheless, the domestic relations court may, in its discretion, elect to treat such an application as a Civ.R. 60(B) motion to vacate a prior order. The domestic relations court was deprived of jurisdiction to do that by the notice of appeal that Todd filed. Following this decision, Todd may ask the court to treat his application as a Civ.R. 60(B) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">{\u00b6 19} Finally, we strongly urge counsel to better observe the requirement of App.R. 16(A)(7) that arguments in briefs cite \u201cparts of the record on which (a party) relies.\u201d The preferred practice is to cite the docket number for each document assigned by the clerk pursuant to App.R. 10(B). Merely referring in the argument to a motion otherwise identified in the statement of the case with reference to its filing date is inadequate and unhelpful, especially in a case of this kind, in which numerous motions were filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">{\u00b6 20} Todd\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">TODD\u2019S SECOND ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cThe trial court erred by upholding the magistrate\u2019s order that defendant pay to plaintiff the sum of $5,432.00.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">{\u00b6 22} Todd made three withdrawals from his deferred-compensation account while the divorce action was pending, in violation of the court\u2019s temporary orders. Todd\u2019s conduct was the basis for the court\u2019s subsequent finding of contempt and its further order that he pay Crystal $5,432, representing one-half of the total amount he withdrew.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">{\u00b6 23} Todd argues that the court\u2019s order exceeded the terms of its decree because there was no evidence that the monies he withdrew represented an increase in the value of the account \u201cduring the marriage,\u201d that is, between August 25, 2001, and March 26, 2004, and the decree awarded Crystal only her one-half share of that unspecified amount. Todd also argues that the court erred in so ordering because it had not reserved jurisdiction to modify the property-division provision of its divorce decree, and that is essentially what it did when the court ordered Todd to pay Crystal $5,432.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>{\u00b6 24} \u201cA division or disbursement of property * * * made (pursuant to a divorce decree) is not subject to future modification by the court.\u201d R.C. 3105.171(1). Therefore, the court could not \u201creserve jurisdiction\u201d to modify the award that it made in the decree. However, that is not what the court did.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">{\u00b6 25} When the court overruled Todd\u2019s objection and adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision awarding Crystal $5,432, the court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c[Cjounsel for Ms. Robinson correctly points out that Mr. Robinson was withdrawing money from this account for his own personal use during the pendency of this litigation in violation of this Court\u2019s temporary restraining orders prohibiting such action which was essentially used to pay his then girlfriend\u2019s living expenses. In consideration of this fact, Plaintiffs counsel also correctly points out that it is nearly impossible to show, based upon the evidence before the Magistrate, what appreciation or depreciation took place on the marital components of the deferred compensation plan since Mr. Robinson\u2019s voluntary withdrawals of money from this account were not discovered until a later date. She argues that equity dictates that he not benefit by his own voluntary failure to disclose the withdrawals which he made from this account, in violation of the Court\u2019s prior Orders, and upon conducting an independent review of the record concerning this issue, this Court agrees with the Plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">{\u00b6 27} The court didn\u2019t award Crystal $5,432 in its postdecree order. Rather, the court ordered Todd to pay Crystal that amount as a civil penalty for his plain contempt of the court\u2019s temporary orders, a result of which was to prevent the court from determining more precisely how much of the account Crystal would have received based on the right that was awarded her in the decree. The purpose of contempt is to secure compliance with the court\u2019s lawful orders. <em>Windham Bank v. Tomaszczyk </em>(1971), 27 Ohio St.2d 55, 56 O.O.2d 31, 271 N.E.2d 815. Courts possess an inherent power to punish the disobedience of its order through contempt proceedings and civil penalties fashioned to avoid the prejudicial effects of a contemnor\u2019s defalcations. We find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">{\u00b6 28} Todd\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">CRYSTAL\u2019S CROSS-ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cThe trial court abused its discretion when it failed to impute income to Mr. Robinson, who is voluntarily underemployed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-11\">{\u00b6 30} Per R.C. 3119.02, the court must calculate child-support obligations in accordance with the basic child-support schedule and applicable worksheet and other provisions in R.C. 3119.02 through 3119.24. The worksheets require a determination of each party\u2019s annual gross income. In addition to an obligor\u2019s actual income from employment and other sources, the court may credit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>an obligor with \u201cpotential income.\u201d That includes any amount of \u201c[i]mputed income that the court * * * determines the parent would have earned if fully employed as determined from the following criteria:</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">{\u00b6 31} \u201c(i) The parent\u2019s prior employment experience;</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c(ii) The parent\u2019s education;</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c(iii) The parent\u2019s physical and mental disabilities, if any;</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">{\u00b6 34} \u201c(iv) The availability of employment in the geographic area in which the parent resides;</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">{\u00b6 35} \u201c(v) The prevailing wage and salary levels in the geographic area in which the parent resides;</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">{\u00b6 36} \u201c(vi) The parent\u2019s special skills and training;</p>\n<p id=\"b513-11\">{\u00b6 37} \u201c(vii) Whether there is evidence that the parent has the ability to earn the imputed income;</p>\n<p id=\"b513-12\">{\u00b6 38} \u201c(viii) The age and special needs of the child for whom child support is being calculated under this section;</p>\n<p id=\"b513-13\">{\u00b6 39} \u201c(ix) The parent\u2019s increased earning capacity because of experience;</p>\n<p id=\"b513-14\">{\u00b6 40} \u201c(x) Any .other relevant factor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-15\">{\u00b6 41} Reviewing the record with respect to R.C. 3119.01(C)(11), the magistrate found:</p>\n<p id=\"b513-16\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cThe evidence presented is relevant to many of these factors. The defendant holds a college degree. He was employed by the Springfield Police Department as a criminologist for several years where he had earned as much as $50,000, which is some evidence of his recent income. Also presented was evidence of other criminologist positions recently applied for by the defendant for which he was rejected. The defendant is 34 years old. There is evidence that toward the end of his employment with the Springfield Police Department and in pertinent part his stated rationale for leaving is the workload increased significantly, he was refused an increase in pay for the extra workload, and defendant developed job related stress indicated by insomnia, increased heart rate and high blood pressure. It is concluded that the defendant is not voluntarily underemployed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-17\">{\u00b6 43} On Crystal\u2019s objection to the magistrate\u2019s decision on the matter of Todd\u2019s alleged voluntary unemployment, the court held that the objection was \u201cnot well-taken.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-18\">{\u00b6 44} We have held, \u201cThe fact that the obligor\u2019s income has been reduced as a result of his or her voluntary choice does not necessarily demonstrate voluntary underemployment. The test is not only whether the change was voluntary, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>also whether it was made with due regard to the obligor\u2019s income-producing abilities and her or his duty to provide for the continuing needs of the child or children concerned.\u201d <em>Woloch v. Foster </em>(1994), 98 Ohio App.3d 806, 811, 649 N.E.2d 918.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">{\u00b6 45} Crystal argues that because of his education and experience, Todd\u2019s decision to change jobs, which reduced his income substantially, was not made with due regard for the needs of their two children. Crystal also argues that the trial court\u2019s decision crediting Todd\u2019s reasons for quitting his former job violates the rule of <em>Rock v. Cabral </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 108, 616 N.E.2d 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">{\u00b6 46} In <em>Rock, </em>the Supreme Court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">{\u00b6 47} \u201cWhether a parent is \u2018voluntarily underemployed\u2019 within the meaning of R.C. 3113.215(A)(5),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the amount of \u2018potential income\u2019 to be imputed to a child support obligor, are matters to be determined by the trial court based upon the facts and circumstances of each case. The determination will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d Id. at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">{\u00b6 48} In <em>Rock, </em>a domestic relations court found that an obligor was voluntarily underemployed. The obligor argued that voluntary underemployment exists only when a person has purposely reduced earnings in an effort to reduce his or her child-support obligation. <em>Rock </em>rejected that contention, noting that R.C. 3113.215(A)(5) [R.C. 3119.01(0(11) ] imposes no such burden of proof. The court wrote that the primary design and purpose of the statute are to protect and insure the best interests of the children and that \u201c[t]he parent\u2019s subjective motivations for being <em>voluntarily </em>unemployed or underemployed play no part in the determination whether potential income is to be imputed to that parent in calculating his or her support obligation.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id. at 111, 616 N.E.2d 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">{\u00b6 49} Crystal argues that the injunction in <em>Rock </em>against considering an obligor\u2019s subjective reasons stands for the proposition that the domestic relations court may not, as the court did in the present case, credit the reasons an obligor gives for quitting a higher-paying job for one that pays less, and that the trial court therefore abused its discretion when it found that Todd\u2019s reasons were sufficient to avoid a finding of voluntary underemployment. We do not agree. <em>Rock </em>merely holds that the court is not required to determine whether it was the obligor\u2019s subjective purpose to avoid his support obligation. Instead, the only reasons relevant to a finding of voluntary underemployment are those set out in R.C. 3119.01(C)(ll)(i) through (x), concerning which the court is permitted in its discretion to give an obligor\u2019s stated reasons for changing jobs whatever weight it wishes.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>{\u00b6 50} Todd testified that he was employed as a criminologist in the Springfield Police Division\u2019s Crime Laboratory when the prior child-support order was issued. When the director of the lab retired, Todd was required to do the work of both positions, which added to his burden considerably. When he was told that he would be given no assistance, Todd sought employment with several other police departments as a criminologist, but without success. Prior contempt orders caused him to lose his commission as a sheriffs deputy, depriving him of the extra income he had been able to earn during off-hours. He began to experience an inability to sleep, elevated blood pressure, and a heart rate well above normal. He sought treatment from a physician, who prescribed medication to help him sleep, and he also sought consultation with a psychologist. Todd testified that after two years, pressures of the job and his related health problems caused him to quit.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">{\u00b6 51} We find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s finding that Todd was not voluntarily underemployed. He sought comparable employment that he testified would pay him as much or more, but unsuccessfully. The health problems his job caused him over a two-year period were serious, and he quit his job to relieve himself of their effects. The court acted within the discretion conferred on it by R.C. 3119.01(C)(11), as interpreted by Rock, in refusing to impute income to Todd on a finding of voluntary underemployment.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">{\u00b6 52} Crystal\u2019s cross-assignment of error is overruled. The judgment of the domestic relations court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b515-8\">Wolff and Fain, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b508-14\">.
