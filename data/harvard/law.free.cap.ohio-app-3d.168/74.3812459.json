The following facts give rise to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>{\u00b6 2} On February 17, 2004, appellee applied to DFI for a loan officer\u2019s license. On May 14, 2004, after conducting an investigation, DFI provided notice of its intent to deny appellee\u2019s application. DFI concluded that appellee\u2019s character and fitness do not command the confidence of the public due to her previous felony conviction for operating a pyramid sales plan. DFI also concluded that appellee failed to prove that she is honest, truthful, and of good reputation.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">{\u00b6 3} Castle requested a hearing, which DFI conducted on August 11, 2004. The hearing examiner issued a report recommending denial of the license. Castle filed objections. Subsequently, DFI issued a final order adopting the report and recommendation and denying the loan officer\u2019s license. Pursuant to R.C. Chapter 119, Castle appealed the administrative order to the Morrow County Court of Common Pleas. The trial court reversed the order of DFI and remanded the matter in order for DFI to issue a loan officer\u2019s license to appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">{\u00b6 4} DFI timely filed a notice of appeal and sets forth the following assignment of error for our consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cI. The lower court applied an improper standard of review in reversing the administrative order of the Division of Financial Institutions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">{\u00b6 6} In its sole assignment of error, DFI maintains that the trial court applied an incorrect standard of review when it reversed the order denying appellee\u2019s request for a loan officer\u2019s license. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">{\u00b6 7} In an appeal pursuant to R.C. Chapter 119, the trial court reviews an administrative order to determine whether it is supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence and is in accordance with the law. <em>Wolff v. Dept. of Job &amp; Family Serv., </em>165 Ohio App.3d 118, 123, 2006-Ohio-214, 844 N.E.2d 1238, citing <em>Univ. of Cincinnati v. Conrad </em>(1980), 63 Ohio St.2d 108, 110, 17 O.O.3d 65, 407 N.E.2d 1265. When reviewing the trial court\u2019s determination regarding whether an administrative order is supported by such evidence, however, the appellate court determines only whether the trial court abused its discretion. <em>Lincoln St. Salvage v. Ohio Motor Vehicles Salvage Dealers Licensing Bd., </em>Stark App. No. 2002CA00089, 2002-Ohio-4661, 2002 WL 31002745, at \u00b6 10, citing <em>Young v. Cuyahoga Work &amp; Training Agency </em>(July 19, 2001), Cuyahoga App. No. 79123, 2001 WL 824466, and <em>Rossford Exempted Village School Disk Bd. of Edn. v. State Bd. of Edn. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 705, 707, 590 N.E.2d 1240.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">{\u00b6 8} The term \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d connotes more than an error of law or judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140. Nonetheless, on questions of law, review by an appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>court is plenary. <em>Univ. Hosp., Univ. of Cincinnati College of Medicine v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 339, 587 N.E.2d 835, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">{\u00b6 9} In its judgment entry issued on November 14, 2005, the trial court initially stated that a \u201ctrial court reviews an agency\u2019s order to determine whether the order is supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence and is in accordance with law. In doing so, the court must give deference to the administrative resolution of evidentiary conflicts.\u201d As noted above, this is the correct standard of review for trial courts to apply in an R.C. Chapter 119 appeal. However, the trial court concluded that \u201cthe denial of the license is against the weight of the evidence and that the hearing officer applied the wrong standard.\u201d At the conclusion of the judgment entry, the trial court further found that \u201c[b]y a preponderance of the evidence presented at the hearing in this case, it is clear that Appellant Castle has met her burden under R.C. 1322.041.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">{\u00b6 10} Upon review of the trial court\u2019s judgment entry, we find that the trial court initially cited the correct standard but applied a manifest-weight standard and preponderance-of-the-evidenee standard in reaching its conclusion that DFI should grant appellee a loan officer\u2019s license. This is not the correct standard of review under R.C. 119.12. Appellee argues that even if we find that the trial court applied the incorrect standard of review, the error is harmless because appellee\u2019s felony conviction for a theft offense does not stand alone as reliable, probative evidence as to her character for fitness or her ability to operate as a loan officer. Appellee further maintains the trial court\u2019s conclusion should not be overruled because the decision was not unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable, given the totality of the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">{\u00b6 11} Because we find error as a matter of law in the trial court\u2019s judgment entry, the proper remedy is to reverse and remand this matter to the trial court for the court to apply the proper standard of review. See <em>Flowers v. Ohio Dept. of Job &amp; Family Serv., </em>Fairfield App. No. 05 CA 94, 2006-Ohio-2159, 2006 WL 1135028.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">{\u00b6 12} Accordingly, we sustain DFI\u2019s sole assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">{\u00b6 13} For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, Morrow County, Ohio, is hereby reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b107-11\">Farmer and Edwards, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
