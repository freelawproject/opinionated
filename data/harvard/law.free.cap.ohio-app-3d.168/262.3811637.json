Kemira Chemicals, Inc. (\u201cKemira\u201d) and Great Lakes Recovery (\u201cGreat Lakes\u201d) in a dispute over vicarious liability for the deaths and injuries resulting from a motor-vehicle accident. Because we conclude that the trial court did not impermissibly weigh the evidence, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">{\u00b6 2} James R. Lenzie, Donald L. Bookwalter, and Travis D. Bookwalter were killed and James Lester Lenzie and Richard L. Sorensen were severely injured in a motor-vehicle accident when their vehicle collided with a tanker truck driven by Calvin Prescott. At the time of the May 20, 2001 accident, Prescott was traveling south on 1-75 on his way to his home in Ridgeville, Indiana. Prescott was returning from delivering a load of sodium silicate from Kemira\u2019s plant in Fortville, Indiana to Great Lakes in Ecorse, Michigan. Prescott had been making payments to purchase the tanker truck at the time of the accident. It had an Interstate Commerce Commission placard with C &amp; R Prescott Trucking displayed on it. Prescott did business as C &amp; R Prescott Trucking, but C &amp; R Prescott Trucking was not incorporated.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">{\u00b6 3} Prescott was initially recruited in 1996 to regularly transport sodium silicate in his tanker truck from Kemira to Great Lakes through either a contact at Great Lakes, Marcelino Martinez, or a contact at Power Silicates,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Brooks Walden. Prescott had no written contract with either Kemira or Great Lakes for bis hauling duties or any written lease with either Kemira or Great Lakes relative to the tanker truck. However, Kemira and Great Lakes<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> had a series of renewable three-year purchase and sales agreements for the sodium silicate. During the years that Prescott delivered to Great Lakes, he delivered approximately 90 percent of the sodium silicate that Great Lakes purchased from Kemira. The shipments of sodium silicate were tracked through the use of an annual blanket purchase order from Great Lakes and a bill of lading for each individual shipment printed by Kemira. Upon picking up a load at Kemira, Prescott signed this bill of lading on a line titled \u201cagent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>{\u00b6 4} Prescott had responsibility for periodically checking on the level of sodium silicate at Great Lakes, either by phone or in person, and transporting a load to Great Lakes from Kemira when the level became low. Prescott was informed by Martinez that if he ever let the sodium silicate at Great Lakes run empty, his hauling services from Kemira to Great Lakes would no longer be needed. Prescott paid for the maintenance of his tanker truck, the fuel for it, as well as for insurance on it. Prescott received no professional training from either Kemira or Great Lakes, and neither entity specified the route he was to take between the facilities. Prescott was paid by Kemira according to the number of pounds of sodium silicate he hauled from Kemira to Great Lakes. Ultimately, Prescott\u2019s freight charges were billed by Kemira to Great Lakes as part of the cost of the sodium silicate. Prescott received a 1099 tax form from Kemira each year.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">{\u00b6 5} On September 4, 2002, appellants filed an initial complaint that included a claim against Kemira, asserting vicarious liability for Prescott\u2019s negligence as Prescott\u2019s employer. On February 19, 2003, appellants filed an amended complaint that included a similar vicarious liability claim against Great Lakes. On July 1, 2004, the trial court granted both appellee Kemira\u2019s and appellee Great Lakes\u2019 motions for summary judgment. On December 15, 2004, appellants and Prescott, individually, and Prescott d.b.a. C &amp; R Prescott Trucking, entered into a consent judgment entry for $10,000,000 in damages. Appellants assert the following assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">{\u00b6 6} \u201c1. The trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Great Lakes and Vinings by finding as a matter of law that Calvin Prescott was an independent contractor because reasonable minds could conclude that Prescott was an employee or agent of Great Lakes or Vinings, or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">{\u00b6 7} <em>\u201c2. </em>The trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Great Lakes and Vinings because it exceeded the scope of its authority under Ohio Civil Rule 56 by weighing the evidence and failing to construe the evidence most strongly in favor of Plaintiffs-Appellants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">{\u00b6 8} Appellate review of a trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is de novo. <em>Grafton v. Ohio Edison Co. </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 102, 105, 671 N.E.2d 241. Accordingly, we review the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment independently and without deference to the trial court\u2019s determination. <em>Brown v. Scioto Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1993), 87 Ohio App.3d 704, 711, 622 N.E.2d 1153. Summary judgment will be granted only when there remains no genuine issue of material fact and, when construing the evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, reasonable minds can only conclude that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 66, 8 O.O.3d 73, 375 N.E.2d 46; Civ.R. 56(C). The burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>showing that no genuine issue of material fact exists falls upon the party who moves for summary judgment. <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.8d 280, 294, 662 N.E.2d 264. However, once the movant supports his or her motion with appropriate evidentiary materials, the nonmoving party \u201cmay not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of [his] pleadings, but his response, by affidavit or as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d Civ.R. 56(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">{\u00b6 9} Prior to embarking on a common-law analysis of Prescott\u2019s employment status, we must address appellees\u2019 argument relative to Prescott\u2019s employment status under federal statutory law. This issue was raised in Kemira\u2019s motion for summary judgment before the trial court, though the trial court\u2019s summary judgment opinion apparently did not address it. Both appellees cite <em>Wyckoff Trucking, Inc. v. Marsh Bros. Trucking Serv., Inc. </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 261, 569 N.E.2d 1049, in the instant appeal in advocating for emphasis on a statutory analysis of Prescott\u2019s employment status under the Interstate Commerce Commission regulations rather than application of the common-law doctrine of respondeat superior. In fact, appellee Great Lakes cites <em>Wyckoff </em>for its contention that the common-law doctrine of respondeat superior plays no role in this case. In response, appellants contend that Prescott can be a statutory employee of Prescott Trucking as well as a common-law employee of either Kemira or Great Lakes at the same time. In other words, appellants assert that establishment of Prescott Trucking as the statutory employer of Prescott with primary liability does not preclude a finding of secondary liability for either Kemira or Great Lakes as common-law employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">{\u00b6 10} In <em>Wyckoff, </em>the court noted there were two differing points of view with regard to the determination of tort liability arising out of accidents involving leased vehicles of interstate motor carriers under I.C.C. regulations. Id. at 265, 569 N.E.2d 1049. As the court stated, \u201c[u]nder the minority view, a written lease in combination with the display of I.C.C. placards creates only a rebuttable presumption of an employment relationship between the driver of the vehicle and the carrier-lessee indicated on the placards. Thus, the carrier-lessee\u2019s liability is ultimately determined by resort to common-law doctrines such as <em>respondeat superior.\u201d </em>Id. \u201cOn the other hand, the majority view holds that Section 1057.12(c)(1), Title 49, C.F.R. creates an irrebuttable presumption of an employment relationship between the carrier-lessee and the driver of the vehicle that displays the I.C.C. placards of the carrier-lessee.\u201d Id. In <em>Wyckoff, </em>the Supreme Court of Ohio sided with the majority view and held:</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c1. In tort causes of action involving leased vehicles of interstate motor carriers, primary liability shall be determined with regard to Interstate Commerce Commission regulations rather than the common-law doctrines of <em>respon</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number><em>deat superior, </em>master-servant, independent contractor and the like. <em>(Thornberry v. Oyler Bros., Inc. </em>[1955], 164 Ohio St. 395, 58 O.O. 189, 131 N.E.2d 383, overruled to the extent inconsistent herewith.)</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">{\u00b6 12} <em>\u201c2. </em>In order for liability to attach on an interstate carrier-lessee under Interstate Commerce Commission regulations, it must be established that, at the time the cause of action arose, (1) <em>a lease </em>of the vehicle was in effect and (2) the vehicle displayed the carrier-lessee\u2019s placard listing its I.C.C. numbers. (Section 1057.12, Title 49, C.F.R., applied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c3. Section 1057.12(c)(1), Title 49, C.F.R. creates an irrebuttable presumption of an employment relationship between the carrier-lessee and the driver of a vehicle that displays the I.C.C. identification numbers of the carrier-lessee.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">{\u00b6 14} Appellants cite a 1992 <em>post-Wyckoff </em>amendment to the I.C.C. regulations and assert that the amendment effectively abrogated <em>Wyckoffs </em>irrebuttable presumption of an employment relationship between a driver and a carrier-lessee whose I.C.C. placard is displayed on the vehicle. In 1992, the I.C.C. amended Section 1057.12(c), Title 49, C.F.R. to add the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c(4) Nothing in the provisions required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section is intended to affect whether the lessor or driver provided by the lessor is an independent contractor or an employee of the authorized carrier lessee.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">(\u00b6 16} We agree that there may be a question regarding the status of <em>Wyckoffs </em>irrebuttable presumption after this amendment. See <em>Hughes v. Brogan </em>(Jan. 12, 1995), 10th Dist. Nos. 94APE05-731, 94APE08-1226, 1995 WL 12110.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, we do not have to resolve that issue because <em>Wyckoff </em>is not applicable to the present case. <em>Wyckoff </em>and the federal statute that it interprets both addressed vehicles of interstate motor carriers subject to a <em>written lease. </em>In the present case, there was no written lease entered into between either Prescott or Prescott d.b.a. C &amp; R Prescott Trucking and Kemira or Great Lakes. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Therefore, <em>Wyckojf </em>does not apply and we must analyze Prescott\u2019s employment status under the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">{\u00b6 17} Under the common law, whether someone is an employee or an independent contractor is ordinarily an issue of fact. <em>Bostic v. Connor </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 144, 524 N.E.2d 881, at paragraph one of the syllabus. \u201cHowever, when there is no conflict in the evidence, or the facts are admitted, the question is one of law to be decided by the trial court.\u201d <em>Martinez v. Trimble </em>(Dec. 29,1995), 6th Dist. No. L-95-160, 1995 WL 764045, citing <em>Bostic, </em>37 Ohio St.3d at 146, 524 N.E.2d 881. \u201cThe key factual determination is who had the right to control the manner or means of doing the work.\u201d <em>Bostic </em>at paragraph one of the syllabus. In <em>Bostic, </em>the Supreme Court of Ohio stated that in determining who has the right to control the manner or means of doing the work:</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cThe factors to be considered include, but are certainly not limited to, such indicia as who controls the details and quality of the work; who controls the hours worked; who selects the materials, tools and personnel used; who selects the routes travelled [sic]; the length of employment; the type of business; the method of payment; and any pertinent agreements or contracts.\u201d Id., 37 Ohio St.3d at 146, 524 N.E.2d 881.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">{\u00b6 19} All indicia of an employment relationship in a given case must be assessed together as a whole. <em>Harmon v. Schnurmacher </em>(1992), 84 Ohio App.3d 207, 211, 616 N.E.2d 591, citing <em>Gillum v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1943), 141 Ohio St. 373, 48 N.E.2d 234.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">{\u00b6 20} Appellants concede that there are several facts that support an independent-contractor status of Prescott/Prescott d.b.a. C &amp; R Prescott Trucking. Prescott received a 1099 tax form rather than a W-2 form each year; he paid for all the maintenance, insurance, and fuel for his truck; and he was not required to take any particular route between Kemira and Great Lakes. However, appellants contend that there were several factors that pointed to an employer-employee relationship between either Kemira or Great Lakes and Prescott that were for a trier of fact to weigh and consider rather than for the trial court to decide on summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">{\u00b6 21} First, appellants point to Prescott\u2019s testimony that under the direction of Martinez, Prescott had responsibility for keeping the supply of sodium silicate at Great Lakes at an adequate level as evidence that Great Lakes controlled the manner or means of Prescott\u2019s work. Prescott testified regarding his understanding of the repercussions if he failed in that responsibility:</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cA. That\u2019s the reason why I had the job, because I took care of the man\u2019s \u2014 so at the plant he told me when he hired me, if my plant ever shuts down for lack of material because of you not being here, you won\u2019t be here no longer.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>{\u00b6 23} \u201cQ. That\u2019s what Martinez told you?</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cA. Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cQ. So he said if somehow you don\u2019t deliver the product and we have to shut down, you\u2019re done?</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cA. That\u2019s right, if somebody has to do it for you, you won\u2019t be here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">{\u00b6 27} Appellants assert that this demonstrates that Great Lakes had the right to \u201cfire\u201d Prescott. However, this does not constitute control by Great Lakes of the manner or means of Prescott doing the hauling work. See <em>Pfau v. Cincinnati Enquirer </em>(Mar. 30,1987), 12th Dist. No. CA86-03-019, 1987 WL 8935. The right to \u201cfire\u201d or \u201cterminate\u201d a person because that person did not achieve the desired <em>result </em>of the business relationship is not incompatible with an independent-contractor status. Id.; <em>Norris v. Citizens Publishing Co. </em>(Feb. 16, 1932), 2d Dist. No.2086, 1932 WL 2428. Neither is the alleged \u201crequirement\u201d that Prescott use a tanker truck to haul the sodium silicate. Neither Kemira nor Great Lakes was controlling the manner or means of Prescott\u2019s hauling work by this requirement because this was the only trucking means to haul the sodium silicate, which is a liquid.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">{\u00b6 28} Appellants also point to the bill of lading as evidence that Prescott was Kemira\u2019s \u201cagent.\u201d The bill of lading was printed at Kemira with Vinings name printed on it as \u201cshipper.\u201d When Prescott picked up a load from Kemira, he wrote the name \u201cC &amp; R Prescott Trucking\u201d on a line titled \u201cagent.\u201d This line also included the designation \u201cper\u201d after which Prescott signed his name \u201cC. Prescott.\u201d When questioned about this, Prescott testified as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cQ. We saw on that bill of lading that you signed as agent for Vinings Industries, is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b300-11\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cA. I\u2019m not an agent, I\u2019m a trucker.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-12\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cQ. You did sign the document where it said \u2018as agent,\u2019 correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b300-13\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cA. I signed it \u2014 I\u2019m as C <em>&amp; </em>R Trucking, Prescott Trucking, I signed that bill as I was the trucker.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-14\">{\u00b6 33} From the foregoing, it is clear that Prescott did not intend to sign the bill of lading as agent for Kemira/Vinings. Appellees also cite the definition of \u201cbill of lading\u201d in arguing that Prescott\u2019s signature offers no significance relative to Prescott\u2019s employment relationship with Kemira. We agree. R.C. 1301.01(F) provides, \u201c \u2018Bill of lading\u2019 means a document evidencing the receipt of goods for shipment <em>issued by a person engaged in the business of transporting </em>or forwarding goods * * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Reasonable minds could conclude only that Prescott signed the bill of lading as agent for Prescott Trucking.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>{\u00b6 34} Appellants also allege that Prescott\u2019s exclusive six-year service for Kemira and Great Lakes is a factor to be weighed in favor of Prescott\u2019s status as an employee. In support, appellants cite the recent case of <em>Mendoza v. Bishop, </em>12th Dist. No. 2004-04-080, 2005-Ohio-238, 2005 WL 123982, and <em>Harmon v. Schnurmacher </em>(1992), 84 Ohio App.3d 207, 616 N.E.2d 591, in which the worker was found to be an employee as a matter of law. However, <em>Mendoza </em>and <em>Harmon </em>involved the employment status of a horse-farm laborer and a personal nurse, respectively. Further, in <em>Harmon, </em>there were additional indicia of the nurse\u2019s status as an employee beyond merely the length and exclusivity of her service, including work hours set by the employer, hourly pay, and the existence of fringe benefits such as paid vacation and additional holiday pay. Likewise, in <em>Mendoza, </em>the additional indicia included that the laborer lived on the premises at no cost, was paid a weekly salary, and the employer supplied all the equipment and materials used in the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">{\u00b6 35} We find <em>Clouse v. Quick Air Freight, Inc. </em>(Dec. 22, 1994), 10th Dist. No. 94APE05-764, 1994 WL 714498, more relevant to the present case. <em>Clouse </em>involved summary judgment issues relative to whether a trucker was an employee rather than an independent contractor. However, in <em>Clouse, </em>the court found critical to its determination that a material issue of fact existed, the fact that under a -written lease agreement, the trucker was <em>not permitted </em>to do jobs for anyone else. In addition, the employer told the driver what repairs to make to the vehicle and required the driver to take medical exams given by a doctor selected by the employer. In contrast to <em>Clouse, </em>in the present case, there is neither a written lease agreement nor any other evidence that Prescott was <em>precluded </em>from hauling for other entities. Prescott just chose not to haul for anyone else. Further, all vehicle maintenance issues were at Prescott\u2019s discretion, and neither Kemira nor Great Lakes required any medical exams. Neither <em>Harmon, Mendoza, </em>nor <em>Clouse </em>lead this court to conclude that length of service, as a sole indicator, precludes a summary judgment finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">{\u00b6 36} Finally, appellants assert that there are several material questions of fact raised by the record that precluded summary judgment for appellees. Specifically, who recruited or \u201chired\u201d Prescott and who made the decisions relative to his rate of pay. Prescott testified that Martinez of Great Lakes initially called him concerning hauling sodium silicate. However, Martinez testified that he could not remember if he or Walden of Powers Silicates contacted Prescott about hauling the sodium silicate. Further, Prescott testified that if he needed a pay raise to cover increasing expenses, he could not recall if he contacted someone at Kemira or Martinez at Great Lakes. Ken White, sales representative at Kemira, testified that Martinez \u201cpretty much defined\u201d the freight rate to Kemira and Martinez was \u201cin control\u201d of the freight rate. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Martinez recalled Prescott raising the issue of a pay increase with him. However, Martinez did not recall renegotiating the freight rate with anyone at either Kemira or Great Lakes on Prescott\u2019s behalf. Based on this somewhat conflicting testimony, there may be a question of fact regarding which entity first contacted Prescott and which entity had the power to increase Prescott\u2019s pay. However, these questions are not material to a determination of Prescott\u2019s employment status. The fact that an entity \u201chires\u201d a driver does not preclude a finding of an independent-contractor status. See <em>Koch v. Lind </em>(1997), 121 Ohio App.3d 43, 57, 698 N.E.2d 1035. Those issues are not relevant to the critical inquiry of who had the right to control the manner or means of doing the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">{\u00b6 37} After a thorough review of the record, reasonable minds could conclude only that neither Prescott nor Prescott d.b.a. C &amp; R Prescott Trucking was an employee or agent of either Great Lakes or Kemira, because neither Great Lakes nor Kemira retained the right to direct the manner in which the transporting work was completed by Prescott. Both were merely interested in the result \u2014 that Great Lakes had a constant supply of sodium silicate. Further, the trial court did not exceed the scope of its authority under Civ.R. 56 by weighing the evidence and failing to construe the evidence most strongly in favor of appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">{\u00b6 38} Based on the foregoing, we find appellants\u2019 assignments of error not well taken. Accordingly, the judgment of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b302-7\">Singer, P.J., and Handwork, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b295-8\">.
