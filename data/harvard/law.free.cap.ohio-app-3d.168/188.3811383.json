For the reasons that follow, we hold that appellee is immune from liability pursuant to R.C. 2744.03(A)(3) and thus affirm the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">{\u00b6 2} Appellant Jessica Schnarrs was a senior at Girard High School and a member of the girls\u2019 varsity basketball team. Andy Saxon, Robin Jamison, and Nick Cochran were coaches employed by appellee, Girard Board of Education. The coaches were at the practice in question and were acting within the scope of their employment when the injury occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">{\u00b6 3} On January 19, 2003, Coach Saxon testified that he made the discretionary coaching decision to utilize recent male graduates to practice with the girls. Saxon stated that he believed using boys with sound basketball skills would improve the girls and better prepare them for stronger future opponents. One of the men selected was Chris Simmons, a former Girard varsity basketball player who stood 6\u20195\u201d and weighed 260 lbs. Jessica had practiced with boys at least once in the past but she had never practiced against Simmons. Despite Simmons\u2019s size, Jessica indicated that she was not fearful of practicing with him because no one had been previously injured, and the team\u2019s practices were well organized and designed to accomplish Coach Saxon\u2019s objectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>{\u00b6 4} During practice, Jessica was participating in a rebounding drill, the object of which was to obtain a rebound after a missed shot and throw the ball down the court to a waiting teammate. Simmons was defending Jessica at the time. After Jessica retrieved her first rebound, Simmons merely raised his arms to shield her pass. However, Jessica stated that Coach Cochran subsequently advised Simmons that he should not allow her to shoot or pass the ball; rather, according to Jessica, if she (or any girl) had the ball, Simmons was to swat the ball \u201cacross the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">{\u00b6 5} After this exchange, Jessica testified that she obtained another rebound and \u201ccocked [her] arm back to throw the ball, baseball style, across the court. As [her] throwing arm started forward, Chris Simmons stepped in front of [her], and hit the ball so hard that the force of this impact forced [her] arm back, snapping it, breaking [her] arm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">{\u00b6 6} Jessica testified that Simmons struck only the ball and, under game conditions, the contact would not result in a foul. Nonetheless, Jessica sustained a fracture of the right humerus bone.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">{\u00b6 7} On June 3, 2003, appellants filed a complaint in the Trumbull County Court of Common Pleas seeking recovery of monetary damages as a result of the coaches\u2019 negligence. On June 30, 2003, appellee filed its answer, asserting that the claims were barred by the doctrine of assumption of the risk and, in any event, appellee was immune from suit pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2744. On July 16, 2004, appellee moved for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">{\u00b6 8} On September 9, 2004, with leave from the court, appellants filed an amended complaint that included new allegations of recklessness against appellee. Also on September 9, 2004, appellee filed its answer to appellants\u2019 amended complaint. The next day, appellee filed its amended motion for summary judgment addressing appellants\u2019 additional claims. On December 29, 2004, appellants filed their motion in opposition. On March 25, 2005, the trial court conducted a hearing on appellee\u2019s motion and, on March 28, 2005, filed its judgment entry granting summary judgment in appellee\u2019s favor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellants filed a timely appeal and assert the following assignments of error for our review:</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c[1.] Assuming that the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellee board of education based on a defense of political subdivision immunity under provisions in Revised Code Chapter 2744, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>{\u00b6 10} \u201c[2.] Assuming that the trial court granted summary judgment based on the rule that individuals who engage in recreational or sports activities assume the ordinary risks of the activity, and cannot recover for any injury unless it can be shown that the other participant\u2019s actions were either \u2018reckless\u2019 or \u2018intentional,\u2019 the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c[3.] Assuming that the trial court based the granting of summary judgment under the rule that as between participants in a sporting event only injuries caused by intentional conduct, or in some instances by reckless misconduct may give rise to a cause of action, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on that basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">{\u00b6 12} Summary judgment is appropriate under Civ.R. 56(C) when (1) there is no genuine issue of material fact remaining to be litigated, (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and viewing the evidence in favor of the nonmoving party, that conclusion favors the moving party. <em>Temple v. Wean United, Inc. </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 317, 327, 4 O.O.3d 466, 364 N.E.2d 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">{\u00b6 13} Summary judgment proceedings afford an appellate court the unique opportunity of reviewing the evidence in the same manner as the trial court. <em>Petersheim v. Corum, </em>158 Ohio App.3d 377, 815 N.E.2d 1132, 2004-Ohio-4297, \u00b6 9, citing <em>Smiddy v. Wedding Party, Inc. </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St.3d 35, 36, 30 OBR 78, 506 N.E.2d 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">{\u00b6 14} Appellants\u2019 first assignment of error challenges the viability of appellee\u2019s assertion of immunity R.C. Chapter 2744.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">{\u00b6 15} In <em>Frazier v. Kent, </em>11th Dist. Nos. 2004-P-0077 and 2004-P-0096, 2005-Ohio-5413, 2005 WL 2542940, at \u00b6 20, we stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cR.C. Chapter 2744 sets forth a three tiered analysis for determining a political subdivision\u2019s immunity from liability. <em>Greene Cty. Agricultural Soc. v. Liming </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 551, 556 [733 N.E.2d 1141]. First, R.C. 2744.02(A)(1) codifies the general rule of sovereign immunity, viz., that \u2018a political subdivision is not liable in damages in a civil action for injury, death, or loss to person or property allegedly caused by any act or omission of the political subdivision or an employee of the political subdivision in connection with a governmental or proprietary function.\u2019 However, this general rule is limited by R.C. 2744.02(B), which sets forth five instances in which a political subdivision is not immune. Hence, the second tier of the analysis requires a court to determine whether any of the exceptions under R.C. 2744.02(B) apply. Finally, if a political subdivision is exposed to liability through the application of R.C. 2744.02(B), a court must consider whether the political subdivision could legitimately assert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>any of the defenses or immunities under R.C. 2744.03. See, e.g., <em>Greene Cty. Agricultural Soc., </em>supra, at 557 [733 N.E.2d 1141].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">{\u00b6 17} We begin our analysis by noting that a school district is a \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d as defined by R.C. 2744.01(F). Accordingly, it is generally not liable for injuries caused by the acts or omissions of its employees. R.C. 2744.02(A)(1). However, R.C. 2744.02(B)(4) provides that political subdivisions are liable for injuries \u201ccaused by the negligence of their employees and [occurring] within or on the grounds of, and * * * due to physical defects within or on the grounds of, buildings that are used in connection with the performance of a governmental function.\u201d In its brief, appellee does not dispute that the injury in question occurred in connection with the performance of a governmental function. The focal issue under appellants\u2019 first assignment of error is whether summary judgment was proper after considering the defenses and immunities asserted by appellee under R.C. 2744.03(A)(3) and (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">{\u00b6 18} We shall first address appellants\u2019 argument as it pertains to R.C. 2744.03(A)(5). The statute provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cThe political subdivision is immune from liability if the injury * * * resulted from the exercise of judgment or discretion in determining whether to acquire, or how to use, equipment, supplies, materials, personnel, facilities, and other resources unless the judgment or discretion was exercised with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">{\u00b6 20} Here, the trial court could not render summary judgment against appellants based upon R.C. 2744.03(A)(5). First, we believe that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether the political subdivision, under the current facts, was utilizing \u201cequipment, supplies, materials, personnel, facilities, and other resources.\u201d The injury was a result of the use of young men who had already graduated from high school. We do not see how the young men in question, including Chris Simmons, could be classified as equipment, supplies, materials, facilities, or resources. The question therefore becomes whether Simmons and his fellow recent graduates were \u201cpersonnel\u201d who were subject to the discretion of the political subdivision. The record indicates that the boys were voluntary participants in the practice; because Simmons was not an employee of the political subdivision, e.g., a member of the coaching staff, we cannot unequivocally say that he qualifies as \u201cpersonnel.\u201d Accordingly, we hold that immunity cannot attach under R.C. 2744.03(A)(5) as a matter of law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>{\u00b6 21} However, our analysis does not end here. While we hold that the trial court could not award appellee summary judgment based upon R.C. 2744.03(A)(5), we must nevertheless consider the viability of the defense set forth under R.C. 2744.03(A)(3). R.C. 2744.03(A)(3) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cThe political subdivision is immune from liability if the action or failure to act by the employee involved that gave rise to the claim of liability was within the discretion of the employee with respect to policy-making, planning, or enforcement powers by virtue of the duties and responsibilities of the office or position of the employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">{\u00b623} Appellants contend that R.C. 2744.03(A)(3) does not protect appellee under the circumstances because the coaches, in organizing the practice session, did not have the requisite discretion. Appellants, citing <em>Enghauser Mfg. Co. v. Eriksson Eng. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 31, 6 OBR 53, 451 N.E.2d 228, maintain:</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">{\u00b6 24} R.C. 2744.03(A)(3) \u201cprovide[s] a political subdivision with a defense against liability for acts or omissions involving the exercise of a legislative or judicial function or the exercise of an executive or planning function involving policy-making characterized by the exercise of a high degree of discretion. Once a political subdivision has made a decision to engage in a certain activity or function, the subdivision will be held liable the same as private corporations and persons for the negligence of their employees and agents in the performance of the activity.\u201d See <em>Enghauser, </em>paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">{\u00b6 25} Appellants\u2019 reliance on <em>Enghauser </em>is peculiar. <em>Enghauser </em>was decided before R.C. Chapter 2744 was enacted. <em>Enghauser </em>held that a political subdivision is immune from liability under certain circumstances when the discretion afforded the decisionmaker is of a \u201chigh degree.\u201d R.C. 2744.03(A)(3) does not explicitly require a specific quantity or quality of discretion (\u201chigh degree\u201d or otherwise) as a precondition for asserting its defense. Additionally, <em>Enghauser, </em>in conjunction with <em>Haverlack v. Portage Homes, Inc. </em>(1982), 2 Ohio St.3d 26, 2 OBR 572, 442 N.E.2d 749, abolished the common-law doctrine of sovereign immunity for municipal corporations subject to certain exceptions related to the exercise of governmental discretion. <em>Haynes v. Franklin, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 344, 2002-Ohio-2334, 767 N.E.2d 1146. These problems notwithstanding, appellants nevertheless contend that the substantive principles set forth in <em>Enghauser </em>animate determinations regarding whether the discretion defense of R.C. 2744.03(A)(3) is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>{\u00b6 26} Although discussion on this proposition is scarce, our research reveals that <em>Leach v. Dayton </em>(1994), 98 Ohio App.3d 467, 648 N.E.2d 895, lends some support to appellants\u2019 position. In <em>Leach, </em>the Second Appellate District stated that the exception to immunity set forth in <em>Enghauser </em>\u201cwas in effect codified in R.C. 2744.03(A)(3).\u201d Id. at 470, 648 N.E.2d 895. While we do not disagree that the holding in <em>Enghauser </em>was a prototype of the codified defense set forth in R.C. 2744.03(A)(3), we believe that the language in <em>Enghauser </em>is significantly narrower than that of the superseding statute. In effect, <em>Enghauser </em>cannot be a comprehensive guide for interpreting R.C. 2744.03(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">{\u00b6 27} <em>Enghauser </em>conditions immunity (or the lack thereof) upon the acts or omissions of a <em>\u201cmunicipal corporation </em>* * * involving the exercise of a legislative or judicial function or the exercise of an executive or planning function involving the making of a basic policy decision which is characterized by the exercise of a high degree of official judgment or discretion.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus. Alternatively, R.C. 2744.03(A)(3) vouchsafes immunity to a \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d when the acts or omissions giving rise to liability were within the discretion of an employee with respect to policies, planning, or enforcement powers of his or her position.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">{\u00b6 28} Under <em>Enghauser, </em>immunity may attach only to municipal corporations. R.C. 703.01(A) defines a municipal corporation as either a city or a village. Alternatively, R.C. 2744.03(A)(3) provides immunity to employees of political subdivisions. A political subdivision includes, but is not limited to, municipal corporations. Therefore, while the holding in <em>Enghauser </em>may be instructive for determining whether a municipal corporation is entitled to immunity, we do not believe that <em>Enghauser </em>can be used as the definitive basis for interpreting R.C. 2744.03(A)(3). In our view, therefore, appellants\u2019 insistence that <em>Enghauser </em>sets forth the interpretive parameters of R.C. 2744.03(A)(3) is ill founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">{\u00b6 29} That said, Coach Saxon\u2019s affidavit demonstrates that he had significant discretion in managing the general affairs of the girls\u2019 basketball team. Saxon testified that he was responsible for the manner in which team practices were conducted and the strategies used to prepare for games:</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cAs Head Coach I am responsible for the conduct, control, and supervision of the Girard Girls Varsity Team practices. It is within my discretion as the Head Coach to conduct the team\u2019s practices and to develop strategies to prepare them for their games.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">{\u00b6 31} Saxon\u2019s affidavit continued:</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cI made the coaching decision to use boys who have good basketball skills and experience to assist with the Girard Girls\u2019 Varsity Team practice conducted on January 19, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>{\u00b6 33} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cIt had been my experience as Head Coach of the Girard Girls\u2019 Varsity Team that the skill brought by the boys when they practiced with the girls helped the team improve and better prepare for upcoming games.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">{\u00b6 35} Saxon\u2019s testimony indicates that he was vested with significant discretion in managing the affairs of the girls\u2019 varsity basketball team such that his actions could be reasonably construed as involving the type of discretion contemplated by R.C. 2744.03(A)(3). Even were we to accept appellants\u2019 contention that R.C. 2744.03(A)(3) requires a \u201ca high degree of judgment or discretion,\u201d we believe that Saxon\u2019s affidavit would support such a finding under the circumstances. Hence, appellants\u2019 argument is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">{\u00b6 36} Appellants further argue that R.C. 2744.03(A)(3) requires \u201ca decision which (1) is in the nature of a basic planning and policy making function, and (2) the decision must be one that involves a policy making activity at the heart of governance of the subdivision that is an essential act of governmental decision making.\u201d In support of this contention, appellants cite <em>C &amp; D Partnership v. Gahanna </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 359, 15 OBR 480, 474 N.E.2d 303, another case decided before R.C. Chapter 2744 was enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">{\u00b6 37} In <em>C &amp; D Partnership, </em>the Supreme Court, citing <em>Enghauser, </em>held that a municipal corporation was immune from tort liability for approving a subdivision plat to the extent that it involved sound policymaking considerations. The court underscored that such policymaking activities were at the heart of municipal governance and further emphasized that its decision was confined to the facts before it. Although <em>C &amp; D Partnership </em>might be usefully analogized to situations where a claimant is questioning a municipal corporation on its engineering decisions or policy determinations regarding urban development, we do not believe that its holding is applicable to the instant facts. Accordingly, we hold that both <em>Enghauser </em>and <em>C &amp; D Partnership </em>offer no useful guidance for our analysis given the facts of the instant case. Appellants\u2019 arguments to the contrary are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">{\u00b6 38} Finally, appellants argue that a political subdivision may not retain immunity when an injury is occasioned by the negligence of its employees in the course of implementing a previously adopted policy or plan. See <em>Franks v. Lopez </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 345, 349, 632 N.E.2d 502, citing <em>Winwood v. Dayton </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 282, 525 N.E.2d 808.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>{\u00b6 39} In <em>Franks, </em>the court assessed whether a political subdivision may be liable for failing to keep its roadways free from nuisance as a result of its failure to maintain an allegedly dangerous intersection. Id. at 346, 632 N.E.2d 502. The court found that an allegedly defective design and construction of the intersection as well as the failure to erect proper signage did not constitute a nuisance within the meaning of R.C. 2744.02(B)(3) and the political subdivision was accordingly immune from suit on such claims. Id. at 351, 632 N.E.2d 502. In its discussion, however, the court indicated that \u201c[w]hile the installation of traffic control devices by a political subdivision may be discretionary pursuant to the [Ohio Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways], once the decision to install has been made, the implementation of that decision is not immune from liability.\u201d Id. at 349, 632 N.E.2d 502, citing <em>Winwood, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">{\u00b6 40} Here, appellants maintain that appellee may not assert immunity under R.C. 2744.03(A)(3) because Jessica\u2019s injury was a result of Saxon\u2019s negligence \u201cin [the] implementation of the policy or plan to use young men in practice games as opponents of the girls\u2019 varsity basketball team.\u201d Appellants\u2019 argument, while innovative, fails to elucidate the \u201cpreviously adopted policy\u201d that Mr. Saxon, as head girls\u2019 basketball coach, was implementing when the injury in question occurred. There is no evidence that appellee prescribed a policy governing the manner in which varsity practices would be conducted. Appellants\u2019 reliance on <em>Franks </em>and <em>Winwood </em>is therefore misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">{\u00b6 41} Saxon testified that he had nearly unchecked discretion to conduct practices and develop strategies to prepare the girls\u2019 basketball team for games. Discretion, under R.C. 2744.03(A)(3), has been defined as \u201c \u2018some positive exercise of judgment that portrays a considered adoption of a particular course of conduct in relation to an object to be achieved * * *.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pope v. Trotwood-Madison City School Dist. Bd. of Edn., </em>2d Dist. No. 20072, 2004-Ohio-1314, 2004 WL 541121, at \u00b6 23, quoting <em>Addis v. Howell </em>(2000), 137 Ohio App.3d 54, 60, 738 N.E.2d 37. In <em>Pope, </em>a student was injured and ultimately died after an injury sustained during an \u201copen gym\u201d session. The session was supervised by a basketball coach and his assistant. After reviewing the coach\u2019s affidavits, the court determined that the supervision of the basketball games evinced the kind of judgment and consideration that would constitute the exercise of discretion under R.C. 2744.03(A)(3). Id. at \u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">{\u00b6 42} In <em>Starkey v. Hartzler </em>(Mar. 26, 1997), 9th Dist. No. 96CA0048, 1997 WL 197202, a middle-school football player was injured while being disciplined by his coach. The coach testified, by way of affidavit, that he was given discretion \u201cto set the rules for conduct of the players and to impose discipline\u201d and that he was \u201cresponsible for maintaining order during [the] practices and seeing that the practices [were] productive with a minimum of distraction and interference by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>players.\u201d Id. at 6, 1997 WL 197202. After reviewing the surrounding facts, the court determined that the methods employed by the coach to discipline his young-players involved the kind of discretion contemplated by R.C. 2744.03(A)(3). Id. Accordingly, the court held that the school district was entitled to immunity pursuant to R.C. 2744.03(A)(3).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">{\u00b6 43} When observed in light of the foregoing holdings, we believe that the practice methods used by Saxon and his assistants were a product of the type of discretion contemplated by R.C. 2744.03(A)(3). Saxon\u2019s affidavit indicates that he had the discretion to conduct practices and set strategies in a manner that would best prepare the team for games. Saxon averred that in his experience, using boys in practice both improved the girls\u2019 skills and better prepared them for upcoming games. Accordingly, we adopt the Second Appellate District\u2019s conception of discretion set forth in <em>Pope, </em>supra. In this respect, we believe that Saxon\u2019s determination to use male players during girls\u2019 basketball practices demonstrated a positive exercise of judgment and a considered adoption of a particular course of conduct to achieve an object, viz., improving skills for upcoming games. Thus, the school district cannot be held liable, because Saxon, by virtue of his position, had the discretion to plan and conduct practices. See, e.g., <em>Starkey.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">{\u00b6 44} Appellants\u2019 first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">{\u00b6 45} Immunity under R.C. Chapter 2744 is primary and serves to shield appellee from suit pertaining to the instant injury. Accordingly, we need not address appellants\u2019 second and third assignments of error relating to appellee\u2019s defense of assumption of the risk. Our resolution of appellants\u2019 first assignment of error renders appellants\u2019 second and third assignments of error moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">{\u00b6 46} For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Trumbull County Court of Common Pleas is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>Ford, P.J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b228-4\">O\u2019Toole, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b220-10\">. Appellants\u2019 complaint was filed against various defendants including appellee and the three coaches present at the practice session leading to Jessica\u2019s injury. It bears noting, however, that the defendant coaches are not parties to the instant appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b222-9\">. This court's decision in <em>Elston v. Howland Local Schools, </em>11th Dist. No. 2004-T-0092, 2005-Ohio-4765, 2005 WL 2210705, supports the foregoing outcome. In <em>Elston, </em>this court cited <em>Kiep v. Hamilton </em>(May 19, 1997), 12th Dist. No. 96-08-158, 1997 WL 264236, for the proposition that R.C. 2744.03(A)(5) cannot confer immunity upon a political subdivision for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>the actions of its employees because the language of the statute indicates that the legislature intended the immunity to extend only to the acts of a political subdivision and not to the acts of its employees. It is worth noting that the conclusions reached in <em>Elston </em>are under review by the Ohio Supreme Court. See <em>Elston v. Howland Local Schools, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 1697, 2005-Ohio-6763, 840 N.E.2d 203.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b225-10\">.
