Kidd contends that the trial court erred in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing on his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-15\">{\u00b6 2} Accordingly, the order of the trial court is reversed, and this cause is remanded for an evidentiary hearing on Kidd\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b413-17\">{\u00b6 3} In January, 2003, David Kidd was indicted on one count of engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity, one count of possession of crack cocaine, six counts of trafficking in crack cocaine, and five counts of possession of criminal tools. Pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, Kidd pleaded guilty in May 2003 to two counts of trafficking in crack cocaine, thereby admitting that he knowingly sold, or offered to sell, crack cocaine in an amount exceeding five grams, but less than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>ten grams, within 1,000 feet of a school. In exchange, the state agreed to dismiss the remaining counts. After a hearing, the trial court sentenced Kidd in accordance with an agreed sentence to a mandatory five-year prison term on each count, to be served consecutively for a total prison term of ten years, a mandatory fine of $7,500 on each count, for a total fine of $15,000, a five-year driver\u2019s license suspension, and a forfeiture of a 1987 Camaro and $1,474 in cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">{\u00b6 4} Kidd appealed, and we affirmed his conviction and sentence. <em>State v. Kidd, </em>Clark App. No. 03CA43, 2004-Ohio-6784, 2004 WL 2903886. We overruled his assignment of error relating to ineffective assistance of counsel, holding as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cEntry of a voluntary guilty plea waives ineffective assistance of counsel claims except to the extent that counsel\u2019s performance causes the waiver of Defendant\u2019s trial rights and the entry of his plea to be less than knowing and voluntary. That is not the claim made here. Thus, Defendant\u2019s guilty pleas waived the error he now assigns.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id. at \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">{\u00b6 6} Thereafter, Kidd filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea pursuant to Crim.R. 32.1, arguing that his plea was not knowing and voluntary due to ineffective assistance of counsel. Kidd claimed that he would not have pleaded guilty had he known that lab reports indicated that the amount of crack cocaine recovered was less than five grams. Kidd claimed that defense counsel had failed to inform him of the lab reports or to make a discovery request to obtain the lab reports. Kidd claimed that he did not find out about the lab reports until after he pleaded guilty. Kidd requested an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">{\u00b6 7} Without a hearing, the trial court overruled Kidd\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. From the trial court\u2019s order overruling his motion to withdraw his guilty plea, Kidd appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">{\u00b6 8} Kidd\u2019s sole assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b414-11\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe trial court erred in failing to order an evidentiary hearing on appellant\u2019s motion to withdraw guilty plea[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-12\">{\u00b6 10} Kidd contends that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to withdraw his guilty plea without an evidentiary hearing. Kidd contends that an evidentiary hearing is necessary to show that his plea was not knowing and voluntary due to the ineffectiveness of trial counsel. He contends that defense counsel failed to inform him of the lab reports or to make a discovery request to obtain the lab reports. Kidd contends that he would not have pleaded guilty to two counts of trafficking in crack cocaine in an amount exceeding five grams had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>he known that the lab reports indicated the amount of crack cocaine to be less than five grams.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"> {\u00b6 11} Crim.R. 32.1 provides that a trial court may set aside a conviction and allow a defendant to withdraw his guilty plea after his sentence to correct a manifest injustice. The defendant has the burden of establishing that a manifest injustice exists, which requires a showing of extraordinary circumstances. <em>State v. Von Allmen, </em>Greene App. No. 2004-CA-51, 2005-Ohio-1384, 2005 WL 681296, at \u00b6 11. \u201cA hearing on a post-sentence motion to withdraw a plea is required if the facts alleged by the defendant and accepted as true would require the court to permit that plea to be withdrawn.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">{\u00b6 12} Kidd alleges that his defense counsel was ineffective for failing to inform him of the lab reports or to make a discovery request to obtain the lab reports and that had he known of the lab reports, he would not have pleaded guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cIn order to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>State v. Stevens, </em>Montgomery App. No. 19572, 2003-Ohio-6249, 2003 WL 22764527, at \u00b6 33, citing <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674; <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 142, 538 N.E.2d 373. \u201cEntry of a voluntary guilty plea waives ineffective assistance of counsel claims except to the extent that counsel\u2019s performance causes the waiver of Defendant\u2019s trial rights and the entry of his plea to be less than knowing and voluntary.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Kidd, </em>2004-Ohio-6784, 2004 WL 2903886, at \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">{\u00b6 14} The record does not reflect that Kidd\u2019s counsel made a discovery request for the lab reports. The record also does not contain any information regarding the lab reports prior to Kidd\u2019s guilty plea. Kidd alleges that he did not find out about the lab reports until after his guilty plea, when his girlfriend received the lab reports from his counsel and mailed the lab reports to Kidd in prison. Kidd attached his girlfriend\u2019s affidavit to his motion to withdraw his guilty plea, in which she averred that she mailed the lab reports to Kidd on July 21, 2003, approximately two months after his guilty plea in May 2003. If defense counsel failed to inform Kidd of the lab reports, Kidd\u2019s plea was less than knowing and voluntary. It is plausible that Kidd may have decided to take his chances at trial had he known the results of the lab reports when he pleaded guilty. Kidd\u2019s claims may ultimately be found to be without merit, either because the evidence that he <em>offered </em>to sell in excess of five grams of cocaine was so compelling that the fact that the cocaine recovered was less than five grams would have been inconsequential, or because Kidd would, in fact, have accepted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>the plea bargain anyway. Nevertheless, we conclude that Kidd\u2019s claims are sufficiently plausible, and find sufficient support in the record and in his girlfriend\u2019s affidavit, that they require an evidentiary hearing before they may be summarily overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">{\u00b6 15} Kidd\u2019s sole assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">{\u00b6 16} Kidd\u2019s sole assignment of error having been sustained, the order of the trial court overruling his motion to vacate his plea is reversed, and this cause is remanded for an evidentiary hearing on the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b416-8\">Wolff and Glasser, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b416-9\">George Glasser, J., retired, of the Sixth Appellate District, sitting by assignment.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
