Painter, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">{\u00b6 1} Does inchoate dower pass to a bankruptcy trustee who settles a fraudulent-transfer issue with the debtor, when the debtor has signed a mortgage (but not the note underlying it) while his bankruptcy remains open in another state\u2014 which the debtor has conveniently failed to tell the mortgagee \u2014 and then pass back to the debtor when his bankruptcy is closed, thus allowing him to be paid for his dower interest when his wife defaults on the mortgage? Even ahead of the bank?</p>\n<p id=\"b46-11\">{\u00b6 2} We think not. We do not believe the law requires \u2014 or should even allow \u2014 the proposed result.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-12\">\n<em>I. The Mortgage</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b46-13\">{\u00b6 3} In December 2001, defendants-appellants Scott and Kimberly Staff signed a $910,000 mortgage for 8050 Kugler Mill Road (\u201cthe Kugler property\u201d) to plaintiff-appellee Standard Federal Bank\u2019s predecessor in interest, ABN AMRO Mortgage Group. (To avoid confusion, we refer to the Staffs by their first names.) In the year preceding this mortgage, Scott (1) had signed a quitclaim deed for his one-half interest in the property to Kimberly, (2) had filed for bankruptcy in Florida, (3) had settled a fraudulent-transfer claim with the bankruptcy trustee on the quitclaim transfer, and (4) had his debt discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>{\u00b6 4} After Kimberly defaulted on the mortgage payments, Standard Federal foreclosed on the property in June 2003. Because Scott\u2019s bankruptcy had not been terminated, Scott argues that his dower interest in the property was part of the bankruptcy estate and not subject to transfer. Scott argues that when the bankruptcy case was closed in September 2003, he regained his dower interest in the property. Scott thus claims that he is entitled to an amount equal to the value of his dower interest in the property. And not having relinquished his dower interest, he concludes that he should be paid before the bank collects on its mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">\n<em>II. A Fraudulent Transfer?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">{\u00b6 5} On February 5, 2001, Scott filed for bankruptcy protection in Florida. Alan Goldberg served as the trustee in the case until its closure. During September 2001, Goldberg discovered that Scott had quitclaimed his undivided one-half interest in the Kugler property to his wife, Kimberly, in November 2000, three months before petitioning for bankruptcy protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">{\u00b6 6} Scott had not disclosed any assets in Ohio when he filed his Florida bankruptcy case. Goldberg decided that despite Scott\u2019s conveyance of all his interest in the Kugler property, Scott had continued to reside at the property, make mortgage payments, receive mail, and otherwise act as if the property was his home. Goldberg then moved to have the property appraised as part of Scott\u2019s bankruptcy estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">{\u00b6 7} Scott and Kimberly negotiated a settlement with Goldberg in which they agreed to pay $105,000 in three installments to satisfy any claims of the bankruptcy estate related to the property. Goldberg then moved to have the court approve the settlement \u2014 thereby setting a schedule for Scott\u2019s debt repayment. The bankruptcy court approved the compromise on November 15, 2001, and Scott\u2019s debt was discharged on December 4, 2001. (But Scott\u2019s bankruptcy case was not terminated until September 2003.)</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">{\u00b6 8} Eight days later, on December 12, 2001, Kimberly mortgaged the Kugler property for $910,000 to Standard Federal\u2019s predecessor in interest, ABN Amro Mortgage Group. While only Kimberly signed the promissory note, both Scott and Kimberly signed the mortgage agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">{\u00b6 9} The terms of the mortgage agreement included the following: \u201c12. Joint and Several Liability; Co-signors; Successors and Assigns Bound. Borrower covenants and agrees that Borrower\u2019s obligations and liability shall be joint and several. However, any Borrower that co-signs this Security Instrument but does not execute the Note (a \u201cco-signer\u201d): (a) is co-signing this Security Instrument only to <em>mortgage, grant and convey the co-signer\u2019s interest in the Property under the terms of this Security Instrument; </em>(b) is not personally obligated to pay the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>sums secured by the Security Instrument; and (c) agrees that Lender and any other Borrower can agree to extend, modify, forbear or make any accommodations with regard to the terms of this Security Instrument or Note without the co-signer\u2019s consent.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">{\u00b6 10} In June 2003, Standard Federal filed for foreclosure on the property after Kimberly defaulted on the mortgage payments. Scott\u2019s defense to the foreclosure was that he was the \u201cowner of a dower interest, free and clear, in the subject premises.\u201d Scott argued that although he was discharged from bankruptcy in November 2001, his bankruptcy case was not closed until September 2003. He contended that his dower interest in the property was part of the bankruptcy estate when he signed the mortgage agreement and thus was not subject to transfer at the time the mortgage was signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">{\u00b6 11} Scott argued that his signing of the mortgage before his bankruptcy case was terminated was an attempt to convey an interest in the property that was part of his bankruptcy estate \u2014 a violation of the bankruptcy rules. He was thus attempting to profit from his own bad act. He further contended that Standard Federal violated the automatic stay provision of Section 362, Title 11, U.S.Code when it filed the foreclosure complaint against Scott and sought to foreclose on his dower interest while the bankruptcy case was still open. Of course, Standard Federal did not then know about the Florida bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">{\u00b6 12} After Standard Federal added Goldberg as a party to the proceedings, Scott filed a cross-claim against Goldberg. Scott claimed that Goldberg had abandoned his dower interest to him or, in the alternative, that if Goldberg was found to have any interest in the property, it then belonged to Scott after the closing of the bankruptcy case. A default judgment was entered in Scott\u2019s favor in July 2004, after Goldberg failed to respond to Scott\u2019s cross-claim and motion for default judgment. Of course, Scott\u2019s attempted service on Goldberg by certified mail never reached Goldberg because Scott used an incorrect address.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">{\u00b6 13} Standard Federal then moved to have the court set aside the default judgment against Goldberg and moved a second time for summary judgment against the Staffs. The magistrate set aside Scott\u2019s default judgment against Goldberg and dismissed all claims against Goldberg. The magistrate then granted Standard Federal\u2019s summary-judgment motion. After the parties filed their objections, the trial court adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">{\u00b6 14} The Staffs now appeal, arguing that the trial court erred by (1) granting Standard Federal\u2019s renewed motion for summary judgment, because Scott did not have title to his dower interest while his bankruptcy case was still pending and thus could not convey his dower interest by signing the mortgage and (2) granting Standard Federal\u2019s motion to set aside Scott\u2019s default judgment against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>Goldberg, because Standard Federal had no standing to seek relief from a default judgment entered against Goldberg.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">\n<em>III. Summary Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">{\u00b6 15} We review grants of summary judgment de novo, without deference to the trial court\u2019s ruling.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Summary judgment should be granted only when (1) there is no genuine issue of material fact; (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can only come to a conclusion adverse to the nonmoving party, when viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A party moving for summary judgment bears the initial burden of showing that no genuine issue of material fact exists, and once it has satisfied its burden, the nonmoving party has a reciprocal burden to set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">\n<em>TV. Dower Interests</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">{\u00b6 16} A dower interest is an interest in real estate that is intended to protect a non-title-holding spouse. It has been a bane to real estate professionals, lenders, and first-year law students for eons. It is a dour subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">{\u00b6 17} But we need to return to the times of lords and fiefs to understand dower interests. In feudal times, land was the chief form of wealth and provided the power base for the head of the family.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, the common law created the marital life estate of dower to protect a widow from disinheritance by her husband.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Dower provided a lifetime protection for the widow consisting of a one-third interest in the real estate titled to the husband during the marriage.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cThe extreme subordination of the wife at common law required that some form of protection from disinheritance be given to her upon the death of her husband, for often she was deemed unable or unqualified to venture from the home into a world run almost exclusively by men.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>{\u00b6 18} In the United States, marital life estates started to be revised during the last half of the 19th century, when states enacted the Married Women\u2019s Property Acts, graciously allowing married women to own property.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> And beginning in 1930 with the state of New York, common-law states gradually abolished dower and turned to a system based on protecting a spouse\u2019s interest in a decedent\u2019s entire estate.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In fact, the great majority of states have now abolished dower, as has the Model Probate Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">{\u00b6 19} Of course, Ohio is in the tiny minority of states that still recognize dower interests.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In fact, there seem to be only three other states that still recognize dower: Arkansas,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Kentucky,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and Michigan.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">{\u00b6 20} In Ohio, a dower interest is described in this way: \u201c[A] spouse who has not relinquished or been barred from it shall be endowed of an estate for life in one-third of the real property of which the consort was seized as an estate of inheritance at any time during the marriage.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In other words, either spouse is entitled to a one-third dower interest in real property unless it has been relinquished or barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">{\u00b6 21} Under this doctrine, whenever a married person buys real estate in Ohio, the married person\u2019s spouse automatically receives a dower interest. Thus any document that intends to convey or mortgage an interest in the property is not effective as to the non-title-holding spouse\u2019s dower interest unless that spouse has also signed the document.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">{\u00b6 22} Dower has always existed in Ohio. Ohio has not abolished it as unnecessary, probably for the reason the rest of the \u201cRevised\u201d Code mainly remains unchanged \u2014 inertia. The present language \u2014 including the eccentric word \u201cconsort\u201d for spouse \u2014 has remained unchanged for at least 107 years.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Dower can create odd situations, as in the following case:</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>{\u00b6 23} \u201cThe plaintiff alleges that she was married to Harry Hickok in 1832, that he died in 1866, that during their coverture he was seized of an estate of inheritance in the lands described in the petition, that the defendant is now seized of the lands, and prays for the assignment of her dower therein. The defendant admits that the facts stated in the petition are true; but he alleges in bar of the plaintiffs claim, that in 1851 she obtained a decree of divorce from the said Hickok, whereby the bonds of matrimony existing between them were dissolved, and that, afterwards, she married one Denison Lamkin, who died before the said Hickok, whereby she became the widow of the said Lamkin, and is not the widow of the said Hickok. He further avers that after the divorce, the said Hickok married another wife, who survives him, and is now his widow.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">{\u00b6 24} At least here, we have the intersection of only dower and bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">\n<em>V. A Novel Argument, i.e., Fit for a Novel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">{\u00b6 25} The Staffs\u2019 first assignment of error challenges the trial court grant of summary judgment to Standard Federal. The Staffs maintain that Scott did not have title to his dower interest before his bankruptcy case was terminated and, therefore, could not convey his dower interest when he signed the mortgage. The Staffs instead believe that Scott\u2019s dower interest in the property became a part of his bankruptcy estate and could not be conveyed without the approval of the bankruptcy court. Then when the bankruptcy was closed, Scott reacquired the dower interest. Of course, Scott tried to convey it anyway when he signed the mortgage, but he now asserts that his signature was ineffective because, unbeknownst to the mortgagee, he was in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">{\u00b6 26} In rebuttal, Standard Federal argues that (1) Goldberg\u2019s settlement with Kimberly and Scott concerning the Kugler property before the Standard Federal loan closing enabled Scott to grant a valid and enforceable mortgage; (2) even if Scott\u2019s dower interest was not his until it was \u201cabandoned\u201d to him after the bankruptcy case terminated, the effect of that \u201cabandonment\u201d under federal bankruptcy law was to restore Standard Federal and Scott to their respective rights as if the bankruptcy case had never been filed, thus retroactively ratifying Scott\u2019s prior conveyance to Standard Federal; (3) Scott was barred from contending that his conveyance to Standard Federal was ineffective at the time of the loan closing by Ohio\u2019s Doctrine of After-Acquired Property; and (4) Scott was equitably estopped by his concealment of his pending bankruptcy from denying the enforceability of his conveyance to Standard Federal.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>\n<em>VI. Bankruptcy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">{\u00b6 27} Commencing a bankruptcy case creates an estate comprised of all the debtor\u2019s legal or equitable interests in property as of the date the petition in bankruptcy is filed.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">{\u00b6 28} The federal bankruptcy courts in both the southern and northern districts of Ohio have previously held that inchoate dower is a recognizable interest in real estate.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Also, when the spouse alleged to have an inchoate dower is the debtor, the dower interest becomes the property of the estate.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">{\u00b6 29} Thus, it is well settled in Ohio that a dower interest can be measured and included in a bankruptcy estate.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In the present case, since Scott had not relinquished his dower interest and had not been barred from exercising it, his dower interest became a part of his bankruptcy estate at the time he filed for bankruptcy protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">{\u00b6 30} The issue before us now is what happened to Scott\u2019s dower interest after it entered his bankruptcy estate. And what happened when he came out of bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">\n<em>VII. Automatic Stays for Property in Bankruptcy Estate</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">{\u00b6 31} Under Section 362(a)(3), Title 11, U.S.Code, \u201cany act to obtain possession of property * * * from the estate or to exercise control over property of the estate\u201d is automatically stayed by the bankruptcy filing. Thus, for Standard Federal to attempt to foreclose and repossess the property that Scott maintained a dower interest in, it would have needed to petition for relief from the automatic stay or the property would have to have been abandoned from the bankruptcy estate. Section 362(d), Title 11, U.S.Code states, \u201cOn request of a party in interest and after notice and a hearing, the court shall grant relief from the stay provided under subsection (a) of this section, such as by terminating, annulling, modifying, or conditioning such stay \u2014 (1) for caus\u00e9, including the lack of adequate protection of an interest in property of such party in interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-11\">{\u00b6 32} Standard Federal could have petitioned the bankruptcy court for relief from the automatic stay. But Standard Federal did not attempt to do so \u2014 mainly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>because it did not know that Scott had filed for bankruptcy in Florida. Scott had concealed that detail \u2014 and signed the mortgage anyway.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">\n<em>VIII. Abandoned Property</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">{\u00b6 33} So the issue becomes whether Scott\u2019s dower interest was abandoned by the bankruptcy estate. Standard Federal maintains that when Scott and Kimberly negotiated a settlement with Goldberg whereby they agreed to pay $105,000 in three installments to satisfy any claims of the bankruptcy estate related to the Kugler property on November 15, 2001, Scott\u2019s dower interest was released back to him. Standard Federal thus believes that when Scott cosigned the mortgage document 27 days later, he was able to convey his dower interest. Scott instead contends that he did not have title to his dower interest before his bankruptcy case was terminated and, therefore, could not convey his dower interest when he executed the mortgage agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">{\u00b6 34} Under Section 554, Title 11, U.S.Code, the bankruptcy-estate property is abandoned under the following circumstances: \u201c(a) After notice and a hearing, the trustee may abandon any property of the estate that is burdensome to the estate or that is of inconsequential value and benefit to the estate, (b) On request of a party in interest and after notice and a hearing, the court may order the trustee to abandon any property of the estate that is burdensome to the estate or that is of inconsequential value and benefit to the estate, (c) Unless the court orders otherwise, any property scheduled under section 521(1) of this title not otherwise administered at the time of the closing of a case is abandoned to the debtor and administered for purposes of section 350 of this title.\u201d In this case, Scott\u2019s dower interest in the property was abandoned at the close of the case under Section 554(c), Title 11, U.S.Code, because a settlement was reached whereby the Staffs paid $105,000 to satisfy any claims against the Kugler property, and because the dower interest in the property was not otherwise administered.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">{\u00b6 35} The effect of abandonment by a trustee under Sections 554(a), (b), or (c), Title 11, U.S.Code, \u201cis to divest the trustee of control over the property because once abandoned, property is no longer part of the bankruptcy estate. =k * * FVhen property is abandoned, it ceases to be property of the estate and reverts to the debtor.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Thus, when property is abandoned under Section 554(a), (b), or (c), Title 11, U.S.Code, it is removed from the estate, the trustee is divested of control, and the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court ceases over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>matters concerning the abandoned property.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Once a trustee abandons property of the estate, the property is treated as though no bankruptcy had been filed, and interest in the property reverts to the party that held such interest pre-petition.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Normally this party is the debtor,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> but a creditor may be entitled to possession instead if, under applicable law or by exercise of contractual or other rights, it held a superior possessory interest at the time the bankruptcy petition was filed.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">{\u00b6 36} In this case, it does not matter whether we accept Standard Federal\u2019s argument that Scott\u2019s dower interest was released upon his settlement with Goldberg of the claims against the property, or Scott\u2019s argument that his dower interest was abandoned to him upon the termination of the bankruptcy proceedings \u2014 the result is the same. Once Scott\u2019s bankruptcy case was terminated, Scott\u2019s dower interest reverted to him as if no bankruptcy had ever been filed. His conveyance of the dower rights through signing the mortgage thus became effective with the close of the bankruptcy case.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">{\u00b6 37} The Staffs\u2019 first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">\n<em>IX. Setting Aside Default Judgments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">{\u00b6 38} The Staffs\u2019 second assignment of error argues that the trial court erred in granting Standard Federal\u2019s motion to set aside Scott\u2019s default judgment against Goldberg, the bankruptcy trustee. The Staffs argue that Standard Federal had no standing to seek relief from the default judgment because (1) it was not a party to the default judgment and (2) Goldberg did not join in the motion to vacate the default judgment. Not so.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">{\u00b6 39} The issue is whether the trial court abused its discretion when it granted Standard Federal\u2019s Civ.R. 60(B) motion to set aside the default judgment. An abuse of discretion connotes an attitude by the court that is unreasonable, unconscionable, or arbitrary.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> \u201cUnreasonable\u201d means that no sound reasoning supports the decision.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>{\u00b6 40} Under Civ.R. 60(B), a court may relieve a party from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for a number of reasons: \u201c(1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect; (2) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(B); (3) fraud (whether heretofore denominated intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation or other misconduct of an adverse party; (4) the judgment has been satisfied, released or discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application; or (5) any other reason justifying relief from the judgment.\u201d The rule further provides that a motion should be made within a reasonable time \u2014 and for reasons (1), (2), and (3), it should not be more than one year after the judgment, order, or proceeding was entered.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">{\u00b6 41} Thus, a party seeking relief from a default judgment under Civ.R. 60(B) must show (1) a meritorious defense, (2) entitlement to relief under one of the grounds set forth in the rule, and (3) that the motion is made within a reasonable time.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">{\u00b6 42} In this case, the Staffs argue that Standard Federal could not seek relief from Scott\u2019s successful motion for a default judgment against Goldberg. The Staffs cite our decision in <em>Zanders v. </em>Jones<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> for the proposition that Standard Federal did not have standing to move to set aside the default judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">{\u00b6 43} In that case, Zanders was injured in an automobile accident caused by Jones.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Zanders sued and unsuccessfully attempted to serve the complaint on Jones through certified mail and publication. Zanders then notified Jones\u2019s insurance carrier, State Farm, and included the complaint and police accident report. Zanders also moved and was granted a default judgment against Jones for $15,000. For six and one-half years, State Farm denied that it insured Jones. After State Farm finally acknowledged that it insured Jones, Zanders filed a supplemental complaint naming State Farm as a party and demanding payment of the judgment against Jones. State Farm answered the complaint and filed a Civ.R. 60(B) motion requesting relief from Zanders\u2019s judgment against Jones. The trial court overruled State Farm\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>{\u00b6 44} We affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision on the ground that State Farm had no standing because it was neither a \u201cparty\u201d against whom the judgment was entered nor a \u201clegal representative\u201d empowered to seek relief on behalf of the party.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> We agreed with the Second Appellate District\u2019s decision in <em>Augaitis v. </em>Reichard<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> that when \u201can insurance carrier named in a supplemental complaint seeks relief from a default judgment entered against the insured, the insurer is not a party to the default judgment and, therefore, has no standing within the contemplation of Civ.R. 60(B) unless its insured also joins in the motion.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">{\u00b6 45} This case is distinguishable from <em>Zanders. </em>The <em>Zanders </em>case was about an insurance carrier, who was not an original party to the lawsuit, who concealed its relationship with the insured for six and one-half years, only to then file a Civ.R. 60(B) motion after a supplemental complaint had been filed against it. Here, Standard Federal was the plaintiff in the lawsuit against the Staffs and moved within a month after the default judgment had been entered against a cross-defendant for the judgment to be set aside. And while Scott purportedly served the complaint on Goldberg at his regular place of business, Goldberg provided the court with an affidavit showing that he had never done business at the address Scott used.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">{\u00b6 46} We agree with the Second Appellate District that a postjudgment intervenor such as Standard Federal may file a motion for relief from a previously entered judgment under Civ.R. 60(B).<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">{\u00b6 47} In the present case, Standard Federal sought relief from a default judgment under Civ.R. 60(B) and met all three necessary elements. Standard Federal demonstrated (1) a meritorious defense \u2014 its property interest in the unpaid mortgage and Scott\u2019s attempt to establish his dower interest in the property; (2) entitlement to relief under one of the grounds set forth in the rule \u2014 Civ.R. 60(B)(5), the catch-all provision that reflects the inherent power of the court to relieve a person or entity from an unjust operation of a judgment;<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> and (3) that the motion was made within a reasonable time \u2014 in this case, only one month after the default judgment was entered.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b57-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>{\u00b648} While we note that the grounds for invoking Civ.R. 60(B)(5) should be substantial,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> the egregious circumstances of this case warranted the trial court\u2019s decision to set aside the default judgment. Scott\u2019s motion for a default judgment against Goldberg was a backhanded attempt to reestablish his dower interest in his marital residence after (1) executing a quitclaim deed to avoid including the Kugler property in his bankruptcy estate and then (2) signing a $900,000 mortgage days after the bankruptcy court had discharged his debt. Such deceit should not be sanctioned by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">{\u00b649} The trial court did not abuse its discretion in setting aside Scott\u2019s default judgment against Goldberg \u2014 we cannot conceive that it should not have done so. The Staffs\u2019 second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">\n<em>X. The Trial Court Was Right</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">{\u00b6 50} We hold that the trial court was correct that (1) Scott\u2019s signing of the mortgage gave up his dower interest when the mortgage was foreclosed and (2) setting aside the default judgment was just. We affirm the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Standard Federal.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b57-8\">Gorman, P.J., and Sundermann, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b49-10\">.
