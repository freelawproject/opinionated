We affirm all of the trial court\u2019s rulings on posttrial motions, with one exception \u2014 we reinstate the original award of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-12\">{\u00b6 2} Plaintiff-appellee and cross-appellant, Patti Hollingsworth, was fired by her former employer, defendant-appellant and cross-appellee, Time Warner Cable. Hollingsworth had worked for Time Warner since 1989 and was an audit coordinator when she was fired in 2002. In her last few months of employment, Hollingsworth had suffered from chronic sinusitis, entitling her to time off under the Family and Medical Leave Act (\u201cFMLA\u201d). During her FMLA absence, she had become pregnant, and a short time later, she was terminated \u2014 purportedly because of her poor job performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-13\">{\u00b6 3} Hollingsworth sued, asserting Title VII pregnancy discrimination and FMLA discrimination and retaliation. The trial court granted summary judgment for Time Warner, and the case was appealed for the first time in <em>Hollingsworth v. Time Warner Cable (\u2018\u2018Hollingsworth I </em>\u2019\u2019).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>Hollingsworth I, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>we held that Hollingsworth had presented sufficient evidence of discriminatory conduct to overcome summary judgment on the issue of whether Time Warner\u2019s justification for termination was a pretext. Accordingly, we reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">{\u00b6 4} On remand, the case was tried to a jury. The jury found that Time Warner had engaged in discrimination and awarded Hollingsworth back pay, liquidated damages, compensatory damages, and punitive damages. Judgment was entered, and Time Warner moved for a new trial, remittitur, and judgment notwithstanding the verdict (\u201cJNOV\u201d). The trial court remitted both the back-pay award and liquidated-damages award in equal amounts and reduced the award for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">{\u00b6 5} Time Warner assigns error to the trial court\u2019s decisions (1) refusing to grant a new trial on the issue of liability, (2) refusing to vacate or remit the jury\u2019s damage awards or to grant a new trial on damages, (3) granting in part Hollingsworth\u2019s attorney-fees petition, and (4) refusing to grant a new trial based on Hollingsworth\u2019s counsel\u2019s remarks during closing argument. Hollingsworth\u2019s cross-appeal challenges the trial court\u2019s decisions (1) partially granting Time Warner\u2019s motion for remittitur on her award of back pay and (2) denying in part her attorney-fees petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">{\u00b6 6} We reverse that part of the trial court\u2019s judgment remitting Hollingsworth\u2019s attorney fees by $26,667, but we affirm the balance of the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">\n<em>I. Hollingsworth\u2019s History at Time Warner</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">{\u00b6 7} Hollingsworth began working at Time Warner in 1989. She was promoted to audit coordinator in 1996 \u2014 a position she held until her termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">{\u00b6 8} In October 2000, Hollingsworth was diagnosed with chronic sinusitis, entitling her to intermittent FMLA leave from employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">{\u00b6 9} In September 2001, Hollingsworth left work early because she was ill. For the next two days, her physician sent notes to Theresa Johnson, Hollingsworth\u2019s supervisor, regarding Hollingsworth\u2019s absences. In response, Johnson contacted Hollingsworth\u2019s physician to confirm the validity of her illness. On learning of Johnson\u2019s unauthorized contact, Hollingsworth complained to the United States Department of Labor (\u201cDOL\u201d). The DOL investigated and determined that with the exception of Johnson\u2019s direct contact with the physician\u2019s office regarding Hollingsworth\u2019s medical condition, Time Warner had \u201cappeared to be in full compliance with the FMLA in regard to [Hollingsworth\u2019s] employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b698-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>{\u00b6 10} About two months later, Hollingsworth told Time Warner that she had become pregnant. Later, Hollingsworth\u2019s obstetrician certified the pregnancy and requested that she reduce her workload.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">{\u00b6 11} In January 2002, Johnson completed annual performance evaluations. Hollingsworth received an individual score of 4.8 out of a possible 5 points. Johnson also noted that Hollingsworth\u2019s work was thorough and that her attention to detail had yielded a quality job performance. The evaluation was signed by department manager Connie Emerson.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">{\u00b6 12} Later that month, Hollingsworth\u2019s attorney wrote a letter to Leroy Peyton, Time Warner\u2019s vice president of human resources, concerning the way Hollingsworth had been treated after her FMLA-protected absences and her DOL complaint. The letter charged that (1) her supervisors had made various comments questioning her dependability, (2) she had not been considered for a new position, and (3) she was soon to be demoted to a clerical position because of her absences and DOL complaint. When Time Warner failed to respond, Hollingsworth\u2019s attorney sent three follow-up letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">\n<em>II. The Theft</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">{\u00b6 13} In January 2002, a lobby supervisor reported a problem with Customer Service Representative (\u201cCSR\u201d) Tisia Hill\u2019s handling of a customer account. As a CSR, Hill would enter bankruptcy adjustments to customer accounts into the computer. Hollingsworth was responsible for auditing these bankruptcy adjustments each day. To audit the bankruptcy adjustments, Hollingsworth would review a daily adjustment report and then compare the dollar-amount entries in both the subscriber-adjustment-inquiry (\u201cSAI\u201d) and the subscriber-memo-statement (\u201cSMS\u201d) screens for each account. Any difference between the dollar amount listed on the SAI screen and that listed on the SMS screen was to be reported to the CSR who handled the bankruptcy adjustment and to the CSR\u2019s lobby supervisor. The error would then be recorded in a monthly error log.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">{\u00b6 14} When Emerson contacted Hill about the customer complaint, Hill stated that she had made a mistake while posting the customer\u2019s payment on the account. Hill later admitted that she had kept the customer\u2019s cash payment and that she had entered a bankruptcy statement on the customer\u2019s account in an attempt to conceal the theft. Hill was terminated, and a more thorough investigation followed, which revealed that Hill had stolen over $18,000. Hollingsworth was then investigated to discover whether she had failed to perform her audit-coordinator duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">{\u00b6 15} The next month, Emerson signed an employee-performance notice indicating that Hollingsworth should be terminated for having improperly audited Hill\u2019s adjustments and for allowing an estimated $18,000 loss to Time Warner. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>Emerson also noted that for months, Hollingsworth\u2019s audit reports had failed to include one township\u2019s accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">{\u00b6 16} In early March 2002, Hollingsworth was fired for \u201cpoor job performance.\u201d The employee-termination evaluation noted that Hollingsworth had failed to follow appropriate audit procedures and that the failure had led to Hill\u2019s theft. Curiously, on the termination evaluation, Johnson gave Hollingsworth low marks, whereas just two months earlier, Hollingsworth\u2019s annual evaluation \u2014 completed and signed by Johnson \u2014 had shown contrasting high marks throughout the range of evaluating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">{\u00b6 17} Time Warner had given Hollingsworth neither warning nor notice of disciplinary proceedings until the day she was fired. That day, she had come to work, was called to a meeting, and was fired on the spot.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">\n<em>III. The Posttrial Motions and Jury Awards</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">{\u00b6 18} After a trial, the jury awarded Hollingsworth $80,000 in back pay, $80,000 in liquidated damages, $32,500 in compensatory damages, and $225,000 in punitive damages. Upon Time Warner\u2019s posttrial remittitur motion, the trial court reduced the back-pay award from $80,000 to $40,000, with a corresponding reduction in value for the liquidated-damages award. The trial court also partially granted Hollingsworth\u2019s motion for attorney fees, reducing the amount awarded from $199,312.70 to $172,645.70 and granting costs of $17,301.82. The trial court otherwise denied Time Warner\u2019s JNOV, remittitur, and new-trial motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">{\u00b6 19} On appeal, Time Warner asks this court to overturn the trial court\u2019s decision granting only in part Time Warner\u2019s posttrial motion for remittitur, as well as its decision denying JNOV and a new trial on liability \u2014 and to do either or all the following: (1) set aside the jury\u2019s finding of liability or grant a new trial, (2) set aside or substantially remit the jury\u2019s awards of punitive, liquidated, back-pay, and compensatory damages, (3) substantially reduce the award of attorney fees and other costs, or (4) grant Time Warner a new trial based on Hollingsworth\u2019s attorney\u2019s closing argument. We discuss Time Warner\u2019s assignments of error in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">{\u00b6 20} We initially note that Time Warner failed to renew its directed-verdict motion at the close of all the evidence. A motion for a directed verdict that is denied at the close of the plaintiffs evidence must be renewed at the close of all evidence to preserve the error for appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Consequently, by neglecting to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>renew its directed-verdict motion at the close of all the evidence, Time Warner has failed to preserve this issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">\n<em>IV. Pregnancy Discrimination and Proof of Pretext</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">{\u00b6 21} In its first assignment of error, Time Warner charges the trial court with error in failing to grant its JNOV and new-trial motions on Hollingsworth\u2019s pregnancy-discrimination and FMLA discrimination and retaliation claims. Time Warner argues that Hollingsworth failed to satisfy her burden to show that Time Warner\u2019s reasons for termination were pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">{\u00b6 22} Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Act was amended in 1978 to include the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (\u201cPDA\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The PDA makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discharge an employee because of \u201cpregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">{\u00b6 23} Ohio courts share concurrent subject-matter jurisdiction with federal courts over Title VII actions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In deciding the merits of Hollingsworth\u2019s claim, we follow the decisions of the United States Supreme Court and the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The clearly established framework for a Title VII analysis applies, in large part, to an analysis under the PDA.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> To prevail on a claim of pregnancy discrimination, the initial burden to prove a prima facie case is on the employee.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If the employee successfully presents a prima facie case, then the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the discharge.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> If the employer is able to provide a nondiscriminatory reason for the termination, then the burden shifts back to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>employee to show that the articulated reason is merely a pretext for discrimination.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">{\u00b624} Time Warner rebutted Hollingsworth\u2019s prima facie case \u2014 and shifted the burden back to her \u2014 by offering the following nondiscriminatory reasons for her termination: (1) her failure to properly audit Hill\u2019s bankruptcy adjustment and (2) her failure to ensure that the Green Township accounts were included in her daily adjustment reports. On appeal, Time Warner argues that its JNOV and new-trial motions regarding its PDA liability should have been granted because Hollingsworth had failed to present sufficient evidence to prove that its proffered reasons were pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">{\u00b625} An appellate court reviews a trial court\u2019s denial of a JNOV motion de novo.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u201cThe evidence adduced at trial and the facts established by admissions in the pleadings and in the record must be construed most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion is made, and, where there is substantial evidence to support his side of the case, upon which reasonable minds may reach different conclusions, the motion must be denied. Neither the weight of the evidence nor the credibility of the witnesses is for the court\u2019s determination [in disposing of the motion].\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">{\u00b6 26} The resolution of a new-trial motion ordinarily lies \u201cin the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed on appeal unless there has been an abuse of discretion.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> An abuse of discretion is manifest when the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> When a trial court\u2019s decision on a motion for a new trial involves a question of fact, a reviewing court must view the evidence in a light favorable to the trial court\u2019s decision rather than to the jury\u2019s verdict.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">{\u00b6 27} As we initially noted in <em>Hollingsworth I, </em>an employee may prove that an employer\u2019s proffered reasons for termination are pretextual by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>showing through a preponderance of the evidence that the proffered reasons (1) had no basis in fact, (2) did not actually motivate the discharge, or (3) were insufficient to motivate the discharge.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It is not enough to disbelieve the employer; the factfinder must <em>believe </em>the plaintiffs explanation of intentional discrimination.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that the trier of fact may infer discrimination from the falsehood of the employer\u2019s explanation.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">{\u00b6 28} Following a trial on the merits, our inquiry into Time Warner\u2019s liability extends only to whether Hollingsworth produced sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding of intentional discrimination.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\"><em>V. Pretext I </em>\u2014 Failure <em>to Audit Tisia Hill\u2019s Bankruptcy Adjustments</em></p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">{\u00b6 29} Time Warner asserts that the investigation into Hollingsworth\u2019s audit-coordinator duties provided one of the nondiscriminatory grounds for her discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">{\u00b6 30} Time Warner presented testimony tending to show that the investigation had revealed that Hollingsworth had missed ten possible errors committed by Hill and that Hill\u2019s lobby supervisor, Sandy Marshall, had never received any correspondence from Hollingsworth about the errors on the ten accounts. These findings were reported to Time Warner\u2019s vice president of human resources, Leroy Peyton. Peyton further scrutinized the findings and concluded that Hollingsworth had failed to identify errors in seven accounts, rather than in ten.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">{\u00b6 31} At trial, Hollingsworth rebutted this evidence by adducing testimony showing that Time Warner had admitted that Hollingsworth\u2019s error logs would have reflected whether she had caught the errors in Hill\u2019s bankruptcy statements' \u2014 -but that management never reviewed these error logs before her termination. Hollingsworth\u2019s supervisor, Theresa Johnson, testified that the error logs would have been \u201creal important to check\u201d and would have conclusively shown whether the errors had been reported. At the time of the termination investigation, Time Warner\u2019s representatives had reviewed neither the error logs nor the e-mails that Hollingsworth had purportedly sent.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>{\u00b6 32} Hollingsworth also presented testimony that after her termination, Time Warner had destroyed the error logs and erased the e-mails without ever reviewing them. Emerson testified that at the time of termination, the error logs were in Hollingsworth\u2019s desk and that none of the error logs had been requested or reviewed by the managers who had signed off on Hollingsworth\u2019s discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">{\u00b6 33} Time Warner later countered that the error logs and e-mails had been destroyed in accordance with its document-retention policy. But the testimony at trial revealed that Time Warner\u2019s document-retention policy contained no reference to error logs. During closing argument, Time Warner was unable to explain exactly what had happened to the error logs in Hollingsworth\u2019s desk: \u201cWhat happened to the error logs? I can\u2019t even tell you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">{\u00b6 34} There was also conflicting trial testimony regarding whether Hollingsworth had informed Marshall of Hill\u2019s errors. Marshall testified that she had never received any e-mail messages from Hollingsworth about the seven errors and that Hollingsworth had failed to forward the monthly error logs. Hollingsworth testified that \u201cshe did not recall\u201d sending any e-mail to Marshall regarding the seven <em>specific </em>accounts cited by Time Warner as justification for her termination. But Hollingsworth\u2019s answers were in response to particular and specific inquiries regarding whether she recalled the identity of the account holders and the specific account numbers for each of the seven accounts. Hollingsworth later testified that she had recalled personally meeting with Marshall regarding Hill\u2019s mistakes on more than one occasion. Notably, the emails that Hollingsworth allegedly sent to Marshall about the Hill accounts had also been erased.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">{\u00b6 35} Testimony at trial further showed that Hill had deleted bankruptcy notations. In many instances, Hollingsworth had audited one of Hill\u2019s accounts, found an error, and noted the error with a bankruptcy memorandum. Hill would then go back and delete the notation. The deletions would have allowed Hill to circumvent the audit coordinator, consequently exonerating Hollingsworth from accountability for Hill\u2019s thievery. In fact, out of the 25 preliminary accounts investigated by Emerson as having potential errors, 15 of the accounts had notations that had been subsequently deleted by Hill. Thus, Hollingsworth was unaccountable for 15 of the 25 accounts initially investigated \u2014 leaving only the ten accounts that had been submitted to Peyton. As we have already noted, Peyton\u2019s investigation further culled that number to seven accounts (of the initial 25) for which Hollingsworth might have been responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">{\u00b6 36} Hollingsworth also argued that similarly situated employees were not discharged or disciplined in connection with Hill\u2019s theft. Time Warner neither investigated nor disciplined either Johnson or Emerson in connection with Hill\u2019s theft. Moreover, during Hollingsworth\u2019s FMLA-protected absences, backups <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>Roxanne Roberts and Annette Hampton had performed audits of the lobby representatives\u2019 bankruptcy accounts. And despite the fact that Roberts and Hampton had also audited Hill\u2019s bankruptcy accounts and made similar mistakes, neither had been questioned or reprimanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">{\u00b6 37} Hollingsworth testified at trial that over the course of the year, Roberts had frequently backed her up and that Roberts\u2019s primary responsibility had been to back up Hollingsworth. Yet Roberts had missed and failed to report at least one \u201cwhopper of an error\u201d in auditing Hill\u2019s account. Time Warner, through the trial testimony of Emerson and Johnson, characterized the \u201cwhopper of an error\u201d as \u201cno error at all,\u201d and therefore Roberts would not have been expected to report it. But Hollingsworth produced Johnson\u2019s pretrial deposition in which she admitted that the account reflected an error. Roberts was never reprimanded or investigated.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\"><em>VI. Pretext II </em>\u2014 The <em>Green Township Accounts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">{\u00b6 38} Time Warner\u2019s second proffered nondiscriminatory reason for firing Hollingsworth was that she had failed to ensure that the Green Township accounts were included in her daily adjustment reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">{\u00b6 39} Specifically, Time Warner argues that during direct examination, Hollingsworth took sole responsibility for the Green Township account problem. In support, Time Warner asserts that on cross-examination, Hollingsworth admitted that she had called the MIS department to fix the problem in October 2001, that it had been fixed, that the problem later recurred, but that she did not follow up on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">{\u00b6 40} In response, Hollingsworth claims that Time Warner has misconstrued her trial testimony and that the imputation of responsibility arose from a February 2002 e-mail. In that e-mail, Hollingsworth commented that it was her \u201cfault\u201d for failing to <em>follow up </em>after discovering and reporting the missing Green Township accounts. But Time Warner\u2019s vice president of finance admitted that several MIS employees were also responsible for their failure to correct the problem with the missing accounts. This admission strongly corroborated Hollingsworth\u2019s testimony that she could not have fixed the problem alone \u2014 she needed the expertise of the MIS department. Also, given the admitted fault of the MIS department in failing to correct the problem, Time Warner neither investigated nor disciplined any MIS employee in connection with the Green Township accounts. Hollingsworth alone was the focus of Time Warner\u2019s investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-10\">{\u00b641} One of Hollingsworth\u2019s trained backups testified that she and other backups had noticed the missing Green Township accounts, but that they had failed to even report the missing information. Even more questionable was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>fact that Time Warner\u2019s representatives, when making the decision to terminate Hollingsworth, had completely failed to ascertain information about Hollingsworth\u2019s attempt to fix the Green Township problem. The trial transcript shows that when Hollingsworth was discharged, the terminating supervisors\u2019 investigation had failed to discover that Hollingsworth had called MIS personnel multiple times in her attempt to remedy the Green Township problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">{\u00b6 42} Time Warner also argues that rather than allowing the accounts to continue unaudited, Hollingsworth could have printed out the missing information in hard copy or found the missing information online. But trial testimony revealed that these accounts could be audited retrospectively and that often these accounts would go unaudited for two to three months at a time. Hollingsworth could have easily audited the Green Township accounts after the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">{\u00b6 43} In summation, the trial testimony showed that Hollingsworth was the only employee who had attempted to fix the Green Township problem, that she could not remedy the problem alone, that her replacements also noticed the problem but failed to even report it, and that the accounts could be audited two to three months after the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">{\u00b6 44} Consequently, we find that the record is replete with testimonial evidence whereby a jury could have concluded that Time Warner\u2019s proffered reasons for the termination were pretextual and that Time Warner had intentionally discriminated against Hollingsworth. That conclusion was further buttressed by the plethora of trial testimony that had shown that Time Warner\u2019s investigation into Hollingsworth\u2019s alleged shortcomings \u2014 while ignoring her co-workers\u2019 culpability in these matters \u2014 was perfunctory.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">{\u00b6 45} By destroying the error logs and deleting Hollingsworth\u2019s e-mails, Time Warner had forced the jury to weigh the testimony of multiple witnesses in deciding whether it had intentionally discriminated against Hollingsworth. If the error logs and e-mail had been preserved, there would have been little room for speculation. But as it stood, the jury believed Hollingsworth in finding that Time Warner had intentionally discriminated against her because she was pregnant. For these reasons, in combination with those enumerated in <em>Hollingsworth I, </em>we hold that the jury verdict against Time Warner was supported by the evidence and that the trial court correctly denied Time Warner\u2019s JNOV motion. We also hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Time Warner\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">\n<em>VII. FMLA Liability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">{\u00b6 46} The evidence showing that Time Warner\u2019s reasons were pretextual also supported the trial court\u2019s decision denying Time Warner\u2019s new-trial and JNOV motions on Hollingsworth\u2019s FMLA discrimination and retaliation claims. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying Time Warner\u2019s new-trial motion on its liability for FMLA discrimination and retaliation and that there was sufficient evidence in the record for the jury to find that Time Warner\u2019s reasons had no basis in fact, did not motivate the discharge, or were insufficient to warrant Hollingsworth\u2019s discharge.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">{\u00b6 47} For all of the foregoing reasons, we also uphold the trial court\u2019s judgment denying Time Warner\u2019s JNOV and new-trial motions as they related to its liability for FMLA discrimination and retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">\n<em>VIII. Damages</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">{\u00b6 48} Time Warner\u2019s second assignment of error charges that the trial court erred in failing to vacate or remit the jury\u2019s damage awards or to grant a new trial on damages. Specifically, Time Warner asserts that the trial court should have granted Time Warner\u2019s JNOV, remittitur, or new-trial motions as to (1) punitive and liquidated damages, because Time Warner established its good-faith defense under Title VII and the FMLA, (2) back-pay damages, because Hollingsworth had failed to mitigate her damages, and (3) compensatory damages, because Hollingsworth did not establish causation and failed to present sufficient evidence <em>to </em>support an emotional-distress claim. We address these subassignments of error in order, first noting that the standard for reviewing a trial court\u2019s jury instruction on damages is whether the trial court\u2019s decision to give a requested instruction constituted an abuse of discretion under the facts and circumstances of the case.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We also review a trial court\u2019s decision denying a remittitur or new-trial motion under an abuse-of-discretion standard.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The assessment of damages is a function that falls squarely within the jury\u2019s purview,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and on appeal we will not substitute our judgment for that of the jury.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> A trial court\u2019s decision denying a remittitur motion is not erroneous unless the award is so excessive as to appear to be the result of passion or prejudice by the jury, or unless the amount awarded is excessive and against the manifest weight of the evidence.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> \u201cTo reverse a jury\u2019s damage award, it must appear to be \u2018so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>disproportionate as to shock reasonable sensibilities.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">{\u00b6 49} But we review a denial of a JNOV motion de novo.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">\n<em>IX. Punitive Damages under Title VII</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">{\u00b6 50} Time Warner claims that the trial court erred in denying its JNOV, remittitur, and new-trial motions as to punitive damages. It also alleges that the trial court abused its discretion by instructing the jury on punitive damages, because (1) Hollingsworth failed to establish that Time Warner had acted with \u201cmalice\u201d and \u201creckless indifference\u201d and (2) Time Warner had established its good-faith defense under Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">{\u00b6 51} To recover punitive damages under Title VII, a plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the employer\u2019s intentional discrimination was the result of \u201cmalice\u201d or \u201creckless indifference\u201d to the federally protected rights of the aggrieved individual.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The Sixth Circuit has held that one way in which a plaintiff may show that the employer acted with reckless disregard for the plaintiffs federally protected rights is by showing either (1) that the decisionmakers in management were familiar with the antidiscrimination laws and the employer\u2019s practices for implementing those laws or (2) that the defendant\u2019s employees lied, either to the plaintiff or to the jury, to cover up their discriminatory actions.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> While only one element is necessary, we believe that a reasonable jury could have found both in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">{\u00b6 52} The decisionmaking managers at Time Warner were familiar with the antidiscrimination laws and the employer\u2019s practices for implementing those laws. Leroy Peyton, Time Warner\u2019s vice president of human resources, had over 35 years\u2019 experience in human resources, which included a period of employment with the Ohio Civil Rights Commission. In anticipation of Hollingsworth\u2019s termination, Peyton had sought advice from Time Warner counsel Greg Drake regarding Hollingsworth\u2019s federally protected rights. The trial testimony also revealed that in January 2002, Peyton had received a letter from Hollingsworth\u2019s attorney warning that her absences were protected under the FMLA. In our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>judgment, at the time of Hollingsworth\u2019s termination, Peyton had been sufficiently advised of the applicable law and had been familiar with Time Warner\u2019s practices for implementing those laws. Peyton\u2019s \u201canticipatory-termination\u201d letter showed that he had at least perceived the risk that Hollingsworth\u2019s termination might violate federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">{\u00b6 53} This conclusion is buttressed by Time Warner\u2019s perfunctory investigation of Hollingsworth\u2019s allegedly poor job performance, the destruction of error logs, the trial testimony in Hollingsworth\u2019s favor, and other similar evidence of pretext from which the jury concluded that Time Warner had known that its termination decision might have been in violation of federal law. That knowledge satisfied the requirement that Time Warner had acted with reckless disregard of, and callous indifference to, Hollingsworth\u2019s federally protected status.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">{\u00b6 54} Time Warner next asserts that its good-faith attempts to comply with Title VII insulated it from liability for punitive damages. Not so.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">{\u00b6 55} The United States Supreme Court held in <em>Kolstad v. Am. Dental Assn. </em>that employers are not vicariously liable for the \u201cdiscriminatory employment decisions of managerial agents\u201d when those decisions conflict with the employer\u2019s \u201c \u2018good-faith efforts to comply with Title VIL\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">{\u00b6 56} Time Warner argues that it had attempted to comply in good faith with Title VII by publishing an employee handbook setting forth the EEO policies and by holding employee meetings to discuss its EEO policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">{\u00b6 57} The Fourth Circuit has held that an employer\u2019s written policy does not shield an employer from liability when there is sufficient evidence that \u201ccall[s] into question\u201d the sincerity of the employer\u2019s commitment to abide by that policy.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Similarly, the Sixth Circuit has suggested in dicta that the mere existence of an antidiscrimination policy does not shield an employer from liability.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Although the <em>Tisdale </em>analysis focused on a hostile-work-environment claim under Title VII, we are convinced that the <em>Tisdale </em>rationale properly extends by analogy to a Title VII pregnancy-discrimination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">{\u00b6 58} The trial evidence and testimony belying Time Warner\u2019s good-faith efforts to comply with Title VII included (1) the cursory investigation and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>inadequate documentation of Hollingsworth\u2019s blameworthiness in failing to audit Hill\u2019s bankruptcy statements \u2014 most glaringly, its failure to review and later destruction of the error logs and e-mails, (2) Time Warner\u2019s failure to discipline Theresa Johnson for calling Hollingsworth\u2019s doctor, in violation of her FMLA rights, (3) Time Warner\u2019s failure to discipline other similarly situated employees for making the same and similar mistakes that Hollingsworth had made, and (4) the sharp contrast between the low marks on Hollingsworth\u2019s termination evaluation and the high marks on her annual evaluation conducted just two months before her termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">{\u00b6 59} Time Warner also asserts that Hollingsworth had never complained about the pregnancy discrimination to anyone at Time Warner. We disagree. Hollingsworth notified the DOL when Johnson had wrongfully called Hollingsworth\u2019s doctor, and before her termination, Hollingsworth\u2019s attorney had mailed Time Warner multiple letters about its retaliatory and discriminatory treatment. Hollingsworth did not fail to complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">{\u00b6 60} We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by submitting the issue of punitive damages to the jury. There was sufficient evidence to conclude that Time Warner had acted with \u201cmalice\u201d or \u201creckless indifference\u201d to the federally protected rights of Hollingsworth. We also conclude that Time Warner\u2019s good-faith defense was of no avail. The record contained sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that Time Warner either failed to abide by or had ignored its own antidiscriminatory policies. We affirm the trial court\u2019s decision denying Time Warner\u2019s JNOV motion as to Title VII punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">{\u00b6 61} Time Warner\u2019s final argument charges the trial court with error in denying its motion for a new trial or remittitur on the issue of punitive damages. Time Warner argues that the punitive-damage award was excessive and was against the manifest weight of the evidence. For many of the same reasons that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in giving the jury instruction on punitive damages, it did not abuse its discretion in denying Time Warner\u2019s motion for a new trial or remittitur. There is no indication in the record that the jury award was either excessive, the result of passion or prejudice, or against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">{\u00b6 62} Thus we uphold the trial court\u2019s decision denying Time Warner\u2019s JNOV, remittitur, and new-trial motions as to punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">\n<em>X. FMLA Liquidated Damages</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b709-10\">{\u00b6 63} Time Warner also challenges the trial court\u2019s decision denying its JNOV, remittitur, and new-trial motions on the issue of liquidated damages. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>Time Warner argues that its motions should, have been granted because it had established its good-faith defense under the FMLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">{\u00b6 64} \u201c \u2018Liquidated damages\u2019 in an amount equal to the plaintiffs lost wages and benefits (plus interest) are awarded in FMLA cases unless the defendant proves that it acted in good faith and with reasonable grounds for believing that its actions did not violate the Act.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> In this case, the jury did not believe that Time Warner had acted in good faith and with reasonable grounds for believing it was not in violation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">{\u00b6 65} We conclude that a reasonable jury could have rejected Time Warner\u2019s proffered reasons for firing Hollingsworth. There was sufficient evidence presented from which the jury could have found that Time Warner had terminated Hollingsworth for taking intermittent leave under the FMLA and that Time Warner had failed to prove that it had acted in good faith and with reasonable grounds for believing that it was not in violation of the FMLA. Again, this conclusion was supported by evidence showing that Time Warner had failed to review the error logs and other relevant material before terminating Hollingsworth; that Time Warner had destroyed the error logs; that Time Warner had neither disciplined \u2014 nor provided additional FMLA training for \u2014 Johnson after she contacted Hollingsworth\u2019s physician in direct violation of her FMLA rights; and that after Hollingsworth had taken her FMLA absences, she had been subjected to alienation, ridicule, and additional scrutiny from both her co-workers and her supervisors.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">{\u00b6 66} Although the parties vehemently disputed the facts, the jury was entitled to conclude that Time Warner\u2019s reasons for termination were pretextual, that her FMLA-protected absences had been a deciding factor in her termination, and that Time Warner had failed to establish its good-faith FMLA defense. We also find nothing to support the conclusion that the trial court abused its discretion in denying Time Warner\u2019s remittitur and new-trial motions. Accordingly, we uphold the trial court\u2019s decision denying Time Warner\u2019s JNOY, remittitur, and new-trial motions as to liquidated damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">\n<em>XI. Mitigation of Damages and Back Pag</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">(\u00b6 67} Time Warner also challenges the trial court\u2019s decision denying its JNOV, remittitur, and new-trial motions on the issue of whether Hollingsworth had mitigated her damages, entitling her to back pay. The jury awarded Hollingsworth $80,000, which, on Time Warner\u2019s posttrial remittitur motion, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>trial court reduced to $40,000. Time Warner now seeks a further reduction of the back-pay award. Conversely, Hollingsworth\u2019s cross-appeal urges this court to overturn the reduction and reinstate the original award of $80,000. We consider Time Warner\u2019s assignment of error and Hollingsworth\u2019s cross-appeal together.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">{\u00b6 68} In reducing the back-pay award from $80,000 to $40,000, the trial court found that from October 2003 until the time of judgment, Hollingsworth had failed to mitigate her damages by failing to use reasonable care and diligence in seeking substantially equivalent employment. Specifically, the trial court found that after October 2003, Hollingsworth had abandoned her job hunt and that her sole source of income was from her part-time housecleaning business. The trial court reasoned that Hollingsworth\u2019s housecleaning endeavors did not satisfy her mitigation duty because she had entered a business in which she had no prior training or experience, she had made no serious investment in her business, and she had treated it as a parttime job.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">{\u00b6 69} Time Warner argues that the trial court should have further remitted or vacated Hollingsworth\u2019s back-pay award because she had also failed to mitigate from March 2002 to October 2003. To establish that Hollingsworth had failed to mitigate her damages, Time Warner needed to show that (1) substantially equivalent positions were available and that (2) she had failed to use reasonable care and diligence in seeking those positions.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">{\u00b6 70} At trial, Hollingsworth testified that after she was terminated, during her pregnancy and after giving birth, she had looked at the employment ads in the classified section of the Sunday newspaper, put together a resume, made phone calls in response to the employment ads, and sent out her resume to multiple employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">{\u00b6 71} By November 2002, Hollingsworth had found a temporary placement at a staffing agency, which paid $9 an hour. Her job at Time Warner had paid almost $15 an hour. Unfortunately, Hollingsworth\u2019s hours at the staffing agency declined, and in response, she started a housecleaning business. She continued to work at the staffing agency until about March 2003, when she continued to clean houses and to look for other employment. The job search continued until about October 2003, when Hollingsworth\u2019s housecleaning business became more profitable. Then, Hollingsworth stopped looking for full-time employment and concentrated on her housecleaning business. We hold that a reasonable jury could have found that Hollingsworth had exercised reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>diligence in mitigating her damages from the date of her termination through October 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">{\u00b6 72} We also hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by partially reducing Hollingsworth\u2019s back-pay award to $40,000 when it granted in part Time Warner\u2019s remittitur motion. Citing <em>Taylor v. Invacare Corp., </em>Hollingsworth urges this court to find that \u201c[s]elf-employment, if it is undertaken in good faith and is a reasonable alternative to seeking other comparable employment, may be considered permissible mitigation.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> We agree that in the proper instance, self-employment can be mitigation. But we note that in this case, the trial court did not base its decision to remit solely upon Hollingsworth\u2019s self-employed status. The trial court additionally found that Hollingsworth had no experience in the housecleaning business, had made no serious investment in the business, and had treated it as a part-time, rather than a full-time, job.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">{\u00b6 73} In light of the foregoing, we conclude that Time Warner\u2019s assignment of error seeking a further remittitur and Hollingsworth\u2019s cross-appeal challenging any remittitur are overruled. Accordingly, we uphold the trial court\u2019s decision remitting in part Hollingsworth\u2019s back-pay award to $40,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">\n<em>XII. Compensatory Damages</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">{\u00b6 74} The jury awarded Hollingsworth $32,500 in compensatory damages for emotional distress suffered because of her unlawful termination. Time Warner argues that Hollingsworth was not entitled to compensatory damages because (1) she did not present sufficient evidence that she had suffered any significant emotional injury and (2) Time Warner was not the cause of her distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">{\u00b6 75} The award of compensatory damages depended on Hollingsworth\u2019s ability to prove that Time Warner\u2019s unlawful actions had caused her emotional distress.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> A plaintiffs own testimony, in combination with the facts and circumstances of a particular case, can suffice to sustain the plaintiffs burden on this issue.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">{\u00b6 76} The trial testimony showed that Hollingsworth was a young expectant mother who, with her husband, had been anticipating closing on a new home. She had been dependent on her job at Time Warner to pay for the new home, and she was concerned about the closing. Hollingsworth\u2019s testimony also re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>vealed that on her termination day, she was devastated, hysterically crying, and an emotional wreck. In the month following her firing, she had become unmotivated and withdrawn from her husband and daughters, and she had visited her obstetrician to discuss her depression.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">{\u00b6 77} Two months before Hollingsworth\u2019s discharge, she had visited a psychiatrist allegedly because of the humiliation she had been suffering at the hands of her co-workers and managers as a result of her federally protected absences.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">{\u00b6 78} At trial, Time Warner argued that Hollingsworth\u2019s emotional distress was caused by other factors in her life, such as problems with her soon-to-be stepdaughter. But the jury was free to reject, and did reject, Time Warner\u2019s causation argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">{\u00b6 79} In our view, Hollingsworth was in a particularly vulnerable (pregnant) state when Time Warner engaged in its unlawful discrimination. Vulnerability is relevant when determining damages.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> At the time of Hollingsworth\u2019s termination, Time Warner knew about her pregnancy. And we believe that given Hollingsworth\u2019s vulnerable emotional state, she suffered emotional distress that was caused by Time Warner\u2019s discrimination. We further conclude that there was sufficient evidence in the record to support a jury award for compensatory damages based upon her emotional distress. We uphold the jury award of $32,500 in compensatory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">\n<em>XIII. Attorney Fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">{\u00b6 80} Time Warner next assigns error to the trial court\u2019s decision granting in part Hollingsworth\u2019s motion for attorney fees and other costs. Time Warner argues that the trial court should have further reduced the attorney fees and costs because Hollingsworth\u2019s counsel\u2019s hourly rates were excessive, the hours expended were excessive, Hollingsworth was only partially successful, and the billed expenses were not properly taxable as costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">{\u00b6 81} Hollingsworth\u2019s cross-appeal charges the trial court with error in reducing her attorney fees by $26,667. The trial court explained that this reduction reflected one-third of $80,000, which was the amount the trial court had reduced the jury\u2019s back-pay award and corresponding liquidated-damages award.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-10\">{\u00b6 82} We review a trial court\u2019s decision to award attorney fees under an abuse-of-discretion standard.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> A trial court may consider the results obtained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>when adjusting attorney fees upward or downward.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The Sixth Circuit has held that \u201ca court should not reduce attorney fees based on a simple ratio of successful claims.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Rather the court should \u201cfocus on the significance of the overall relief obtained by the plaintiff.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">{\u00b6 83} The trial court\u2019s opinion and entry noted that \u201cthe parties have litigated for 2/6 years, which included summary judgment issued by the [cjommon [pjleas [cjourt and subsequently reversed by\u201d this court in <em>Hollingsworth I. </em>New and extensive discovery was initiated, and several motions were heard and resolved by the trial court. The case was tried by a jury, and Hollingsworth was awarded a substantial judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">{\u00b6 84} We acknowledge the complexity of the case and the special expertise required to bring such a lawsuit. Hollingsworth submitted evidence supporting the hours worked and the rates claimed. Hollingsworth\u2019s counsel had also maintained detailed billing records that had sufficiently justified the hours expended. We conclude that Time Warner\u2019s assignment of error relating to attorney fees is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">{\u00b6 85} We also note that Hollingsworth achieved a substantial success at trial. Hollingsworth prevailed to varying extents on each of her claims, and the unsuccessful aspects of her claims were \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with her successful claims such that they \u201cinvolve a common core of facts or [were] based on related legal theories.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> We fail to see a correlation between the trial court\u2019s reduction of damages (liquidated and back pay) and the court\u2019s reduction of attorney fees. In that regard, the trial court\u2019s rationale was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">(\u00b6 86} Accordingly, Time Warner\u2019s assignment of error is overruled, but Hollingsworth\u2019s cross-appeal is well taken in this one respect \u2014 the trial court erred by reducing the fee award.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">\n<em>XIV. Passion and Prejudice</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">{\u00b6 87} Time Warner\u2019s final assignment of error alleges that the trial court should have granted its motion for a new trial because of Hollingsworth\u2019s attorney\u2019s closing argument. Time Warner argues that counsel\u2019s closing argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>ment should not have (1) accused Time Warner of \u201cdestroying\u201d the error logs, (2) referred to the alleged destruction of the documents as someone having \u201can appointment with the shredder,\u201d and (3) compared Time Warner management with a fictional movie character named Dean Wormer (who had fabricated a pretextual plan to remove a fraternity house from campus in <em>Animal </em>House).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">{\u00b6 88} A party that loses a jury trial is entitled to a new trial if opposing counsel has \u201ctranscended the bounds of acceptable closing argument, creating an atmosphere \u2018surcharged with passion or prejudice.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">{\u00b6 89} Time Warner\u2019s first two arguments are without merit. The jury was free to reject Time Warner\u2019s assertion that it had destroyed the error logs under its document-retention policy, and the inference that Time Warner had destroyed the logs was supported by the evidence. With regard to Time Warner\u2019s third argument, our review of the record has failed to divulge inflammatory or disparaging commentary attributable to Hollingsworth\u2019s counsel that would have been likely to inflame the jury with passion and prejudice. And even this court has used references to <em>Animal </em>House.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Accordingly, Time Warner\u2019s final assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">{\u00b6 90} The judgment of the trial court is affirmed in all respects but one. We reinstate the original award of attorney fees of $199,312.70.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">Judgment affirmed as modified.</p>\n<judges id=\"b715-9\">Sundermann and Hendon, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b696-14\">. 157 Ohio App.3d 539, 2004-Ohio-3130, 812 N.E.2d 976.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b699-11\">.
