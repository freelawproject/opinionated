On appeal, McDaniel argues that the district court erred by ruling that it did not have the authority to order McDaniel\u2019s sentence to run concurrently with an unimposed sentence on pending state charges. McDaniel maintains that if, at the time of his federal sentencing, he had already been sentenced in state court, his federal sentence would fall under the provisions of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3 (b) or (c), which would mandate or at least allow for concurrent sentencing. He states that the language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584, which governs the imposition of multiple sentences, indicates that a district court may order terms of imprisonment imposed at different times to run concurrently. He further contends that this Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Ballard, </em>6 F.3d 1502 (11th Cir.1993), \u201cspecifically noted that both [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584] and the [Guidelines were silent ... on this situation\u201d and that <em>Ballard </em>\u201cdirected that the lower courts consider the policy of \u00a7 5G1.3 as if the state sentence had been imposed and then consider the factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 in order to determine if a consecutive or concurrent sentence is warranted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1288\">*1288</page-number>The issue presented, whether a district court is authorized to make a federal sentence concurrent to a state sentence not yet imposed for pending state charges, is one of first impression. It raises a pure question of law that we review <em>de novo. See United States v. Barbour, </em>70 F.3d 580, 586 (11th Cir.1995) (articulating that pure questions of law are subject to <em>de novo </em>review).</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-4\">Upon careful review of the record and our precedent, and upon consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we find reversible error. Our opinion in <em>United States v. Andrews, </em>330 F.3d 1305 (11th Cir.2003), clarifies that under <em>United States v. Ballard, </em>6 F.3d 1502 (11th Cir.1993), a district court does have the authority to make a federal sentence concurrent to a state sentence not yet imposed for pending state charges, <em>(\u201cBallard </em>clearly concludes that a district court need not concern itself with whether a state sentence has already been imposed when determining whether to make the federal sentence consecutive or concurrent with the state sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Ballard, </em>6 F.3d at 1504-10)). Because the district court mistakenly believed it lacked the authority to impose a concurrent sentence, we vacate McDaniel\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
