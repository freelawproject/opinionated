We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-11\">A woman hired Taylor to remodel kitchen.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> About a month into the project, the woman informed Taylor that she was not happy with his work, would no longer require his services, and may choose not to pay him any more.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-12\">Taylor responded by engaging in a series of harassing and threatening activities, including posting a message on an internet bulletin board encouraging men to call the woman\u2019s 12-year-old daughter in order to engage in sexual activities. The woman and her daughter reported receiving fifteen to thirty calls and that these calls emotionally traumatized the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-15\">Authorities searched Taylor\u2019s house, finding the computer that he used to post the message as well as seven firearms. They seized the firearms because Taylor\u2019s 1986 guilty plea to a sexual battery charge involving his toddler daughter made him a convicted felon prohibited from possessing firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-16\">Taylor pleaded guilty to use of interstate facilities, here, the internet, to transmit information about a minor \u201cwith the intent to entice, encourage, offer, or solicit any person to engage in [criminal] sexual activity\u201d with the minor, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2425, and to possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1), 924(a). He was sentenced to 63 months imprisonment and three years of supervised release. On appeal, Taylor challenges the following special conditions of supervised release: (1) submission to polygraph testing, (2) restrictions on internet access, (3) registration as a sex offender, and (4) a restriction on visiting places where children congregate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-17\">II. SENTENCING CONSIDERATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-18\">In fashioning a sentence, the district court must consider the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). These include: \u201c(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant\u201d and \u201c(2) the need for the sentence imposed ... (A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense ...; (B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct ...; (C) to protect the public from further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number>dimes of the defendant; and (D) to provide the defendant with needed ... correctional treatment in the most effective manner....\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). \u201cThe district court may impose any condition of supervised release it deems appropriate so long as it comports with the factors enumerated in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Zinn, </em>321 F.3d 1084, 1089 (11th Cir.2003) (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d)). \u201cSimilarly, the federal Sentencing Guidelines permit the sentencing court to impose any conditions of supervised release that are \u2018reasonably related\u2019 to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, so long as the conditions \u2018involve no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary for the purposes set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) and are consistent with any pertinent policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing United States Sentencing Guidelines (U.S.S.G.) \u00a7 6015(b)). \u201cWe have observed it is not necessary for a special condition to be supported by each factor enumerated in \u00a7 3553(a). Rather, each is an independent consideration to be weighed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Bull, </em>214 F.3d 1275, 1278 (11th Cir.2000)). \u201cMoreover, while the Sentencing Guidelines recognize that a condition of supervised release should not unduly restrict a defendant\u2019s liberty, a condition is not invalid simply because it affects a probationer\u2019s ability to exercise constitutionally protected rights.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1285-5\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A6h\">We review the district court\u2019s imposition of a special condition of supervised release for abuse of discretion, so long as the objection was preserved for appeal. <em>See United States v. Bull, </em>214 F.3d 1275, 1278 (11th Cir.2000). We will reverse only if we have a \u201cdefinite and firm conviction that the [district] court committed a clear error of judgment in the conclusion it reached.\u201d <em>Davenport Recycling </em>Assoc. <em>v. Com\u2019r, </em>220 F.3d 1255, 1258 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-8\">A. SUBMISSION TO POLYGRAPH TESTING</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-9\">As a special condition on Taylor\u2019s supervised release, the district court ordered Taylor to \u201cparticipate in a mental health program specializing in sexual offender treatment approved by the probation officer, and abide by the rules, requirements and conditions of the treatment program, including submitting to polygraph testing to aid in the treatment and supervision process.\u201d Taylor makes five challenges to the polygraph testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-10\">First, Taylor contends that the polygraph testing is not reasonably related to his conviction under the standards listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), quoted in Section II above. Given his record, we disagree. The district court required polygraph testing to help insure Taylor\u2019s compliance with the supervised release terms imposed on him.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Following his 1986 conviction, Taylor failed to comply with the terms of his supervised release and that release was revoked. The district court also required the polygraph testing to help insure that Taylor receives the mental health/sexual offender treatment he requires. Taylor\u2019s 1986 conviction was for sexual battery of his toddler daughter. Taylor\u2019s current conviction is based on his extreme reaction to a contractual dispute which ultimately resulted in his placing a 12-year-old-child in harm\u2019s way by presenting her as a willing victim for pedophiles. Under these circumstances, the district court did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1284\">*1284</page-number>abuse its discretion in determining that the polygraph testing is reasonably related to the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Compare United States v. Zinn, </em>321 F.3d 1084, 1089-90 (11th Cir.2003). Further, the polygraph testing does not, as Taylor suggests, result in an \u201cexcessive deprivation of [his] liberty interests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-4\">Second, Taylor contends that the polygraph testing condition is so vague that it \u201cdelegat[es] ... judicial responsibility to the probation office and deprives Taylor [of] notice of what is required of him.\u201d We rejected this argument in <em>Zinn, </em>although the review was only for plain error because the objection had not been preserved for appeal. <em>Zinn, </em>321 F.3d at 1087, 1092. In <em>Zinn, </em>we recognized that the sentencing guidelines \u201cexpressly per-mite ]\u201d the district court to require defendants to \u201c \u2018participate in a mental health program <em>approved by the United States Probation </em>Office\u2019 \u201d, and we repeated our firm belief that probation officers play a vital role in effectuating the sentences imposed by district courts. <em>Id. </em>at 1092 (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5B1.3(d)(5), p.s. and citing <em>United States v. Bernardine, </em>237 F.3d 1279, 1283 (11th Cir.2001)). In <em>Bemar-dine, </em>we said that a probation officer \u201cis appointed by the district court and acts ... under the discretion of the appointing court\u201d, is an \u201carm of the court\u201d, and is \u201ca liaison between the [district] court ... and the defendant.\u201d <em>Bernardine, </em>237 F.3d at 1282-83 (citations and internal marks omitted). We also said that \u201ca probation officer is statutorily mandated to perform any other duty that the court may designate\u201d and that we interpret this grant of authority broadly, though it is limited by Article III of the Constitution which prohibits the delegation of judicial functions. <em>Id. </em>at 1283 (citations and internal marks omitted). For these reasons, the district court in this case did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-5\">Third, Taylor contends that the polygraph testing condition violates his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. He argues that the district court\u2019s failure to specify the subject matter of the testing means that he could be asked questions that incriminate him, and that Florida law would require the examiner to report those answers, thereby subjecting Taylor to criminal liability. However, Taylor\u2019s injury is entirely speculative because no incriminating questions have been asked. <em>See Zinn, </em>321 F.3d at 1091. Because Taylor has not been compelled to testify despite a valid claim of privilege, we can \u201conly decide whether requiring polygraph testing as a condition of supervised release generally violates the Fifth Amendment so as to amount to [an abuse of discretion].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1092. <em>Zinn </em>held there was no plain error. <em>Id. </em>We hold there was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-6\">Fourth, Taylor contends that the district court improperly ordered him \u201cto pay the costs of polygraph examinations, notwithstanding its conclusion that [he] did not have the ability to pay a fine.\u201d What the district court\u2019s order actually says is: \u201c[T]he defendant shall contribute to the costs of such treatment and/or polygraphs, not to exceed an amount determined reasonable by the probation officer based on ability to pay or availability of third-party payment and in conformance with the probation office\u2019s applicable sliding scale.\u201d Taylor\u2019s argument is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-7\">Finally, Taylor contends that the cumulative effect of his arguments requires that we find that the district court abused its discretion. We disagree. Taylor\u2019s arguments, which are inadequate individually, are no more adequate collectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-8\">B. RESTRICTIONS ON INTERNET ACCESS</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-9\">Taylor contends that the special condition prohibiting him from using or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1285\">*1285</page-number>possessing a computer with internet access is unreasonable and overbroad. Further, he maintains that \u201c[b]ecause the court authorized [the probation officer] to search [his] computer hard drives and other applications, the probation officer could easily monitor [his] use of the computer.\u201d He concludes that this restriction fails because it is ambiguous and impinges upon his First Amendment right to use computers for legitimate purposes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1287-5\">In <em>Zinn, </em>we addressed restrictions on internet access. <em>Id. </em>at 1092. In the face of Zinn\u2019s challenges that the restriction was both unconstitutionally overbroad and not reasonably related to the appropriate sentencing considerations (set forth in Section II above), we found no abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 1092-94. While recognizing the value of the internet for legitimate purposes, we were also cognizant of the dangers to the public when sex offenders are on-line. <em>Id. </em>at 1093. Here, we agree with the government that Taylor\u2019s crime was not merely enabled by the internet. In fact, he used the internet as his tool to harass his former client and to endanger her daughter by capitalizing on the internet\u2019s effectiveness as a means of reaching pedophiles. Restrictions on Taylor\u2019s internet access are undeniably related to the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-6\">As to his other arguments, if Taylor has a legitimate need to use a computer after his release, the district court\u2019s order authorizes his probation officer to allow that use. Also, the district court did not abuse its discretion in authorizing the probation office to monitor Taylor\u2019s compliance with this condition by searching Taylor\u2019s computer hard drive and other applications, especially in light of the qualification that \u201c[t]he inspection shall be no more intrusive than necessary to insure compliance.\u201d Finally, we reject Taylor\u2019s arguments that the district court\u2019s order is ambiguous because it is not clear whether he may use a computer which is capable of being connected to the internet but is not connected, or whether he may use other'technology, such as a phone or television, to access the internet.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-9\">C. REGISTRATION AS A SEX OFFENDER</p>\n<p id=\"Ah3\">Taylor pleaded guilty to violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2425, which is codified in chapter 117 of title 18. The sentencing guidelines mandate that individuals convicted under that chapter register as sex offenders. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.3(a) (requiring, in pertinent part, individuals described by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4042(c)(4) to register as sex offenders); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4042(c)(4) (describing individuals convicted under chapter 117 of title 18 as among those subject to the sex offender registration requirement). Accordingly, the district court required Taylor to register as a sex offender. Taylor challenges this special condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-10\">Taylor argues that he has a procedural due process right to a hearing before being stigmatized as a sex offender. A panel of this Court recently rejected this precise argument under indistinguishable circumstances. <em>See United States v. Veal, </em>322 F.3d 1275 (11th Cir.2003). Taylor first relies on <em>Kirby v. Siegelman, </em>195 F.3d 1285 (11th Cir.1999), which is inapplicable because the defendant in <em>Kirby, </em>unlike Taylor, was never convicted of a sex crime. <em>See Veal, </em>322 F.3d at 1277. Taylor next relies on <em>Doe v. Dep\u2019t of Public Safety, </em>271 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1286\">*1286</page-number>F.3d 38 (2d Cir.2001), <em>reversed, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 123 S.Ct. 1160, 155 L.Ed.2d 98 (2003). <em>Doe </em>was never binding precedent on this Court, see <em>Veal, </em>322 F.3d at 1278 (citing <em>United States v. Rosenthal, </em>763 F.2d 1291, 1294 n. 4 (11th Cir.1985)), and has recently been reversed, see <em>Connecticut Department of Safety v. Doe, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 123 S.Ct. 1160, 155 L.Ed.2d 98 (2003). As Taylor cannot present binding precedent to support a convicted sex offender\u2019s due process right to a hearing prior to imposing the special condition mandated by the sentencing guidelines, the district court did not abuse its discretion by not conducting a hearing. <em>See Veal, </em>322 F.3d at 1278-79.</p>\n<p id=\"Agge\">D. RESTRICTION ON VISITING PLACES WHERE CHILDREN CONGREGATE</p>\n<p id=\"Azt\">Taylor also challenges the special condition on his supervised release that he have no direct contact with minors without his probation officer\u2019s written approval and that he \u201crefrain from entering into any area where children frequently congregate, including schools, day care centers, theme parks, playgrounds, etc.\u201d Taylor maintains that the condition is vague because the list uses the term \u201cetc.\u201d Conceivably, he suggests, the restriction could extend to churches, libraries, fast food restaurants, movie theaters, and shopping malls. Moreover, he asserts that the restriction does not put him on notice of \u201chow many young people must be present to trigger the condition.... \u201d He concludes that the restriction has \u201cthe potential to severely curtail, if not eliminate, [his] freedom of movement and association,\u201d and \u201c[l]eft to the discretion of the probation office, [he] could be conceivably restricted from the majority of public locations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ArB9\">Once again, Zinn raised this same challenge and we rejected it. <em>Zinn, </em>321 F.3d at 1088. However, we did so without elaboration. <em>Id. </em>While the same process is justified here, we note that our sister Circuits have provided persuasive arguments in support of the conclusion stated in the <em>Zinn </em>opinion. <em>See United States v. Paul, </em>274 F.3d 155, 167 (5th Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 1002, 122 S.Ct. 1571, 152 L.Ed.2d 492 (2002) (\u201cSentencing courts must inevitably use categorical terms to frame the contours of supervised release conditions. Such categorical terms can provide adequate notice of prohibited conduct when there is a commonsense understanding of what activities the categories encompass.\u201d); <em>United States v. Gallo, </em>20 F.3d 7, 12 (1st Cir.1994) (\u201c[TJhough a probationer is entitled to notice of what behavior will result in a violation, so that he may guide his actions accordingly, fair warning is not to be confused with the fullest, or most pertinacious, warning imaginable. Conditions of probation do not have to be cast in letters six feet high, or to describe every possible permutation, or to spell out every last, self-evident detail\u201d) We hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"AkTP\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"A2q\">Because the special conditions imposed by the district court are reasonably related to factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and because the special conditions do not impinge upon Taylor\u2019s constitutional rights, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion by imposing the special conditions of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"AyX\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1284-13\">. In order to protect their privacy, the names of the victims are not used.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1285-6\">. We have recognized that examinations of this kind help insure compliance with the conditions of supervised release because probationers fear that any false denials of violations will be detected. <em>Owens v. Kelley, </em>681 F.2d 1362, 1364, 1369-70 (11th Cir.1982) (discussing Psychological Stress Evaluation examinations).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1287-7\">. Taylor also argues in this appeal for the first time that the internet restrictions are unnecessary to the extent that they prohibit him from possessing child pornography which is already against Florida law. However, the child pornography restriction is a separate condition and any issue involving it is not properly before us because it was not raised in the district court. In any event, Taylor's argument is meritless.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
