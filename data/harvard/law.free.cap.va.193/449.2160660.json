His punishment under the first charge was fixed at a fine of $200 and thirty days in jail, and under the reckless driving charge at a fine of $200.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-14\">Upon appeal to the circuit court the defendant was tried before a jury on February 26, 1951, was found guilty of both charges, and his punishment fixed at a fine of $100 on the drunken driving charge and $10 on the charge of reckless driving. To the court\u2019s judgment upon the verdicts Hundley was granted a writ of error and <em>supersedeas.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b552-15\">Appellant relies upon four assignments of error which are treated in his brief as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-16\">\u201c(1) Can a defendant, who has committed only one act, be convicted of more than one offense in view of section 19-232 of the Code of Virginia, 1950? That is, can a defendant be convicted of the two offenses of driving while drunk and reckless driving which constituted one act at the same time and place.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>Section 19-232 reads: \u201cIf the same act be a violation of two or more statutes or of two or more municipal ordinances or of one or more statutes and also one or more ordinances, conviction under one of such statutes or ordinances shall be a bar to a prosecution or proceeding under the other or others. Furthermore, if the same act be a violation of both a State and a federal statute a prosecution or proceeding under the, federal statute shall be a bar to a prosecution or proceeding under the State statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">\"When we consider the facts in the case appellant\u2019s position becomes untenable. First he was driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicants in violation of Code, \u00a7 18-75, and second, he was driving the automobile recklessly in violation of section 46-208. Before the defendant was apprehended he was driving around curves at a speed of from 75 to 85 miles per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">The State trooper who finally arrested him says: \u201cEach time I pulled up beside him, started to pull up beside him, he cut very sharply over in front of me. He did this at least two, I\u2019ll say three times.\u201d The State trooper was sounding his siren, and says: \u201cIt didn\u2019t faze him. He just kept driving. * * * I used every method I could think of in order to stop him because at the rate of speed he was traveling, the manner in which he was operating his car, it was just dangerous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">These facts disclose more than one act. They show two separate acts resulting in the commission of two offenses, and in such an instance the statute does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">It is conceivable for a person under the influence of intoxicants to drive properly. Many people not under the influence of intoxicants drive recklessly. A test of the identity of acts or offenses is whether the same evidence is required to sustain them; if not, then the fact that several charges relate to and grow out of one transaction or occurrence does not make a single act or offense where two separate acts or offenses are defined by statute, as in the instant case. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bacom, </em>159 Fla. 54, 30 So. (2d) 744, 172 A. L. R. 1050, 1053; <em>People </em>v. <em>Townsend, </em>214 Mich. 267, 183 N. W. 177, 16 A. L. R. 902; <em>State </em>v. <em>Empey, </em>65 Utah 609, 239 P. 25, 44 A. L. R. 558, and 15 Am. Jur., Criminal Law, \u00a7 390, pages 65-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">It frequently has been held that reckless driving and driving while under the influence of intoxicants, where both are involved in the same occurrence, are separate acts and therefore constitute separate offenses, and the prosecution for one offense is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>no bar to a prosecution for that coupled with it. 22 C.J.S., Criminal Law, \u00a7 295; <em>State </em>v. <em>Sisneros, </em>42 N. M. 500, 82 P. (2d) 274; <em>Usary </em>v. <em>State, </em>172 Tenn. (8 Beeler) 305, 112 S. W. (2d) 7, 114 A.L.R. 1401; <em>State </em>v. <em>Yuse, </em>191 Wash. 1, 70 P. (2d) 797; <em>District of Columbia </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>75 U. S. App. D. C. 301, 128 F. (2d) 17, cert. den. 317 U. S. 658, 63 S. Ct. 57, 87 L. ed. 529; <em>People </em>v. <em>Skarczewski, </em>178 Misc. Rep. 160, 33 N. Y. S. (2d) 299, affd. 287 N. Y. 826, 41 N. E. (2d) 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Section 19-232 contemplates a <em>conviction </em>of an act or offense prohibited by two or more statutes or ordinances. If a defendant is tried and <em>convicted </em>under one statute or ordinance for the violation of a prohibited act or offense and a prosecution is later instituted under another statute or ordinance which covers the same act or offense, then the first conviction, properly pleaded, would bar the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">A motion was made by the attorney for the Commonwealth to sever the charges in the warrant. First he desired to try the accused on the charge of driving while under the influence of intoxicants. Appellant objected to the severance and the court, in its sound discretion, denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">After the evidence was in and while the instructions were being argued appellant changed his position and moved for a severance, which motion was denied. Appellant having objected to a severance when sought by the- Commonwealth at the beginning of the trial, cannot now be heard to complain that the court erred in not granting the severance after the case had been fully developed on both charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">In our jurisdiction several misdemeanors may be tried under one warrant. Upon such a trial the court instructs the jury as to what constitutes each offense charged. In the instant case the court properly instructed the jury as to both charges in the warrant and the verdict returned on each charge was in proper form.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">The second assignment of error deals with the propriety of the justice of the peace, before whom the accused was taken for the purpose of bail, testifying as to the condition of the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">The justice of the peace was permitted to testify that appellant was under the influence of intoxicants when he appeared before him immediately after his arrest. Appellant objected to this testimony on the ground that section 4781, Virginia Code, 1919, prohibited a justice of the peace from testifying to statements made to him by the accused while o'n trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-11\">When our trial justice system was established the juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>diction to try misdemeanor cases was transferred from justices of the peace to trial justices, and section 4781 was amended. This amendment is now section 19-241, Virginia Code, 1950. The amended section eliminates \u201cjustice of the peace\u201d and substitutes \u201ctrial justice\u201d. This change removes any statutory prohibition against a justice of the peace testifying, and there is no common law rule which prohibits such testimony. In any event, the statutory prohibition was against a justice of the peace testifying as to \u201cstatements made by the accused on his trial\u201d. (\u00a7 4781, Code, 1919; \u00a7 19-241, Code, 1950). Here the justice was not testifying as to <em>statements </em>made by the accused but as to what he saw regarding his <em>condition.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The third question involved is: \u201cWhether or not the court erred when the witness, P. L. English, Justice of Peace, voluntarily and probably intentionally made the statement concerning the defendant, \u2018I considered him too drunk to drive\u2019, in not instructing the jury to disregard such statement as a conclusion or declare a mistrial. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">The statement here objected to was elicited from the witness by the attorney for appellant who was subjecting this officer to an unreasonable cross-examination. The witness had explained in a temperate manner his reason for granting* the defendant bail. The officers had stored defendant\u2019s car as he was too drunk to be entrusted with it. Defendant had requested that he be permitted to go home to his wife so he could be on time for work the next day. His companion who was sober agreed to go his bail and also agreed to take appellant home in a taxi. Under these circumstances and conditions the justice of the peace properly granted bail and delivered appellant into the care of his companion. This explanation did not satisfy appellant\u2019s attorney who continued to question the witness about some difficulty between the State trooper and appellant.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-7\">\u2018 \u2018 Mr. Lee:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-8\">\u201cQ. Down at that jail do officers just cooly haul off and hit a man under arrest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-9\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t often see it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-10\">\u201cQ. No, sir. You look the other way, don\u2019t you? What is your definition of somebody drunk or under the influence, Mr. English?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-11\">\u201cA. I reckon about like most everybody else\u2019s.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-12\">\u201cQ. I\u2019m asking what yours is, please, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-13\">\u201cA. My definition of somebody being drunk? Well, I don\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>know just exactly how to give you that definition. One man will \u25a0appear one way. One another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-5\">\u201cQ. Now this boy, you certainly thought he was sober enough to admit him to bail ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-6\">\u201cA. In this case, if he would go in the taxicab home in the charge of that driver, I agreed to send him home to his wife.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-7\">\u201cQ. He was sober enough to be admitted to bail, to execute to acknowledge a legal obligation, wasn\u2019t he.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-8\">\u201cA. I considered him too drunk to drive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-9\">\u2018 \u2018 Mr. Lee: If your Honor please, we move the court to strike out the-\u2014move the court that a mistrial be granted on account of the last remark of this witness. He said, \u2018I considered him too drunk to drive \u2019, a volunteer statement not called for by the question. \"We move for a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-10\">\u201cJudge Hopkins: Overruled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-11\">The motion before the court was \u201cwe move for a mistrial\u201d. The motion was properly overruled. The answer of the witness was a natural one under the circumstances of the cross-examination to which he had been and was being subjected. If the answer constituted error it was invited error of which appellant cannot here complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-12\">The last question involved deals with a motion to assess costs against the Commonwealth for \u201cunnecessary printing caused by a designation of most of the printed record in this case of matters not germane to the issue * * # in violation of Rule 5:1 \u00a7 6(e) of the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-13\">The purpose of the rule is to prohibit printing of matters not germane to the assignments of error, and the rule authorizes this court in case of infraction to make an appropriate order respecting payment of the cost of printing the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-14\">In criminal cases the duty to designate the part of the record relied upon by the Commonwealth on appeal devolves upon the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney and the Attorney General. (Rule 5:1 \u00a7 6(b)). The very nature of this case, when considering the assignments of error relied upon, required the printing of most of the record. The evidence, the notice of appeal and assignments of error consumed fifty-three pages of the sixty-page record,\u2014the remaining seven pages included the warrant, the orders in the trial court and instructions. In view of the questions presented these were necessary to a proper consideration of the case on appeal. There is no merit in this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-15\">For the reasons herein stated the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"ASp\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
