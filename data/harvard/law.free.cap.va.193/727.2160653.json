Defendant, filed a plea in bar denying plaintiff\u2019s right to maintain the action because after the accident she and defendant had married and were husband and wife at the time of bringing suit and at the time of hearing. The facts alleged in the plea being admitted, the court sustained the plea and dismissed the action. The error assigned is to that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-12\">Plaintiff bases her right to maintain the suit on section 55-36 of the Code, 1950, which provides in pertinent part that: \u201c\u2014A married woman may contract and be contracted with and sue and be sued in the same manner and with the same consequences as if she were unmarried, *</p>\n<p id=\"b830-13\">In <em>Keister </em>v. <em>Keister </em>(1918), 123 Va. 157, 96 S. E. 315, 1 A. L. R. 439, the quoted part of this statute, which in identical words was then part of section 2286-a of Pollard\u2019s Code of Virginia, 1904, was held to refer only to remedies and not to confer \u201cthe substantive right\u201d on a married woman to sue her husband for an assault committed by him on her during the coverture. It was there said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-14\">\u201cThe substantive civil right in question is a legal existence \u2014a legal personality\u2014of a married woman, separate and apart from the legal personality of her husband, during coverture. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>Such -a right a married woman had not and has not at common law.\u201d 123 Va. at p. 161, 96 S. E. at p. 316.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">It was further said that the question was not whether the statute had given married women the same remedies they would have if unmarried, but whether it \u201chas conferred on married women the particular substantive right aforesaid.\u201d 123 Va. at p. 161, 96 S. E. at p. 316. The statute, it was observed, being in derogation of the common law, was to be strictly construed and read as if the common law remained unchanged unless the purpose to change it appeared expressly or by necessary implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">It was concluded that, \u201cIf the legislature had intended to confer upon married women the substantive civil right of a legal existence and legal personality separate and apart from that of the husband, during coverture, nothing was easier than for it to have said so in language of no uncertain meaning. If it intended not to confer such a substantive right, but merely to enlarge the remedies of married women with respect to other substantive rights of theirs existing at common law and conferred by the first portion of this very statute, the language of the statute was appropriate to accomplish the latter purpose and its object is fully accomplished when the statute is given that meaning.\u201d It was not necessary, the court added, that any further meaning be given to it and no further meaning could be given to it. 123 Va. at pp. 163-4, 96 S. E. at p. 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">The plaintiff in the present suit argues that that construction of the statute applies only to torts committed during coverture, and that there- is language in the opinion which gives the wife the right to sue her husband for an antenuptial tort. The sentence relied on is in these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-8\">\u201cThat is to say, the statute under consideration merely provides that at all times during the coverture a married woman is thereby given a right to sue, provided she had, at the time it is alleged that the cause of action arose, the substantive civil right .which was necessary, as aforesaid, to give rise to such cause of action.\u201d 123 Va. at p. 164, 96 S. E. at p. 317.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-9\">' Taken out of its context that sentence could have that meaning; but when read in its context, it is clear that such meaning was not intended. The clause, \u201cThat is to say,\u201d refers to the sentence immediately preceding, holding that the effect of the statute is merely to provide that all disabilities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>of married -women, to sue are removed as of the time the suit is instituted upon any cause of action \u201cthen existing.\u201d But no cause of action could be \u201cthen existing,\u201d as the quoted sentence explains, without the \u201csubstantive civil right\u201d necessary to give rise to it; <em>i. e., </em>a legal personality of the wife separate and apart from the legal personality of her husband, which the common law does not give and which the statute has not conferred. This is made abundantly clear by the sentence following the quoted sentence: \u201cThe statute, therefore, is entirely consistent with the common law, which does not confer the substantive right aforesaid on married women, and hence does not change the common law in that regard by implication.\u201d 123 Va. at p. 164, 96 S. E. at pp. 317-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">It is the rule of the common law that all liability for antenuptial torts is extinguished by marriage. 27 Am. Jur., Husband and Wife, \u00a7 589 at p. 192; 41 C.J.S., Husband and Wife, \u00a7 396 at p. 880; Anno., 89 A.L.R. at p. 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">If nothing can be found in our statute to change the common law rule that a wife cannot sue a husband for a tort committed during coverture, as held in the <em>Keister Case, </em>a search of the statute in the light of the principles followed in that case likewise reveals no purpose to change the common law so as to permit a suit by the wife against the husband for a tort committed before marriage. The reason for the conclusion in the second instance is no less compelling than in the first. We have found no1 case allowing a suit for antenuptial torts in the jurisdictions which have held that their married women\u2019s acts have not changed the common law rule against suits for torts committed during coverture. All that have dealt with the question, so far as our search reveals, have held against such right.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\"><em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>218 U. S. 611, 31 S. Ct. 111, 54 L. ed. 1180, 30 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1153, quoted and relied on in the <em>Keister Case, </em>construed a statute of the District of Columbia\u2014the same in all essential particulars as the Virginia statute, said the <em>Keister </em>opinion,\u2014-and held that it \u201cwas not intended to give a right of action as against the husband, but to allow the wife, in her own name, to maintain actions of tort which, at common law, must be brought in the joint names of herself and husband.\u201d 31 S. Ct. at p. 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">Twenty years after the decision in the <em>Thompson Case </em>the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia held, in <em>Spector </em>v. <em>Weisman, </em>40 F. (2d) 792, under the statute construed in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number><em>Thompson Case, </em>that a wife cannot maintain an action against her husband for damages for personal injuries sustained in an automobile accident caused by the negligence of the husband before they were married. In that case the suit was begun but not brought to judgment before the marriage. It was held that the District of Columbia statute had not changed the common law to permit such an action, whether the injuries had been inflicted before or after the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">In <em>Staats </em>v. <em>Co-op. Transit Co., </em>125 W. Va. 473, 24 S. E. (2d) 916, the plaintiff was injured in a collision while a guest passenger in an automobile driven by Staats. She brought suit against Staats and another, but before trial she married Staats. It was held that she could not continue to maintain the action against her husband. The court said that the rule established in <em>Poling </em>v. <em>Poling, </em>116 W. Va. 187, 179 S. E. 604, holding that the West Virginia married women\u2019s statute, substantially the same as the quoted Virginia statute, did not enable a husband or wife to maintain an action against the other for a tort committed during coverture, was based upon \u201cabundance of authority, correct reasoning and sound public policy;\u201d and that the same considerations compelled a holding that the plaintiff could not, after becoming the wife of defendant, maintain her action against him. 24 S. E. (2d) at p. 920.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">The same conclusion was reached in <em>Lubowits </em>v. <em>Taines, </em>293 Mass. 39, 198 N. E. 320; <em>Patenaude </em>v. <em>Patenaude, </em>195 Minn. 523, 263 N. W. 546; <em>Coster </em>v. <em>Coster, </em>289 N. Y. 438, 46 N. E. (2d) 509, (applying Massachusetts law); <em>Carmichael </em>v. <em>Carmichael, </em>53 Ga. App. 663, 187 S. E. 116; <em>Scales </em>v. <em>Scales, </em>168 Miss. 439, 151 So. 551; <em>Webster </em>v. <em>Snyder, </em>103 Fla. 1131, 138 So. 755; <em>Raines </em>v. <em>Mercer, </em>165 Tenn. (1 Beeler) 415, 55 S. W. (2d) 263.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">The <em>Keister Case, supra, </em>123 Va. at p. 168, 96 S. E. at p. 319, cited the cases from other jurisdictions dealing with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>the right of action of a wife against her husband for torts under married women\u2019s acts and distinguished the opposite holdings in Arkansas, Oklahoma, Connecticut.and New Hampshire on the basis of the difference in the statutes involved. There have been many decisions on the question since the <em>Keister Case.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">The division of opinion occurs largely from the wording- and construction of the particular act, although there are conflicts among the cases \"not explainable merely by statutory differences. 27 Am. Jur., Husband and Wife, \u00a7 591, p. 192.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">Although the majority rule applied in the <em>Keister Case </em>has been criticized in the opposing cases, and by some text-writers,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we have not found that any court which has adopted that rule has changed front. The author of the annotation in 89 A.L.R. 118 says that recent cases have adhered to the \u201cgreat weight of authority\u201d and hold that the statutes giving married women the right to sue separately for wrongs to their separate property and personal security conferred no right on either spouse to sue the other for personal injuries. Likewise the author of the annotation in 160 A.L.R.. 1406 cites cases from some 22 jurisdictions in support of his statement that many later cases have adhered to or noted the continued force of the well-established proposition that the common law rule of unity of husband and wife, forbidding one to maintain an action for damages against the other for personal injuries, subsists in the absence of statutory language sufficiently broad to amount to an unequivocal abrogation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">We have no statute in Virginia removing the common law inhibition against the husband\u2019s suing the wife for personal tort. <em>Cf. Austin </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>136 Miss. 61, 100 So. 591, 33 A.L.R. 1388; <em>Fehr </em>v. <em>General Acci. Fire, etc., Assur. Corp., </em>246 Wis. 228,16 N. W. (2d) 787, 160 A.L.R. 1402. The unequal situation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>that would result from giving the wife the right to sue her husband would even take away the consolation of the husband suggested by Eschweiler, J., in his dissenting opinion in <em>Wait </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>191 Wis. 202, 209 N. W. 475, 210 N. W. 822, 48 A.L.R. 276, anticipating results that might follow upon the holding of the majority that the wife could maintain such action against her husband.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">The <em>Keister Case </em>was decided thirty-four years ago. Although what is now section 55-36 has been thrice amended in regard to elements of damage recoverable by the wife for a personal injury, (Code 1919, \u00a7 5134; Acts 1932, p. 21; Acts 1950, p. 460; <em>Floyd </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>190 Va. 303, 57 S. E. (2d) 114), there has been no enactment by the legislature giving the wife the right to sue the husband for a tort, which the <em>Keister Case </em>held was not given to her by the present statute as to torts during coverture, and which we now hold was likewise not given to her by the present statute for an antenuptial tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">The reasons assigned by Judge Burks for his concurrence in the <em>Keister </em>decision are still valid. After reviewing some of the common law limitations upon the wife, and saying that it was those restrictions which the married women\u2019s acts in the several States had removed, he added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-7\"><em>\u201c* </em>* * But it must be borne in mind that marriage is something more than a mere civil contract. The mere act of marriage gives rise t\u00f3 a new status between the parties thereto and society, and to new rights and obligations between the parties themselves. It creates the most sacred relation known to society, and is fostered, regulated and protected by statute. Upon the preservation of its integrity, the health, morals and purity of the State (are) dependent. * * * By the act of marriage, the parties thereto establish a unit of society, which automatically carries with it primary obligations, which cannot be destroyed without reducing that honorable estate to mere licensed cohabitation. * * * Of course, it is competent for the legislature to sever this unity so far as it may seem wise to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>do so, and it has severed it in respect to the wife\u2019s property,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but to warrant a holding that either spouse may sue the other for slander, libel or assault, the language of the statute should be so plain that there could he no room for difference of opinion on the subject.\u201d 123 Va. at pp. 176-7, 96 S. E. at p. 322.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">The judgment below is</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b833-8\"> <em>Raines </em>v. <em>Mercer, supra, </em>well states the reason for these holdings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-9\">\u201cThe marital unity, which settled rules of law have recognized through so many years, prevents the operation of those general statutes designed to remove particular disabilities of married women. The question is not whether disabilities have been removed, but whether the long-prevailing rule of the law, declaring husband and wife to be one person, in legal contemplation, has been annulled. Until this rule is annulled by statute, all rights of action for antenuptial wrongs of the husband to the wife are extinguished by their marriage. Because marriage extinguished antenuptial action for tort between husband and wife, the wife could not maintain an action against him for injury to her person committed before marriage or during coverture.\u201d 55 S. W. (2d) at p. 264.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b834-8\"> Those following the \u201cmajority rule\u201d as well as those adhering to the \u201cminority rule\u201d are cited in these cases: <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>Harvey </em>(1927), 239 Mich. 142, 214 N.
