The first order was made August 4th, and the second, September 9th, 1859.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b283-10\">John W. Edmonds <em>and </em>E. D. Sherwood, for the plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHv\">moved to dismiss the appeal from the first order, on the ground that it was not made within thirty days from the time the or-' der was entered, and because the defendant had been a second time heard since that order was entered, and the order was at such time confirmed. The second order, it was insisted by Edmonds, counsel, was not an appealable order, it being merely an order granting leave to substitute a perfect bond for an imperfect one. He contended that no order at special term, as to costs, was appealable. He could find no precedent or provision that would allow an appeal from such orders.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b283-11\">Mr. James and L. S.
