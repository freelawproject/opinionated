For, if the case be not such a one, he thus renders himself liable for false imprisonment, and motion also may be made to set aside and vacate the execution against which he must, to the satisfaction of the court, by affidavits, establish the proper grounds to justify the imprisonment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b54-6\">The court of appeals, in <em>Corwin </em>agt. <em>Freeland, </em>(2 <em>Seld. </em>560), held with <em>Cheney </em>agt. <em>Garbutt, </em>and left the question alluded to by Harris, Justice, in the last two cases, still <em>vexata questio. Alden </em>agt. <em>Sarson </em>(4 <em>Abb. </em>102) decides contrary to the opinion of Judge Harris, that the execution cannot be issued without the order of the court, when the record does not approve of it, nor has order of arrest been granted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b54-7\">For practice prior to the Code respecting <em>ca. sa., vide Graham's Practice, page </em>411.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b54-8\">Marvin, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"Afq\">I have examined the question submitted. The Code 1ms made no provision for <em>applying to the court or judge </em>for leave to issue a <em>ca. sa. </em>If the right exists in this case, it is without reference to any <em>order, </em>and the plaintiff may exercise the right. He will act, however, at his peril. \u25a0</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
