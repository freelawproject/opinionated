That a judgment and execution creditor of the <em>cestui que trust, </em>who, in proceedings supplementary to execution, had procured a receiver of her property to be appointed, could <em>not </em>have the question determined in such proceedings, whether the whole income of the fund was necessary for her support, and whether any, and if any, how much of such income should, as a matter of equity, be applied and paid upon such judgment.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b58-9\">2.

A receiver of the property and effects of a judgment-debtor, appointed in proceedings supplementary to execution, is not, by the mere force of his appointment, vested with a title to the interest of sucli judgment-debtor as <em>cestui que trust </em>in the income of a fund, which by I <em>E.

Stewart &amp; Co., on the 3d of December, 1856. recovered a judgment in the New-York common pleas, against Mary E, Foster for $3,031. An execution on said judgment was duly issued and returned unsatisfied. Thereupon, on the 15th of April, 1857, an order was made by a judge of that court, in proceedings supplementary to execution, requiring her to ap* pear and be examined concerning her property. On the 9th of June, 1857, an order was made by a judge of that court, appointing Malcolm Campbell, Esq., a receiver of all her property and effects.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-9\">On the proceedings had prior to the appointment of such receiver, it was shown that the father of said Mary E. Foster (then deceased), by bis last will and testament, bequeathed $30,000 to his i executors, in trust, to invest the same, and apply the income thereof to the support of said Mary E.

Foster, be paid by them to said receiver, \u201c to be applied by him on account of said plaintiffs\u2019 (A. T.

Stewart &amp; Co., until said receiver should commence an action (or until the further order of the court), \u201c against the trustees and Mary E. Foster, to compel the application of said income and interest derived from the said trust-money, to the payment of the plaintiffs\u2019 judgment in this action.\u201d If the action was not brought in thirty days the injunction was to cease\u2014except as to income accrued prior to the 7th of June, 1857, and not paid over\u2014such an action was commenced, and the complaint on the hearing of it was dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-7\">Between the 9tb of June, 1857, and the 5th of December, 1857, the fund of $30,000 produced an excess of $650, over the sum of $800 per annum. The $650 was paid pending said appeal, to the attorney of A. T. Stewart &amp; Co., and after the aforesaid appeal was decided, he paid it back to the said receiver.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-8\">On the 18th of February, 1858, the Messrs.

Thereupon proceedings supplementary to execution wer\u00e9 instituted in that action, before a judge of this court, who by order, dated the 25th of March, 1858, appointed said Malcolm Campbell a receiver of the property and effects of said Mar/*\u00cd\u00a1.

(It was paid to Campbell a day or two prior to the 10th of December, 1857.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-7\">Mr. H. Hilton, the attorney of A. T. Stewart &amp; Co., made affidavit that he received September 23d, 1857, as surplus of income accruing August 1st, 1857, $325. And, on the 4th of December, 1857, as surplus of income accruing .November 1st, 1857, $325.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-8\">That, upon the decision of the general term of the common pleas (before referred to), he paid the $650 to said receiver \u201c to be applied by him on account of such judgment, it being income then remaining unpaid to Mary E. Foster.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-9\">That the same has been so applied. On the 9 th of February, 1859, said receiver paid to him, as attorney of A.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AO\">The interest of Mary E. Foster in the unaccrued income of the fund, held in trust by <em>Hoguet and Getty, </em>is inalienable by her. <em>(Clute </em>agt. <em>Bool, </em>8 <em>Paige, </em>83; <em>1 R. S. </em>773, \u00a7 2; <em>id. </em>729, \u00a7 63.)</p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">The appointment of a receiver upon a creditor\u2019s bill will not, <em>per se, </em>vest in the receiver a title to such income, though income may have accrued in the hands of the trustees prior to such appointment, and be in their hands when such appointment is made: <em>(Degraw </em>agt. <em>Clason, </em>11 <em>Paige, </em>136; 2 <em>R. S. </em>174, \u00a7\u00a7 41, 42.)</p>\n<p id=\"b62-12\">It can only be determined by <em>action </em>whether all of such income is necessary for the support of the judgment-debtor (the <em>cestui que trust), </em>and whether so much as may be unnecessary for her support, shall be paid to her judgment-creditors. <em>(Sillick </em>agt. <em>Mason, </em>2 <em>Barb. Ch. R. </em>79.) Not only the debtor, but the trustees, must be parties to such action, that the judgment which shall be given may protect them in making payments of parts of the income to the j udgment-creditor of the <em>cestui </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number><em>que trust; </em>and that they, as the parties having the legal title to the property in question, and charged by law with the duty of applying the income of it to the support of the judgment-debtor, may be heard upon the question, whether an application of the whole is essential to a proper performance of their duty ? <em>(Scott </em>agt. Nevins, 6 <em>Duer, </em>672, <em>and cases cited above.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The receiver appointed by the order of the 9th of June, 1857, was not, by virtue of his appointment, vested with the title to any income that might accrue subsequent to that date. The $650 which he subsequently received, and which forms the subject of the present controversy, accrued after the appointment of the receiver made on the 9th of June, 1857.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">As we construe the order of the 9 th of June, 1857, and the order modifying it, made on the 5th of December, 1857, A. T. Stewart &amp; Co. were required to proceed by an action (to be commenced within thirty days), to the end that it might be determined in such action whether they, as judgment-creditors of Mary E. Foster, should be permitted to receive, upon their judgment, the excess of the income over and above $800 per annum, that might accrue after the 9th of June, 1857, or any, and if any, what part of the income of the said fund?</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">It appears that such an action was brought, and that the complaint upon the hearing of the action was dismissed. The order of the 5th of December, 1857, contains no direction what shall be done with the excess of income over $800 per annum, which may have been paid'to the receiver between the 9th of June, 1857, and the dismissal of such complaint, unless the construction be claimed, that it directs such excess of income, in the hands of the receiver at the time of its date, to be paid to A. T. Stewart &amp; Co.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">In that condition of things, Campbell was appointed a receiver in the action in this court, on the 25th of March, 1858. The motion of the Messrs. Genet, that the receiver should pay the $650 alleged to be in his hands, and received by him, as has been stated, was properly denied, because,</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>1. The judge of this court, before whom the supplementary proceedings were pending, had not determined, even if he had the power to pass upon the question, that the whole income was not necessary to the debtor\u2019s support.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">- <em>2. </em>The receiver was not a debtor to Mary E. Foster, in respect to the $650 in his hands; nor was the money in his hands her property. The legal title to it, except so far as such title may have been modified or affected by the orders of June 9th and December 2d, 1857, was in the trustees; and the duty of applying it to her support was confided to them by law, and would continue, until by the judgment of some competent tribunal it had been taken from them as unnecessary to her support, and had, by such judgment, been specially appropriated. It is only \u201c property of the judgment-debtor \u201d which, by section '297, a judge can order to be applied towards the satisfaction of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">. - We do not intend to deny if income had accrued and was .in the hands of trustees, which they <em>conceded </em>to be unnecessary for-her proper support, that so much of such accrued income as they conceded to be unnecessary for that purpose might not be applied by an order of a judge, made in the supplementary proceedings. But this appeal does not presen t any such question, and we are not, therefore, called upon to express'any opinion in relation to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">- 8. Whatever may have been the interest of Mary E. Foster ih the $650 in-question, it appeared, upon the motion on which the order appealed from was made, that the receiver, as such, claimed an interest in the money adverse to Mary E. Foster, and made such' claim by virtue of his appointment of the 9th of June, 1857 ; and the orders of the 9th of June and the 2d of December, 1857, denied that he was her debtor in respect thereof, and also claimed that, by virtue of the order of the 9th \u00f3f- June, 1857, under .which he received it, and the order of the 2d of December, 1857, it was his duty to pay it to A. T. Stewart\u25a0&amp;. Co.'; that they claimed to be entitled to it by force, of such -orders,-and that under such claim he had paid it to their attorney. ..Under such circumstances, the motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>should have been denied. Section 299 of the Code does not authorize a judge to direct, by order, that money held by a third person, and in respect to which such adverse claims are made, shall be paid over by such third person to a judgment-creditor, who is seeking to reach it.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">4. The money in question did not come to the hands of Campbell by virtue of his receivership, derived from his appointment by a judge of this court. When appointed receiver by a judge of this court, he held the money as a receiver appointed by a judge of the court of common pleas, and had received it by virtue of the orders of June 9th and December 2d, 1857. His appointment by a judge of this court, as receiver of all the property and effects of Mary E. Foster, would not, by its own force, have vested in him any title to the moneys, had they then been in the hands of the trustees. <em>(De Graw </em>agt. <em>Clason, </em>11 Paige, 136.) It is difficult to see how the fact, that, by order of a judge of the court of common pleas, such moneys had been paid by the trustees into the hands of the receiver, to abide the result of a suit to be brought to determine whether they should be applied otherwise than as the trust requires, and which suit was pending when they were paid to him, can give the receiver, as a receiver appointed by a judge of this court, any title to or power over them, which such appointment would not have conferred, had the moneys at the time it was made been in the hands of the trustees un appropriated.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">It is not the duty or province of the court to undertake to advise the remedy to be pursued, to determine whether the Messrs. Genet, as between themselves and Mary E. Foster, or as between themselves and A. T. Stewart &amp; Co., are equitably entitled to the money in question, or whether it may be recovered of Mr. Campbell in an action brought for that purpose by her present trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Entertaining these views we have expressed, we have not deemed it necessary to consider the objections taken to the validity of the proceedings, on the part of the present plaintiffs, supplementary to execution, nor to the order appealed from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>as being an order made at special term, and not- by a judge of the court, out of court.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">We think the order appealed from is not erroneous, and it is, therefore, affirmed, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
