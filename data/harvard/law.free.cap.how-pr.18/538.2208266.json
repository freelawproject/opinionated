That act is entitled \u201c An act concerning crimes and punishments,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">By section one of title six of chapter one of that act, (2 <em>Rev. Stat. </em>690), petit larceny is defined to be the \u201c stealing, taking, or carrying away the personal property of another, of the value of twenty-five dollars or underand that section declares that the punishment of petit larceny shall be <em>\u201c </em>imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding six months, or by fine not exceeding one hundred dollars, or by both such fine and imprisonment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">Section twenty-three of title seven of the same chapter (2 <em>Rev. Stat. </em>701,) declares that \u201c no person, sentenced upon a conviction for felony, shall be competent to testify in any cause, matter or proceeding, civil or criminal, unless pardoned,\u201d &amp;c.; but that <em>\u201c </em>no sentence, upon a conviction for any offence other than a felony, shall disqualify or render any person incompetent to be sworn or to testify in any cause, matter or proceeding, civil or criminal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">Section thirty of the same title seven (2 <em>Rev. Stat. </em>702,) declares that \u201c the term felony, when <em>used in this act, </em>or in any other statute, shall be construed to mean an offence for which the offender, on conviction, shall be liable by law to be punished by death, or by imprisonment in a state prison.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">It would appear to follow so clearly and conclusively, from these statutory provisions and definitions, that Stephen Leary was a competent witness in this case, notwithstanding his previous conviction of petit larceny, and that the judge did right in refusing to strike out his evidence, that it is difficult to see how even a question could be raised on that point. One provision of the act is, that no conviction, for any offence other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>than a felony, shaE disqualify or render any person incompetent to be sworn, or to testify ; and another provision of the same act defines the word <em>\"felony\" when used in the act, </em>to be an offence punishable by death or imprisonment in a state prison; and, by a third provision of the same act, the offence of petit larceny is <em>defined; </em>and it is declared to be punishable not by death or imprisonment in a state prison, but by fine or imprisonment in a county jail, or by both such fine and imprisonment. 4,</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">It follows so plainly, from these statutory provisions, that Stephen Leary was a competent witness, notwithstanding his previous conviction of petit larceny, that one would hardly look for, or expect to find, an authority outside of the statute on that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The case of the <em>People </em>agt. <em>Alder </em>(3 <em>Parker, </em>249,) does not at all interfere with the plain construction of the statute. That case decides only that the definition of the word felony, in the-Devised Statutes, applies only where the word is used in a statute, leaving petit larceny still a felony as at common law \u201cin respect to all questions controlled solely by the common law.\u201d The question in the <em>People </em>agt. <em>Alder </em>was such a question, unaffected by the statutory definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">On the cross-examination, by the district-attorney, of Tkadeus Spencer, a witness called and sworn for the prisoner, the district-attorney put this question to the witness: <em>\u201c </em>Do you know that the prisoner had a cutting match with any one previous to the killing of Leary ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">The witness was allowed to answer this question, after objection by the counsel for the prisoner. The answer was: \u201c I do not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">As the answer could not possibly prejudice the prisoner, it is unnecessary to inquire whether the question, in reference to the testimony which had been given by the witness on his direct examination, was or was not proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">The remaining question in this case is raised on the face of the indictment. That question is, whether the indictment, in charging the offence, sets forth with sufficient particularity and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>certainty, the manner of the death, and the means by which it was effected ? The counsel for the prisoner insists that the indictment is fatally defective in this respect, and does not charge the crime of murder within the rules of criminal pleading, and, therefore, moves that the judgment be arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">The indictment, after alleging, in the usual manner, that the prisoner, on a certain day, at the first ward in the city of Mew-York, with force, &amp;c., on and upon John Leary, wilfully, feloniously, &amp;c., did make an assault, and then proceeds as follows : \u201c And that the said Mortimer Shay, a certain knife, which he, the said Mortimer Shay, in his right hand then and there had and held, him, the said John Leary, in and upon the forehead, then and there wilfully and feloniously, and of his malice aforethought, did beat, strike, stab, cut and wound, giving unto the said John Leary, then and there, <em>with the knife aforesaid, </em>in and upon the forehead of him, the said John Leary, one mortal wound, of the breadth of one inch, and of the depth of three inches, of which mortal wound he, the said John Leary,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">The counsel for the prisoner insists that the evidently clerical mistake in the omission of the word <em>with, </em>before the description of the weapon, renders the indictment fatally defective ; that although the indictment alleges that the fatal wound was given with the knife, yet, that in consequence of the omission of the word <em>with </em>before the word <em>knife, </em>in the preceding portion of the indictment, it is not alleged that the fatal <em>blow </em>or <em>stab, </em>&amp;c., which caused the mortal wound, was given with the knife; that it does not appear, nor is it alleged, that the knife caused the mortal wound.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">Mow, without examining the authorities cited by the counsel for the prisoner to show the particularity required, in an indictment for murder, in setting forth the manner of the death and the means by which it was effected, and conceding, for the purposes of this question, that the indictment in this case should have substantially alleged that the mortal blow or stab was struck or made with the knife, yet I think this indictment does, in fact, so substantially allege. The indictment distinctly and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>certainly alleges three things: 1st. That the prisoner then and there had and held in his right hand a certain knife. 2d. That he did then and there heat, strike, stab, cut and wound the deceased. 3d. That he then and there gave unto the deceased, on and upon his forehead, with the knife aforesaid, one mortal wound, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Now, is not this substantially alleging that the blow, stab, &amp;c., were given <em>with </em>the knife ?</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">It is certainly plainly alleged that the prisoner struck the .deceased, having in his right hand a knife, and that he gave the mortal wound with the knife. Is not this substantially alleging that the prisoner struck the deceased with the knife, and that the knife caused the mortal wound ? I think it is, and that the death, and the means, and manner, in and by which it was effected by the prisoner, is sufficiently and certainly charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">In my opinion, the judgment of the oyer and terminer should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
