The action is given to the \u201cBoard of Commissioners of Excise of the county,\u201d and should have been prosecuted in that form. <em>(Act of </em>1857, \u00a7 22; 2 <em>R. S. </em>944, \u00a7 23, <em>5th ed.; </em>3 <em>R. S. </em>774, \u00a7 107, <em>5th ed.; Commissioners of Saratoga Co. </em>agt. <em>Doherty, </em>16 <em>How. Pr.

The action is not maintainable by'them. <em>(Hill </em>agt. <em>Supervisors of Livingston Co., </em>2 <em>Kern. </em>52; <em>Gould </em>agt.

(19 <em>Barb. </em>156.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-13\"><em>Fourth. </em>The evidence of Solomon <em>Gr. </em>Young was irrelevant.

E. Westbrook, <em>for respondents.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-5\">I. There was a proper appearance in behalf, of the plaintiffs, and the right to appear was abundantly proved.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-6\">1st. Thaddeus Hait, who was one of the board, being present, the right to use the name of the board will be inferred. <em>(Downing </em>agt. <em>Rugar, </em>21 <em>Wend. </em>178; <em>The People ex rel. Durham </em>agt. <em>Commissioners of Canal Fund, 3 Hill, </em>599.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-8\">2d. The authority to use the name of the board was proven by the attorney, who also testified that the parties who authorized him to appear formed the board of excise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-9\">' II. The county court properly overruled the objection, that the' action was \u201c irregularly brought in the individual names of the plaintiffs.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-10\">1st. The action is not brought in the <em>individual </em>names of the plaintiffs, but by the board, <em>as a board, </em>and the names of the individuals are inserted to show who constitute the board.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-11\">This is manifest, not only from summons, but complaint, which shows that the <em>board </em>sues for the penalties, and claims them as the <em>\u201cBoard of Commissioners of Excise.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-12\">2d. The twenty-second section of the act under which this action is brought, requiring penalties to \u201c be sued for and recovered in the <em>name </em>of the Board of Commissioners of Excise,\u201d is substantially the same as section 105, page 715, 2 R. S. (4th <em>ed.), </em>section 93, page 493, of old edition, requiring certain officers to sue \u201cin the <em>name </em>of their respective offices;\u201d and yet it has been repeatedly held that the use of the individual names of such officers is not only no error, but is necessary for the maintenance of the action. <em>(Supervisors of the town of Galway </em>agt. <em>Stimson, </em>4 <em>Hill, </em>136; <em>The Agent of the State Prison at Mount Pleasant </em>agt. <em>Rikeman &amp; Hubbell, </em>1 <em>Denio, </em>279; <em>The Commissioners of Highways of the town of Cortlandville </em>agt. <em>Peck, 5 Hill, </em>215.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-13\">3d. If it was improper to insert the <em>names </em>of the individuals constituting-the board of excise in the summons, inasmuch as the complaint .shows that the board sues in fact, such names can be stricken out by the court, under the power of amendment conferred,.upon them by the Code. <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 173, 176; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number><em>see, also, notes to these sections, Howard's Code, pp. </em>296-302; <em>Commissioners of Excise </em>agt. <em>Sperry, </em>16 <em>Howard, </em>211.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-5\">III. The complaint is sufficient. It contains <em>two </em>counts. The first is a general one, in which the plaintiffs, <em>as a board, </em>claim fifty dollars of the defendant, for selling strong and spirituous liquors, or wines, in quantities less than five gallons at a time, without having a license therefor, at his shop, in Lloyd aforesaid, contrary to and in violation of the provisions of \u201cAn act to suppress intemperance, and to regulate the sale of intoxicating liquors,\u201d passed April 16, 1857.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-6\">The second count is similar to the first, except that it <em>specifies </em>the kind and quantity of liquor sold, and the parties to whom it was sold.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-7\">1st. It will be seen, by. a reference to the complaint, that there is no force in the objection that the judgment was erroneous, for the reason that only a <em>single </em>penalty can be recovered under <em>one </em>count in a complaint.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-8\">The complaint has <em>two </em>counts\u2014under either of which a recovery would be proper. The <em>general </em>count is good. <em>(People </em>agt. <em>Bennett, </em>5 <em>Abbott, </em>384; <em>same case affirmed, </em>6 <em>Abbott, </em>343; <em>Hall and Wheeler, Overseers, &amp;c., </em>agt. <em>McKechnie, </em>22 Barb. 244; <em>Phinny </em>agt. <em>Phinny, </em>17 <em>Howard, </em>193.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-9\">2d. The recovery would be good under the second count. It shows <em>several </em>violations of the excise law, and under no rule of pleading applicable <em>to justices' </em>courts would the plaintiffs be confined to a single penalty, as there is no particular mode of separating causes of action in that court. <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 64, <em>sub. </em>5; <em>Hall and Wheeler, Overseers, &amp;c., </em>agt. <em>McKechnie, </em>22 <em>Barb. </em>244.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-10\">3d. The plaintiffs having established, by <em>tho proof, </em>a right to recover for more than <em>two </em>penalties, the court, for the furtherance of justice, would allow the pleading to be amended, if necessary, to sustain the judgment. <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 173, 176, <em>and nates supra; Bate agt. Graham &amp; Jordan, </em>1 <em>Kernan, </em>237.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b315-11\">Gould, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"A09\">It seems to me that the decisions in 4 <em>Hill, </em>136, and 5 <em>Hill, </em>215, and 1 Denio, 279, are not at all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>at variance with, that in 6 <em>Hill, </em>240; nor do I see that 2 <em>Kern. </em>52 alters either of those prior decisions. And while I am confident that this suit would have been well brought in the name of the Board of Commissioners, without the individual names of the members of that board, there can be no pretence that the whole cause of action is not specifically and appropriately alleged as accruing to them <em>as </em>the Board of Commissioners, and <em>to </em>the Board of Commissioners. Under these circumstances, I see no occasion for holding the words, <em>\u201c </em>Board of Commissioners of,\u201d &amp;c., to be merely \u201c <em>descriptio </em>personas,\u201d any more than for holding that the individual names are mere surplusage, where the right of action is well set forth, and the proper party plaintiff named as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">I should affirm the judgment..</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Hogbboom and Wright, <em>Justices, </em>concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
