Subsequently, the defendant\u2019s attorney informed the plaintiff that the action was settled, each party to pay his own costs. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>nied that it was so settled, and, after several interviews with, the defendant\u2019s attorney, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney continued to notice the cause for trial, and finally, in June, 1859, took a judgment by default for the whole amount, and issued execution for the costs only, which amounted to some $102.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The sole question in dispute was, whether the action was settled on the terms of each party paying his own costs, and a motion was made by the defendant to vacate and set aside the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">This motion came on for hearing before me, and the affidavits being conflicting, I directed a reference to ascertain in what manner the action was settled. The order of reference directed the referee to take proof as to the terms and conditions of^ the settlement of the action, and to report the same, together with the testimony, to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">The referee made his report, and found that the action was settled on condition that each party should pay his own costs, and subjoined to his report the testimony taken before him.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">The judge below, before whom the matter came up for final hearing, concluded that the referee was not directed to find the facts, but merely to take the testimony, and submit the same to this court, and denied the motion to vacate the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">The defendant appealed from this order, and the court have come to the conclusions\u2014first, That the order of reference was rightly construed by the referee; and, secondly, That the evidence taken before him sustained his finding; and the judgment of the general term, therefore, is, that the order made below be reversed, without costs to either party, on the appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
