J. Fithian, <em>for plaintiff,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACx\">\n<em>argued,</em>\n</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWr\"><em>First. </em>Assuming the defendant to be a foreign corporation, then the attachment should stand. The affidavit upon which it issues is sufficient. <em>(Code, section </em>229; <em>Howard's N. Y. Code, p. </em>344: <em>Morgan </em>agt. <em>Avery, </em>7 <em>Barb. </em>656: <em>Matter of Griswold, </em>13 <em>Barb. </em>412.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b227-7\">The next question is, whether the defendant is a corporation created by and under \u201c the laws of any other state or country,\u201d within the meaning of section 227 of the Code, and on that question we say\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b227-8\"><em>First. </em>It is submitted that this corporation is within the provisions of the Code, section 227, and subsequent sections; and that an attachment can issue against its property, even though the Mew-Yorlc act <em>(Laws </em>1858, <em>chap. </em>121) should have all the effect claimed for it by the defendant\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b227-9\">1st. The statute gives an attachment in all cases where the defendant in the action is \u201c a corporation created by or under the laws of any other state government or country.\u201d ( <em>Code, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number><em>section </em>227.) This language, when read in connection with section 229 of the Code, must be considered as a definition of what is meant by the term \u201c foreign corporation,\u201d as in the latter section.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b228-5\">2d. Conceding to the Hew-York act the effect claimed for it by the defendant\u2019s counsel, still the corporation is left within the plain letter of the statute authorizing an attachment. Conceding (at this point) that it is <em>possible </em>for the legislature to enact impossibilities, and give to this corporation some sort of a domicil or status in this state; still, is it not true, nevertheless, that this corporation was created by the laws of Canada? If it existed at the time of the passage of the Hew-York act, by the same name, with the same privileges and franchises, and under the same officers and direction, and all this by the laws of Canada, has it ceased so to exist by any act of Hew-York? Will the counsel contend that the corporation is any the less a body \u201c created \u201d by the laws of Canada now, than it was when the Hew-York act was passed?</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b228-6\"><em>Second. </em>But it is contended that the act of the Hew-York legislature <em>(Laws of </em>1858, <em>chapter </em>121) is absolutely null and void, and of no effect whatever.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b228-7\">1st. How is this act to be construed ? If it be claimed that it was intended to have the effect of making this corporation a body corporate of the state of Hew-York, without destroying its identity as a corporation by the laws of Canada, and leaving it the same corporation there and here\u2014then the legislature has undertaken a moral and physical <em>impossibility. </em>A corporation is a legal entity, a creature of <em>positive law. </em>It cannot migrate, and this because it is an artificial creature of the law of the place or government where it exists, and every hour of its existence is by force of that <em>law, </em>and when the corpora-tors attempt to move themselves or it beyond the jurisdiction of the law and government under which they were created and exist, the privileges and franchises they hold under <em>that </em>law must fall from them ; and the converse of the proposition is equally true, that so long as a body corporate continues to have a legal existence and identity under the government and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>laws of our country, that same body politic or corporate cannot by <em>possibility </em>have a legal existence and identity by virtue of the laws of any other government or country. It is as impossible as for the same man to exist in the United States and Canada at the same time, or that the same man should be twice born, or begotten by two fathers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-5\">It is conceded that the legislature of this state may confer privileges and franchises upon a foreign <em>corporation, </em>but these are only privileges to the foreigner, and ip. no respect changes his character or identity. And should it be contended that <em>that </em>only is what was intended by the act, then I answer that there is no provision in the act exempting this foreign corporation from attachment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-6\">2d. Will the counsel contend that, by virtue of his New-York act, he has got two corporations\u2014one in Canada by the laws there, and one here by the laws of the state of New-York ? This is equally impossible with the other. A corporation is one <em>personage </em>in <em>law: </em>it is indivisible; it is impossible that a set of corporators, with a corporate <em>name, </em>and with privileges, franchises, directors, officers and managers, should be <em>two </em>corporations, with the same <em>privileges, franchises, corporate </em>name, <em>officers and managers, </em>at the <em>same time, </em>and <em>in different places and jurisdiction. </em>This would be to endow them with ubiquity. The Siamese twins were closely connected, but one was \u201c Chang \u201d and the other was <em>\u201c </em>Engthey were not both the same person. We accept the doctrine of \u201c Trinity,\u201d by faith, agreeing at the same time that it is beyond the comprehension of finite reason, but we cannot be asked to accept the Lake Huron Eailway by faith; it must stand in our courts, if at all, by law and reason.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-7\">8d. The act of New-York is impossible of execution in another respect. It provides that this corporation, naming it and recognizing its <em>previous existence </em>as a body corporate, shall be a corporation under our general railroad act, as if formed under that act, &amp;c., and possess all the privileges, and be subject to all the liabilities granted and imposed by that act. Now it is impossible that the provisions of the general railroad act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>should apply to this corporation. They are utterly inconsistent. The courts cannot execute the act. Every section would come in conflict with the rights of the corporators and corporation under the Canada <em>law. </em>.How is the court to execute upon this company the provisions of our act as to the <em>stock </em>management of the road, elections of the officers, individual liability of the stockholders, lien of laborers, &amp;c. ? It is impossible.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b230-5\">The next inquiry is, whether the plaintiff, who it is conceded is a non-resident of this state, is for that reason debarred - from maintaining this action. It is conceded plaintiff is not a resident of this state. It is claimed defendant is a foreign corporation. It is admitted the \u201c <em>cause of action </em>\u201d did not arise in this state. It is shown by the papers that the defendant has <em>property </em>within this state. And it is insisted that <em>such property </em>is the <em>subject of the action </em>within the meaning of section 427 of the Code, sub. 2. The court below decided to the contrarjq and on that ground set aside the attachment. We maintain the court erred,</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b230-6\">1st. It is conceded that, at common law, no action lay in our courts against a foreign corporation, either in <em>personam </em>or in <em>rem.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b230-7\">2d. The Revised Statutes (2 <em>R. S., part </em>3, <em>chapter </em>8, <em>title </em>4, \u00a7 15) authorized an action or suit against a foreign corporation to be brought by <em>attachment, </em>in behalf of \u201ca resident of this state.\u201d Of course such a suit was <em>necessarily </em>a proceeding in <em>rem </em>against the property. It could not be <em>in personam, </em>unless there. was a voluntary appearance. And under this statute the writ of attachment was the <em>process </em>by which the suit was commenced.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b230-9\">3d. Then came the Code of 1848, providing for the commencement of all suits by summons, or summons and' complaint, abolishing all writs or process whereby actions had been before commenced, and giving an order of attachment as a proceeding in the action, or a \u201cprovisional remedy,\u201d but containing no provision for actions against \u201c foreign corporations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b231-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>4th. The Code, therefore, did in no respect change the <em>nature </em>of actions against \u201c foreign corporations \u201d from being suits in <em>rem. </em>(4 <em>How. P. R. </em>276.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b231-5\">5th. In 1849 <em>(Laws, chapter </em>107, <em>p. </em>142), the legislature en acted that suits might be commenced against <em>foreign </em>corporations, by <em>\u201c </em>complaint and summons, together with an attachment as now provided by law,\u201d upon all contracts executed and delivered within this state,'and for all causes of action arising within this state. This act was not limited to <em>residents </em>of this state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b231-6\">6th. Then follows the Code of April 11th, 1849, with the 427th section as it now stands, giving an action against a foreign corporation by a <em>resident </em>of the state, for \u201c any cause of action.\u201d And by a <em>non-resident </em>when the \u201c <em>cause </em>of action shall have arisen, or the subject of the action be <em>situated </em>within this state.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b231-7\">\"We maintain, therefore, that in all actions against <em>foreign </em>corporations, when the object and purpose of the action is to enforce payment of a debt or demand out of the property of such corporation in this state, by virtue of attachment and judgment, the <em>subject </em>of the action is the <em>property </em>sought to be <em>sequestered.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b231-8\">1st. It is decided by every court which has spoken on the subject, that such an action is a proceeding in <em>rem, </em>and not in <em>personam. </em>(4 <em>How. P. R. </em>275 ; 13 <em>How. </em>516; 5 <em>How. </em>183.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b231-9\">This proposition is fully conceded by the judge at special term.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b231-10\">2d. This last proposition ought to be decisive of the case. If it <em>be </em>a proceeding in <em>rem, </em>what other <em>subject </em>can there befor the suit to affect but the <em>property ?</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b231-11\">3d. The learned judge, at special term, holds that the subject of the action is the <em>claim </em>asserted by plaintiff, and \u201c the satisfaction of which he seeks out of the property attached which he concedes to belong to defendant.\u201d With respect it is submitted, this is confounding the \u201c subject \u201d with the \u201c cause \u201d of action. Every action may be said to have three elements. The cause\u2014the <em>object </em>and purpose\u2014and the <em>subject. </em>Express <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>mention is made of <em>two </em>of these elements in the section of the Code under consideration. In this case, what is plaintiff\u2019s <em>cause </em>of action ? What brings him into court ? It is that there is a contract and a breach, for which plaintiff claims compensation in damages. If the word \u201c claim \u201d be used in the sense of the plaintiff\u2019s demand, as it sometimes is, then it is equivalent to the <em>\u201c </em>cause of action,\u201d or the contract and breach. If it be meant to signify by it merely the prayer for relief, or the asking the aid of the court, then it has no legal signification whatever in the question at issue. But in no sense can it be said to be the \u201c subject of the action.\u201d The cause of action and claim exists, and belongs to the plaintiff before any suit, and without any interference by the court. It is <em>that </em>which sets the court in motion. The \u201c object \u201d of the proceedings in court\u2014the end sought to be obtained is to <em>subject </em>the <em>person </em>or <em>property </em>or both, of the defendant, to answer plaintiff\u2019s claim. The \u201c subject \u201d <em>upon </em>which the court acts is the person or <em>property </em>of the defendant. In this case it is not the <em>person </em>of the defendant. That is beyond the reach of the court, and cannot be brought within its jurisdiction, unless by voluntary appearance. But the <em>property of </em>the defendant <em>is </em>within the power of the court, and is the only matter or thing which <em>can </em>be <em>subjected </em>to the plaintiff\u2019s claim. If this was an action of <em>replevin </em>for personal property, or <em>ejectment </em>for real estate, can there be a doubt that the property sought to be reached would be the \u201c subject of the action ?\u201d Yet in both such cases personal judgment could be rendered against the defendant. Certainly, then, in a proceeding <em>wholly </em>in <em>rem, </em>what can be the subject of the action but the <em>rem ? (Ready </em>agt. Stewart, 1 <em>Code R. N. S. </em>298.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b232-5\">4th. The foregoing is sustained by authority. One of the definitions of the word <em>\u201c </em>subject \u201d is \u201c to cause to undergo, as to subject a substance to a white heat,\u201d &amp;c., so the <em>\u201c </em>subject \u2019 is that on which any \u201c mental \u201d or \u201c physical \u201d operation is performed. In logic it is that concerning which anything is affirmed or denied. ( <em>Webster\u2019s Dictionary.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b232-6\">So in the case of <em>Clark </em>agt. <em>The New-Jersey Steam Naviga</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number><em>tion Co. </em>(1 <em>Story's Circuit Court Reports, </em>531). This was a libel filed in the district court of Rhode Island, and an attachment issued thereon against the property of defendants in that <em>district. </em>Plea that defendants were a corporation of <em>Mew-Jersey, </em>and that they could not be sued or their property attached in the courts of any other district or state. Judge Story decided that although an action in. <em>personam </em>could not be sustained against a foreign corporation (unless it voluntarily appear), yet as to property of such corporation within the jurisdiction, an action would lie to reach it, in which case the proceeding was in <em>rem, </em>and the property the subject of the action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b233-5\">It is claimed <em>Ready </em>agt. <em>Stewart </em>(1 <em>Code, R. N. S. </em>297) is in point for us. It was there held, where <em>both </em>parties were <em>residents </em>of <em>Maryland, </em>and the causes of <em>action arose </em>there, that the plaintiff could maintain an action against the defendant here by an attachment of his property here. And that because \u25a0\u2014although the court got no jurisdiction of the <em>person </em>of the <em>defendant, </em>it had jurisdiction over all <em>property </em>in this state\u2014 and in such cases, the <em>property </em>and not the <em>person </em>was the subject matter of the action. The language of the judge is too plain to be mistaken on this point. So in <em>Brewster </em>agt. <em>Michigan Central Railroad Company </em>(5 <em>Howard, </em>183), the court set aside a personal judgment against a foreign corporation, by service upon an agent in this state. Welles, J., says, \u201c The extent of power of the court over a foreign corporation, where there has not been a voluntary appearance in the action, is to <em>subject </em>the property and effects.of such corporation within this state to the payment of its debts, by a judgment in <em>rem </em>as to such property and effects after the same has been attached,\u201d &amp;c. If the purpose and <em>thepower </em>of the courtis solely to <em>\u201c </em>subject\u201d property, what can be the \u201c subject of the action\u201d but the property sought to be subjected?</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b233-6\">Again, the alterations which have been made in sections 113 and 114 of the Code of 1848 (now sections 134 and 135) should have much weight in giving a construction to section 427. The first Code of 1848 contained no provision whatever for suing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>a foreign corporation, or for publication of a summons in <em>such case. (See sections </em>113, 114.) Then came the Code of 1849, adding section 427\u2014changing sections 113 and 114 to 134 and 135, and amending section 135, so that service of summons might be made by publication in cases \u201c <em>where the defendant is a foreign corporation.\u201d </em>Then came the decision of Sill, J., in <em>4th Howard P. R. </em>276, holding that service of summons upon an agent of <em>&amp; foreign </em>corporation here was of no effect, and that no judgment in <em>personam </em>could be obtained against a foreign corporation without a voluntary appearance. Of course, under such an adjudication, the provisions for making service of a summons by publication, upon a foreign corporation, was of no.avail. But in order that the proceeding in <em>rem </em>against the property of the corporation might not fail for want of some way to serve a summons (which was the only way provided for commencing any action whatever), the amendments of 1851 provided for service in <em>such case only </em>on a foreign corporation. To the first subdivision of section 134 they added the words, \u201c <em>hut such service can he made in respect to a foreign corporation only when it has property within this state, or the cause of action arose therein;\u201d </em>and to the first subdivision of section 135 they added these words, \u201c <em>and has property within this state, or the cause of action arose therein;\u201d </em>thus providing for the commencement of actions in the two cases mentioned in subdivision 2 of section 427, and showing conclusively that the legislature which made these amendments understood the term, <em>\u201c subject f the action shall be situated within this state,\u201d </em>as used in sect' <em>jr- </em>427, to mean precisely the same as the words, <em>\u201cproperty within this.state,\u201d </em>used in sections 134 and 135.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b234-5\">The learned jndge, at special term, answers this by saying that, \u201c this construction would create a direct repugnancy between the sections in question.\u201d With respect, we submit the \u201c repugnacy \u201d is created by the construction which the <em>court </em>gives to section 427. Let that section have the construction we contend for, and there is no repugnancy, but all the sections would harmonize, not only with each other, but with the manifest understanding of the legislatura</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b235-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>The case of <em>Bank of Commerce </em>agt. <em>The Rutland, &amp;c., Railroad </em>(10 <em>How. P. R. </em>1) is no authority against us. That case turned upon the other clause of section 427, and the question was, whether the <em>cause of action </em>did or did not arise within this state; and the suit being upon a bill of exchange <em>payable </em>here, the court held, that the cause of action arose here, and for that reason held the proceedings valid. It is true that Justice .Hand did remark, in passing, that the property was <em>not </em>the subject of the suit. But that point was not up at all, or discused by counsel. The remark was dictum\u2014unnecessary for the decision of the case, and it is clear the judge had given it no examination; for in the same sentence he uses the words, \u201c subject <em>matter </em>of the action,\u201d thus interpolating a word not in the statute, and which gives to the word \u2018.\u2018subject\u201d a much broader signification than it would have without such word.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b235-5\">To the point, that a suit against a foreign corporation, and an attachment against its property, is a proceeding in <em>rem. (See </em>13 <em>Howard's Practice Rep. </em>516, <em>and all other authorities therein cited.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b235-6\"><em>Lastly. </em>\u00edf it be claimed that the act of the New-York legislature <em>(chapter </em>121, <em>Laws </em>1858) had the effect to create or organize a new corporation within this state, then we contend it is in conflict with the constitution, and void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b235-7\">Section 1st, article 8th, of the constitution, provides that \u201c corporations shall <em>not </em>be created by special act, except for municipal purposes, and in cases where, in the judgment of the legislature, the object of the corporation cannot be obtained under general laws.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b235-8\">1st. This is a special act</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b235-9\">2d. It is not a municipal corporation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b235-10\">3d. The object to be attained by this corporation is to construct, own and operate a railroad, and hold sufficient real and personal property for that purpose.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b235-11\">4th. That these objects can be obtained by general laws, has been adjudged by the legislature by at least a dozen acts; and the same- thing was fully adjudged by the act in question, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>by its attempts to make this a corporation under the general act.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b236-5\">Wm.

The defendant is a corporation under the laws of the state of ISTew-York, to authorize the formation of railroad companies and regulate the same, passed April 2d, 1850. <em>(Vide Session Laws </em>1858, <em>chapter </em>121, <em>p. </em>226.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-8\">2. The act of 1858, declaring the defendant a corporation under the general railroad law of 1850, is valid, and not a violation of the first section of article 8th of the constitution of tlie state of'New-York. <em>(Morris </em>agt. <em>The </em>People, <em>3d Denio, </em>382, <em>opinion, p. </em>394; <em>Suydam </em>agt. Moore, 8 <em>Barb. S. C. Rep. </em>358, <em>opinion, </em>364; <em>Syracuse City Bank </em>agt. <em>Davis, </em>16 <em>Barb. S. C. </em>188 <em>and </em>193 ; 15 <em>do. </em>657-663.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-9\">I. If, in the opinion of the court, the defendant is a foreign corporation and liable to attachment, then we say the plaintiff has not made out a case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-10\">By section 229 ofthe'Code, an attachment may issue in favor of any person, when it shall appear that the defendant is a foreign corporation, and that a cause of action exists.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-11\">By the affidavit upon which the order of attachment was made, it does not appear that a cause of action in favor of plaintiff against defendant exists. The plaintiff swears defendant is indebted to him for work, &amp;c., $160,000. It does not appear that the debt, if any, was due or. when it became due. It specified the amount of-the claim, but does not specify the grounds of the claim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-12\">II. Section 427 of the Code, relative to actions against foreign corporations, provides that actions may be maintained :</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-13\">1st. By a resident of the state, for any cause of action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-14\">2d. By a plaintiff not resident when the cause of action shall have arisen in this state, or the subject of the action shall be situated within the state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-15\">The affidavit upon which the order of attachment was made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>is defective, in that it shows the defendant to be a foreign corporation, but does not show that the plaintiff is a resident of this state, or that the cause of action arose here, or the subject of the action is situated here.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-5\">The remedy by attachment under the Code is a provisional one, and, unless the plaintiff can maintain his action, no attachment can issue or be maintained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-6\">The defendant\u2019s affidavits show, that the plaintiff is a nonresident, and that the cause of action, if any, arose in Canada.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b237-7\">By the court\u2014Greene, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AI6c\">The only question, which I deem it necessary to decide on this motion is, whether, conceding the defendant to be a foreign corporation, it is liable to be sued, or rather to be proceeded against under our statutes, which provide for the <em>appropriation by judicial proceedings of the property </em>of such corporations situated in this state, to the payment of their debts. There are a few elementary propositions material in the consideration of this question, which need only to be stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\"><em>First. </em>No valid judgment <em>in </em>personam, or which, <em>proprio </em>vigore, creates or declares an obligation to pay money or perform any legal obligation, can be pronounced by any judicial tribunal, until it has first obtained jurisdiction over the party against whom the judgment is pronounced bjr the ordinary process of the common law, or in the equivalent language of our state and federal constitutions, \u201c <em>by due process of law.\"</em></p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\"><em>Second. </em>A corporation can have no local habitation beyond the territorial boupds of the government, by whose laws it was created, and hence no jurisdiction <em>in invitum </em>of it, a <em>quasi cor</em>poration., can be obtained in a country, subject to any other government. But,</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\"><em>Thirdly. </em>All property within the jurisdiction of any government is necessarily subject to the control of its laws, and may rightfully be appropriated by those laws to the payment of the debts of its owner, at such times and upon such conditions as may, by such government, in the exercise of a reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>able discretion, be deemed just. And as this right, as well as the manner of exercising it, depends upon the laws of the country where the property is situated, it must be exercised in' all respects in subjection to those laws. The true points of inquiry, therefore, are: to what extent do the laws of this state subject foreign corporations to proceedings in its courts for that purpose, and by whom and for what causes may such proceedings be instituted-?</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">' Prior to the adoption of the Code, the Bevised Statutes provided that suits brought in the supreme court, by a resident of this state, against any corporation created by the laws of any other state, &amp;c., for the recovery of any debt or damages, might be commenced by attachment. (2 <em>R. S. </em>457,157.) Until the enactment of this statute, it seems to have been' conceded, that under our laws no proceedings could be taken against foreign corporations, except in cases where they appeared voluntarily, or in other words, that our courts had no common law jurisdiction over such corporations, and could acquire none without their'consent. <em>(See opinion of </em>Sill, J., <em>in Hulbert </em>agt. <em>The Hope Mutual Ins. Co., </em>4 <em>How. P. R. </em>276; <em>Matter of McQueen and others </em>agt. <em>The Middletown Manufacturing Co., </em>16 <em>John. R. 5, and </em>1 <em>R. S., p. </em>163, \u00a7 23, \u00a7 21, <em>p. </em>162, and \u00a7 1, <em>p. </em>157.) In the case last cited, it was held, that the provisions of the act under which the case arose applied to <em>natural persons </em>only. <em>(Opinion </em>of Spencer, J., <em>pages </em>6 <em>and </em>7.) The Code as first enacted <em>(Laws of </em>1848, <em>chap. </em>379, <em>p. </em>497) contained no provision for the commencement of \" actions \u201d against foreign corporations. By an act passed March 15th, 1849 (L<em>aws, ch. </em>107, <em>p. </em>142), the 15th section of the Bevised Statutes, above cited, was amended, so as to provide that <em>suits </em>might be brought in the supreme court and court of common pleas, in the city of Uevv-York, against any corporation created by the laws of any other state, &amp;c., for the recovery of any debt, &amp;c., arising upon contract made, executed and delivered within this state, or upon any cause of action arising therein, that such suits might be commenced by complaint and summons, together with an attachment as then provided by law, and that such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>complaint and summons might be served in the manner provided by sections 113 and 114 of the Code of Procedure. By a subsequent act passed' April 11th, 1849 <em>(Laws, chap. </em>438, p. 613), the Code was revised and amended, \u201cso as to read,\u201d as provided by the latter act. By this act, several new sections were added to the Code, among them were sections 227 to 243 inclusive, and section 427. By the latter section it was provided that an action against a corporation created by the laws of any other state, &amp;c., might be brought in the supreme court, the superior court, or court of common pleas of the city of bTew-York, in the following cases :</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">1st. By a resident of the state, <em>\"for any came of ac</em>tion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">2d. By a plaintiff not a resident of this state, when the cause of action shall have arisen, <em>or the subject of ike action shall be situated within this state.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">This section has remained unchanged until the present time. Section 227 provided that, in an action for the recovery of money, an attachment might be issued as a security for the satisfaction of such judgment as the plaintiff might recover, among other cases, where the action was against a corporation created by the laws of any other state, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">The following sections to 243, inclusive, prescribe the proceedings upon such attachment. These sections, with the exception of certain amendments to sections 227, 229 and 241, which in no way affect the question under consideration, remain as they were originally enacted. Sections 134 and 135, in the act of 1849, which are substituted for sections 113 and 114, in the Code of 1848, and which contain amendments, which need not be here noticed, prescribe the manner of serving the summons in all cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">By act passed July 10th, 1851 <em>(Session Laws of </em>1851), the Code was again amended. By that act sections 134 and 135 were amended in the following particulars, supposed to be material to the question under consideration:</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">By the first subdivision of section 134 of the Code, as amended in 1849, as by the same subdivision of the corre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>Bponding section (113) of the Code of 1848, it was provided, that if the suit was against <em>\u201c a </em>corporation,\u201d the summons should be served by delivering a copy thereof to the president or other head of the corporation, secretary, cashier or managing agent thereof. By the amendment of 1851, the following clause was added to the first subdivision of section 134:</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">\u201c But such service can be made in respect to a <em>foreign corporation </em>only, when it has property within this state, or the cause of action arose therein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Section 135 of the Code, as amended in 1849, provided, that when the. person, upon whom the service was to be made, could not be found in the state, the court or a judge might grant an order, that the service be made by the publication of the summons among other cases, \u201c when the defendant is a foreign corporation.\u201d By the amendment of 1851, it w_as provided that service by publication might be made \u201c when the defendant is a foreign corporation, and has property within the state, or the cause of action arose therein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">It is conceded that this action is not brought \u201c by a resident of this state, nor upon a contract made, executed or delivered within this state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">It follows, therefore, that neither the provisions of the Revised Statutes above cited (2 <em>R. S. </em>459, \u00a7 15), nor the amendment of that section adopted in 1849 <em>(Laws of </em>1849, <em>ch. </em>107, <em>p. </em>142), have any application to this case, and if this proceeding can be sustained at all, the authority for it must be found in the provisions of the Code. The provisions of section 427 have been quoted, and they seem to me decisive of this question. That the courts of this state have no common law jurisdiction over or power to render judgments in <em>personam </em>against foreign corporations is clear, both upon principle and authority. <em>(See the cases above cited, and Brewster </em>agt. <em>The Michigan Central Railroad </em>Co., 5 <em>How. P. R. </em>183.) The proceeding against a foreign corporation, though termed an \" action \u201d against it, is merely a proceeding in <em>rem, </em>or a <em>quasi </em>proceeding in <em>rem, </em>the object and sole effect of which are to appropriate its property, within the jurisdiction of the court, to the payment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>debts of the corporation. That proceeding\u2019 can be instituted only by the persons and for the causes prescribed by the statutes of the state. <em>(Case </em>agt. <em>Ohio Insurance Co., </em>2 <em>C. R. </em>82.) The section last cited provides that this proceeding or \u201c action \u201d hia)'- be instituted by a resident of this state, for any cause of action, and by a plaintiff not a resident, when the cause of action <em>shall hace arisen, or the subject of the action </em>shall be situated within this state. We have seen that the plaintiff is not \u201c a resident of this state.\u201d It is admitted by the affidavits on both sides, that the contract, upon which the action is brought, was executed, and that the breach of it, for which the damages are claimed, took place in Canada. There can, therefore, be no pretence that the cause of action \u201c arose in this state.\u201d I think it is equally clear that <em>\u201c </em>the subject of the action \u201d was not situated within this state. What is the subject of the action <em>? </em>Hot certainly the title to the property attached, for the plaintiff asserts no such title here;. he claims the right to have that property appropriated to the payment of an alleged debt due to him from the defendant. But this right is neither questioned nor questionable, if his right to maintain this preceding is conceded. The subject of the action is the <em>claim therein asserted </em>by him, and the satisfaction of which he seeks out of the property attached, which he concedes to belong to the defendant. <em>(See the opinion of </em>Hand, J., <em>in the case of The Bank of Commerce </em>agt. <em>The Rutland and Washington Railroad Co., </em>10 <em>How. P. R. </em>8.) On the argument, the plaintiff referred to the ease of <em>Ready </em>agt. <em>Stewart </em>(1 <em>C. R. N. S. </em>298), as sustaining the position in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">But I do not so understand the opinion of the learned judge who delivered the opinion in that case. He says the term, \u201c subject of the action,\u201d relates to the nature of the action, or the \u201c <em>thing </em>\u201d sought to he obtained by the judgment to be given, but not at all to the <em>\u201cperson of the </em>defendant.\u201d The learned judge was commenting upon the 3d subdivision of section 185 of the Code, which requires that, in the case of a nonresident defendant, who has property in the state, and the action arises on contract, the * court should have juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>diction of the <em>subject </em>of the action. Now, the thing sought to be obtained by the judgment was, the establishment of the claim asserted in the action. The idea that the learned judge was combatting was, as I understand his language, simply that the term, \u201cjurisdiction of the subject of the action,\u201d did not mean jurisdiction of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">It was also urged on the argument, on the authority, I suppose, of a suggestion of Justice Hand, in the case above cited, that the amendment of sections 134 and 135, limiting the service of summons, as in those sections prescribed, to cases where the cause of action arose in the state, or the defendant had property therein, is to be construed as modifying section 427, so as to make a foreign corporation liable to an action, whenever it has property in the state. This 'construction would create a direct repugnancy between the sections in question. This consequence should, and I think may be avoided by limiting the provisions o'f each section to the apparent object of the section. Section 427 specified the cases in which actions might be brought against foreign corporations, and sections 134 and 135 prescribed the manner of serving the summons in certain classes of cases, without regard to the right to maintain the action in any particular case. The object of these sections, I apprehend, was to provide for a service in all cases, where, assuming the right to institute an action, such service would be of any utility to the party ; and while it may be difficult in all cases, and especially in cases like that now under consideration, to perceive a perfect adaptation of all the provisions of these sections to. this object, I think it would be still more difficult to give them the effect of enlarging the pro visions of another section in which the right to maintain this class of actions is plainly defined, and as plainly limited. In short, the authority to maintain these actions is given by section 427, and the practice in them, so far as th\u00e9 service of the summons is concerned, is regulated by sections 134 and 135, and' this, I think, is the only effect of these sections in such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">It is settled by well-considered authorities, that proof of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>jurisdictional facts is not essential to establish the regularity of the service of a summons upon a foreign corporation. The attachment may be issued at the time of issuing the summons, or \u201c <em>at any time afterwards.\u201d (Hulbert </em>agt. <em>The Hope Mutual Insurance </em>Company, <em>above </em>cited, <em>and Bates </em>agt. <em>The New-Orleans, Jackson and Great Northern Railroad Co., </em>13 <em>H. P. R. </em>516.) The corporations proceeded against by summons before the issuing of an attachment may, on motion, contest these facts, and the plaintiff may, on a motion to set aside the service of the summons, produce the proof necessary to show his right to proceed against the corporation and thus sustain his proceedings. <em>{Cases above cited.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">It is not until the plaintiff procures his attachment, which is to operate upon the property of the corporation, and which effects and eventually consummates the whole object of the proceeding, that the plaintiff is bound to prove the acts upon which jurisdiction to entertain the proceedings depends.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">As the plaintiff in this case was not a resident of the state, and as the cause of action did not arise, and the subject of it is not situated within this state, it follows that the court has no jurisdiction of the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">And the order to discharge the attachment must be affirmed with $10 costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">Marvin, Grover and Davis, Justices, concurring.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
