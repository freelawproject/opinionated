This'claim is, that'the Insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>Company, of which the plaintiff is assignee, was organized un-' der the law of 1849, and not that of 1853 ; and that, therefore, a rule applies to the <em>premium </em>notes, different from the rule laid down in <em>Devendorf </em>agt. <em>Beardsley </em>(23 <em>Barb.), </em>and subsequently in this district, in <em>Devendorf </em>agt. <em>Cornell. </em>And that,\" by this different rule, <em>all premium </em>notes are (by the law of 1849) a part of the <em>capital </em>of companies organized under that act.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">This I deem a mistake. The act of 1849 <em>(Laws of </em>1849, <em>p. </em>442, \u00a7 5) does not call the notes \u201c premium notes,\u201d but \u201c notes received in advance for premiums,\u201d &amp;c.; and such notes, when given <em>under that section, </em>are to be \u201c considered as part of the capital stock;\u201d and these are negotiable and payable absolutely and in full, without assessment or any of the provisions applicable to notes given <em>after </em>the organization, and in the course of the regular business of the company. That act, however <em>(page </em>445, \u00a7 10), authorizes such .corporations, after organization, and, indeed, requires them to declare, in their filed charter, \u201c the mode and manner \u201d of doing business <em>as such organized company. </em>And the charter of the company in the cases before us, in its 11th section \u201c(Case, <em>folio </em>25), provides for taking <em>\u201cpremium notes </em>;\u201d which certainly cannot be a part of the capital stock. So that, under the law of 1849, there was such a thing as a \u201c premium note,\u201d different and distinct from a <em>capital stock note ; </em>and the premium notes were of a different .tenor from a stock note drawn according to the law, and controlled by different rules as to calls and collection.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Taking these positions to be correct, the case of <em>White </em>agt. <em>Haight </em>(16 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>310) by no means conflicts with the other decisions I have alluded to. At p. 314 of that case, it is admitted that the note there sued (called, indeed, a \u201c premium note,\u201d) \u201c <em>formed part of the original </em>capital.\u201d So that it was, of course, under the 5th section above referred to; and though, oti. its face not of the tenor required by the act, it was (and such was the decision of that ease), <em>payable as by that section </em>the law controlling the intent of the parties^ and making that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>intent accord with the law. And the whole of that decision is, that such a note\u2014one given as part of the capital stock\u2014-is <em>a stock note, </em>and payable as such, no matter what its tenor.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">In the cases before us, however, there is neither admission nor proof that either of the notes was a part of the original stock. Nor does the referee find either of them to be so.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">The plaintiff claims, indeed, that the points on which the <em>Devendorf </em>cases were decided were not taken before the referee. But, allowing (what is by no means certain) that the 4th ground on which a non-suit was asked, \u201c that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause.of action,\u201d is not aptly taken, as taken for the want not of <em>proofs </em>but of <em>allegations, </em>or as being too indefinite; allowing this not to be well taken, the second ground for asking the non-suit, \u201c the defendant is liable only to his proportion,\u201d &amp;a, is plainly consistent with no other line of defence, than that the note was not a stock note, and so liable merely to assessment, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">I should hold these notes to be, according to their tenor (in the absence of proof to the contrary), premium notes, and not stock notes; and thus fully within the decisions in the <em>Devendorf </em>cases. Of course, the judgments should be set aside, and a new trial be had.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
