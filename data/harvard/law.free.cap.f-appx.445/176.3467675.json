After review of the parties\u2019 briefs and the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-17\">Bradshaw first claims that the district court abused its discretion by admitting evidence of previous fraud convictions under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b). Immediately after the court entered the convictions into evidence \u2014 over Bradshaw\u2019s objection \u2014 the court instructed the jury that the previous convictions could be used to determine whether Bradshaw \u201chad the state of mind or intent necessary to com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>mit the crimes charged\u201d or to help establish \u201cthe identity of [Bradshaw] ... as the perpetrator of the crime charged in the indictment.\u201d Bradshaw contends that the district court erred in allowing the jury to consider his previous convictions for purposes of establishing identity because the earlier crimes lacked sufficient distinctive characteristics to establish a modus oper-andi. Moreover, the instant offenses shared no characteristics with his previous transgressions outside of the fact that each involved fraud. Bradshaw also asserts that the other evidence offered at trial was not sufficient to render the district court\u2019s error harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to admit evidence pursuant to Rule 404(b) for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>587 F.3d 1082, 1091 (11th Cir.2009). Rule 404(b) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-5\">Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">When determining whether extrinsic-offense evidence may be introduced to prove identity, the likeness of the prior and charged offenses is the \u201ccrucial consideration.\u201d <em>United States v. Phaknikone, </em>605 F.3d 1099, 1108 (11th Cir.2010). \u201cThe physical similarity must be such that it marks the offenses as the handiwork of the accused. In other words, the evidence must demonstrate a modus operandi,\u201d otherwise the evidence is inadmissible under Rule 404(b) as proof of identity. <em>See id. </em>We review preserved evidentiary objections for harmless error. <em>United States v. Baker, </em>432 F.3d 1189, 1202 (11th Cir.2005). The government bears the burden of establishing that an error is harmless. <em>Phaknikone, </em>605 F.3d at 1109. \u201cReversal is warranted only if the error resulted in actual prejudice because it had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). We may consider the presence of overwhelming evidence of guilt as a factor in determining that an error is harmless. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">For purposes of resolving this appeal, we assume that the district court erred by initially allowing the jury to consider Bradshaw\u2019s previous convictions to establish identity for the instant offenses. However, such an error does not warrant reversal of his convictions because there was overwhelming evidence apart from these convictions to establish Bradshaw\u2019s identity as the perpetrator of the charged offenses; thus any error in admitting the previous convictions was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">Bradshaw states that his \u201cdefense at trial was that the government failed to prove he was the person who fraudulently possessed and used\u201d the credit cards at issue. The government introduced ample evidence to directly refute that. For example, as to the credit card obtained in Victim l\u2019s name, the government submitted the following evidence to demonstrate that Bradshaw committed credit card fraud: (1) a credit card was opened under the victim\u2019s name and shipped to Bradshaw\u2019s Florida address; (2) Bradshaw\u2019s first name was the password for the online application for the account; (3) the owner of a pawn shop identified Bradshaw as the individual who pawned several items and then bought them back using the fraudulently obtained credit card. Furthermore, \u201cAntonio Bradshaw\u201d was added as an authorized user of Victim 2 and 3\u2019s credit line after a phone call that originated from a number that fraud investigators traced to Bradshaw. The record also contains testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>mony from a number of merchants who implicated Bradshaw in using both credit cards.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After consideration of the record evidence, it is clear that, even without the previous convictions, the government produced overwhelming evidence of Bradshaw\u2019s guilt. Accordingly, even if there was error, it was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Bradshaw next argues that the district court should have granted his motion for judgment of acquittal on the aggravated identity theft charges. Specifically, he claims that the government failed to establish that he knew he had used identification that belonged to an actual person.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">\u201c[A defendant\u2019s] conviction must be upheld if <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, with all reasonable inferences and credibility choices made in the government\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>United States v. Gomez-Castro, </em>605 F.3d 1245, 1248 (11th Cir.2010) (citations omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">\u201cTo prove a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A, the evidence must establish \u2018that the defendant: (1) knowingly transferred, possessed, or used; (2) the means of identification of another person; (3) without lawful authority; (4) during and in relation to a felony enumerated in \u00a7 1028A(c).\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Barrington, </em>648 F.3d 1178, 1192-93 (11th Cir.2011) (footnote omitted) (quoting <em>United States v. Hurtado, </em>508 F.3d 603, 607 (11th Cir.2007) (per curiam)). Therefore, the government must demonstrate that the defendant knew that the misused identification belonged to an actual person. <em>Flores-Figueroa v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 646, 129 S.Ct. 1886, 1894, 173 L.Ed.2d 853 (2009). That knowledge may be proven with circumstantial evidence. <em>Gomez-Castro, </em>605 F.3d at 1249. \u201cBoth the circumstances in which an offender obtained a victim\u2019s identity and the offender\u2019s later misuse of that identity can shed light on the offender\u2019s knowledge about that identity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1248.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">The government provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate that Bradshaw possessed the requisite knowledge to commit aggravated identity theft both by opening a new credit card account and \u201ctaking over\u201d an existing credit card account. In the \u201ctake over\u201d circumstance, Bradshaw knew that the account could only exist if it were connected to an actual individual. Significant circumstantial evidence also demonstrates that Bradshaw was aware that information used to open the new credit card was connected to an actual person. First, Victim 1 testified that the application submitted contained his correct name, birthday, and social security number. Also, a reasonable jury could infer that Bradshaw would not have sought credit using Victim l\u2019s identification if he did not believe it to be connected to an individual with an actual credit history. <em>See United States v. Holmes, </em>595 F.3d 1255, 1258 (11th Cir.2010) (per curiam). Moreover, a Chase official testified that a fictitious identity could not be used to secure a line of credit. Even without that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>testimony, a jury, based on ordinary human experience, could quite easily conclude that credit card companies subject applications to a screener process before subjecting themselves to the risks of extending credit. <em>Cf. Gomez-Castro, </em>605 F.3d at 1249 (explaining that a jury\u2019s everyday experience would allow them to conclude that governments verify an applicants identity prior to issuing documents). Based on that evidence, a jury could determine that Bradshaw knew the identifying information he used to obtain a credit card in Victim l\u2019s name was connected to an actual individual. Therefore, we conclude that reasonable jurors could have found that Bradshaw knew the identities he used were connected with actual people.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Finally, Bradshaw argues that the district court abused its discretion by failing to consider the relevant commentary to the Sentencing Guidelines prior to imposing two partially consecutive sentences for his aggravated identity theft convictions. He points out that the Guidelines set out several factors that must be considered before imposing sentences for multiple counts of conviction, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2, and the district court failed to reference each of those factors during sentencing. Bradshaw, however, did not raise this objection to the district court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Pursuant to \u00a7 1028A, a defendant convicted of aggravated identity theft is required to serve a two-year term of imprisonment consecutive to any other sentence imposed. If a defendant has multiple convictions under \u00a7 1028A, the district court has discretion to determine whether these sentences should run concurrently with each other. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.6 cmt. n. 1(B); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 1028A(b)(4). This commentary directs the court to consult the commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2 for guidance in making that determination. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.6 cmt. n. 1(B). It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-10\">In determining whether multiple counts of 18 U.S.C. 1028A should run concurrently with, or consecutively to, each other, the court should consider the following non-exhaustive list of factors:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-11\">(i) The nature and seriousness of the underlying offenses. For example, the court should consider the appropriateness of imposing consecutive, or partially consecutive, terms of imprisonment for multiple counts of 18 U.S.C. 1028A in a case in which an underlying offense for one of the 18 U.S.C. 1028A offenses is a crime of violence or an offense enumerated in 18 U.S.C. 2382b(g)(5)(B).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-12\">(ii) Whether the underlying offenses are groupable under \u00a7 3D1.2 (Groups of Closely Related Counts). Generally, multiple counts of 18 U.S.C. 1028A should run concurrently with one another in cases in which the underlying offenses are groupable under \u00a7 3D1.2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-13\">(iii) Whether the purposes of sentencing set forth in 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2) are better achieved by imposing a concurrent or a consecutive sentence for multiple counts of 18 U.S.C. 1028A.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-14\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2, cmt. n. 2(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-15\">Here, while the district court did not explicitly mention the specific Guidelines commentary that provides the analysis for determining whether multiple aggravated felony convictions warrant concurrent or consecutive sentences, that omission does not constitute plain error. First, Bradshaw points to no binding precedent that requires the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>to explicitly discuss the list of non-exhaustive factors present in comments to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2. Second, the transcript reveals that the district court did consider the nature and seriousness of the underlying offenses, and it explicitly discussed the \u00a7 3558(a) factors. Therefore, it clearly considered two of the three factors in the comments to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not plainly err in applying partially consecutive sentences for the two separate \u00a7 1028A convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b201-9\">. Two different courses of conduct were the focus of Bradshaw's indictment and trial. First, the government alleged that in August 2005, Bradshaw opened a credit card in another individual\u2019s (\"Victim 1\") name. Second, approximately 2 months later, Bradshaw accessed an unknowing couple\u2019s (\"Victim 2 and Victim 3\") line of credit through an \"authorized user\u201d credit card that had been issued in his name. The latter is known as an account \u201ctake over.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b203-8\">. Two additional facts minimize any potential for injurious effect. First, the government never argued, to the court or the jury, that the previous convictions should be considered for purposes of establishing identity. More importantly, during jury instructions, the district court properly directed the jury to consider the previous convictions only in determining whether Bradshaw possessed the necessary intent to commit the crimes. That mitigated the initially erroneous statement that the jury could consider the previous convictions for identity purposes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b204-7\">.
