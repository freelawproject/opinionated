Baird, II, is serving a 1,190-month sentence after pleading guilty to possession, production, and transportation of child pornography and to traveling in interstate commerce for the purpose of engaging in illicit sexual conduct with a minor. Proceeding <em>pro se </em>and claiming that his counsel provided ineffective assistance in violation of his Sixth Amendment right, Baird appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentences. Specifically, Baird argues that counsel failed to adequately explain a clause in Baird\u2019s plea agreement because counsel was unfamiliar with parts of the relevant law. As a result, Baird says he was not in a position to knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily accept the plea agreement in which he waived his right to ask the court to impose a sentence below the advisory guideline range.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Counsel\u2019s failure, Baird asserts, not only met the standard for deficient performance. But it also prejudiced him by precluding him from challenging an unreasonably lengthy and severe sentence. After a thorough review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm Baird\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-15\">In a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceeding, we review a district court\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error. <em>Rhode v. United States, </em>583 F.3d 1289, 1290 (11th Cir.2009). We review claims for ineffective assistance of counsel <em>de novo </em>as a mixed question of law and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>fact. <em>Michael v. Crosby, </em>430 F.3d 1310, 1318 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Generally, when a conviction is based on a guilty plea, the defendant waives all non-jurisdictional challenges, including those of a constitutional nature. <em>Wilson v. United States, </em>962 F.2d 996, 997 (11th Cir.1992). This rule applies equally to direct appeal and collateral attack: a \u00a7 2255 movant who entered a valid guilty plea waives any pre-plea ineffective assistance claims that do not concern his decision to enter the plea. <em>See id. </em>However, insofar as the movant challenges the knowing and voluntary nature of the plea, as Baird does here, collateral attack is permitted. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">To make a successful claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must meet a two-pronged test. He must show that: (1) counsel\u2019s performance was deficient; and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced his defense. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Both parts of the test must be met. If a defendant cannot satisfy the performance prong, a court does not need to address the prejudice prong, and vice versa. <em>Michael, </em>430 F.3d at 1319.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Baird argues that he satisfies the deficient performance prong because his attorney, Jonathan Wesson, failed to adequately explain the following clause of his plea agreement: \u201cShould the defendant ask the court to impose a sentence below the advisory guideline range on any basis, including but not limited to factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553, the government will consider this agreement null and void.\u201d The record reveals that Wesson\u2019s failure to explain this clause properly prior to Baird\u2019s acceptance of the plea agreement stemmed from Wesson\u2019s unfamiliarity with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553, which mandates that a court not impose a sentence \u201cgreater than necessary\u201d to achieve a number of important purposes, such as, <em>inter alia, </em>promoting respect for the law, providing just punishment for the offense, and protecting the public from further crimes by the defendant. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). As a result of Wesson\u2019s explanatory failure, Baird asserts, Baird \u201cunknowingly]\u201d waived his right to ask the court for a sentence below what the sentencing guidelines advised, essentially giving both the court and the government free rein to \u201cdo as they wish[ed] with\u201d him, \u201cwith no possibility of objection.\u201d For this reason, insists Baird, Wesson\u2019s performance was constitutionally deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">An evidentiary hearing was held to ascertain the validity of Baird\u2019s \u00a7 2255 claims. This evidentiary hearing resulted in the district court finding that, while Wesson failed to explain the \u00a7 3553 factors to Baird, Wesson did tell Baird repeatedly at every stage of the proceeding that he would likely receive a life sentence if he accepted the plea agreement. Beyond this, nothing prohibited Baird\u2019s sentencing court from imposing a below-guideline sentence on its own. In addition, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s conclusion both disputing Baird\u2019s claims regarding what Wesson told him about sentencing and designating Baird \u201can astoundingly unbelievable witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">We refrain from determining here whether Wesson\u2019s failure to explain the law underlying federal sentencing policy thoroughly to Baird constituted deficient performance falling outside the \u201cwide range\u201d of professionally competent assistance. <em>Payne v. Allen, </em>539 F.3d 1297, 1317 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation marks omitted). Determining that issue is unnecessary because, regardless of whether there was deficient performance on the part of his counsel, Baird has failed to satisfy the second prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test. That is, he has not shown that coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>sel\u2019s failure to explain \u00a7 3553 in the context of the plea agreement prejudiced his defense. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. Consequently, we hold that Baird is not entitled to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Baird contends that had counsel informed him of his ability to challenge a particularly severe sentence using the \u00a7 3553 factors, he would have never entered into the plea agreement that waived his right to ask for a below-guideline sentence based on those factors. For this reason, Baird claims, counsel\u2019s failure to explain the \u00a7 3553 factors in the context of the plea agreement caused him to suffer prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">However, the district court, whose factual findings we adopt in the absence of clear error, <em>see United States v. McPhee, </em>336 F.3d 1269, 1275 (11th Cir.2003) (\u201cUnder the clearly erroneous standard, we must affirm the district court unless review of the entire record leaves us with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d (quotation marks omitted)), determined that the factual premises of this argument were invalid. First, it found that, contrary to Baird\u2019s assertions, Baird understood that \u201che was almost certain to receive a life sentence\u201d when he pleaded guilty. Second, the district court found that, with both a conviction and life sentence likely, Baird\u2019s primary concern in negotiating a plea agreement was limiting the government\u2019s ability to forfeit his property. This aim was achieved through the final plea agreement, which left Baird\u2019s home and farm untouched. Accepting these factual findings, particularly that Baird\u2019s decision to plead guilty was driven by a desire to protect his home and farm and was undertaken with the knowledge that a life sentence was likely, we conclude that there is no reasonable probability that counsel\u2019s provision of full and correct information regarding \u00a7 3553 would have altered Baird\u2019s decision to plead guilty. Under the circumstances, Baird had ample motivation to accept the plea and save his property. And by failing to show a \u201creasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial,\u201d <em>Gordon v. United States, </em>518 F.3d 1291, 1297 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation marks omitted), we hold that Baird has failed to meet his burden under the prejudice prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">This conclusion draws further support from the sweeping language of the waiver provision in the plea agreement at issue here. Specifically, that provision precludes Baird from \u201cask[ing] the court to impose a sentence below the advisory guideline range <em>on any basis, </em>including but not limited to factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553.\u201d (Emphasis added.) While he may not have understood \u00a7 3553, Baird does not dispute that he knew that he was waiving his right to argue for a below-guideline sentence \u201con any basis\u201d when he entered the plea. Thus, the plain language of this waiver buttresses our conclusion that a specific explanation regarding the \u00a7 3553 factors would not have made a difference here.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">Because he was not prejudiced by any deficiencies in his representation, we hold that Baird entered his plea of guilty knowingly and voluntarily. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b277-11\">. While the Certificate of Appealability (\u201cCOA\") refers to \u201cwaivers\u201d in the plural, the only waiver Baird discusses in his brief is the waiver of the right to argue for a below-guideline total sentence under \u00a7 3553. Therefore, even though Baird is a <em>pro se </em>litigant on appeal, the issue of any other waiver in the plea agreement as to which counsel may have been ineffective has been abandoned. <em>See United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1283 n. 8 (11th Cir.2003); <em>see also Irwin v. Hawk, </em>40 F.3d 347, 347 n. 1 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
