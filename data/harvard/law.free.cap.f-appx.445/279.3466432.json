On appeal, Zambrano argues that the BIA did not make an explicit adverse credibility finding, and alternatively, that the record does not support such a finding. Zambrano also argues that the BIA did not make a finding regarding past persecution, and therefore her ease should be remanded.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">We review the BIA\u2019s decision as the final judgment, unless the BIA has expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir.2007). Here, because the BIA issued its own opinion upholding the IJ\u2019s decision, we review only the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>Kueviakoe v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>567 F.3d 1301, 1304 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">We review the BIA\u2019s factual determinations under the substantial evidence test. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005). We must \u201caffirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). Under this test, we view \u201cthe record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">To qualify for asylum, an applicant must show, with specific and credible evidence, either past persecution or a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of future persecution on a protected ground. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286-87 (11th Cir.2005); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b). Credible testimony \u201cmay be sufficient to sustain the applicant\u2019s burden without corroboration.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(b)(l)(B)(ii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(ii). Conversely, an adverse credibility determination alone may support a denial of an asylum claim, but if the applicant produces evidence other than her testimony, the IJ and the BIA must consider this evidence as well. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-12\">In evaluating credibility, the IJ and BIA must consider the \u201ctotality of the circumstances,\u201d including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-13\">demeanor, candor, or responsiveness of the applicant or witness, the inherent plausibility of the applicant\u2019s or witness\u2019s account, the consistency between the applicant\u2019s or witness\u2019s written and oral statements (whenever made and whether or not under oath, and considering the circumstances under which the statements were made), the internal consistency of each such statement, the consistency of such statements with other evidence of record (including the reports of the Department of State on country conditions), and any inaccuracies or falsehoods in such statements, without regard to whether an inconsis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>tency, inaccuracy, or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim, or any other relevant factor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">INA \u00a7 208(b)(1 )(B)(iii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). When making an adverse credibility finding, the IJ and BIA must be explicit and offer \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d for the finding. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Here, contrary to Zambrano s contention, the BIA made an explicit adverse credibility finding. That determination was based on several inconsistencies between Zambrano\u2019s asylum application, her testimony, and the documentary evidence she submitted. Specifically, the BIA pointed to discrepancies regarding the details of an incident in which her father was shot, and discrepancies regarding her interactions with smugglers in Colombia. In relying upon these inconsistencies, which are supported by the record, the BIA provided \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d for its adverse credibility determination. <em>See Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1233 (11th Cir.2006). As Zambrano did not submit any other corroborating evidence besides the documents that created inconsistencies with her testimony, the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination was sufficient to support the denial of Zambrano\u2019s asylum claim. <em>See Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Because Zambrano failed to meet the burden on her asylum claim, her claim for withholding of removal necessarily failed. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1303. Having disposed of Zambrano\u2019s asylum claim as such, the IJ was not obligated to make specific findings regarding past persecution with respect to Zambrano\u2019s claim for withholding of removal. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1249 n. 3 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-1\">Accordingly, we deny Zambrano\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-2\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b304-8\">. As Zambrano does not raise any challenge in her brief to the denial of CAT relief, that claim is abandoned. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
