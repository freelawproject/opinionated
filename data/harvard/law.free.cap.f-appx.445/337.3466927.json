On appeal, Lanier argues that the district court imposed a procedurally and substantively unreasonable sentence. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion using a two-step process. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008). We look first at whether the district court committed any significant procedural error, such as miscalculating the advisory guidelines range, treating the guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to explain adequately the chosen sentence. <em>Id. </em>Then, we examine whether the sentence is substantively unreasonable under the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>Defendant Lanier bears the burden to show his sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-12\">In this case, Defendant Lanier has not shown that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable. Contrary to Lanier\u2019s assertion, the district court explicitly stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The district court\u2019s statement that it had taken the factors into account was sufficient. <em>See United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Defendant Lanier\u2019s argument that the district court relied solely on Lanier\u2019s criminal history in fashioning a sentence lacks merit. In addition to discussing La-nier\u2019s extensive criminal history, the district court stated that a 188-month sentence was necessary to protect the public from further criminal activity, command respect for the law and serve as a deterrent. Although the district court spent considerable time discussing Lanier\u2019s criminal history, it did so to explain why it was not persuaded by Lanier\u2019s argument that his criminal history warranted a downward variance. Moreover, even if the district court gave great weight to Lanier\u2019s criminal history, it was within its discretion to do so. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Defendant Lanier objects to the district court\u2019s statement that Lanier had received \u201ca little bit of a break\u201d because four of his more serious prior convictions were not counted toward his criminal history score. This statement does not reflect an inappropriate consideration of Lanier\u2019s criminal history. Again, the district court was explaining its reasons for denying Lanier\u2019s request for a downward variance, not fashioning a sentence based upon those four uncounted convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">We also cannot say the district court\u2019s 188-month sentence, at the low end of the advisory guidelines range of 188 to 235 months, is substantively unreasonable. Although we do not apply a presumption of reasonableness, we ordinarily expect a sentence within the correctly calculated guidelines range to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008). A sentence imposed well below the statutory maximum (in this case forty years, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B)) is another indicator of a reasonable sentence. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">Here, Defendant Lanier acted as a \u201cgo-between\u201d for a drug-trafficking organization, collecting $100 commissions for bringing customers to his suppliers. During three separate controlled buys over a fourth-month period, Lanier facilitated the sale of a total of 113.5 grams of crack cocaine. After one of the controlled buys, Lanier promised the confidential informant he could deliver any type and amount of drug the confidential informant wanted. While Lanier tries to minimize his role in the drug-trafficking organization, he did not request a minor-role reduction and his role was essential to both the three transactions and the overall drug distribution conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">In addition, Defendant Lanier had an extensive criminal history and qualified as a career offender under the Sentencing Guidelines. Five of his scored prior convictions involved drug offenses. Lanier had over thirty prior convictions, some for drug offenses, that were not scored. The district court was within its discretion to conclude that Lanier\u2019s criminal history category of VI and career offender status did not over-represent the seriousness of his criminal history and to refuse Lanier\u2019s request for a downward variance on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">The district court considered Lanier\u2019s argument that his status as a go-between earning only small commissions was a mitigating factor warranting a downward variance. However, the district court clearly concluded that this factor was outweighed by Lanier\u2019s serious criminal history and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>the need to protect the public, promote respect for the law and deter future crimes. Lanier has not given us a reason to disturb the district court\u2019s judgment. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201c[T]he weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d (quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Under the totality of the circumstances, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in imposing a 188-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b362-7\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
