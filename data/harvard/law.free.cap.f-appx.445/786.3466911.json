United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). If the district court\u2019s decision is procedurally sound, this court will \u201cconsider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A sentence that falls within the applicable guidelines range \u201cis presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding the application of the presumption of reasonableness to sentences within a properly calculated guidelines range).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>Because Zuniga did not sufficiently raise below his argument that the district court failed to explain adequately the sentence imposed, we review for the issue for plain error. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007). Zuniga properly concedes that under plain error review, his procedural reasonableness argument is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 365 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">Further, we reject Zuniga\u2019s argument that <em>Pepper v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1229, 1246-49, 179 L.Ed.2d 196 (2011), contravenes this court\u2019s holding in <em>Mondragon-Santiago </em>that a sentence that falls within a guidelines range calculated pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 366-67. Zuniga\u2019s policy-based arguments attacking the underpinnings of \u00a7 2L1.2 essentially invite this court to engage in impermissible \u201csubstantive second-guessing of the sentencing court.\u201d <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 767 (5th Cir.2008). He fails to overcome the presumption of reasonableness afforded his sentence. <em>See Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d at 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b810-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
