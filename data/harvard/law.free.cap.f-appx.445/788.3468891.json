Tovar\u2019s counsel, the Federal Public Defender (FPD), raises a single issue on appeal. Counsel argues that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), the statute under which Tovar was convicted, is unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). The FPD concedes that this argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent in <em>United States v. Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d 580, 582-84 (5th Cir.2000), and he raises the issue solely to preserve it for possible further review. Because Tovar\u2019s argument is foreclosed, the Government\u2019s motion for summary af-firmance is GRANTED, its alternative motion for an extension of time is DENIED as unnecessary, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">Garcia\u2019s appointed counsel has moved for leave to withdraw and has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Garcia has filed a response. Insofar as Garcia argues that his counsel was ineffective, the general rule in this circuit is that a claim of \u201cineffective assistance of counsel cannot be resolved on direct appeal when the claim has not been raised before the district court since no opportunity existed to develop the record on the merits of the allegations.\u201d <em>United States v. Cantwell, </em>470 F.3d 1087, 1091 (5th Cir.2006). Because the present record is not sufficiently developed and Garcia has not even identified an issue for appeal, we will not consider Garcia\u2019s claim on direct appeal. <em>Cantwell, </em>470 F.3d at 1091.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief, Garcia\u2019s response, and the relevant portions of the record. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no non-frivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"Avo\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
