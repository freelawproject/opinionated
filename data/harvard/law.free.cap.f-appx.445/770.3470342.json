Milton, III, federal prisoner # 24395-034, was convicted of conspiring to possess crack and powder cocaine with intent to distribute. He challenges the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>denial of a motion that he labeled as arising under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 36. His request for a certificate of appealability is DENIED as unnecessary, because he is not challenging \u201cthe final order in a proceeding under\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">In his filing with this court, Milton contends that relief under Rule 36 is proper because his arguments concerning the district court\u2019s alleged failure to comply with certain portions of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32 relate to ministerial matters. We disagree and discern no error in the district court\u2019s holding that Milton\u2019s motion, which raised a claim that did not pertain to a clerical matter and that could have been presented earlier, was an unauthorized successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See United States v. Orozco-Ramirez, </em>211 F.3d 862, 867 (5th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Key, </em>205 F.3d 773, 774 (5th Cir.2000); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">The judgment is AFFIRMED, and Milton\u2019s motion to proceed <em>informa pauperis </em>is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b794-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
