In March 2008, the Department of Homeland Security served Campbell with a notice to appear charging that he was removeable (1) under Immigration and Nationality Act \u00a7 212(a)(2)(C) as an alien who has engaged in the trafficking of a controlled substance and (2) under INA \u00a7 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) as an alien convicted of a controlled substance offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">At Campbell\u2019s removal hearing, the government submitted evidence of his 1981 conviction for distribution of and possession with intent to distribute heroin. The IJ denied Campbell\u2019s request for a hearing on the trafficking charge because Campbell remained removeable based on his prior conviction for a controlled substance offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">At a later hearing Campbell submitted an application for a waiver of inadmissibility under former INA \u00a7 212(c) and an application for withholding of removal under the United Nations Convention Against Torture, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c). The IJ denied Campbell\u2019s request for a hearing on his \u00a7 212(c) application, granted the government\u2019s motion to pretermit Campbell\u2019s \u00a7 212(c) application, and denied Campbell\u2019s CAT claim after a separate hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">Campbell contends that the IJ and the BIA erred by finding that: (1) he was ineligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under former INA \u00a7 212(c) because he was convicted after a jury trial rather than after pleading guilty, and (2) his evidence was insufficient to establish eligibility for withholding of removal under CAT. Campbell also contends that he was deprived of due process because the IJ denied his requests for an evidentiary hearing and because the IJ deprived him of a fair hearing on his CAT claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-13\">We review <em>de novo </em>issues of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006) The plain language of the INA precludes judicial review of an IJ\u2019s final order of removal for an alien who is removeable for having committed certain offenses, including a controlled substance offense. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(C) (\u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law ..., no court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed [a controlled substance offense].\u201d) Accordingly, \u201c[w]hen [a criminal] alien petitions for review of a removal order denying his CAT claim, we may not review the administrative fact findings of the IJ or the BIA as to the sufficiency of the alien\u2019s evidence and the likelihood that the alien will be tortured if returned to the country in question.\u201d <em>Singh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>561 F.3d 1275, 1280-81 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-14\">Campbell admitted that he had been convicted of distribution of and possession with intent to distribute heroin. Therefore, to the extent Campbell challenges the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s finding that he failed to establish his eligibility for relief under CAT, we dismiss the petition for review for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The INA does, however, preserve our jurisdiction to review the legal and constitutional issues Campbell raises. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(D) (\u201cNothing in subparagraph (B) or (C), or in any other provision of this chapter (other than this section) which limits or eliminates judicial review, shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Because the BIA did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s opinion, we review only the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). We review questions of law <em>de novo, </em>with appropriate deference to the BIA\u2019s reasonable interpretation of the statute in question. <em>Ferguson v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>563 F.3d 1254, 1269 n. 25 (11th Cir.2009). However, no deference is owed to an agency interpretation involving the retroactive application of a statute. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Under the law as it existed at the time of Campbell\u2019s 1981 conviction, an alien could apply for discretionary relief under former INA \u00a7 212(c) during the course of removal proceedings. However, \u00a7 212(c) was repealed by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) and \u201creplaced ... with a new section that gives the Attorney General the authority to cancel removal for a narrow class of inadmissible or deportable aliens.\u201d <em>INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 297, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 2277, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001). Nevertheless, in <em>St. Cyr, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u00a7 212(c) relief remained available to an alien who had been convicted of a disqualifying offense by plea agreement before enactment of IIRIRA. <em>St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. at 314-15, 121 S.Ct. at 2287. Focusing on the <em>quid pro quo </em>nature of a plea agreement, the Supreme Court held that IIRIRA\u2019s repeal of \u00a7 212(c) had an impermissible retroactive effect on \u201cpeople who entered into plea agreements\u201d because such persons \u201calmost certainly relied upon [the] likelihood [of obtaining \u00a7 212(c) relief] in deciding whether to forgo [the] right to a trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 321-25, 121 S.Ct. at 2291-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">In this case, the BIA found that Campbell was ineligible for relief under former INA \u00a7 212(c) because he was convicted of distribution of and possession with intent to distribute heroin \u2014 a drug trafficking offense \u2014 after a jury trial rather than after pleading guilty in reliance on the continued availability of \u00a7 212(c) relief. Campbell argues that the BIA erred because the IIRIRA\u2019s repeal cannot retroactively be applied to him. That argument is foreclosed by our precedent. In <em>Ferguson v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>563 F.3d 1254 (11th Cir.2009), an alien who was convicted of a felony after a trial sought to \u201cextend <em>St. Cyr </em>outside of the guilty plea context.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1263; <em>see St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. at 297, 121 S.Ct. at 2277. We held that \u201creliance is a core component of <em>St. </em>GyFs retroactivity analysis as it applies to aliens challenging the application of IIRIRA\u2019s repeal of \u00a7 212(c).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1269-70. Joining the majority of other circuits, we held that <em>St. Cyr </em>does not apply \u2014 and \u00a7 212(c) relief is unavailable \u2014 to aliens who were convicted after a trial \u201cbecause such aliens\u2019 decisions to go to trial do not satisfy <em>St. Cyr\u2019s </em>reliance requirement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, Ferguson could not seek relief under the repealed statute because she did not enter a guilty plea in reliance on the continuing availability of \u00a7 212(c) relief. <em>Id. </em>at 1271.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">Campbell\u2019s case in indistinguishable from <em>Ferguson. </em>Because Campbell did not plead guilty to his drug trafficking offense, he cannot demonstrate that he detrimentally relied on the continued availability of a \u00a7 212(e) waiver of inadmissibili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>ty. Since detrimental reliance is a critical element of any claim for \u00a7 212(c) relief based on an alleged impermissible retroactive application of IIRIRA, we deny Campbell\u2019s petition for review of the BIA\u2019s denial of \u00a7 212(c) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Campbell also contends that he was denied due process of law because the IJ refused his requests for a hearing on his removability and on his application for \u00a7 212(c) relief and that he was deprived of a fair hearing on his CAT claim. Campbell\u2019s due process claim concerning the IJ\u2019s refusal to conduct a hearing on his request for relief under former INA \u00a7 212(c) is without merit because \u201c[t]here is no constitutionally protected right to discretionary relief, which is the relief requested here.\u201d <em>Zafar v. United States Atty. Gen., </em>461 F.3d 1357, 1367 (11th Cir.2006) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Campbell\u2019s other constitutional claims also lack merit. Due process requires \u201ca full and fair hearing.\u201d <em>Ibrahim v. INS, </em>821 F.2d 1547, 1550 (11th Cir.1987). Accordingly, aliens must receive \u201cnotice and an opportunity to be heard in their removal proceedings.\u201d <em>Fernandez-Bernal v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>257 F.3d 1304, 1310 n. 8 (11th Cir.2001). To prevail on a due process claim, however, an alien must show substantial prejudice\u2014namely, that the outcome would have been different \u201cin the absence of the alleged procedural deficiencies.\u201d <em>Patel v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>334 F.3d 1259, 1263 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">To the extent that Campbell argues that he was denied due process by the IJ\u2019s failure to hold a hearing on his removability, his claim lacks merit because he has failed to identify any evidence that he could have presented to rebut the charges of removal. And even if Campbell successfully challenged the drug trafficking charge under INA \u00a7 212(a)(2)(C), he remained removeable under \u00a7 212(a)(2)(a)(i)(II) as an alien convicted of a controlled substance offense; he admitted his 1981 conviction. <em>See De Sandoval v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1276, 1285 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cPetitioner fails to show how the additional procedures she demands would have changed the result in her case because she has admitted all of the facts necessary to warrant reinstatement of the original removal order_\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">Finally, Campbell argues that the IJ exhibited hostility toward him at his CAT hearing and that the IJ\u2019s bias against him amounted to a denial of due process because he was deprived of a full and fair hearing. But even though the IJ expressed frustration with Campbell\u2019s counsel at the hearing, \u201cexpressions of impatience, dissatisfaction, annoyance, and even anger, that are within the bounds of what imperfect men and women ... sometimes display,\u201d do not establish bias or partiality. <em>Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555-56, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 1157, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994). Furthermore, as the BIA noted, the IJ reviewed Campbell\u2019s evidence and gave his counsel multiple opportunities to identify what evidence he was relying on to assert that Campbell would be tortured after being deported. Accordingly, Campbell was not deprived of a full and fair hearing on his CAT claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
