Propes, Texas prisoner # 1178904, moves this court for a certificate of appealability (COA) to appeal the dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition as an untimely 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 application. Propes is serving an 18-year sentence for murder. He argues that he is not attempting to challenge his murder conviction, but rather is attempting to test the constitutionality of the State\u2019s actions in withholding certain DNA, ballistic, and forensic evidence from him both before trial and after his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-9\">This court may not grant a COA unless Propes makes \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d \u00a7 2253(c)(2). When a \u00a7 2254 application is dismissed on procedural grounds, \u201ca COA should issue when the prisoner shows, at least, that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-10\">Propes\u2019s claim that the State withheld evidence implicitly challenges the validity of his conviction. Therefore, the district court properly construed this action as arising under \u00a7 2254. <em>See Davis v. Fechtel, </em>150 F.3d 486, 490 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-11\">The instant \u00a7 2254 application is Propes\u2019s third such filing. The instant \u00a7 2254 application alleged defects in Propes\u2019s conviction that occurred at trial or before he filed his first federal application in 2005; therefore, his current application is successive. <em>Propes v. Quarterman, </em>573 F.3d 225, 230 (5th Cir.2009); <em>see Leal Garcia v. Quarterman, </em>573 F.3d 214, 222 (5th Cir.2009); <em>In re Flowers, </em>595 F.3d 204, 205 (5th Cir.2009). An applicant for relief under \u00a7 2254 must obtain this court\u2019s authorization before filing a second or successive application. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). This court did not authorize the filing of a successive \u00a7 2254 application in this case. Because Propes\u2019s petition was an unauthorized successive \u00a7 2254 application, reasonable jurists would not find the district court\u2019s dismissal of his application debatable or wrong. <em>See Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595. Consequently, his motion for a COA is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-16\">Propes has previously been warned that frivolous, repetitive, or otherwise abusive filings would invite sanctions. Propes has failed to heed this warning. According, Propes is ORDERED to pay a sanction in the amount of $100 to the Clerk of this Court. He is BARRED from filing any pleading in this court or in any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction challenging his murder conviction until the sanction has been paid in full, unless he first obtains leave of the court in which he seeks to file such a challenge. Propes is further CAUTIONED that future attempts to evade the requirements of \u00a7 2244 and any future frivolous, repetitive, or otherwise abusive filings in the district court or in this court will subject him to additional and progressively more severe sanctions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b791-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
