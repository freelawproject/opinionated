He argued that the government orally agreed to file such a motion for substantial assistance that he had provided after sentencing and that the government had refused to file the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-11\">Neither party makes a jurisdictional challenge, but we must consider this court\u2019s and the district court\u2019s jurisdictional basis. <em>See United States v. Key, </em>205 F.3d 773, 774 (5th Cir.2000). The district court has jurisdiction to correct or modify Martinez\u2019s sentence in limited circumstances under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(b) and (c). The applicable provision confers jurisdiction if the government moves to reduce a sentence under Rule 35(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-12\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that a promise was made, the district court has jurisdiction to review the government\u2019s refusal to file a Rule 35 motion only where the defendant has made a substantial threshold showing that the government has refused based on an \u201cunconstitutional motive.\u201d <em>United States v. Sneed, </em>63 F.3d 381, 388 n. 6 (5th Cir.1995). Martinez did not allege or demonstrate any unconstitutional motive that might have permitted the court to review the refusal to file a Rule 35(b) motion. The motion to compel was thus \u201can unauthorized motion which the district court was without jurisdiction to entertain,\u201d because the \u201cmotion and situation do not fit any provision\u201d of the Rule. <em>United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 142 (5th Cir.1994). Accordingly, we AFFIRM on the alternative grounds that the district court lacked jurisdiction to grant the motion. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b767-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
