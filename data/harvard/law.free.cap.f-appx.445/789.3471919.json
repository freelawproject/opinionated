Amaya was sentenced to 24 months of imprisonment, which constituted an upward variance from his advisory guidelines range of 8 to 14 months of imprisonment, and three years of supervised release. He contends that his sentence is greater than necessary to satisfy the requirements of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">The district court found that the Guidelines \u201cdo not adequately account for all of the criminal convictions that in this defendant\u2019s background.\u201d The court noted six adult convictions that did not score any criminal history points, and the court found that the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need to promote respect for the law, and the need to protect the public were not adequately served by the advisory guideline range. In overruling Amaya\u2019s objection to the sentence, the court also noted Amaya\u2019s prior 18-month sentence for a prior illegal reentry conviction and indicated that a higher sentence was necessary in order to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct. Thus, the district court made an individual assessment and concluded that the advisory guidelines range gave insufficient weight to some of the sentencing factors. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>517 F.3d 801, 809 (5th Cir.2008). Amaya\u2019s above-guidelines sentence was reasonable in light of \u201cthe totality of the circumstances,\u201d and we \u201cmust give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">Amaya characterizes his criminal history as relatively minor, but his criminal history includes numerous convictions and arrests for serious offenses and supports the district court\u2019s upward variance. <em>See United States v. Herrera-Garduno, </em>519 F.3d 526, 531 (5th Cir.2008). He complains that \u00a7 2L1.2 increases a defendant\u2019s offense level based on criminal history, which Chapter 4 of the Guidelines also take into account. Only one of Amaya\u2019s prior sentences scored criminal history points under Chapter 4. In any case, we have rejected the contention that the use of a prior conviction both to increase the offense level and to calculate the criminal history category is impermissible. <em>United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir. 2009). We have also rejected the argument that a sentence is excessive because illegal reentry is a trespassing crime. <em>See United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b813-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
