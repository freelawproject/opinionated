By Sling such a motion, McClure is challenging the magistrate judge\u2019s eertiScation, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3) and Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 24(a), that any appeal would not be taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">A prisoner must properly exhaust the prison grievance procedure before he may Sle a \u00a7 1983 suit against prison of Scials. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a); <em>Woodford v. Ngo, </em>548 U.S. 81, 93, 95, 126 S.Ct. 2378, 165 L.Ed.2d 368 (2006). McClure makes a conclusional assertion that the defendant\u2019s claim that he failed to exhaust is incorrect. However, he does not argue that he timely Sled both Step 1 and 2 grievances regarding the alleged August 3, 2007, incident, as required by the Texas prison grievance procedure. <em>See Johnson v. Johnson, </em>385 F.3d 503, 515 (5th Cir.2004). His argument that he could have shown that he suffers post traumatic stress disorder if he had been allowed discovery does not address the magistrate judge\u2019s reasons for granting the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and for dismissing the appeal \u2014 McClure\u2019s failure to exhaust.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">McClure asserts that the district court ignored that he had filed suit against the grievance department investigator, D. Fenner, and he argues that because of Fenner\u2019s interference with his grievances, his failure to exhaust should be excused. In his original complaint, McClure asserted simply that Fenner \u201cfailed to protect\u201d and \u201cfailed to uphold due process of law.\u201d He did not assert that Fenner or anyone else interfered with the grievance process. He raised that assertion for the first time in his \u201cobjections\u201d to the magistrate judge\u2019s judgment. However, McClure did not file a notice of appeal from the magistrate judge\u2019s denial of his objections to the judgment, which the magistrate judge construed as a motion for reconsideration under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b). Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to review the denial of that motion. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(l)(A)(vi), (B)(ii); <em>see also Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 214, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007); <em>Williams v. Chater, </em>87 F.3d 702, 704-06 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-12\">McClure has not shown any error in the magistrate judge\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(a). McClure\u2019s request for IFP status is denied. McClure\u2019s appeal is frivolous, <em>see Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983), and it is dismissed, <em>see Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. McClure\u2019s motion for the appointment of appellate counsel is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-13\">The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). We caution McClure that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-14\">MOTION FOR IFP DENIED; MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF COUN<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>SEL DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b779-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
