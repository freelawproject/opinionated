Liu contends the BIA and IJ erred in concluding he was not credible because substantial evidence supported his asylum claims. After review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>we affirm the BIA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">An alien\u2019s credible testimony, without further corroboration, can be sufficient to meet the applicant\u2019s burden in establishing eligibility for relief from removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b) (1 )(B )(ii). Under the REAL ID Act of 2005:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-6\">Considering the totality of circumstances, and all relevant factors, a trier of fact may base a credibility determination on the demeanor, candor, or responsiveness of the applicant or witness, the inherent plausibility of the applicant\u2019s or witness\u2019s account, the consistency between the applicant\u2019s or witness\u2019s written and oral statements (whenever made and whether or not under oath, and considering the circumstances under which the statements were made), the internal consistency of each such statement, the consistency of such statements with other evidence of record (including the reports of the Department of State on country conditions), and any inaccuracies or falsehoods in such statements, without regard to whether an inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim, or any other relevant factor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). The court may deny asylum relief if the court finds the applicant\u2019s testimony is not credible, and the applicant produces insufficient corroborating evidence to rebut any inconsistencies or omissions. <em>Xia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>608 F.3d 1233, 1240 (11th Cir.2010). Reliable testimony is marked by \u201cconsistency on direct examination, consistency with the written application, and the absence of embellishments.\u201d <em>Shkambi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>584 F.3d 1041, 1049 (11th Cir.2009). The IJ must offer specific, cogent reasons for the adverse-credibility finding, and it is the alien\u2019s burden to show that the credibility finding was not properly supported. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s adverse-credibility determination and the BIA offered specific, cogent reasons for its determination. The BIA based its decision upon several inconsistencies between Liu\u2019s application, testimony, and submitted documents. Specifically, the BIA noted Liu testified he was in jail for a little more than a month, but his asylum application stated he was in jail for a half of a year. Liu testified his robbery arrest was in 1993, but his asylum application stated that the arrest was in 1994. The BIA also noted the July 2006 medical records Liu provided did not mention his wife\u2019s IUD. In addition, the July 2006 medical records indicated his wife had a previous abortion, which contradicted Liu\u2019s testimony his wife had only had one abortion in May 2007. The other medical reports Liu provided did not mention the presence of an IUD at the relevant time. The BIA noted the November 2008 X-ray report listed Liu\u2019s wife\u2019s age incorrectly. The BIA further noted Liu failed to support his assertion that Chinese officials forcibly beat him and told him he had to report to the police following his wife\u2019s abortion by producing medical records, subpoenas, or warrants. Further, the BIA reasonably found Liu\u2019s limited education could not excuse the discrepancies in his story.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-11\">The BIA also concluded Liu\u2019s religious claims were inconsistent. The BIA noted Liu first testified his wife went to church with him once and then testified she attended church services three or four times. In addition, Liu\u2019s testimony regarding his wife\u2019s limited religious activities was incon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>sistent with his wife\u2019s statement she often went to Christian parties, visited sick friends in the hospital, and handed out religious flyers. The BIA concluded the credibility issue was dispositive and declined to address the merits of Liu\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">Liu argues he never explicitly indicated that the IUD worsened his wife\u2019s gynecological issues or that his wife never converted to Christianity. The BIA, however, did not base its adverse-credibility determination on whether it was unclear if the IUD had worsened Liu\u2019s wife\u2019s gynecological issues, but rather, the inconsistencies related to the date of the IUD insertion and forced abortion. Further, the BIA did not base its adverse-credibility determination on inconsistencies related to whether or not Liu\u2019s wife was actually baptized and converted to Christianity, but rather, the extent of her church involvement and the internal inconsistency in Liu\u2019s testimony regarding how many times she attended church. Further, there is no indication, as Liu argues, that the BIA misread the record or disregarded some of Liu\u2019s evidence. <em>See Kueviakoe v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>567 F.3d 1301, 1305-06 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Liu asserts the BIA should have focused on the apparent consistencies, and that his explanations for his inconsistencies were reasonable and should have been accepted. However, the fact the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the BIA\u2019s determination. The BIA did not err in basing its adverse-credibility determination on the inconsistencies between Liu\u2019s testimony and the other evidence, regardless of whether the inconsistencies went to the heart of Liu\u2019s claims. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). Liu\u2019s argument the inconsistencies were negligible is unpersuasive because they did not need to be central to his claim, and, moreover, the inconsistencies did involve many of the core facts of his claim. Because of the numerous inconsistencies evident from the record and explicitly detailed in the BIA\u2019s decision, the record does not compel reversal of the BIA\u2019s credibility decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">As Liu\u2019s testimony was not credible, and he failed to produce sufficient corroborating evidence to rebut inconsistencies, the adverse-credibility finding is sufficient to deny his asylum claim. <em>See Xia, </em>608 F.3d at 1240. Because Liu failed to meet the standard for asylum, he cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal or CAT relief. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, 257 </em>F.3d 1262, 1292-93, 1303-04 (11th Cir.2001) (stating an applicant who cannot meet the \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d standard for asylum cannot meet the higher standards for withholding of removal or CAT relief). Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b310-15\">. A determination that the petitioner\u2019s testimony is not credible is a finding of fact. <em>Xia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>608 F.3d 1233, 1239 (11th Cir.2010). We review factual determinations under the substantial evidence test, and \"we must affirm the BIA's decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Diallo </em>v. <em>U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 596 </em>F.3d 1329, 1332 (11th Cir.2010) (quotations omitted). Under the substantial-evidence test, we review the evidence from the record, drawing all inferences in favor of the agency\u2019s decision, and will reverse only if the record compels reversal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b311-8\">.
