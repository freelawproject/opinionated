After review of the briefs and record, we affirm as to all convictions and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>sentences, except as to their sentences on Count 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">On July 31, 2009, Defendants Rolon and Ortiz, both with extensive prior felony convictions, were arrested after they agreed to participate in, and took substantial steps toward completing, a \u201creverse sting\u201d home invasion robbery. A confidential informant (\u201cCl\u201d) alerted law enforcement that Ortiz was seeking help to rob a marijuana grow house, and Miami-Dade police and federal authorities began investigating Ortiz. Law enforcement discovered that defendant Ortiz\u2019s robbery target was not actually a marijuana grow house, and law enforcement then staged a false raid on the house to deter Ortiz\u2019s robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">A. Recorded Calls for Another Robbery</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">Thereafter, the Cl made a recorded phone call to defendant Ortiz explaining that the Cl knew someone who could arrange another home invasion robbery, defendant Ortiz agreed to meet with the Cl and the Cl\u2019s contact, who, unbeknownst to Ortiz, was an undercover Miami-Dade police detective (the \u201cundercover detective\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">Defendant Ortiz brought defendant Ro-lon to the meeting with the Cl and the undercover detective. At that meeting, which was audio and video recorded, the undercover detective told Ortiz and Rolon that he was a cocaine courier. The detective told the pair that (1) he typically transported between 20 and 25 kilograms of cocaine per delivery; (2) he had not been paid for his recent deliveries; and (3) he wanted to rob the house where he brought his deliveries (the \u201cstash house\u201d) without arousing suspicion that he had participated in the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">Defendants Ortiz and Rolon asked a number of questions, including whether there was cash in the stash house, whether the house was guarded, who was guarding it, and how many and what type of guns the guards would be carrying. Defendant Ortiz advised the undercover detective that he would bring in a third man to help with the robbery, that he and his associates were \u201cprofessionals,\u201d and that each of them would be armed and wearing police badges. Defendant Rolon specifically stated that (1) he would bring either a .9 millimeter Glock or an AR-15 assault rifle and (2) he would not hesitate to \u201cblow up someone\u2019s head\u201d if necessary. Ortiz, Ro-lon, the Cl, and the undercover detective agreed that the undercover detective and the Cl would take half of the cocaine at the stash house and that Ortiz, Rolon, and their third accomplice would split the other half among them.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">In the following days, defendant Ortiz and the Cl made several telephone calls, all recorded, during which they planned the second meeting with the undercover detective and Ortiz discussed his preparation for the robbery. At the second meeting, defendant Ortiz assured the undercover detective that Ortiz had previously committed home invasion robberies and that Ortiz and his associates would use two-way radios to communicate.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-12\">On July 31, 2009, the day of the planned robbery, the Cl placed a recorded phone call to Ortiz and told him to meet the Cl at a gas station. The undercover detective observed the gas station from across the street. Defendants Ortiz and Rolon arrived approximately 20 minutes later and provided the Cl with a black t-shirt with the letters \u201cDEA\u201d printed on the front, a black ski mask, a pair of black latex gloves, and other police apparel. Ortiz and Rolon then followed the Cl to a warehouse, where they believed the Cl was picking up a vehicle. When they arrived, law enforcement surrounded the vehicles and apprehended Ortiz and Rolon.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>Among the items police recovered from Rolon\u2019s car were two black hats with the word \u201cNarcotics\u201d written on them, a black hat with the word \u201cPolice\u201d written on it, two black t-shirts with the letters \u201cDEA\u201d on one side and the word \u201cPolice\u201d on the other side, two black ski masks, a box of latex gloves, 18 wire tie straps, three law enforcement badges, a 9 millimeter Ruger handgun and magazine loaded with 15 rounds of ammunition, and a 9 millimeter Smith &amp; Wesson handgun and magazine loaded with 12 rounds of ammunition.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Police recovered similar items \u2014 including a Ruger .357 Magnum revolver \u2014 from the car of codefendant Federico Dimolino, the third accomplice.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Defendant Ortiz admitted that he had intended to rob 25 kilograms of cocaine and that he planned the robbery. Ortiz also claimed responsibility for the two loaded handguns found in Rolon\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">B. Indictment and Convictions</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">In August 2009, a grand jury returned a ten-count indictment against defendants Ortiz, Rolon, and Dimolino. Counts 1 to 5 of the indictment charged Ortiz, Rolon, and Dimolino with (1) conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 5 kilograms or more of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846; (2) attempt to possess with intent to distribute 5 kilograms or more of cocaine, also in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846; (3) conspiracy to interfere with commerce by threats or violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a); (4) attempt to interfere with commerce by threats or violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a); and (5) conspiracy to use and carry a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence and a drug trafficking crime and to possess a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence and a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(o). Count 6 charged Ortiz and Rolon, and Count 7 charged Dimolino, with using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence and a drug trafficking crime and possessing a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence and a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Count 8 charged Ortiz and Count 9 charged Rolon with being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g) and 924(e).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Count 10 charged Dimolino with being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Ortiz and Rolon moved to dismiss the indictment due to outrageous government conduct. The district court denied their motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>At trial, defendant Ortiz mounted an unsuccessful entrapment defense. On October 7, 2010, the jury convicted Ortiz on Counts 1 to 6 and Count 8 and Rolon on Counts 1 to 6 and Count 9. Counts 1 and 2 carried a minimum penalty of ten years\u2019 up to life imprisonment. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(b). Counts 3, 4, and 5 each carried sentences of up to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1951(a), 924(o). Count 6 carried a minimum penalty of not less than five years\u2019 imprisonment, to be served consecutive to any other sentence. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(i), (e)(l)(D)(ii). Counts 8 and 9 carried a minimum penalty of 15 years\u2019 up to life imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 924(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">C. Consecutive Life Sentences</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The district court sentenced defendants Ortiz and Rolon to life imprisonment on each of Counts 1, 2, 5, and Counts 8 and 9, respectively, all to run concurrently;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 240 months\u2019 imprisonment on Counts 3 and 4, to run concurrently; and consecutive terms of life imprisonment on Count 6.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Prior to their crimes in this case, both Ortiz and Rolon had extensive criminal convictions, including multiple violent felonies. Although they raise only a few sentencing issues, we explain at length how their sentences were calculated since both defendants are serving consecutive life sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">1. Rolon\u2019s Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"A0Z\">Rolon\u2019s Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cRolon\u2019s PSI\u201d) showed that he had these Florida convictions: (1) four separate convictions in 1990 for aggravated battery (CR89-212), robbery with a deadly weapon (CR89-1901), grand theft in the third-degree of a motor vehicle, possession of burglary tools (89CF12435-0), and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon (89CF12688-0); (2) 1997 convictions for attempted second-degree murder, possession of a firearm in the commission of a felony, and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon (CR97-4069); (3) 2000 convictions for attempted first-degree murder, attempted armed kidnapping, shooting into an occupied vehicle, and use of a firearm during a felony (97-10535); and (4) a 2000 conviction for aggravated battery with a deadly weapon (98-26377). These convictions yielded 12 criminal history points, corresponding to a criminal history category of V. In addition, because Rolon\u2019s 1990, 1997, and 2000 convictions included at least two \u201ccrime[s] of violence,\u201d Rolon was a career offender under the guidelines, which raised his criminal history category to VI. <em>See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 </em>4Bl.l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">Rolon\u2019s base offense level was 34. Because Rolon\u2019s offense statutory maximum was life imprisonment on Counts 1 and 2, Rolon\u2019s career offender status raised his offense level from 36 to 37, yielding a guidelines range of 360 months\u2019 to life imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4Bl.l(b)(A).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Ro-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>Ion\u2019s conviction on Count 6, for violating \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A), carried a consecutive sentence of not less than five years\u2019 imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(i), (c)(l)(D)(ii). This Count 6 conviction also raised Rolon\u2019s guidelines calculation to 420 months\u2019 to life imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(c)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Rolon\u2019s Count 6 conviction not only triggered a consecutive sentence under \u00a7 924(c)(l)(D)(ii), but also mandatory life imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8559(c). Rolon\u2019s Count 6 conviction was for using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence and a drug trafficking crime and possessing a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence and a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(c), a person convicted of a \u201cserious violent felony\u201d who has two prior \u201cserious violent felony\u201d convictions is subject to a mandatory life sentence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Section 3559(c) defines \u201cserious violent felony\u201d as \u201ca Federal or State offense, by whatever designation ... consisting of murder ... assault with intent to commit murder ... kidnapping ... robbery ... firearms use; <em>firearms possession (as described in section 92f(c)); </em>or attempt, conspiracy, or solicitation to commit any of the above offenses,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(c)(2)(F)\u00ae (emphasis added), or \u201cany other offense punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years or more that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force ... or that ... involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person of another ... may be used....\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3559(e)(2)(F)(ii). Rolon\u2019s conviction on Count 6, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)\u00ae, qualified as a \u201cserious violent felony\u201d under the explicit terms of \u00a7 3559(c)(2)(F)\u00ae. Because Ro-lon\u2019s 1990, 1997, and 2000 convictions included \u201cserious violent felon[ies]\u201d under \u00a7 3559(c), Rolon was subject to a mandatory life sentence on Count 6.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In addition, because the sentence for an offense under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) must be <em>consecutive </em>to any other sentence, the district court sentenced Rolon to a consecutive term of life imprisonment on Count 6. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 924(c)(l)(D)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-15\">2. Ortiz\u2019s Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b343-16\">Ortiz received an identical sentence. Ortiz\u2019s Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cOrtiz\u2019s PSI\u201d) showed that he had over 20 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>prior Florida convictions: (1) a 1982 conviction for obstruction of a police officer (M82001942); (2) 1984 convictions for carrying a concealed firearm and obstruction by false information (F8414896B), grand theft auto (F84-19003), theft, no valid driver\u2019s license, and reckless driving (F84-11104); (3) a 1985 conviction for aggravated assault (F84-30194); a 1986 conviction for grand theft in the third degree (F86-026793B); 1987 convictions for burglary of a conveyance and grand theft auto (F97-14437); 1988 convictions for burglary of a dwelling, grand theft in the second degree, possession of burglary tools, criminal mischief (F87-27423B), and prostitution (B88-212277); a 1989 conviction for disorderly conduct (M89-62140); a 1990 conviction for battery (89-31358); a 1991 conviction for robbery (F90-6933); 1991 convictions for robbery, kidnapping, possession of a firearm while engaged in a criminal offense, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, and carrying a concealed firearm (F90-13954B); 1991 convictions for third-degree murder and sale, purchase, or delivery of a controlled substance (F90-16384A);<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 1997 convictions for possession of cocaine and resisting an officer with violence (F96-41769).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">These convictions yielded eight criminal history points, corresponding to a criminal history category of IV. In addition, because Ortiz\u2019s 1991 conviction for robbery (F90-6933) and his 1997 conviction for resisting an officer with violence (F96-41769) were \u201ccrime[s] of violence,\u201d Ortiz was a career offender under the guidelines, which raised his criminal history category to VI. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). Although Ortiz\u2019s PSI showed that he had multiple violent felonies and controlled substance offenses, the PSI listed these 1991 and 1997 convictions as the basis of Ortiz\u2019s career offender status.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">Ortiz\u2019s base offense level was 34. The district court added a two-level increase for Ortiz\u2019s leadership role, yielding an adjusted offense level of 36.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In addition, because Ortiz\u2019s offense statutory maximum was life imprisonment on Counts 1 and 2, Ortiz\u2019s career offender status raised his offense level from 36 to 37. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a)-(b). After increasing Ortiz\u2019s offense level from 36 to 37 for Ortiz\u2019s career offender status, the district court added another two-level increase for obstruction of justice due to Ortiz\u2019s perjurious trial testimony. This raised Ortiz\u2019s offense level to 39, yielding a guidelines range of 360 months\u2019 to life.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Like Ro-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Ion\u2019s conviction on Count 6, Ortiz\u2019s conviction on Count 6 carried a minimum <em>consecutive </em>five-year sentence.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This conviction raised Ortiz\u2019s guidelines calculation to 420 months\u2019 to life. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(c)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Unlike Rolon, Ortiz\u2019s conviction on Count 6 did not trigger a <em>mandatory </em>life sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(c). Though Ortiz had committed two \u201cserious violent felonies\u201d over the course of several years, he was convicted of these predicate offenses on the same day.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As a result, he was not convicted of his second qualifying felony \u201cafter [his] conviction of the preceding serious violent felony or serious drug offense,\u201d as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(c)(1)(B). The district court noted that Ortiz had avoided his consecutive life sentence being mandatory under \u00a7 3559(c) \u201cfor technical reasons,\u201d but \u2014 unlike Ro-lon \u2014 was the \u201corganizer and leader of this conspiracy, procured the guns and the items to be used in the robbery, and then also testified patently falsely at this trial.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus, the district court sentenced Ortiz to a consecutive term of life imprisonment on Count 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-13\">Defendants Ortiz and Rolon appeal their convictions and sentences on multiple grounds.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-14\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AAn\">A. Substantive Due Process</p>\n<p id=\"b345-15\">Ortiz and Rolon contend that the district court erroneously denied their motions to dismiss the indictment.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Ortiz\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>and Rolon\u2019s motions argued that the government\u2019s \u201creverse sting\u201d tactics violated their substantive due process rights. Specifically, Ortiz and Rolon claimed that the government \u2014 by staging a false raid of a purported marijuana grow house, creating a fictional cocaine stash house, selecting a large drug quantity, and arresting them at the warehouse before they had proceeded to the robbery location \u2014 violated fundamental notions of justice and fair play.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">To prevail on a claim of outrageous government misconduct, a defendant must show that, under the totality of the circumstances, the law enforcement technique at issue was so outrageous that it was fundamentally unfair and shocking to the universal sense of justice mandated by due process. <em>See United States v. Haimowitz, </em>725 F.2d 1561, 1577 (11th Cir.1984). This defense \u201ccan only be invoked in the rarest and most outrageous circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). We consistently have recognized that government infiltration of criminal activity is a permissible means of investigation and repeatedly rejected challenges to the \u201creverse sting\u201d method of police investigation. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Sanchez, </em>138 F.3d 1410, 1413 (11th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Savage, </em>701 F.2d 867, 869-70 (11th Cir.1983); <em>United States v. Rogers, </em>701 F.2d 871, 872 (11th Cir.1983). Where the government merely presents a defendant with a routine criminal opportunity of which the defendant is more than willing to take advantage, the government\u2019s actions do not amount to outrageous conduct warranting dismissal. <em>See Savage, </em>701 F.2d at 869-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Based on our precedent, defendants Ortiz and Rolon have not shown that the government\u2019s law enforcement techniques violated substantive due process. Rather, this Court has affirmed the constitutional validity of law enforcement techniques similar to the \u201creverse sting\u201d at issue here. For example, in <em>Sanchez, </em>we held that federal agents\u2019 proposing the robbery of a fictitious house purportedly stocked with 50 kilograms of cocaine and 300 pounds of marijuana did not \u201capproach that demonstrable level of outrageousness the case law suggests would be necessary for reversal of these defendants\u2019 convictions.\u201d 138 F.3d at 1414; <em>see also Rogers, </em>701 F.2d at 872 n. 1 (concluding the government did not act outrageously when, in the face of defendants\u2019 wavering, the government \u201csweetened\u201d a drug deal by offering to lower the price of drugs, put the defendants up in a hotel room, and furnish them with women).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">Similar to <em>Sanchez, </em>the government here merely presented defendants Ortiz and Rolon with a fictitious home invasion opportunity that the defendants readily accepted and pursued. Importantly, Ortiz had planned to rob a marijuana grow house <em>before </em>law enforcement conducted a false raid on his initial robbery target and <em>before </em>the Cl introduced Ortiz to the undercover detective who proposed the cocaine stash house robbery. Further, in his meetings with the Cl and the'Undercover detective, Ortiz claimed to have committed home invasion robberies in the past and explained that he and Rolon were \u201cprofessionals.\u201d After accepting the undercover detective\u2019s proposal, Ortiz and Rolon actually planned the details of the stash house robbery independent of any specific government suggestion or guidance. Ortiz and Rolon \u2014 not the detective \u2014 decided to pose as police officers and to arrive armed, and Ortiz and Rolon subsequently procured police apparel and arrived with guns on the day of the robbery. In short, although the government presented a criminal opportunity, Ortiz and Rolon eagerly accepted that opportunity and orchestrated the scheme. In light of the totality of the facts here and our circuit precedent, we conclude that the district court did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>abuse its discretion by denying defendants Ortiz\u2019s and Rolon\u2019s motions to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">B. Prosecutor\u2019s Closing Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Defendants Ortiz and Rolon each claim that the district court erroneously denied their motions for a mistrial based on allegedly improper statements by the prosecutor during his closing argument. We review each statement separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">1. Prosecutor\u2019s Statement that Ortiz was a Convicted Murderer</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">During his closing statement, the prosecutor called Ortiz a \u201cconvicted murderer.\u201d Ortiz did not contemporaneously object to this statement but moved for a mistrial \u2014 after the prosecutor had concluded his closing argument and after the jury was excused \u2014 on the ground that the statement was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">In the absence of a contemporaneous objection, we review for plain error the district court\u2019s failure to correct an improper closing argument. <em>United States v. Pendergraft, </em>297 F.3d 1198, 1204 (11th Cir.2002). Plain error requires a legal error that is plain and that affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>United States v. Pielago, </em>135 F.3d 703, 708 (11th Cir.1998). We review the denial of a motion for a mistrial for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Foley, </em>508 F.3d 627, 632 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">We first find no error in .the district court\u2019s denial of Ortiz\u2019s motion for a mistrial based on the district court\u2019s failure to correct the prosecutor\u2019s statement that Ortiz was a \u201cconvicted murderer.\u201d The prosecutor\u2019s statement was supported by the record, which contained a certified copy of Ortiz\u2019s prior conviction for third-degree murder. The government properly sought admission of Ortiz\u2019s prior murder conviction to rebut Ortiz\u2019s testimony relating to his entrapment defense, <em>see United States v. Duran, </em>596 F.3d 1283, 1298-99 (11th Cir.2010), and the government was entitled to refer to this evidence already introduced at trial. <em>See United States v. Diecidue, </em>603 F.2d 535, 553 (5th Cir.1979) (\u201cUnflattering characterizations of defendants are not reversible error when supported by the evidence.\u201d).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Because the prosecutor\u2019s statement was not improper, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Ortiz\u2019s motion for a mistrial on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-15\">2. Prosecutor\u2019s Statement Regarding Reasonable Doubt</p>\n<p id=\"b347-16\">During his closing argument, the prosecutor stated that \u201cjuries have been finding defendants guilty for 250 years in this country, all beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Defendant Rolon contemporaneously objected to this statement and reserved a motion for a mistrial. The district court sustained the objection, struck the prosecutor\u2019s statement from the record, and stated that the court would \u201cinstruct on reasonable doubt without comment on what juries have done for 200 years.\u201d At that time, the court did not directly instruct the jury to ignore the prosecutor\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-17\">Defendant Rolon later moved for a mistrial on ground that the prosecutor\u2019s comment was \u201cover the top.\u201d In denying Ro-lon\u2019s motion, the district court explained to Rolon\u2019s counsel that the court understood the statement merely to mean that reasonable doubt had been the standard for guilt for 250 years. The district court further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>stated it \u201cmade that correction in any event\u201d by \u201csustaining] the objection and ... [telling] the jury that [it was] striking that argument and ... would instruct on reasonable doubt without comment on what juries have done for 200 or so years.\u201d Neither Rolon nor Ortiz objected further.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Rolon now argues for the first time on appeal that the court exacerbated the prejudicial effect of the prosecutor\u2019s improper statement by repeating the statement. As noted above, we review' the denial of a motion for a mistrial for abuse of discretion. <em>Foley, </em>508 F.3d at 632. Assuming a prosecutor\u2019s comments were improper, we reverse only if the comments affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>United States v. Eckhardt, </em>466 F.3d 938, 947 (11th Cir.2006). A defendant\u2019s substantial rights are prejudicially affected if a reasonable probability arises that, but for the remarks, the outcome of the trial would have been different. <em>Id. </em>If the record contains sufficient independent evidence of guilt, any error is harmless. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\"><em>We </em>find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s denial of Rolon\u2019s motion for a mistrial based on the single reasonable-doubt comment. Even if the prosecutor\u2019s statement was improper, the district court promptly struck the statement from the record and advised that the court would instruct the jury on reasonable doubt. Subsequently, the district court properly instructed the jury on the reasonable doubt standard. Because \u201c[w]e generally presume that jurors follow their instructions,\u201d the district court\u2019s instruction on reasonable doubt was sufficient to cure any prejudice caused by the prosecutor\u2019s statement. <em>See United States v. Hill, </em>643 F.3d 807, 829 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">We further reject the argument that Ortiz and Rolon were prejudiced by the district court\u2019s repetition of the prosecutor\u2019s remark. The district court merely stated that it would instruct the jury on reasonable doubt \u201cwithout regard\u201d to the historical practice of juries. To the extent the district court repeated the prosecutor\u2019s statement in sustaining the defendants\u2019 objection, it was to illustrate that the district court\u2019s instructions would render the prosecutor\u2019s remark irrelevant. And, as noted above, before the jury deliberated, the district court gave the jury detailed instructions on the meaning of reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">Even assuming some residual prejudicial effect remained, the prosecutor\u2019s statement did not affect Ortiz\u2019s and Rolon\u2019s substantial rights because \u2014 in light of the substantial independent evidence of their guilt \u2014 no reasonable probability exists that this statement altered the outcome of the trial. <em>See United States v. Adams, </em>74 F.3d 1093, 1097 (11th Cir.1996) (holding that improper prosecutorial references did not raise a reasonable probability that, but for the remarks, the outcome would be different due to \u201csufficient independent evidence establishing guilt\u201d). As we note elsewhere in our discussion, numerous tape-and-video-recorded conversations, abundant physical evidence seized from Rolon\u2019s vehicle, and Ortiz\u2019s own inculpato-ry statements provided ample evidence of Ortiz\u2019s and Rolon\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">C. Ortiz\u2019s Closing Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">Ortiz claims that the district court erred by precluding his counsel from analogizing the government\u2019s case to the movie <em>Minority Report </em>in his closing argument. Before the district court, Ortiz sought to analogize his arrest and prosecution to the \u201cPrecrime\u201d law enforcement unit depicted in that movie that, in the words of Ortiz\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>counsel, \u201cstop[ped] people before they might commit a crime in the future and [took] them out.\u201d On appeal, Ortiz claims that in <em>Minority Report </em>the government tried to arrest a person because the government \u201canticipated\u201d that the person would commit a crime in the future, and that this is what happened in Ortiz\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">We review for abuse of discretion a court\u2019s decision to limit a party\u2019s closing argument. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1320 (11th Cir.2008). In closing argument, a party is entitled to make all legal arguments supported by the facts. <em>Id. </em>However, a party may not argue inaccurate or inapplicable theories of law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Here, the district court did not abuse its discretion by prohibiting Ortiz\u2019s counsel from referencing <em>Minority Report. </em>Ortiz\u2019s theory of law \u2014 that he was arrested only because the government \u201canticipated\u201d that he would later commit a crime \u2014 was plainly inapplicable to Ortiz because it was not supported by the evidence, the government\u2019s theory of prosecution, or even by Ortiz\u2019s own entrapment defense. The trial evidence showed that Ortiz planned to rob a marijuana grow house even <em>before </em>he met the undercover detective. Audio and video recordings documented Ortiz\u2019s meetings with Rolon, the Cl, the undercover detective, and codefendant Dimolino and illustrated their resulting conspiracy to rob the detective\u2019s fictitious stash house. Authorities recovered guns, ammunition, and police paraphernalia from Rolon\u2019s car (in which Ortiz was riding) after the pair were arrested on the way to the robbery. This evidence showed that Ortiz was arrested only <em>after </em>committing the crimes for which he was charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Ortiz claims that he was trying to argue only that the government cannot arrest people for crimes they have not yet committed. But this argument is inapplicable to Ortiz\u2019s entrapment defense, which presumes that the defendant has committed the charged crime. Even if this argument were applicable to Ortiz\u2019s defense, the record shows that Ortiz\u2019s counsel remained free to make this argument without reference to <em>Minority Report. </em>Indeed, after the district court sustained the government\u2019s objection to the movie analogy, Ortiz\u2019s counsel argued to the jury that \u201cthe Government used a plan that ... was to take Mr. Ortiz from the community because the prediction under their scenario was he eventually ... would commit a crime in the future.\u201d \u201cThat,\u201d he explained, \u201cis entrapment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">D. Entrapment Jury Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">As to his entrapment defense, Ortiz requested a jury instruction on entrapment that followed the Eleventh Circuit pattern instruction 13.1. Instead, the district court instructed the jury in accordance with the Eleventh Circuit entrapment pattern instruction 13.2, which also explains entrapment. Instruction 13.2 differs from 13.1 only in that 13.2 provides the additional instruction that jurors \u201cmust not evaluate the conduct of Government officers or others' under their direction to decide whether [the jurors] approve of the conduct or think it was moral.\u201d <em>Compare </em>Eleventh Circuit Criminal Pattern Jury Instructions (Criminal Cases) 2010, Special Instruction no. 13.1, <em>with id. </em>no. 13.2.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Ortiz claims that the 13.2 pattern instruction on entrapment, given in his case, was erroneous because it \u201cskewed the jury\u2019s ability to correctly apply the facts adduced at trial to the entrapment defense.\u201d Specifically, Ortiz argues that precluding the jury from concluding that the government acted wrongfully was tantamount to pre-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>eluding the jury\u2019s finding that the government entrapped him.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">We review jury instructions <em>de novo </em>to determine whether they misstated the law or misled the jury. <em>United States v. Simpson, </em>228 F.3d 1294, 1298 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">We reject Ortiz\u2019s argument that the district court\u2019s entrapment instruction, which followed the 13.2 pattern instruction nearly verbatim, was erroneous. An entrapment defense consists of \u201ctwo elements: (1) government inducement of the crime, and (2) lack of predisposition on the part of the defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Padron, </em>527 F.3d 1156, 1160 (11th Cir.2008). Both pattern jury instructions 13.1 and 13.2 accurately state these elements. <em>See United States v. Schlaen, </em>300 F.3d 1313, 1316 (11th Cir.2002) (rejecting as meritless an identical challenge in which a defendant argued that the district court should have given Eleventh Circuit pattern entrapment instruction 12.1 rather than pattern instruction 12.2).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The additional language of pattern instruction 13.2 merely tells jurors that they may not consider the moral valence of the government\u2019s pretending to be part of a criminal enterprise. This is an accurate statement of the law. Because the moral character of the government\u2019s tactics are irrelevant to whether the government induced a crime or whether the defendant was predisposed to commit a crime, the 13.2 pattern instruction does not preclude a jury from concluding that a defendant was entrapped. Here, as in any case involving an entrapment defense, the jury could have concluded that Ortiz was entrapped even had they found that the government acted immorally. The entrapment instruction in 13.2 was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">E. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) Jury Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">Defendants Ortiz and Rolon argue that the district court erroneously instructed that the jury could convict them under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) for either using <em>or </em>carrying a firearm. Ortiz and Rolon claim that because their indictment charged them with using <em>and </em>carrying a firearm, the district court\u2019s jury instructions and the district court\u2019s later response to a jury question about the and/or distinction amounted to a constructive amendment of their indictment in violation of their right to be tried only on indicted charges. <em>See United States v. Peel, </em>837 F.2d 975, 979 (11th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">As noted earlier, Count 5 was a conspiracy offense regarding firearms, while Count 6 was the substantive offense as to the same firearms. Count 5 of the indictment charged Ortiz and Rolon with conspiring to \u201cuse <em>and </em>carry a firearm\u201d during a crime of violence and a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(o). Similarly, Count 6 charged that Ortiz and Rolon \u201cdid knowingly use <em>and </em>carry a firearm\u201d during a crime of violence and a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). The district court proposed to instruct the jury that the government was required to prove, for the conspiracy offense, that \u201cthe object of the unlawful plan was to use <em>or </em>carry a firearm\u201d and for the substantive offense, that Ortiz and Rolon \u201cknowingly used, carried, <em>or </em>possessed a firearm.\u201d Ortiz and Rolon objected to this wording on grounds that the \u201cor\u201d wording of the instruction varied from the <em>\u201cand </em>\u201d wording of the indictment. The district court overruled these objec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>tions and instructed the jury in the disjunctive.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">During their deliberations, the jury sent the district court a note asking this: \u201cIn the Indictment, the language for Counts 5 and 6 are \u2018use <em>and </em>carry.\u2019 In the verdict, # 5 and # 6 read \u2018used <em>or </em>carried.\u2019 Please explain the discrepancy between the conjunctions <em>and </em>and or\u201d (emphasis in original). Over Ortiz\u2019s and Rolon\u2019s objections, the district court responded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-6\">The statute in question refers to \u201cuses or carries\u201d and does not require that both must be proven. The government has charged both in the indictment but only has to prove that the defendant \u201cused\u201d or \u201ccarried\u201d a weapon as specified in the instructions. You will note that the jury instructions provide that \u201cthe government has to prove only one of those ways, not both. If you find either \u201cuse\u201d or \u201ccarry\u201d in relation to the crimes charged in Counts 1-4, that is sufficient.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">This Court reviews for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s response to a jury question. <em>United States v. </em>Lopez, 590 F.3d 1238, 1247 (11th Cir.2009). Original jury instructions are reviewed <em>de novo. Simpson, </em>228 F.3d at 1298.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">We find no error in either the district court\u2019s initial instruction or the district court\u2019s response to the jury\u2019s question. Our precedent compels this conclusion. First, \u201cthe law is well established that where an indictment charges in the conjunctive several means of violating a statute, a conviction may be obtained on proof of only one of the means.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1300; <em>see also United States v. Cornillie, </em>92 F.3d 1108, 1110 (11th Cir.1996). Second, in <em>Simpson, </em>we considered a challenge to jury instructions regarding \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) identical to that Ortiz and Rolon now raise. 228 F.3d at 1300. In <em>Simpson, </em>we held that the conjunctive language of the indictment and the disjunctive language of the \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) jury charge meant that the defendant \u201ccould not possibly have been convicted on a ground that was not alleged in the indictment.\u201d <em>Id.; see also United States v. Poarch, </em>878 F.2d 1355, 1358 (11th Cir.1989). Accordingly, we concluded that the disjunctive jury charge did not amount to a constructive amendment to the indictment. <em>Simpson, </em>228 F.3d at 1300.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-11\">The same rationale applies here. Counts 5 and 6 of Ortiz and Rolon\u2019s indictment charged in the conjunctive. However, criminal liability under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) attaches where a person \u201cuses <em>or </em>carries a firearm\u201d (emphasis added). The same is true of the conspiracy charge under \u00a7 924(o). <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 924(o) (providing penalties for \u201c[a] person who conspires to commit an offense under subsection (c)\u201d). Because these statutes require a jury to find only that a defendant <em>either </em>used <em>or </em>carried a firearm, the district court\u2019s instructions accurately characterized the law. The jury could not have convicted Ortiz and Rolon on a ground not alleged in the indictment because the indictment language was broader than that of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-12\">F. <em>Allen </em>Jury Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b351-13\">A day and a half into their deliberations, the jury returned guilty verdicts for Ortiz on Count 8 and Rolon on Count 9 but left incomplete the verdict form blanks for the remaining counts. At that time, over the defendants\u2019 objection, the district court gave an \u201cAllen\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> charge nearly identical to the Eleventh Circuit pattern <em>Allen </em>in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>struction. <em>See </em>Eleventh Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions (Criminal Cases) 2010, Trial Instructions no. 5 (\u201cModified <em>Allen </em>Charge\u201d). Four hours later, the jury convicted Ortiz and Rolon on all remaining counts against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Rolon and Ortiz argue that the <em>Allen </em>instruction was inherently coercive because the jury already had deliberated for a day and a half. Moreover, Rolon argues that the charge was especially coercive given the current economy because the charge emphasized the expense that a new trial would impose on the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to give an <em>Allen </em>charge for abuse of discretion, and will find such an abuse only if the charge was inherently coercive. <em>See United States v. Woodard, </em>531 F.3d 1352, 1364 (11th Cir.2008). Though we have expressed concern about <em>Allen </em>charges, <em>see United States v. Rey, </em>811 F.2d 1453, 1457-60 (11th Cir.1987), we have approved this Circuit\u2019s pattern <em>Allen </em>charge on numerous occasions. <em>See, e.g., Woodard, </em>531 F.3d at 1364; <em>United States v. Dickerson, </em>248 F.3d 1036, 1050 (11th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Trujillo, </em>146 F.3d 838, 846 (11th Cir.1998). In assessing an <em>Allen </em>charge, we consider the totality of the circumstances, including the language of the charge and the amount of time between its issuance and the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Woodard, </em>531 F.3d at 1364.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">In this case, the district court did not abuse its discretion by giving an <em>Allen </em>charge. The district court\u2019s charge was substantively identical to charges we previously have approved. <em>See, e.g., Dickerson, </em>248 F.3d at 1050; <em>Rey, </em>811 F.2d at 1461. The district court instructed the jury that it could take as much time as it needed to deliberate, and the jury returned its verdict four hours later, an interval far in excess of that we previously have held does not indicate impermissible coercion. <em>See Rey, </em>811 F.2d at 1458 (jury returned verdict 95 minutes after <em>Allen </em>charge). We also reject Rolon\u2019s conjectural claim that this <em>Allen </em>charge had a coercive effect due to alleged psychological effects of the national economy or the financial condition of the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-11\">G. Ortiz\u2019s Classification as a Career Offender</p>\n<p id=\"b352-12\">Ortiz next claims that his Florida conviction on August 4, 1997 for \u201cresisting an officer with violence,\u201d in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> no longer qualifies as a predicate \u201ccrime of violence\u201d offense for career offender status under \u00a7 4B1.2 of the guidelines, and thus he must be resen-tenced.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-13\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether a prior conviction qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the sentencing guidelines. <em>United States v. Palomino Garcia, </em>606 F.3d 1317, 1326 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-14\">In <em>United States v. Nix, </em>628 F.3d 1341 (11th Cir.2010), <em>petition for cert. denied </em>- U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 258, 181 L.Ed.2d 150 (2011), this Court held that a conviction under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01, resist<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>ing an officer with violence, qualified as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the \u201cresidual clause\u201d of the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B). <em>Nix, </em>628 F.3d at 1342. The ACCA\u2019s residual clause defines \u201cviolent felony\u201d as including \u201cany crime ... that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)\u00ae.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> We repeatedly have read the definition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA as \u201cvirtually identical\u201d to the guidelines definition of a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d which includes \u201cconduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a); <em>United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir.2008). Therefore, <em>Nix a fortiori </em>forecloses Ortiz\u2019s claim that his prior Florida \u00a7 843.01 conviction does not qualify as a predicate \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for career offender status.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">We also reject Ortiz\u2019s claim that the Supreme Court\u2019s remand in our unpublished case, <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>355 Fed.Appx. 297 (11th Cir.2009), <em>vacated by </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 896, 178 L.Ed.2d 739 (2011), makes any difference. <em>Jackson </em>is not binding precedent. 11th Cir. R. 36-2. In any event, in <em>Jackson, </em>we held that Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01 qualifies as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA because the \u201cuse, attempted use, or threatened use or physical force against the person of another\u201d was an element of the offense. <em>Jackson, </em>355 Fed.Appx. at 299. The Supreme Court vacated that opinion and remanded to this Court for further consideration in light of <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>559 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 1268, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010). <em>Jackson, </em>131 S.Ct. at 896.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-18\">In <em>Johnson, </em>the Supreme Court held that the Florida offense of battery by \u201c[ajctually and intentionally touching] another person,\u201d Fla.

The <em>Johnson </em>Court concluded that because criminal liability under \u00a7 784.03(l)(a) is satisfied by <em>\u201cany </em>intentional physical contact, \u2018no matter how slight,\u2019 \u201d that crime does not have the \u201cuse ... of physical force\u201d as an element, as required by the ACCA definition of \u201cviolent felony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1270 (quoting <em>State v. Hearns, </em>961 So.2d 211, 218 (Fla.2007)).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Notably, the <em>Johnson </em>Court did not con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>sider whether a \u00a7 784.03(l)(a) battery offense qualified as a violent felony under the ACCA residual clause, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), because the government \u201cdisclaimed at sentencing any reliance upon the [ACCA] residual clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1274.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">On remand in <em>Jackson, </em>this Court again held that Florida\u2019s \u00a7 843.01 crime of resisting an officer with violence is a \u201cviolent felony,\u201d but this time we based the ruling on the ACCA residual clause. <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>440 Fed.Appx. 857, 2011 WL 4360910, at *1 (11th Cir.2011) (unpublished). Following our binding precedent in <em>Nix, </em>we explained that the ACCA residual clause includes crimes that present \u201ca serious potential risk of physical injury,\u201d and thus, under the ACCA residual clause, \u201cresisting an officer with violence constitutes a violent felony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis omitted). Consequently, resisting an officer with violence is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d too under \u00a7 4B1.2 of the guidelines. <em>See Archer, </em>531 F.3d at 1352.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Therefore, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Johnson </em>and our decision in <em>Jackson </em>on remand do not help Ortiz either.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">H.

These factors include the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, and the need to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant. <em>Id. </em>When the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory guidelines range, we will ordinarily expect that choice to be a reasonable one. <em>Id. </em>We reverse only if we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">Ortiz has not established that his life sentences are substantively unreasonable. His first life sentence was within his guidelines range. His second life sentence was consecutive because \u00a7 924(c)(1 )(D)(ii) mandates a consecutive sentence. More importantly, the record shows that Ortiz\u2019s life sentences were adequately justified with reference to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. As noted above, Ortiz had numerous prior convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>tions, including six convictions for crimes that involve violence. He was the organizer and leader of the criminal conspiracy in this case, and he actually intended to carry out a violent robbery consistent with crimes he and Rolon had committed in the past. The district court rejected Ortiz\u2019s contention that he was turning his life around as \u201cnonsense\u201d and explained its conclusion that Ortiz had \u201ctestified patently falsely\u201d at trial. In light of these factors, we cannot say that Ortiz\u2019s sentences were substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">I. Rolon\u2019s Mandatory Life Sentence Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(c)</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Rolon challenges his second, consecutive life sentence on Count 6. Rolon argues, for the first time on appeal, that he should not have been subject to an enhanced mandatory term of life imprisonment under \u00a7 3559(c) because the government presented no evidence at his sentencing hearing to validate the two prior convictions upon which the \u00a7 3559(c) enhancement relied. Rolon further claims that, even though he was represented by counsel in proceedings that led to all of his prior convictions, these prior convictions are void for \u00a7 3559(c) purposes because his assistance of counsel in all but one of those prior cases was ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">We review for plain error arguments raised for the first time on appeal. <em>United States v. Bacon, </em>598 F.3d 772, 775 n. 1 (11th Cir.2010). Plain error requires a legal error that is plain and that affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>Pielago, </em>135 F.3d at 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">The district court committed no reversible error in sentencing Rolon because the mandatory life sentencing provision of \u00a7 3559(c) squarely applied to Rolon. As noted earlier, Rolon\u2019s PSI and the government\u2019s Notice of Intent to Seek Enhanced Penalties Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(c) showed that he was convicted of multiple Florida state crimes that qualify as \u201cserious crimes of violence.\u201d Those crimes were (1) aggravated battery (CR89-212); (2) robbery with a deadly weapon (CR89-1901); (3) attempted second-degree murder and possession of a firearm in the commission of a felony (CR97-4069); (4) attempted first-degree murder, attempted armed kidnapping, shooting into a vehicle, and use of a firearm during a felony (97-10535); and (5) aggravated battery with a deadly weapon (98-26377). Rolon filed no objections to the PSI\u2019s factual statements that he was previously convicted of these crimes, and Rolon does not now claim that he was not convicted of these crimes. A failure to object to allegations of fact in a presentence investigation report admits those facts for sentencing purposes. <em>United States v. Wade, </em>458 F.3d 1273, 1277 (11th Cir.2006). As a result, the absence of confirmatory evidence of Rolon\u2019s prior convictions is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">Nor does Rolon\u2019s claim \u2014 that he was convicted of these predicate felonies without the effective assistance of counsel\u2014 vitiate these convictions for the purposes of \u00a7 3559(c). Rolon may not collaterally attack his prior state convictions in a federal sentencing proceeding on grounds that his state counsel was ineffective. <em>Custis v. United States, </em>511 U.S. 485, 496-97, 114 S.Ct. 1732, 1738-39, 128 L.Ed.2d 517 (1994); <em>United States v. Covington, </em>565 F.3d 1336, 1345 (11th Cir.2009). Such a collateral attack is available only if a defendant who has not waived his right to counsel was convicted of the predicate crime without having counsel appointed at all. <em>Custis, </em>114 S.Ct. at 1738-39. Because Rolon, by his own admission, was represented by counsel in the proceedings that led to his predicate state convictions, Ro-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>Ion may not now challenge their application to \u00a7 3559(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">J. Constitutionality of Rolon\u2019s Life Sentences</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Rolon further argues that his consecutive life sentences are cruel and unusual in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Ro-lon\u2019s argument is foreclosed by our precedent holding that a sentence of life imprisonment on drug charges is not per <em>se </em>cruel and unusual. <em>See United States v. Willis, </em>956 F.2d 248, 251 (11th Cir.1992); <em>see also Harmelin v. Michigan, </em>501 U.S. 957, 994, 111 S.Ct. 2680, 2701, 115 L.Ed.2d 836 (1991) (\u201cSevere, mandatory penalties may be cruel, but they are not unusual in the constitutional sense....\u201d). Importantly, too, Rolon was also convicted of a \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) firearm offense in this case and had an extensive criminal record, including multiple violent felonies. Section 3559(c), mandating a life sentence, squarely applied to Rolon. And \u00a7 924(c)(l)(D)(ii) made that sentence consecutive. Rolon\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim clearly fails. <em>See Rummel v. Estelle, </em>445 U.S. 263, 284-85, 100 S.Ct. 1133, 1145-46, 63 L.Ed.2d 382 (1980) (explaining that sentencing based on a defendant\u2019s criminal history is not cruel and unusual under the Eighth Amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM all of Ortiz\u2019s and Rolon\u2019s convictions and sentences except as to their sentences on Count 5, and we VACATE Ortiz\u2019s and Rolon\u2019s sentences as to Count 5, and REMAND to the district court for resentenc-ing on Count 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">AFFIRMED in part and VACATED AND REMANDED in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">Appendix A</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">The district court gave the following entrapment instruction:</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">\u201cEntrapment\u201d occurs when law-enforcement officers or others under their direction persuade a defendant to commit a crime the defendant had no previous intent to commit.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-12\">The Defendant has claimed to be a victim of entrapment regarding the charged offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-13\">The law forbids convicting an entrapped defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-14\">But there is no entrapment when a Defendant is willing to break the law and the Government merely provides what appears to be a favorable opportunity for the Defendant to commit a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-15\">For example, it\u2019s not entrapment for a Government agent to pretend to be someone else and offer \u2014 directly or through another person \u2014 to engage in an unlawful transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-16\">You must not evaluate the conduct of Government officers or others under their direction to decide whether you approve of the conduct or think it was moral.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-17\">So a defendant isn\u2019t a victim of entrapment if you find beyond a reasonable doubt that the Government only offered the defendant an opportunity to commit a crime the Defendant was already willing to commit.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-18\">But if there is a reasonable doubt about whether the Defendant was willing to commit the crime without the persuasion of a Government officer or a person under the Government\u2019s direction, then you must find the Defendant not guilty.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b341-9\">.

The district court sentenced Dimolino to 120 months' imprisonment on Count 1 and 60 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count 7, to be served consecutively, for a total sentence of 180 months' imprisonment. The government\u2019s sentencing memorandum pointed out that, unlike defendants Ortiz and Ro-lon, Dimolino had never been arrested for or convicted of a crime of violence. Dimolino received an offense level reduction for acceptance of responsibility and did not testify falsely at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b342-6\">.The district court grouped together Counts 1, 2, 5, and 8 pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D 1.2(c). These counts were also grouped with Counts 3 and 4. <em>Id. </em>In sentencing Ortiz and Rolon to life imprisonment on Count 5 the district court exceeded the statutory maximum of 20 years' imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(o).

Consistent with the armed career criminal guidelines, Rolon was sentenced according to his career offender offense level of 37. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 4B 1.4(b)(2).

On January 22, 2010, the government filed a Notice of Intent to Seek Enhanced Penalties Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(c) listing Rolon's following convictions as \"serious violent felonies\u201d: (1) 1990 convictions for aggravated battery (CR89-212) and robbery with a deadly weapon (CR89-1901), (2) 1997 convictions for attempted second-degree murder and possession of a firearm in the commission of a felony (CR97-4069), and (3) 2000 convictions for attempted first-degree murder, attempted armed kidnapping, shooting into a vehicle, use of a firearm during a felony (97-10535), and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon (98-26377). As outlined earlier, Rolon\u2019s PSI listed and described these same eight convictions as well as five others.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b344-4\">. On January 23, 1987, a man was shot from a vehicle in which Ortiz was a passenger (F90-16384A). On January 10, 1990, Ortiz and an accomplice robbed a jewelry store brandishing guns (F90-13954B). On February 19, 1990, Ortiz and an accomplice robbed a woman at gunpoint and stole her car (F90-6933).

The district court erroneously added a two-level increase to Ortiz\u2019s base offense level for obstruction of justice <em>after </em>assessing an increase from 36 to 37 due to Ortiz's career offender status. The district court should have added the two-level increase for obstruction of justice <em>before </em>considering the effect of Ortiz's career offender status under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>See </em>\u00a7 IB 1.1 (a) (instructing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>court to consider \u201cadjustments as appropriate related to victim, role, and obstruction of justice,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.1(a)(3), <em>before </em>\"[djeter-min[ing] from Part B of Chapter 4 any other applicable adjustments,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 IB 1.1 (a)(6)).</p>\n<p id=\"AJf\">That calculation would have yielded a base offense level of 34, plus a two-level increase for Ortiz's leadership role, plus a two-level increase for obstruction of justice, yielding a total of 38. Ortiz\u2019s offense level 38 calculation plus criminal history category VI would have yielded a guidelines range of 360\u2019 months to life, which is equal to that using an offense level of 39 with the same category VI; thus, the district court's error as to his offense level was harmless.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b345-8\">.
