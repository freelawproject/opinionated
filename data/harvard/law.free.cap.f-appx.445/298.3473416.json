Fowler argues that the United States failed to prove that her offense involved a protected computer or caused a loss that exceeded $5,000. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>We review <em>\u201cde novo </em>the denial of a motion for acquittal and the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Tampas, </em>493 F.3d 1291, 1297 (11th Cir.2007). We view the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the government and draw[ ] \u2018all reasonable inferences and credibility choices in favor of the jury\u2019s verdict.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1297-98 (quoting <em>United States v. Evans, </em>344 F.3d 1131, 1134 (11th Cir.2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Substantial evidence supports the finding of the jury that Fowler \u201cknowingly caused the transmission of a program, information, code, or command\u201d that \u201cintentionally cause[d] damage without authorization[ ] to a protected computer,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030(a)(5)(A), which was \u201cused in or affeet[ed] interstate or foreign commerce or communication,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1030(e)(2)(B). Fowler admitted to a federal agent that, after she was fired from her position as a system administrator for Suncoast Community Health Centers, she changed the password for the firewall. At trial, Bill Windham, a network system operator at Suncoast, testified that, without access to the firewall, Suncoast could not control \u201cactivity inward\u201d to their systems. Two officers of Suncoast, Brantz Roszel and Tom Brown, testified that Fowler also disabled all the administrator accounts, obstructed access to the domain controllers, disconnected backup systems, reformatted a hard drive on Roszel\u2019s computer, and transferred eight years of reports from Brown\u2019s computer into an obscure subdi-rectory on the company server. Fowler\u2019s interference with the computer system left Suncoast employees unable to exchange email or check email remotely. Fowler\u2019s misconduct also interrupted employees\u2019 ability to access patients\u2019 health records, verify patients\u2019 eligibility for Medicaid, or communicate with laboratories and outside healthcare agencies through the internet, which \u201cis an instrumentality of interstate commerce,\u201d <em>United States v. Hornaday, </em>392 F.3d 1306, 1311 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Substantial evidence also supports the finding of the jury that Fowler\u2019s interference caused \u201closs to 1 or more persons during [a] 1-year period\u201d that \u201cag-gregat[ed] at least $5,000 in value.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030(c)(4)(A)(i)(I). Suncoast expended over $6,000 for Roszel, Brown, and Windham to \u201crespond[ ] to [Fowler\u2019s] offense, conduct! ] a damage assessment, and restor[e] the data, program, system, or information to its condition prior to the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1030(e)(ll). Roszel, Brown, and Windham testified that they were required to access and reconfigure the administrator account, restore email and other normal computer functions for employees, assess and later replace the firewall, and recover administrative files. Suncoast also had further \u201ccost[s] incurred\u201d in paying Health Choice Network $3,941.27 to repair the computer system. <em>Id. </em>Victor Rodriguez, the director of technology operations at Health Choice, testified that he reset the administrator password for the Suncoast network, reconfigured its services to match the password, and investigated the interference with the Suncoast system. During his investigation, Rodriguez discovered that Fowler had established an employee account under the name \u201cPeggie Davis\u201d that contained full administrative rights and that Fowler could use after she was fired to access the Suncoast computer system.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">We AFFIRM Fowler\u2019s conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
