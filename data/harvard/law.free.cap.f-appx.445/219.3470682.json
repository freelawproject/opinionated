On appeal, Mitchell raises four principal arguments: (1) the district court abused its discretion in denying his motions for mistrial; (2) the court erred in allowing the government to shift the burden of proof through a line of questioning about him being able \u201cto tell his story\u201d; (3) the court erred in failing to provide an expert witness instruction to the jury; and (4) his 747-month total sentence was substantively unreasonable. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-16\">We review a district court\u2019s decision not to grant a mistrial for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Jennings, </em>599 F.3d 1241, 1249 (11th Cir.2010). Generally, we review a claim of prosecutorial misconduct <em>de novo </em>because it presents a mixed question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>of law and fact. <em>United States v. Duran, </em>596 F.3d 1283, 1299 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 210, 178 L.Ed.2d 46 (2010). We review the legal correctness of a jury instruction <em>de novo, </em>but will defer on questions of phrasing absent an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Prather, </em>205 F.3d 1265, 1270 (11th Cir.2000). We review the sentence a district court imposes for \u201creasonableness,\u201d which \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">First, we are unpersuaded by Mitchell\u2019s argument that the district court abused its discretion when it denied his motions for mistrial, because hearsay statements of Detective Sal Augeri on a tape recording that was played to the jury, and Augeri\u2019s trial testimony that Mitchell had previously been locked-up, were prejudicial. In order to prevail on a motion for mistrial, the movant must show that his substantial rights have been prejudicially affected. <em>United States v. Emmanuel, </em>565 F.3d 1324, 1334 (11th Cir.2009). \u201cThis occurs when there is a reasonable probability that, but for the remarks, the outcome of the trial would have been different.\u201d <em>United States v. Newsome, </em>475 F.3d 1221, 1227 (11th Cir.2007). We make this determination in the context of the entire trial and in light of any curative instruction. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[W]hen a district court gives a curative instruction, the reviewing court will reverse only if the evidence is so highly prejudicial as to be incurable by the trial court\u2019s admonition.\u201d <em>United States v. Delgado, </em>321 F.3d 1338, 1347 (11th Cir.2003) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">In this case, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Mitchell\u2019s motions for mistrial. With respect to the recorded statements of Detective Au-geri, Mitchell was not prejudicially affected by their being played to the jury because the majority of Augeri\u2019s statements during those pages merely placed one of the witnesses\u2019s responses into context. In addition, the court gave numerous curative instructions to the jury to ignore Augeri\u2019s statements, and those statements were not so highly prejudicial as to be incurable. <em>See id.; see also United States v. Byrom, </em>910 F.2d 725, 730, 737 (11th Cir.1990) (holding that a confidential informant\u2019s statements on a videotape were admissible after an instruction by the district court that they were not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, but to place the defendant\u2019s comments into context).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">With respect to Augeri\u2019s trial testimony that Mitchell had been \u201clocked up,\u201d Mitchell was similarly not prejudiced, because this part of Augeri\u2019s testimony was brief and unelicited by the government, and the court immediately provided a curative instruction to the jury. <em>See Emmanuel, </em>565 F.3d at 1334 (\u201c[Wjhere the comment is brief, unelicited, and unresponsive, adding nothing to the government\u2019s case, the denial of a mistrial is proper.\u201d). Furthermore, there was overwhelming evidence against Mitchell at trial\u2014including that Mitchell had received medical treatment for a gunshot wound, that Mitchell had confessed to a friend that he had committed the robbery, and that a police officer had identified Mitchell as one of the robbers\u2014and he has not shown that, but for the testimony, the outcome of the trial would have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">Second, we find no merit in Mitchell\u2019s claim that he was entitled to a new trial when the government questioned him about not having a previous opportunity \u201cto tell his story.\u201d \u201cTo establish prosecu-torial misconduct, (1) the remarks must be improper, and (2) the remarks must preju-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>dicially affect the substantial rights of the defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Eckhardt, </em>466 F.3d 938, 947 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation omitted). \u201cA defendant\u2019s substantial rights are prejudicially affected when a reasonable probability arises that, but for the remarks, the outcome of the trial would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThus, where there is sufficient independent evidence of guilt, any error is harmless.\u201d <em>United States v. Merrill, 513 F.3d </em>1293, 1307 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Here, the government\u2019s questioning of Mitchell about his failure to tell the authorities his story was not improper. Mitchell testified that he \u201cnever got a chance to tell [his] story,\u201d and that his testimony was the \u201cfirst time\u201d he had said what happened. The record shows that this statement was unsolicited by the government, and thus, Mitchell effectively opened the door to the prosecutor\u2019s questioning. <em>See United States v. Daniels, </em>617 F.2d 146, 150 (5th Cir.1980) (holding that a prosecutor\u2019s remarks during closing argument that the defendant had not been fully cooperative were permissible to rebut the defendant\u2019s assertion that he had cooperated with the authorities when the defendant had \u201copened the door to comment on the issue of his cooperation, and the prosecutor\u2019s statement fell within the doctrine of fair reply.\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Moreover, as noted above, Mitchell has failed to establish that but for the prosecutor\u2019s questions, the outcome of his trial would have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Third, we reject Mitchell\u2019s claims that the district court erred in failing to provide the jury with an expert witness instruction for the testimony of David Snavely, or alternatively, that the failure of his trial counsel to request an expert witness instruction constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. Generally, district courts \u201chave broad discretion in formulating jury instructions,\u201d and we will not reverse a conviction due to a jury charge \u201cunless the issues of law were presented inaccurately, or the charge improperly guided the jury in such a substantial way as to violate due process.\u201d <em>Prather, </em>205 F.3d at 1270. However, a party invites error, and thus precludes review of any error on appeal, when it informs the district court that a jury instruction was acceptable. <em>United States v. Silvestri, </em>409 F.3d 1311, 1337 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that a party invites error when it states that an instruction \u201ccovered the bases\u201d or that a proposed correction to an instruction was not \u201cnecessary\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">As the record shows, Mitchell failed to request an expert witness instruction at the preliminary jury charge conference, and when asked by the court if an expert witness had testified, he failed to respond. In addition, after informing the court at the jury charge conference that he reviewed the instructions \u201cwith a fine tooth comb,\u201d he responded in the negative to the court\u2019s question about whether there was anything else it needed to consider with respect to the instructions. In this respect, Mitchell\u2019s comments to the court, or lack thereof, are the functional equivalent of the defendant in <em>Silvestn </em>replying that the instructions \u201ccovered the bases,\u201d and of the defendant in <em>Fulford </em>informing the court that its instructions were \u201cacceptable.\u201d <em>See Silvestri, </em>409 F.3d at 1337; <em>United States v. Fulford, </em>267 F.3d 1241, 1247 (11th Cir.2001). In addition, he responded in the negative to the court\u2019s question at the jury charge conference about whether there was anything else it needed to consider with respect to the instructions. As a result, Mitchell invited any error in the court\u2019s jury instructions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>and thus, we will not review this claim on appeal. <em>See Silvestri, </em>409 F.3d at 1337.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">We also decline to address Mitchell\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim on direct appeal because the record is not sufficiently developed to allow meaningful review of the claim. <em>See Merrill, </em>513 F.3d at 1308 (holding that \u201cexcept in the rare instance when the record is sufficiently developed, we will not address claims for ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal\u201d (quotation and alteration omitted)). We note, moreover, that Mitchell remains free to raise this claim in a collateral proceeding. <em>Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 503-04, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003) (holding that an appellant may raise an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim in a collateral proceeding, even if he failed to raise the issue on direct appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Finally, we disagree with Mitchell\u2019s argument that his sentence was substantively unreasonable because the district court failed to give weight to \u201cseveral\u201d mitigating factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We review the \u201c\u2018substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard,\u2019 \u201d based on the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190 (quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). This review is \u201cdeferential,\u201d requiring us to determine \u201cwhether the sentence imposed by the district court fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[WJe will not second guess the weight (or lack thereof) that the [district court] accorded to a given factor ... as long as the sentence ultimately imposed is reasonable in light of all the circumstances presented.\u201d <em>United States v. Snipes, </em>611 F.3d 855, 872 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation, alteration and emphasis omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 2962, 180 L.Ed.2d 245 (2011). We will \u201cvacate the sentence if, but only if, we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>See United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en </em>banc) (quotation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 1813, 179 L.Ed.2d 772 (2011). Although we do not automatically presume a sentence within the guideline range is reasonable, we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-12\">\u201cThe party challenging the sentence bears the burden to show it is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 674, 178 L.Ed.2d 502 (2010). The sentencing court need not explicitly articulate that it has considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and need not discuss each factor, so long as the record indicates that the court considered the factors in some form. <em>See United States v. Dorman, </em>488 F.3d 936, 944 (11th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>Cir.2007) (holding that a sentence was not unreasonable because, \u201c[d]espite the district court\u2019s failure to explicitly articulate that it had considered the \u00a7 3558(a) factors, by virtue of the court\u2019s consideration of [the defendant\u2019s] objections and his motion for a downward departure, the court did, in fact, consider a number of the sentencing factors ... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">On this record, Mitchell\u2019s is substantively reasonable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For starters, Mitchell\u2019s 747-month term total sentence is within, though at the high-end, of the advisory guideline range. As for Mitchell\u2019s argument that the court failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors he presented in mitigation, the record shows that the sentencing judge stated that she had reviewed the PSI and the advisory Guidelines. The court found that its sentence complied with the purposes of sentencing as set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) after considering the advisory guideline recommendation, the minimum mandatory sentences required by statute, and \u201call of the factors identified in [\u00a7 3553(a)(l-7) ].\u201d Thus, the fact that the court did not explicitly address the factors raised by Mitchell, such as the sentence received by others involved in the robbery, his age, or his history and characteristics, does not render the court\u2019s sentence substantively unreasonable. <em>See Dorman, </em>488 F.3d at 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Moreover, in requesting a 35-year total sentence, Mitchell effectively argued for a sentence of zero months\u2019 imprisonment\u2014 and thus, a substantial downward variance \u2014 for Counts 1, 2, and 4. However, Mitchell failed to establish that his circumstances, in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, justified such a variance. Rather, the court found that it \u201csimply couldn\u2019t\u201d sentence him to a minimum mandatory sentence of 35 years\u2019 imprisonment for numerous reasons supported by the record. For example, the court noted that the waitresses at the Waffle House had guns put to their heads, that there could have been victims on the road during the high speed chase with the police, and that police officers could have been killed during the incident. The court also decided not to sentence Mitchell at the low-end of the Sentencing Guidelines because (i) of the violence involved in the offenses, and (ii) Mitchell had not testified truthfully at trial. The court further said that it had \u201cthought long and hard\u201d about the sentence and that the sentence would \u201csend[ ] a message that this type of behavior isn\u2019t going to be tolerated\u201d and would compensate the victims for what had occurred. Accordingly, the record demonstrates that the district court properly considered the facts of this case, as well as the factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a), and the decision to impose a sentence at the high-end of the recommended guideline range was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b246-6\">.
