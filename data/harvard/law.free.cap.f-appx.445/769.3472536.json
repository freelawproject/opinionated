In 1999, he was found guilty by a jury of one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine, cocaine base, and heroin, four counts of possession with intent to distribute cocaine and aiding and abetting, one count of possession with intent to distribute cocaine base and aiding and abetting, two counts of possession with intent to distribute cocaine base and aiding and abetting, and six counts of use of a communication facility to facilitate the commission of conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance. He was sentenced to a total term of 292 months of imprisonment. His convictions and sentences were affirmed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-22\">In 2008, proceeding pro se, Bradford filed a \u00a7 3582(c) motion based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines. The district court granted Bradford\u2019s motion and reduced his sentence to 235 months in prison. In 2010, again proceeding pro se, Bradford filed a second \u00a7 3582(c) motion, requesting a further reduction in his sentence based on Amendment 748, which implemented substantive provisions of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (\u201cthe FSA\u201d) in the 2010 Sentencing Guidelines, and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. The district court de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>nied relief stating that Amendment 748 was not designated as an amendment to be given retroactive effect. On appeal, Bradford contends that the district court erred in denying his \u00a7 3582 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">The decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is discretionary, so the denial of a \u00a7 3582(c) motion is reviewed for abuse of that discretion. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010). The district court is authorized to reduce a sentence based on a sentencing range that subsequently was lowered by the Sentencing Commission only if the amendment to the guidelines is listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c). <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2); \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l); \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)); <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>105 F.3d 981, 982 (5th Cir.1997). Currently, Amendment 748, which will be redesignated as Amendment 750, is not listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(c), so the district court was not authorized to reduce Bradford\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 672, 674. Amendment 750 will not have retroactive effect until its effective date of November 1, 2011. Should Bradford become eligible for a lower sentence in November 2011, he may file a \u00a7 3582(c) motion at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">Because Bradford was not eligible for a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c), the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582(c) motion. <em>See </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(c); <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691-92, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010); <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 238 (5th Cir.2009). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED. Bradford\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b793-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
