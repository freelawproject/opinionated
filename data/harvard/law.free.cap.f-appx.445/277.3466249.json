Costello, R. Reginald Hyde, and John M. Reynolds (collectively, \u201cCross-Claim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>ants\u201d) appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) and Fed. R.Civ.P. 9(b) for failing to allege fraud with particularity against George P. Irish and Sandra K. Irish. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">In the fall-out from a foreclosure, Cross-Claimants filed a cross-complaint against the Irishes, alleging two counts of fraud. Cross-Claimants appeal the ultimate dismissal only of Count II, in which they argued that George P. Irish defrauded Cross-Claimants into signing a $428,571.43 promissory note and second mortgage against real property in Key West, Florida, which Cross-Claimants had previously purchased from the Irishes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court dismissed Count II without prejudice because it did not \u201cidentify (1) what false or fraudulent statements were made that resulted in Cross-Claimant\u2019s detrimental reliance, (2) when these statements were made, and (3) the content of these statements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Cross-Claimants filed an amended complaint that alleged that George P. Irish had \u201cmisrepresented to the Cross-Claimants that he was entitled to the promissory note and mortgage as an advance payment of profits on an investment of monies in Florida by the Cross-Claimants\u201d and that this misrepresentation resulted in an invalid \u201cpromissory note and mortgage [being] recorded\u201d against the Key West property \u201con or about March 28, 2006.\u201d The district court again dismissed Count II, this time with prejudice, because it did \u201cnot state with particularity what statements were made to induce Cross-Claimants to execute a note and mortgage in favor of the [Irishes], [did] not state the time and place of any statements or who made the statements, and [did] not state the manner in which any statements misled the Cross-Claimants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>a dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6). <em>Ziemba v. Cascade Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>256 F.3d 1194, 1199 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cThe allegations in the complaint must be taken as true and construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Hoffman-Pugh v. Ramsey, </em>312 F.3d 1222, 1225 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">Rule 9(b) requires that \u201c[i]n alleging fraud or mistake, a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake. Malice, intent, knowledge, and other conditions of a person\u2019s mind may be alleged generally.\u201d Fed.R.CivP. 9(b). This court has explained that Rule 9(b) \u201cis satisfied if the complaint sets forth (1) precisely what statements were made in what documents or oral representations or what omissions were made, and (2) the time and place of each such statement and the person responsible for making (or, in the case of omissions, not making) same, and (3) the content of such statements and the manner in which they misled the plaintiff, and (4) what the defendants obtained as a consequence of the fraud.\u201d <em>Ziemba, </em>256 F.3d at 1202 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">In the current case, Cross-Claimants\u2019 amended cross-complaint falls short of satisfying Rule 9(b). While they are correct in stating that the amended cross-complaint did include the content of the allegedly fraudulent statements and who made them, it still did not include where the fraudulent statements were made or how they were communicated (orally or in which documents). It also did not include when the statements were made. The amended cross-complaint did say that the result of the fraudulent statements was that a promissory note and second mortgage were recorded \u201con or about March <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>28, 2006, but that information does not indicate when the allegedly fraudulent statements themselves were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-2\">Courts should be aware that \u201capplication of Rule 9(b) ... must not abrogate the concept of notice pleading,\u201d but the \u201cparticularity rule serves an important purpose in fraud actions by alerting defendants to the precise misconduct with which they are charged and protecting defendants against spurious charges of immoral and fraudulent behavior.\u201d <em>Durham v. Bus. Mgmt. Assocs., </em>847 F.2d 1505, 1511-12 (11th Cir.1988) (quotations omitted). Where a complaint does not set out the time, location, or method of communication of allegedly fraudulent statements, it does not satisfy Rule 9(b). <em>See Cooper v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Fla., </em>19 F.3d 562, 567 (11th Cir.1994) (\u201c[P]leading must include facts as to time, place, and substance of the defendant\u2019s alleged fraud.\u201d); <em>Ziemba, </em>256 F.3d at 1202.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-3\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b302-6\">. Cross-Claimants do not appeal the dismissal of the first count of fraud or a third count that was added in the amended complaint, and therefore those appeals are waived. <em>DeYoung v. Schofield, </em>609 F.3d 1260, 1282 n. 21 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AI7\">.
