Because we find that Local 745 met its initial burden on summary judgment and the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Appellants\u2019 motion to alter or amend the judgment, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grants of summary judgment to Local 745 and IBT, respectively, and its denial of Appellants\u2019 motion to alter or amend the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-16\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b785-17\">Arrietta and Johnson were employees of Yellow Transportation in Dallas, Texas. Both Arrietta and Johnson were members of IBT and were represented locally by Local 745. Local 745 had been receiving reports of a racially hostile work environment at Yellow Transportation since as early as 2001. A fellow employee of Ar-rietta and Johnson, Fred Brooks, wrote a letter to IBT about these conditions in September 2004 and requested that the Union investigate. IBT forwarded that complaint along to Local 745 for follow-up. In response to Brooks\u2019s letter, Local 745 hired an independent investigator, Ruben Amendariz, to look into the complaints that Brooks had sent to IBT.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-18\">Amendariz tried to gather further details regarding the conditions about which Brooks complained, but neither Brooks nor the Appellants cooperated with Amen-dariz\u2019s investigation. Brooks finally did respond to some written questions from Amendariz, but there was little detail or substance to the answers. At no point did Brooks or the Appellants request the filing of a grievance or any other legal process. Amendariz concluded his investigation by sending a report to Local 745 that found Brooks\u2019s claims unsubstantiated in part due to a lack of cooperation from Brooks and the Appellants. As a result, Local 745 decided to take no further action on Brooks\u2019s letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>Appellants, along with other Yellow Transportation employees, filed a lawsuit against Yellow Transportation for discrimination. Following a verdict for Johnson in that suit, Appellants and other non-parties to this appeal filed a lawsuit under \u00a7 1981 against the Appellees, claiming a hostile work environment. The district court granted summary judgment to the Appel-lees. Arrietta and Johnson then sought to alter or amend the judgment, but the district court denied that motion as well. Ar-rietta and Johnson appealed both of those decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standards as the district court. <em>Hernandez v. Yellow Transp., Inc., </em>641 F.3d 118, 124 (5th Cir.2011). Summary judgment is appropriate where the movant shows that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 247, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986); Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a)). If the movant \u201cmeets the initial burden of demonstrating that there exists no genuine issue of material fact,\u201d then absent rebutting evidence by the non-movant, summary judgment should be granted. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 </em>U.S. 317[, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548] (1986)). In making the summary judgment determination, all inferences are drawn in favor of the non-movant. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">The district court may grant a motion to alter or amend the judgment under Rule 59(e) where there is \u201c(1) an intervening change in controlling law; (2) the availability of new evidence not previously available; or (3) the need to correct a clear error of law or prevent manifest injustice.\u201d <em>See In re Benjamin Moore &amp; Co., </em>318 F.3d 626, 629 (5th Cir.2002). We review a district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 59(e) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>Johnson v. Diversicare Afton Oaks, LLC, </em>597 F.3d 673, 677 (5th Cir.2010). Moreover, we have described a Rule 59(e) motion as an \u201cextraordinary remedy that should be used sparingly.\u201d <em>Templet v. HydroChem, Inc., </em>367 F.3d 473, 479 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b786-9\">A. Claims Against IBT</p>\n<p id=\"b786-10\">Appellants claim to raise error as to IBT, but their \u201cStatement of Issues\u201d does not address any conduct of IBT. Moreover, nowhere in their brief do they contend that summary judgment for IBT was improperly granted. Therefore, no claims against IBT have been properly presented to this court. Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A); <em>Quick Techs., Inc. v. Sage Group PLC, </em>313 F.3d 338, 343 n. 3 (5th Cir.2002) (\u201c[An] argument ... not listed in the \u2018Statement of Issues Presented for Appeal\u2019 nor addressed in the body of the brief ... is deemed waived.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-11\">B. Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b786-12\">Appellants assert error based on Local 745\u2019s failure to meet its initial burden on summary judgment to show that there were no disputed issues of material fact. Appellants cite to <em>Ashe v. Corley, </em>where we said, \u201cIt is not enough for the moving party to merely make a conclusory statement that the other party has no evidence to prove his case.\u201d 992 F.2d 540, 543 (5th Cir.1993); <em>see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 328, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986) (White, J., concurring) (\u201cIt is not enough to move for summary judgment without supporting the motion in any way or with a conclusory assertion that the plaintiff has no evidence to prove his case.\u201d). Appellants claim that Local 745\u2019s brief in support of summary judgment only made such conclusory statements, and therefore, summary judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>should not have been granted. We have also said that the summary judgment mov-ant may discharge her initial burden by \u201cpointing out the absence of evidence supporting the nonmoving party\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Duffy v. Leading Edge Prods., </em>44 F.3d 308, 312 (5th Cir.1995) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\">Although Local 745\u2019s brief does not point specifically to portions of the summary judgment record that show that Appellants could not make out their prima facie case at trial, there are instances where Local 745 notes the lack of evidence underlying Appellants\u2019 case. Local 745, in its brief in support of summary judgment, states that there was \u201cno dispute\u201d that it \u201cdid not participate in the creation of the alleged hostile work environment\u201d and that there are \u201cno allegations that any of the [Appellants] ever complained to Local 745 about the alleged hostile work environment.\u201d These were sufficient to discharge Local 745\u2019s burden under our caselaw. <em>See, e.g., Russ v. Int\u2019l Paper Co., </em>943 F.2d 589, 592 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">C. Motion to Alter or Amend</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">Appellants filed a Rule 59(e) motion wherein they sought to supplement the summary judgment record with deposition testimonies of Arrietta and Taylor that were not previously in the summary judgment record. Appellants wanted to enter this evidence to show that the Union refused to file a grievance alleging racial discrimination on Arrietta\u2019s behalf. The district court denied the motion because the Arrietta and Taylor deposition testimonies were available to the Appellants at the summary judgment phase but just went unintroduced. Therefore, the district court concluded that they were not \u201cnew evidence\u201d under <em>Benjamin Moore </em>such that a Rule 59(e) motion would be appropriate. All of this is true, and therefore, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in denying the Appellants\u2019 Rule 59(e) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-9\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b787-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the Appellees and its denial of Appellants\u2019 Rule 59(e) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b785-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
