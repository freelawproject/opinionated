We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-15\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-16\">In 1991, Chesapeake, GeoSouthern, and American Fluorite, Inc.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> entered into a Joint Development Agreement under which Chesapeake was to drill oil and gas wells on mineral leases owned by Geo-Southern. The parties engaged in extensive negotiations and revisions of this 1991 Agreement. Chesapeake was represented by an attorney throughout the negotiations; GeoSouthern was represented by its president, acting without the assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-17\">Under the 1991 Agreement, certain oil and gas Properties listed in the agreement were to be made available for development. Land selected from the Properties' for proposed wells was referred to in the 1991 Agreement as a Horizontal Prospect. If one of the parties to the agreement proposed developing all or part of an included Property, the other party could then elect to participate. Under the terms of the 1991 Agreement, GeoSouthern, as owner of the Properties, would assign a working interest in the Horizontal Prospect to Chesapeake. Thereafter, if the well on the Horizontal Prospect became noncommercial for sixty days or more, GeoSouthern had a right under the 1991 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number>Agreement and assignments to compel reassignment of Chesapeake\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-4\">Most of the Horizontal Prospects encompassed approximately 160 acres, however, two units were significantly larger. The parties agreed that these two units, Abbie 1-H (Abbie Well) and Neidra 1-H (Neidra Well), would be assigned to Chesapeake with GeoSouthern retaining the right to reassignment of the excess acreage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\">In 1993 the parties amended the 1991 Agreement and entered into a separate Joint Development Agreement with Union Pacific Resources Corporation. The 1993 Agreement covered several, but not all, of the properties included in the 1991 Agreement. While the 1991 Agreement applied only to listed Properties, the 1993 Agreement applied to a \u201cJoint Development Area\u201d defined geographically on a map. Upon execution of the 1993 Agreement, the 1991 Agreement was suspended as to Properties located within the Joint Development Area during the term of the 1993 Agreement,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and was terminated as to Properties outside the Joint Development Area unless they were listed'in Schedule F of the 1993 Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-6\">Three separate disputes later arose. The first dispute concerns the Victoria OL No. 1 Well. GeoSouthern proposed the Victoria Well as a Horizontal Prospect. Nineteen days after GeoSouthern notified Chesapeake of its designation of the Victoria Well as a Horizontal Prospect, Chesapeake elected to participate. GeoSouthern denied participation, claiming that Chesapeake\u2019s election was untimely. The 1991 Agreement provides that after receiving notice of designation by GeoSouthern Chesapeake must notify GeoSouthern of its election to participate \u201cin writing ... not less than fifteen (15) days after receipt of such notice.\u201d GeoSouthern claims that the parties intended that the election was to be made within fifteen days after receipt of notice, despite the literal language of the contract, and sought reformation of the contract. Chesapeake asserts that the literal language of the 1991 Agreement expressed the mutual intent of the parties. The district court granted Chesapeake\u2019s motion for summary judgment, holding that Chesapeake\u2019s response was timely and entitled Chesapeake to an interest in the Victoria Well, and entered a further declaratory judgment that GeoSouthern was not entitled to reformation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-9\">The second dispute arises from the Brangus 1-H Well. Following the initial assignment, this well became noncommercial for at least sixty days and GeoSouth-ern compelled reassignment of Chesapeake\u2019s interest under the terms of the 1991 Agreement. GeoSouthern later developed a new well, Brangus No. 1-RE, which included the acreage from the earlier Brangus Well, plus additional acreage. Chesapeake claims it is entitled to participate in the second Brangus Well on a reduced percentage basis on the theory that the underlying leases it reassigned to GeoSouthern are still Properties under the 1991 Agreement. The district court granted Chesapeake\u2019s motion for summary judgment, awarding it a proportional interest in the second Brangus Well, as well as in \u201cother wells which were the result of Horizontal Prospects under the 1991 [Agreement] and were reassigned to Geo-Southern in accordance with the provisions in the 1991 [Agreement] regarding wells which were noncommercial for at least sixty days.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-10\">The third dispute involves the Abbie Well and Neidra Well. The excess acreage from these wells was reassigned to GeoSouthern. Subsequently, GeoSouthern used acreage from these units to create a new well, the Helene No. 1-RE Well. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number>Chesapeake claims it is entitled to participate in the Helene Well on a reduced percentage basis on the grounds that it is comprised of portions of the Abbie Well and Neidra Well. The district court granted Chesapeake\u2019s motion for summary judgment awarding it a prorated interest in the Helene Well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-4\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-5\">I. <em>Summary Judgment Standard:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1048-6\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A factual issue is material if its resolution could affect the outcome of the action.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In determining whether there is a genuine issue as to any material fact, all justifiable inferences will be made in the nonmoving party\u2019s favor, and we will \u201cnot weigh the evidence or evaluate the credibility of witnesses .... \u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A \u201cdispute about a material fact is \u2018genuine\u2019... if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Therefore, summary judgment is appropriate if the nonmovant fails to establish facts supporting an essential element of his <em>prima facie </em>claim.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1048-7\">GeoSouthern complains that the district court applied the incorrect standard for summary judgment herein. After discussing the traditional standard, the trial court noted our articulation of the summary judgment standard applicable to those issues which are to be decided by the court in a nonjury trial. We observed in <em>Nunez v. Superior Oil Co.,</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that when \u201cthe evidentiary facts are not disputed, a court in a nonjury case may grant summary judgment if trial would not enhance its ability to draw inferences and conclusions.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In a nonjury trial, the judge is the ultimate trier of fact, and properly exercises judicial discretion by drawing inferences from evidence without resort to trial in instances such as are herein presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-13\">II. <em>GeoSouthem\u2019s Reformation Claim:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1048-14\">Paragraph 3.2 of the 1991 Agreement provides that GeoSouthern must advise Chesapeake in writing that it proposes to drill on a Horizontal Prospect, and Chesapeake must notify GeoSouthern of its intent to participate \u201cin writing ... not less than fifteen (15) days after receipt of such notice.\u201d .</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-15\">In October, 1997, GeoSouthern gave Chesapeake notice of a proposal to drill the Victoria Well. Nineteen days later, Chesapeake gave GeoSouthern written notice of its election to participate in the well. GeoSouthern concedes that Chesapeake\u2019s election was timely under the literal words of the 1991 agreement, but maintains that the language of the 1991 Agreement was the result of mutual mistake. GeoSouth-ern seeks reformation of the 1991 Agreement and a declaratory judgment that Chesapeake\u2019s response was untimely under the reformed time requirement. The district court refused to reform the 1991 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1021\">*1021</page-number>Agreement and declared Chesapeake\u2019s response timely thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-4\">Generally, an unambiguous contract \u201cmust be enforced as written, looking at the objective intent as manifested by the language used, rather than interpreting it by attempting to divine the subjective intent of the parties.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> To obtain reformation of a contract, a party must show that: (1) the parties reached an agreement on a material term, but (2) the written contract does not reflect the parties\u2019 agreement because of a mutual mistake.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The party seeking reformation has the burden of proving mutual mistake,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and must prove the facts and circumstances warranting reformation by clear and convincing evidence.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1049-5\">In the present action, there is no dispute that Chesapeake\u2019s attorney inserted the \u201cno less than fifteen days\u201d language into an early draft of the 1991 Agreement. The 1991 Agreement was thereafter subject to extensive revision and negotiations. There is no evidence whatsoever that the parties agreed, prior to executing the 1991 Agreement, that a response would be required within fifteen days, nor is there any evidence that Chesapeake understood the \u201cno less than\u201d language to require a response within fifteen days. Rather, Geo-Southern presented evidence that: (a) its president read and misunderstood the provision to require a response within fifteen days; (b) Chesapeake made subsequent requests that GeoSouthern respond within fifteen days; and (c) a 1997 letter from Chesapeake to GeoSouthern stating, \u201c[i]n accordance with our Agreement, Chesapeake will make its election within fifteen days of receipt of such notice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-11\">Examining the above evidence, the district court concluded that such evidence, if presented to the court in a bench trial \u201cwould not cause the Court to find the \u2018no less than fifteen days\u2019 provision in the 1991 [Agreement] was the result of a mutual mistake.\u201d We are compelled to agree. ' GeoSouthern has failed to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact. The above evidence is not subject to factual dispute nor could it be shaped by issues of credibility. The terms of the contract are unambiguous.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Our review of the record, parties\u2019 briefs, and legal authority, persuades that the trial court properly granted summary judgment denying GeoSouth-ern\u2019s claim for reformation.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1049-13\">III. <em>The Victoria Well:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1049-14\">As noted above, the district court properly denied GeoSouthern\u2019s demand for reformation. Chesapeake properly responded no less than fifteen days after receiving notice from GeoSouthern and, as a result, is entitled to its percentage interest in the Victoria Well as declared by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>IV. <em>The Helene No. 1-RE Well:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1050-4\">As noted above, the parties agreed that GeoSouthern would assign rights in the Abbie Well and Neidra Well to Chesapeake, but GeoSouthern retained the right to compel reassignment of Chesapeake\u2019s rights in the excess acreage. The relevant provision declared that the \u201cthe reassignment of [Chesapeake\u2019s] ... working interest will not reduce [Chesapeake\u2019s] (or its assigns) percentage interest in or production from any well, including increased production from subsequent operations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-5\">GeoSouthern subsequently exercised its right of reassignment as to excess acreage in the two wells. Chesapeake executed reassignments returning to GeoSouthern \u201call of [Chesapeake\u2019s] right, title and interest in and to the oil and gas leases.\u201d The reassignments are expressly made subject to the 1991 Agreement, and the initial assignments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-6\">Summary judgment is proper in cases involving the interpretation of an unambiguous contract.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It is undisputed that the Helene Well contains acreage which was, in part, previously included in the Abbie Well and Neidra Well. The Abbie Well and Neidra Well are properties listed under the 1991 Agreement. The development of these wells originally was proposed by Chesapeake under the 1991 Agreement, as amended by the 1993 Amendment. The assignments from GeoSouthern to Chesapeake precluded any reassignment from reducing Chesapeake\u2019s percentage interest in subsequent operations of the wells. The reassignments returned to GeoSouthern all of Chesapeake\u2019s right, title and interest in the excess acreage, but expressly were made subject to the 1991 Agreement and assignments. The district court correctly determined that taken together these contracts unambiguously established that the Abbie Well and Neidra Well excess acreage remained Properties under the 1991 Agreement when reassigned to GeoSouth-ern.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-9\">GeoSouthern subsequently formed the Helene Well by combining the reassigned acreage with other acreage. Under the unambiguous terms of the contracts, Geo-Southern\u2019s subsequent operations on the Helene Well produced a new Horizontal Prospect in which Chesapeake had a right to notice and an opportunity to participate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-10\">V. <em>The Brangus Well:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1050-11\">Paragraph 4.4 of the 1991 Agreement provides that GeoSouthern has a right \u201cto receive a reassignment of all rights to a Horizontal Prospect ... after the well on such Horizontal Prospect becomes noncommercial ... for a period of sixty (60) consecutive days.... \u201d The assignment of the Brangusl Well from Geo-Southern to Chesapeake included this right to compel reassignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-12\">Chesapeake was unambiguously provided with a right to participate in the Bran-gusl Well, however, the well became noncommercial for the required period and GeoSouthern compelled reassignment. The reassignment was under the existing contractual arrangement. The 1991 Agreement unambiguously includes the Brangusl Well, and the 1993 Amendment unambiguously provides that subsequent operations which amend the existing unit \u201cwill be a new Horizontal Prospect proposal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-13\">The district court determined that when Chesapeake reassigned its rights and interest in the Brangusl Well the land remained subject to the 1991 Agreement. When GeoSouthern later selected that land for development it constituted a new Hori<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>zontal Prospect under the 1991 Agreement, to which Chesapeake was entitled to notice and an opportunity to participate. Our review of the record persuades that the district court correctly interpreted and applied the unambiguous contracts as they relate to the Brangusl Well and Brangus2 Well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-5\">The district court held that Chesapeake is entitled to notice and an opportunity to participate in other wells which GeoSouth-ern may propose for further development following a reassignment under paragraph 4.4. A close review of the record, and the district court\u2019s ruling, persuades that the trial court\u2019s order was sufficiently tailored to encompass only those future prospects as may necessarily fall within the purview of the unambiguous provisions of the existing agreements, amendments and assignments between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-6\">For these reasons, the judgment appealed is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1046-11\">.
