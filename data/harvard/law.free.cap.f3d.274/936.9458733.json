Perrien challenges the sufficiency of the evidence that the assaults occurred within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States, the sufficiency of the evidence that he committed the assaults, and the allowance of a two-level sentencing enhancement for \u201cmore than minimal planning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b966-8\">On the day the assaults were discovered, Brandon Perrien (\u201cPerrien\u201d) remained at home with his daughters while his wife, Christina Perrien, who serves in the Air Force, worked. The couple lived in base housing on Keesler Air Force Base, in Biloxi, Mississippi. When Mrs. Perrien returned home from work, she noticed that one of her daughters, Cai\u2019Lah, did not move her left arm. When Mrs. Perrien tried to move Cai\u2019Lah\u2019s arm, the child began to scream. Mrs. Perrien took Cai\u2019Lah to the hospital, where the examining physician discovered that the child\u2019s upper left arm had been fractured. Cai\u2019Lah was so young at the time that she lacked the motor skills to injure herself accidentally. The doctor concluded that someone broke Cai\u2019Lah\u2019s arm. An x-ray revealed evidence of earlier rib fractures, and the doctor became concerned that the child had been abused. Mrs. Perrien retrieved her other daughter, Ai\u2019Jah, and brought her to the hospital. Subsequent examination of the children revealed, in each child, between 10 and 20 fractures that occurred on at least two separate occasions. Several of the fractures were of a type that rarely occurs in the absence of child abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-10\">Agents from the Air Force\u2019s Office of Special Investigations went to the Perrien home, where they found holes in the walls, broken furniture, and other indications of abusive behavior. The agents then interviewed Perrien and began an investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-11\">During the course of the investigation, Perrien gave two sworn statements in which he admitted behavior toward the children that could have caused their injuries. Mr. and Mrs. Perrien kept car seats and automatic swings in their living room which the children used to play. In his first statement, Perrien explained that the injury to Cai\u2019Lah\u2019s left arm occurred when using one of the car seats in the living room. \u201cI picked up Cai\u2019Lah from the car seat that was on the floor in the living room,\u201d he explained, \u201cand her left arm got caught in between the handle and the seat. Cai\u2019Lah\u2019s arm bent back as I picked her up. Cai\u2019Lah screamed and began to cry.\u201d Perrien explained that the children\u2019s rib fractures could have occurred when the children were sleeping in the same bed as Mrs. Perrien and him, because on two occasions he accidentally rolled over the twins.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-12\">In a subsequent interview with investigators, Perrien admitted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b966-13\">On about 10 separate occasions while taking care of the kids ... the stress became overwhelming and I snapped. When this occurred I handled the kids rougher than normal but still not with the intent of causing them any injuries. I realized after some of the incidents that I did injure the kids.... When I say that handled them rough I mean I would pull them out of the swing. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>there [sic] legs were caught I would just pull until it came loose. I would also squeeze their stomach [sic]. The primary reason I did this was because the kids were sometimes constipated and had gas. I was expiramenting [sic ] whether or not this technique would work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">The prosecution called Dr. Kent Hymel, an expert on child abuse and forensic pediatrics. Dr. Hymel testified that pulling the children from the car seats or swings in the way described by Perrien in his statements could have caused the arm injuries in the twins, if the force used in pulling them from the seats was sufficiently great. He further testified that it was unlikely that rolling over the twins would have fractured their ribs, but very forcefully squeezing the infants\u2019 stomachs could have caused the rib fractures. The jury found Perrien guilty of two counts of assault within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">The parties disagree as to the government\u2019s burden of proof on whether the assaults occurred \u201cwithin the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The United States asserts that the relevant burden is the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence.\u201d The defense assumes, and the district court instructed the jury, that the relevant burden is \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b967-10\">We need not resolve this issue, because we find that the government\u2019s evidence on situs was sufficient to support a guilty verdict even if the higher reasonable doubt standard applies. In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, we must \u201cdetermine whether a reasonable trier of fact could have found that the evidence established the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>E.g., United States v. Reveles, </em>190 F.3d 678, 686 (5th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Ortega Reyna, </em>148 F.3d 540, 543 (5th Cir.1998). We draw all inferences that may be drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict. <em>Id. </em>The evidence does not need to exclude every reasonable hypothesis of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>innocence; the jury is free to choose among reasonable interpretations of the evidence. <em>Reveles, </em>190 F.3d at 686; <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>74 F.3d 575, 577 (5th Cir.1996). We reverse, however, if the evidence \u201cgives equal or nearly equal circumstantial support to a theory of guilt and a theory of innocence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">Here, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the assaults were committed within the special jurisdiction. Perrien gave two statements in which he admitted using the car seats and the swings in the couple\u2019s living room in ways that could have caused injuries to the children. Perrien concedes, and the evidence at trial established, that the couple\u2019s home (including their living room) was within the special jurisdiction. Moreover, Mrs. Perrien took the family\u2019s car to work with her on the day Cai\u2019Lah\u2019s arm was fractured. Although Perrien could have taken the children out of the home in a stroller, he would not have had occasion to use a car seat except in the living room. And Dr. Hymel, the government\u2019s expert, testified that the kind of stomach compressions needed to fracture the childrens\u2019 ribs, if \u201cwitnessed by a disinterested third party would have been clearly perceived to have been highly dangerous, very likely injurious.\u201d The jury could reasonably have inferred from this statement that Perrien would have had a hard time carrying out the stomach compressions outside the privacy of the home. On this evidence, the jury was justified in finding that the assaults occurred within the special jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">Perrien also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence as to whether he (as opposed to someone else, presumably Mrs. Perrien) committed the assaults. None of Perrien\u2019s motions at trial raised this issue: they addressed only the sufficiency of the evidence of the location of the crime. It is therefore unclear whether his argument on this point has been properly preserved for appeal. Assuming arguendo that the issue is properly preserved, the jury had sufficient evidence to support a guilty verdict. Perrien, as the sole caretaker of the twins while Mrs. Perrien was at work, had ample opportunity to commit the assaults. Per-rien gave two statements that the jury could have viewed as incriminating, including a statement that he \u201csnapped\u201d on several occasions and treated the kids roughly. The medical evidence corroborated that some of his self-described \u201crough\u201d handling could have caused the observed injuries in the children. This is sufficient evidence to support a guilty verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-7\">The final issue is whether the district court properly allowed a two-level sentencing enhancement for \u201cmore than minimal planning.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.2(b)(1). \u201cMore than minimal planning\u201d includes, among other things, taking \u201csignificant affirmative steps ... to conceal the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Whether Perrien engaged in more than minimal planning is a fact question that we review for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Calbat, </em>266 F.3d 358 (5th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Lage, </em>183 F.3d 374, 384 (5th Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 1163, 120 S.Ct. 1179, 1180, 145 L.Ed.2d 1086 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-10\">Here, Perrien acknowledged injuring the children and then not taking them to a doctor. He told his wife that he did not know what was wrong with Cai\u2019Lah\u2019s arm, but later admitted to investigators that he had injured her when removing her from a car seat. It does not seem to be \u201cclear error\u201d for the district court to conclude on these facts that Perrien had engaged in \u201csignificant affirmative steps\u201d to conceal his offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>We therefore AFFIRM the convictions and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b967-7\">. An existing Fifth Circuit case, <em>United States v. Bell, </em>993 F.2d 427 (5th Cir. 1993), holds that the preponderance of the evidence standard applies to the jurisdictional elements in two statutes, the Assimilative Crimes Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 13, and the federal aggravated sexual abuse statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c). Both statutes, like 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 113(a), require that the offenses occur \"within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b967-8\">We question our holding in <em>Bell. </em>In <em>Apprendi </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the Supreme Court recently reaffirmed the rule that any element included in the offense-defining part of a criminal statute must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>at 476, 120 S.Ct. 2348 (\"[the Due Process Clause and Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial] indisputably entitle a criminal defendant to a 'jury determination that [he] is guilty of every element of the crime with which he is charged, beyond a reasonable doubt' \u201d (internal citations omitted)); <em>accord, e.g., In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970) (\"[W]e explicitly hold that the Due Process Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged.\u201d); <em>United States v. Gaudin, </em>515 U.S. 506, 115 S.Ct. 2310, 132 L.Ed.2d 444 (1995); <em>Patterson v. New York, </em>432 U.S. 197, 209-10, 97 S.Ct. 2319, 53 L.Ed.2d 281 (1977) (\"[T]he Due Process Clause requires the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt all of the elements <em>included in the definition of the offense </em>of which Perrien is charged.\u201d (emphasis supplied)); <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur, </em>421 U.S. 684, 95 S.Ct. 1881, 44 L.Ed.2d 508 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-12\">Here, the requirement that the assault be committed \"within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States\u201d is unambiguously included in the offense-defining part of the statute. We therefore doubt that a mere preponderance of the evidence on this element could suffice to support a guilty verdict.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
