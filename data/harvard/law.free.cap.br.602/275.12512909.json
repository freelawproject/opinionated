Doc. No. 8. The plaintiff, the law firm of Liddle &amp; Robinson, seeks to proceed with its adversary complaint despite filing it three days after the deadline. Eric A. Zakarin, the debtor, objected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The court notes that this adversary proceeding is assigned to the docket of the Hon. Rosemary Gambardella. In her current absence however, and after all briefing and oral argument was complete, the proceeding was assigned to the undersigned for disposition. On March 26, 2019, the court sent a letter to counsel advising them of the same and gave them 14 days in which to object to the court's deciding the matter on the papers. As no objections were received, this matter is ripe for disposition. After review of the extensive briefing and the oral argument of March 5, 2019, this court determines that Rule 4007(c) may not be equitably tolled, and the Motion should be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION AND VENUE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This matter before the court is a core proceeding pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A) and (O), and the court has jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and the Standing Order of Reference issued by the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey on July 23, 1984, as amended on September 18, 2012, referring all bankruptcy cases to the bankruptcy court.

Bankr. No. 18-14226, Doc. No. 1. On Schedule E/F, he acknowledged his debt to Liddle &amp; Robinson for attorney's fees in the amount of $ 135,000.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    at 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 3, 2018, the court set June 5, 2018 as the deadline for filing a complaint objecting to discharge or nondischargeability of a debt.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Doc.

Doc. No. 8-2, \u00b6 4. But when he sought to file the complaint electronically via this court's CM/ECF system, he found he could not do so, as he was not registered for e-filing in New Jersey.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 4.

He stated in the email that he would follow up in the morning, electronically-filing and paying the filing fee then, once his registration was processed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Notably, Liddle\n   &amp; Robinson did not also send a copy of that letter or the complaint to debtor's counsel. Doc. No. 11, p. 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The receipt Mr. McCann received from PACER, however, indicated that he had an active registration for \"case search\" only. The receipt reflected that status on June 6, 2016 of his registration request for the District of New Jersey was \"unknown.\" Doc. No. 8-2, Exh. 1. It explained that there were three possible statuses: pending, processed, and active.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Only \"active\" would mean that he could electronically-file documents on the docket. What Mr. McCann seemed to not grasp at the time was that he was not granted that filing status because he is not an attorney admitted to practice in New Jersey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The morning of June 6, 2018, Mr. McCann followed up with the court's CM/ECF Help Desk with the intent of resolving the registration delay and also e-filing and providing payment in connection with the filing of the Adversary Complaint and related documents.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 6. He stated that the individual at the CM/ECF Help Desk advised him that the registration process would likely take another day and recommended that Liddle &amp; Robinson send a courier to the Clerk's Office to file an original hard copy of the Adversary Complaint that day.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00b66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Thus, that same day, Mr. McCann arranged with Keating &amp; Walker Attorney Service, Inc., a legal support service, to file a hard copy of the original Adversary Complaint, the appropriate Summons and Notice, and a cover letter explaining the attempted e-filing of the night of June 5, 2018.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 7. Mr. McCann alleged then that \"due to confusion and/or misunderstanding on his part, the courier sent by Keating &amp; Walker did not believe that he was able to leave the papers for filing with the Clerk of the court on June 6, 2018 and returned to his office without filing the Adversary Complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In fact, the problem was that Mr. McCann had not supplied the courier with the filing fee, therefore the Clerk's Office rejected the attempted filing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Exh. 2 (McCann's 6/6/2018 5:25 p.m. email to Purce).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The evening of June 6, 2018, Mr. McCann received from the court's employee, Sharon Purce, an email confirming his registration for access to the court's NextGen CM/ECF system.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Exh. 2.

Liddle &amp; Robinson retained local counsel and filed the instant motion to extend the time to file an adversary complaint.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Doc.

Nos. 9, 12. On March 5, 2019, the court heard oral argument. At the close of that argument, the debtor raised the recent Supreme Court decision of\n   <em>\n    Nutraceutical Corp. v. Lambert\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12623923\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/710/\">\n    139 S.Ct. 710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12623923\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/710/\">\n    203 L.Ed.2d 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2019). The court granted leave to submit the opinion for the court's consideration by March 8, 2019, while permitting Liddle &amp; Robinson to respond by March 15, 2019. The debtor submitted the opinion on March 7, Doc. No. 17, and Liddle &amp; Robinson filed no response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Liddle &amp; Robinson asks the court to apply the doctrine of equitable tolling to extend the deadline to file its complaint despite the limits expressed in the Bankruptcy Rules. It argues that it was filing pro se and thus had no reason to believe it needed to engage local counsel. It further argues that it exercised due diligence in attempting to file the complaint, sending a copy to chambers and filing a hard copy with the court. It argues that the filing deadline under Bankruptcy Rule 4007(c) is not jurisdictional, and thus the court should apply principles of equitable tolling to deem its complaint timely filed. It points out that the Supreme Court has held that Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 4004, an analogous rule addressing the deadline to object to discharge, is not jurisdictional.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kontrick v. Ryan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897340\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/443/\">\n    540 U.S. 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897340,9066734\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/124/906/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 906\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897340\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/443/\">\n    157 L.Ed.2d 867\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004). It then cites cases applying equitable tolling that it argues are similar to its\n   situation. It asserts that if the court does not extend the deadline, then it will suffer the injury of its $ 135,000 claim being discharged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The debtor replies that the Third Circuit has not recognized equitable tolling in connection with Rule 4007(c). It further asserts that, even if this Circuit did recognize the doctrine, Liddle &amp; Robinson's motion must be denied because its failure to timely file was entirely its fault. He argues that attorney negligence-the late filing was not out of the control of the law firm-does not rise to the extraordinary level needed for the court to excuse missing the deadline. The debtor asserts that Liddle &amp; Robinson failed to act with due diligence to preserve its claim because it chose to wait until the evening of the deadline to attempt to register and electronically file its complaint in an unfamiliar system to it, and chose not to retain local counsel to file the complaint despite the fact that the attorney signing the complaint is not admitted to practice in this court. As a result, the debtor submits that the plaintiff cannot meet the burden necessary for the extraordinary relief it requested, which the debtor claims is to be applied only sparingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The parties agree that the application of equitable tolling is Liddle &amp; Robinson's only means for deeming its complaint timely filed. Liddle &amp; Robinson seeks a finding of nondischargeability of its claim pursuant to section 523(a)(2)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code. Section 523(c) of the Code provides that a debtor shall be discharged from a debt of a kind specified in paragraph (2), (4) or (6) of section 523(a) unless the creditor requests that the court determine that such debt be excepted from discharge under paragraph (2), (4) or (6) of section 523(a).\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). Thus, these types of nondischargeability requests must be brought in the bankruptcy court. While Rule 4007 provides that the time to file a complaint other than under section 523(c) may be filed at any time, one under section 523(c) \"shall be filed no later than 60 days after the first date set for the meeting of creditors under \u00a7 341(a).\" Fed. R. Bankr. P. 4007(b), (c). Regarding extension of that deadline, the Rule states \"On motion of a party in interest, after hearing on notice, the court may for cause extend the time fixed under this subdivision.\" Fed. R. Bankr. P. 4007(c). Importantly, \"[t]he motion shall be filed before the time has expired.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Rule 9006, which provides for enlargement of specified periods in the rules, including \"on motion made after the expiration of the specified period ... where the failure to act was the result of excusable neglect,\" Fed.

A less onerous means for protecting the creditor's rights in this regard is to liberally grant timely filed requests for extensions to the bar date where, as in this case, the creditor has a valid and explainable suspicion regarding the existence of facts giving rise to a dischargeability cause of action.
