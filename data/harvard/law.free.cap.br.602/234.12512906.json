S.D.N.Y. 2018), the Plaintiff, Salvatore LaMonica (\"Trustee\"), trustee of the administratively consolidated estates of TransCare Corporation and numerous debtor-affiliates (collectively, \"TransCare\" or the \"Estate\"), filed an Amended Complaint seeking to recover damages from the Defendants\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   under multiple theories. (\n   <em>\n    See Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   , dated Nov. 28, 2018 (\"\n   <em>\n    Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   \") (ECF Doc. #53).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Certain Defendants named in Count IV (Recharacterization of Debt as Equity against Ark II), Count VI (Lender Liability, Common Law Breach of Fiduciary Duty, and Common Law Assumption of Control against all Defendants other than Tilton), and Count XI (Constructive Fraudulent Transfer; Recovery of Same; Claim Disallowance against PPAS) moved to dismiss those Counts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Certain Claims Asserted in the Chapter 7 Trustee's Amended Adversary Complaint\n   </em>\n   , dated January 14, 2019 (\"\n   <em>\n    Motion to Dismiss\n   </em>\n   \") (ECF Doc. # 60);\n   <em>\n    see also Defendants' Reply in Further Support of Their Motion to Dismiss Certain Claims Asserted in the Chapter 7 Trustee's Amended Adversary Complaint\n   </em>\n   , dated March 15, 2019 (\"\n   <em>\n    Reply\n   </em>\n   \") (ECF Doc. # 68).) The Trustee opposed the motion. (\n   <em>\n    See Plaintiff's Opposition to Defendants' Partial Motion to Dismiss\n   </em>\n   , dated March 1, 2019 (\"\n   <em>\n    Opposition\n   </em>\n   \") (ECF Doc. # 63.))\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At the March 28, 2019 hearing, the Court granted the motion to dismiss the constructive fraudulent transfer claim asserted in Count XI against PPAS and reserved decision on the balance of the\n   <em>\n    Motion to Dismiss\n   </em>\n   . For the reasons that follow, the\n   <em>\n    Motion to Dismiss\n   </em>\n   is granted as to Count VI and denied as to Count IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Prior to bankruptcy, TransCare provided emergency medical transportation services,\n   including 911 ambulance services, to hospitals and municipalities in New York, Pennsylvania and Maryland, and disability transportation services for municipal authorities, including the New York City Transit Authority (\"MTA\"). (\u00b6\u00b6 1, 8.) Tilton indirectly owned the majority of TransCare's equity and was the sole member of TransCare's Board of Directors. (\u00b6\u00b6 2, 9, 22.) She also managed and directly or indirectly owned the Entity Defendants, all part of the \"Patriarch\" family of companies. (\u00b6 9;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-14.) The Entity Defendants operated from the same headquarters in New York City, their employees worked together in the same office space, they shared the same email domain, documents and information (including information about TransCare), worked on matters without regard to which entity was their specific employer and held themselves out to the world as \"Patriarch Partners.\" (\u00b6 29.) Tilton also controlled non-defendants Zohar CDO 2003-1, Ltd., Zohar II 2005-1, Ltd., Zohar III, Ltd. (collectively, the \"Zohar Entities\") as their collateral managers. (\u00b6 30.) Finally, Tilton owned 99% of and controlled non-Defendant Ark Investment Partners II, L.P. (\"Ark Investment\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The 2003 Credit Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   TransCare had previously filed pre-negotiated chapter 11 cases in 2002. (\u00b6 20.) Prior to the 2002 case, Ark II had purchased approximately 51% of TransCare's outstanding senior secured debt, and it acquired approximately 51% of the shares of the reorganized TransCare under the confirmed plan in July 2003. (\u00b6 22.) The 2003 chapter 11 plan also provided for a $ 33.5 million credit facility for Reorganized TransCare that was memorialized in a Credit Agreement, dated Aug. 4, 2003 (\"Credit Agreement\"). (\u00b6 23.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   PPAS served as administrative agent under the Credit Agreement, and approximately 51% of the loans under the Credit Agreement were held by two Tilton-controlled entities, Ark II and Ark Investment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Zohar III, Ltd. took over Ark II's loan in 2007 and Ark II ceased to be a lender under the Credit Agreement. (\u00b6 27 n. 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   From at least 2014 through the filing of TransCare's bankruptcy, the lenders under the Credit Agreement included two third party lenders, Credit Suisse Alternative Capital LLC and First Dominion Funding I, the three Zohar Entities and Ark Investment. (\u00b6 27.) At the time the Credit Agreement was executed and at the time each amendment was executed, Tilton controlled PPAS (the administrative agent), the \"Required Lenders\" (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and TransCare. (\u00b6\u00b6 25, 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Tilton's Control of TransCare and the Entity Defendants\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The gravamen of the\n   <em>\n    Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   is that Tilton used her control over TransCare and the Entity Defendants to\n   breach her fiduciary duties and self-deal, all to the detriment of TransCare. For example, she prohibited TransCare from refinancing the debt owed under the Credit Agreement, (\u00b6 31), and caused TransCare to pay over $ 11 million to PPAS on account of the loans under the Credit Agreement between 2012 and 2014. (\u00b6 38.) In a July 2012 written consent of the sole director, Tilton prohibited any TransCare officer from conducting various activities, including disclosing financial or shareholder information to any third party, entering into any contract not contemplated by the annual plan or engaging legal counsel, and restricted certain functions to a designated executive. (\u00b6 34.) As of 2015, however, Tilton had not approved an annual plan or selected a designated executive as contemplated in the 2012 written consent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Therefore, all powers remained in the board of directors, with Tilton as the sole director. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Brian Stephen, in-house counsel at Patriarch Partners who claimed to represent TransCare's board, explained to TransCare's CEO, Glenn Leland, that Leland was prohibited from taking even preliminary steps to any actions requiring board approval. (\u00b6 35.) This effectively prohibited any independent action by TransCare's executives. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Although Tilton retained complete control of TransCare, she rarely communicated directly with its executives, instead directing them to communicate through, and take orders from, her employees at various Patriarch entities. (\u00b6 36.) These employees included Stephen, Jean-Luc Pelissier (Executive Managing Director at PPMG), Michael Greenberg (Analyst at Patriarch Partners), Randy Jones (Managing Director at Patriarch Partners), Brad Schneider (Analyst at Patriarch Partners), and Scott Whalen (Tilton's son-in-law, Credit Analyst at Patriarch Partners until 2014/2015, and thereafter Director at PPMG). (\u00b6\u00b6 35-36, 41.) Their orders to TransCare included the hiring and firing of TransCare's employees and the payment or non-payment of TransCare's vendors. (\u00b6 37.) In transactions between PPAS or Ark II and TransCare, Tilton would execute the agreements on behalf of PPAS or Ark II, and direct TransCare executives or employees of other Patriarch entities to execute the agreements on behalf of TransCare. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) For example, Greenberg executed amendments to the Credit Agreement on behalf of TransCare. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) TransCare lacked independent counsel in any transaction entered into with any of Tilton's companies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    C. TransCare's Financial Decline and Potential Purchasers\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   From 2012 through 2014, TransCare operated profitably with revenues of approximately $ 130 million and positive EBITDA. (\u00b6 38.) The MTA Contract was TransCare's most lucrative business segment, historically generating $ 22 million in revenue and $ 3.7 million in EBITDA. (\u00b6 39.) By 2015, however, TransCare's costs grew and it began losing clients because it was not investing in new vehicles. (\u00b6 38.) Years of under-investment left TransCare without the financial ability to fund payroll, pay vendors, or obtain insurance in the ordinary course. (\u00b6 3.) TransCare's accounts payable grew and its critical vendors went unpaid. (\u00b6 38.) TransCare's executives were told that \"not paying bills on time and in full was the 'Patriarch way.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) TransCare's business was in such distress that the MTA indicated that it might not renew the MTA Contract, which was set to expire in mid-2015, due to TransCare's deteriorating financial condition. (\u00b6 39.) TransCare had such poor credit that suppliers were refusing to supply parts for the MTA vehicles even though the MTA reimbursed TransCare for the parts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Throughout 2015, TransCare's financial distress resulted in nearly missing or actually missing critical payments such as payroll and payroll taxes, failing to pay essential vendors, such as EZ-Pass, and lacking sufficient cash on hand to pay necessary expenses like gasoline, uniforms, and replacement engine parts. (\u00b6\u00b6 3, 40, 45-46, 48-53 &amp; 61-65.) Regulators threatened to shut down the MTA business, (\u00b6 52), and key suppliers were refusing to continue doing business. (\u00b6\u00b6 39, 61.) TransCare employees were forced to pay for tolls and gas out of pocket. (\u00b6 53.) On February 4, 2015, TransCare executives warned Tilton that the company lacked cash to make payroll the following day and faced a projected $ 6.7 million shortfall by the end of March. (\u00b6 40.) By the end of the year, employees were leaving in frustration, including the head of the MTA paratransit division. (\u00b6 63, 66.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In 2015, the CEO of TransCare received multiple offers from competitors to purchase TransCare or portions of TransCare's business. (\u00b6\u00b6 41-44, 53-55, 66, 68.) These offers were rebuffed. For example, on February 5, 2015, Glenn Leland, TransCare's CEO, advised Pelissier and Schneider that National Express offered to purchase TransCare's MTA Contract for approximately $ 15-18 million and to immediately deliver a non-refundable deposit in the amount of $ 1.7 million to begin negotiations. (\u00b6\u00b6 42-42.) Around the same time, RCA Ambulance Service expressed an interest in purchasing TransCare to Tilton and TransCare. (\u00b6 44.) On February 18, 2015, Leland sent a draft stabilization plan for TransCare to Pelissier, Schneider and Greenberg noting that TransCare was \"\n   <strong>\n    not\n   </strong>\n   a viable on-going concern without immediate investment and assertive course correction\" (emphasis in original). (\u00b6 45.) He presented the sale of the MTA Contract as an alternative to the complete collapse of TransCare's business. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   National Express approached TransCare again in July 2015, along with two other national ambulance companies interested in purchasing all or parts of TransCare. (\u00b6\u00b6 53-54.) National Express delivered a signed letter of intent to TransCare on July 10, 2015, offering to purchase the MTA Contract for $ 6-7 million, plus the assumption of $ 2 million in related liabilities. (\u00b6 55.) Leland sent the offer on to Pelissier, Greenberg and Whalen. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Whalen responded to Leland immediately, denying him permission to engage the offer and stating that a letter of intent was \"way premature.\" (\u00b6 56.) National Express reached out again in December 2015, offering to purchase the MTA Contract for approximately $ 6-8 million. (\u00b6 66.) Leland again relayed the offer to Pelissier, Greenberg and Stephen recommending that TransCare immediately begin negotiations of the sale of the MTA Contract to avoid a complete shutdown. (\u00b6\u00b6 66-69).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Tilton and her employees refused to let TransCare's executives consider any of these offers, and instead, provided cash infusions to the company throughout the year. (\u00b6\u00b6 43-44, 47, 56-59, 67-69.) The only time Tilton spoke with Leland directly was to berate TransCare's CEO \"for daring to explore a sale option.\" (\u00b6 43.) Stephen told Leland that he \"had no authority to even discuss sale options of any assets with any company,\" and \"claimed that TransCare would not receive any of the potential sale proceeds because 'Lynn has other debts.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Pelissier told Leland \"that under no circumstances could he attempt to raise funds by exploring potential sales.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Whalen told Leland to make clear \"that the business is not for sale at this time.\" (\u00b6 56.) Leland confirmed that despite TransCare's desperate financial situation, he was being instructed to tell National Express that \"per Patriarch Partners,\" TransCare was not for sale. (\u00b6 58.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   A complicating factor in TransCare's financial situation occurred in July 2015, when Wells Fargo discovered a $ 1.5 million discrepancy in TransCare's reported receivables and promptly suspended TransCare's credit line. (\u00b6 52.) This suspension caused a bounced insurance check and missed payroll. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In mid-December 2015, Tilton began exploring sale options for TransCare. (\u00b6 71.) Greenberg delivered research on comparable sales of ambulance companies to Tilton in December 2015, which implied a valuation for the MTA Contract of $ 22-36 million. (\u00b6 72.) In late December 2015, Tilton sent a proposal to Wells Fargo to sell TransCare's assets by September 2016. (\u00b6 73.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On or about January 15, 2016 and January 29, 2016, PPAS paid approximately $ 810,000 and $ 690,000 (the \"January Advances\") to insurance companies on behalf of TransCare. (\u00b6 76.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Events Surrounding the Filing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   According to the\n   <em>\n    Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   , February 9, 2016 marks the date that Tilton began to execute her plan to acquire TransCare's most valuable assets and scuttle TransCare. On February 9, 2016, Pelissier informed the MTA that the owner of TransCare wished to transfer the MTA Contract to a different entity, (\u00b6 79), Tilton's personal lawyers at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom LLP contacted attorneys at Curtis Mallet-Prevost, Colt &amp; Mosle LLP about the need to file chapter 11 cases for TransCare immediately, and TransCare signed an engagement letter the following day. (\u00b6 80.) On February 10, 2016, Tilton also incorporated Transcendence and its wholly-owned subsidiary Transcendence II. (\u00b6 81.) The same day, Greenberg told TransCare's vice president, Glen Youngblood, that Transcendence II would be taking over TransCare's MTA Contract, which then had an estimated $ 25 million in revenue, and its paratransit operations, which had an estimated $ 31 million in revenue. (\u00b6 83.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Also on February 10, 2016, nearly four weeks after the initial January Advance, Tilton sought to convert the January Advances into a new loan. At her direction, Greenberg provided documents to TransCare related to a new credit facility between TransCare and Ark II, including a loan agreement (\"Ark II Credit Agreement\"), dated \"as of January 15, 2016,\" a security agreement, a guaranty, and an intercreditor agreement between Ark II and PPAS. The latter subordinated the lenders lien and right to payment under the Credit Agreement to the lien and right to payment granted to Ark II under the Ark II Credit Agreement. (\u00b6 84.) The intercreditor agreement was signed by Tilton on behalf of both Ark II and PPAS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Ark II Credit Agreement contemplated loans of up to $ 6.5 million, but this amount was never made available to TransCare.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\u00b6 85.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   For the Transcendence plan to succeed, Tilton needed to convince employees, vendors, insurers, and governmental agencies to accept the substitution of Transcendence for TransCare. (\u00b6 88.) Tilton held meetings with TransCare's executives in Patriarch's offices to model out which business units would be transferred to Transcendence and estimate the amount of revenue they could be expected to bring to the new company. (\u00b6 88.) On February 11,\n   2016, Randy Jones told TransCare executives who were working on the plan and being offered positions in the new Transcendence company that they \"cannot breath[e] a word until we have the overall deal finalized.\" (\u00b6 89.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On February 24, 2016, PPAS purported to effectuate a strict foreclosure under Article 9 on certain of TransCare's assets, including its ambulances and paratransit division. (\u00b6\u00b6 94-95 &amp; n. 6 &amp; 7.) Apparently, PPAS accepted the MTA Contract, the stock of three TransCare subsidiaries, two vendor contracts, and certain of TransCare's personal property in exchange for the satisfaction of $ 10,000,000 under the Credit Agreement. (\u00b6 95.) The documentation did not provide notice to Wells Fargo or explain the basis for the $ 10 million figure. (\u00b6 96.) Tilton signed a written consent as the sole director of Transcendence II to authorize it to enter into an assignment agreement for the MTA Contract. (\u00b6 98.) In addition, pursuant to a bill of sale and other documents dated February 24, 2016, Transcendence received other foreclosed assets of TransCare, including the equity of debtors TransCare Pennsylvania, Inc., TC Hudson Valley Ambulance Corp. and TC Ambulance Corporation. (\u00b6 99.) Although PPAS executed the foreclosure, Tilton took the position that Ark II was the senior secured lender and distributed the proceeds to Ark II rather than PPAS. (\u00b6 100.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    E. The Unraveling of the Strict Foreclosure and the Bankruptcy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On February 24, 2016, Tilton directed TransCare and ten subsidiaries to file for chapter 7 relief. (\u00b6 103.) Late in the evening on February 25, 2016, individuals at Patriarch realized that the Transcendence plan would not succeed. (\u00b6 105.) At 10:53 p.m., Stephen sent an email directing TransCare executives to \"secure\" as many assets as possible, targeting the most valuable, portable assets first, including TransCare's accounts receivable server. (\u00b6\u00b6 105-06.) TransCare's vice president refused and contacted the Trustee. (\u00b6 106.) On February 25, 2016, PPAS advised the Trustee that it had conducted a strict foreclosure of certain assets that were not part of the Estate. (\u00b6 107.) On April 25, 2016, the three TransCare entities whose assets were part of the strict foreclosure filed chapter 7 petitions. (\u00b6 107.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    F. This Adversary Proceeding\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Trustee filed the original complaint on February 22, 2018, (ECF Doc. # 1), and the Defendants moved to dismiss several counts. (ECF Doc. # 10.) The Court partially granted and partially denied the motion and granted the Trustee leave to file the\n   <em>\n    Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    TransCare\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12512267\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/592/272/#p287\">\n    592 B.R. at 292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   includes fourteen counts but the\n   <em>\n    Motion to Dismiss\n   </em>\n   only targets Counts IV (Recharacterization), Count VI (Lender Liability and Breach of Fiduciary Duty) and Count XI (Constructive Fraudulent Transfer).

The ultimate question for the court is \"whether the parties called an instrument one thing when in fact they intended it as something else.... Answers lie in facts that confer context case-by-case.\"\n   <em>\n    In re SubMicron\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"556397\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/432/448/#p455\">\n    432 F.3d at 456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Here, the factual issues cannot be resolved on the\n   <em>\n    Motion to Dismiss\n   </em>\n   . On the one hand, the Ark II Credit Agreement looks like a loan. It described itself as a loan (Factor #1), it contained a fixed maturity date and schedule of quarterly payments (Factor #2), it included a fixed rate of interest and interest payments (Factor #3), and it was secured by a lien on certain assets (Factor #7). In addition, the loan was not subordinated to creditors; rather, the Ark II lien primed the existing lien of the lenders under the 2003 Credit Agreement (Factor # 9), and the funds were used to pay ongoing, insurance expenses and not to acquire capital assets (Factor # 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On the other hand, the January Advances were made by a different entity several weeks before the Ark II Credit Agreement was executed, and viewed in that light, the same factors line up in favor of an equity infusion. In other words, the\n   <em>\n    Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   implies that at the time of the January Advances, the parties did not intend the funds to be a loan from Ark II to TransCare: there was no loan agreement (Factor #1), no repayment terms, maturity date, or regular payments, (Factor #2), no agreed rate of interest or interest payments, (Factor #3), and no documentation of a security interest or lien (Factor # 7).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Other\n   <em>\n    AutoStyle\n   </em>\n   factors also weigh in favor of recharacterization. At the time of the January Advances and even when they were documented, there is no indication that the parties had any expectation that the loan would be repaid or the source of that repayment (Factor # 4). The Ark II Credit Agreement moved in lock step with Tilton's plan under which PPAS would foreclose on TransCare's assets, assign them to one of the Transcendence defendants and place TransCare into a liquidating chapter 7 bankruptcy. Tilton could not have reasonably expected that TransCare could ever repay the Ark II loan. Furthermore, the\n   <em>\n    Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   alleges that by 2015, TransCare lacked the funds to pay its bills or fix its vehicles and in July, Wells Fargo suspended TransCare's line of credit. These allegations imply that TransCare was undercapitalized (Factor # 5) and unable to obtain third party financing (Factor # 8). If there is no outside\n   financing, and no reasonable creditor would have acted in the same manner,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   this is strong evidence that the advances were capital contributions rather than loans.\n   <em>\n    AutoStyle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9469401,9467287\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/269/726/\">\n    269 F.3d at 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Under the facts and circumstances as pled by the Trustee, the Ark II loan looks like part of a corporate reorganization. Ark II owned 55.7% of insolvent TransCare's stock, (\u00b6 13), and approximately 55% of Transcendence's stock. (\u00b6 81.) Through the strict foreclosure and related transactions, Tilton swapped Ark II's valueless equity in TransCare for the same interest in Transcendence's more valuable equity. While Wells Fargo's liens still encumbered some of the TransCare assets that would ultimately be transferred to Transcendence, Ark II jumped ahead of the secured lenders under the Credit Agreement and primed them. Furthermore, Ark II was not liable for any of TransCare's unsecured debt. The allegations suggest that the January Advances used to pay insurance were intended to keep the TransCare vehicles operating long enough to effectuate this reorganization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In conclusion, the recharacterization question is intensely factual, and the\n   <em>\n    Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   plausibly alleges that the Ark II \"loan\" was part of a corporate reorganization pursuant to which Ark II would exchange its worthless interest in TransCare for a more valuable interest in Transcendence. Moreover, the timing of the January Advances, which were made by a different entity and preceded the Ark II Credit Agreement by up to nearly four weeks, imply that the Ark II Credit Agreement was intended to paper over a transaction that was not a loan at the time of the January Advances. Accordingly, the motion to dismiss Count IV is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Count VI: Assumption of Control\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Count VI asserts claims against \"Patriarch\" on the theory that \"Patriarch\" dominated and controlled TransCare to such an extent that \"Patriarch\" undertook fiduciary duties to TransCare and breached those and other duties all to TransCare's disadvantage. (\u00b6\u00b6 126-30.) The\n   <em>\n    Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   does not define \"Patriarch,\" a name shared by several defendants, and the only identification of the defendants targeted by Count VI is to the Entity Defendants listed in the heading. The parties have operated under this belief and I will too.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Entity Defendants have moved to dismiss Count VI in its entirety on two separate grounds. First, the Trustee continues to violate the group pleading rules that resulted in the dismissal of portions of the original complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Motion to Dismiss\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 74-76.) Second, a claim for \"lender liability\" can only be asserted against a lender and since the only lender included in Count VI is Ark II, this claim must be dismissed as to the other Entity Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 77-78.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Trustee's\n   <em>\n    Opposition\n   </em>\n   shifted gears. He contends that each Entity Defendant owed fiduciary duties to TransCare (regardless of whether it was a lender) under the same domination and control theory and breached those duties. (\n   <em>\n    Opposition\n   </em>\n   at 31-32.) While the Entity Defendants concede \"the general proposition that fiduciary duties may be imposed on one who 'exercises control over the business and affairs of the corporation,' \" (\n   <em>\n    Reply\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31 (citation omitted)), they argue that the Trustee's\n   <em>\n    Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   \"does not allege facts sufficient to show that any of\n   the Entity Defendants assumed the requisite level of control over TransCare to find the existence of a fiduciary relationship.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Instead, the\n   <em>\n    Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   pleads only that \"control of TransCare was always with Lynn Tilton.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Claims for breach of fiduciary duty may be brought against any persons \"who exercise\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   control of the corporation during the relevant times.\"\n   <em>\n    Banco De Desarrollo Agropecuario, S.A. v.

While PPAS may have enjoyed the leverage over TransCare that comes with its status as administrative agent for secured lenders owed an amount north of $ 40 million, and Ark II may have enjoyed similar though lesser leverage, the exercise of remedies under a loan agreement to foreclose or collect the debt, without more, does not render either in control under theories of lender liability or breach of fiduciary duty.\n   <em>\n    East End Dev.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201277443\">\n    2017 WL 1277443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (\"A lender exercising its rights under the parties' loan agreements, without more, does not rise to the level of dominance necessary to impose lender liability.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Finally, the contention that either of the Transcendence entities dominated and controlled TransCare is also without merit. The\n   <em>\n    Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   alleges that Transcendence and Transcendence II were formed by Tilton as part of her plan to strip TransCare of its assets and reorganize the business around Transcendence.

While leave to amend should be freely granted, any amendment would be futile. For the reasons stated at the hearing, PPAS was not a transferee of the transfers alleged in Count XI and Count XI cannot be amended to make PPAS something it was not.
