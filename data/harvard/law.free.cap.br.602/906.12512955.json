(\"MLS\"), a law firm in which Joseph Q. Mirarchi (\"Mirarchi\") was the sole practitioner, filed a motion (\"the Motion\") (\"Doc. 581\") seeking payment of $113,400.00 that has been placed in the bankruptcy court clerk's registry (\"the Escrowed Funds\"). The Escrowed Funds constitute thirty-five percent (35%) of the settlement proceeds of a state court lawsuit (\"the C.P. Action\") that the chapter 12 debtor, Renee M. Thorpe (\"the Debtor\"), and her non-debtor husband, Dale Thorpe (collectively, \"the Thorpes\"), filed against Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company (\"Nationwide\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Presently, the Motion is before the bankruptcy court on remand from the Court of Appeals and the district court. The district court instructed this court to make a recommendation concerning the proper amount of a\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   award to MLS. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. # 695).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, I recommend that the district court enter an order determining that MLS is entitled to $25,200.00 and that the Thorpes are entitled to the $88,200.00 balance of the Escrowed Funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

So, I will limit the discussion to a brief description of my initial Memorandum and the procedural events that followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Thorpe I\n   </em>\n   , after determining that the dispute was a non-core matter,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12185881\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/563/576/#p580\">\n    563 B.R. at 594-97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , I issued proposed findings of fact, proposed conclusions of law and a recommendation that the district court deny the Motion in its entirety. I concluded that MLS lacked any right to the Escrowed Funds based on the contingency fee contract between MLS and the Thorpes. I further concluded that Mirarchi's professional misconduct precluded any recovery in\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   By Memorandum and Order entered on July 20, 2017, the district court adopted\n   this court's recommendation and denied the Motion.\n   <em>\n    Thorpe II\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On November 20, 2018, the Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's order in part, reversed it in part, and remanded the matter to the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's determination that MLS lacked a contractual right to the Escrowed Funds based on the contingency fee agreement.\n   <em>\n    Thorpe III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=755%20F.%20App%27x%20177\">\n    755 F.

The Court of Appeals reversed the district court's determination that, due to wrongful conduct, MLS was precluded from a recovery in\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   , reasoning:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [W]e hold that the doctrine of unclean hands does not bar the quantum meruit claim of Mirarchi. We acknowledge that he was placed on administrative suspension due to his own failure, although seemingly negligent, to obtain the requisite CLE credits to continue practicing law in Pennsylvania. We also acknowledge that Mirarchi's failure to disclose his administrative suspension violated the Pennsylvania Rules of Disciplinary Enforcement, see Pa. R.D.E. 217(b), and that his work on behalf of the Thorpes during his one-month administrative suspension constituted the unauthorized practice of law,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   42 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 2524 ; Pa. R.D.E. 217(j). We do not applaud the manner in which Mirarchi handled his representation of the Thorpes once he was placed on administrative suspension. Nonetheless, we do not believe his conduct shocks the conscience such that he should be completely denied recovery based on the doctrine of unclean hands.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=755%20F.%20App%27x%20177\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=755%20F.%20App%27x%20177\">\n    at 182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Court of Appeals remanded the matter \"to the Bankruptcy Court and the District Court to determine in the first instance the proper amount of Mirarchi's recovery in\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=755%20F.%20App%27x%20177\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=755%20F.%20App%27x%20177\">\n    at 183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnote omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Following the remand to the district court, by order entered December 17, 2018, the district court \"referred\" the matter to this court \"to determine the proper amount of [the]\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   award.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Doc. # 695).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

If a party asserts that further evidence is necessary and/or appropriate, the party [must] state with specificity the reasons for its position.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (Doc. # 696) (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   No party in interest filed a timely request for the opportunity to supplement the existing evidentiary record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On March 18, 2019, after determining that additional briefing \"would be of assistance to the court,\" I entered another order, this time directing that each party submit a memorandum on or before April 9, 2019. (Doc. # 706).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The March 18, 2019 order was specific in describing the issues to be addressed in the requested memoranda:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (a) the appropriate legal standards to be applied in determining a\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   award in a case in which an attorney's services have been terminated before the right to a contingent fee has vested; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (b) the proper determination of the\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   award based on the facts of this case, with citations to the record (or to the prior findings [of] fact of the district court or the proposed findings of fact of the bankruptcy court) for any facts employed in the analysis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As the March 18, 2019 Order indicated on its face, I directed the filing of additional submissions from the parties to flesh out their positions regarding the applicable legal standards and to have them point to the relevant facts in the existing record (with citations to the record) that should be considered in determining MLS's\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   entitlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Unfortunately, the March 18, 2019 Order triggered a flurry of filings from the parties that went well beyond the scope of the submissions ordered by the court - a veritable free-for-all of unsolicited, sometimes untimely, filings and responses. I address those matters below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    2. the Thorpe's Judicial Notice Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    a.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On April 9, 2019, the Thorpes filed a motion, (\"the Judicial Notice Motion\") (Doc. # 708), requesting that this court take judicial notice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's March 18, 2019 Order (\"the Supreme Court Order\"). The Supreme Court Order disbarred Mirarchi based on an accompanying Report and Recommendations of the Disciplinary Board of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. The Thorpes also attached to the Judicial Notice Motion a copy of the seventy-three (73) page report of the Disciplinary Board. (\"the Report\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Thorpes contend that Mirarchi's disbarment is relevant evidence that was not available before the expiration of the January 4, 2019 deadline set by this court for requesting the opportunity to supplement the existing record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   MLS objects to the court's consideration of this additional evidence on the ground that the Thorpes are requesting that the court take judicial notice of facts that are in dispute (without explaining why the facts of the disbarment and the findings in the Report are in dispute). (Doc. # 718).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   I will deny the Judicial Notice Motion, but for reasons other than those offered by MLS. I conclude that the Supreme Court Order and the Report provide evidence\n   that is either merely cumulative or irrelevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    b.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Report describes numerous instances of professional misconduct by Mirarchi involving,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   : (a) the handling and misappropriation of client trust fund monies and (b) the unauthorized practice of law while under administrative suspension. The Report makes no specific reference to any conduct involving Mirarchi's representation of the Thorpes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Report does reference the July 15, 2015 Pennsylvania Supreme Court order (effective on August 14, 2015) that administratively suspended Mirarchi for failing to comply with his continuing education requirements, as well as his reinstatement effective September 16, 2015. (Report \u00b6\u00b6 161-62, 185). The Report then states the Disciplinary Board's finding that between August 14, 2015 and September 15, 2015, Mirarchi \"continued to maintain an office for the practice of law and to hold himself out as eligible to practice law\" and \"falsely testified at the disciplinary hearing that while he was administratively suspended, he 'did not work on any cases.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 180, 186).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   With the possible exception of the Report's reference to the unauthorized practice of law, none of the other, numerous instances of misconduct recited in the Report relate to Mirarchi's representation of the Thorpes. It is not possible to tell from the Report whether the Thorpes' case was one of the cases the Disciplinary Board was referring to when it found that Mirarchi worked on cases while under administrative suspension in 2015. But, ultimately, that is of no consequence. The fact that Mirarchi practiced law by representing the Thorpes while under administrative suspension in 2015 is not \"news\" to this court. That fact was established during the initial hearing in this court and is no longer in dispute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thorpe I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12185881\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/563/576/#p580\">\n    563 B.R. at 586-88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 601-02 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thorpe III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=755%20F.%20App%27x%20177\">\n    755 F. App'x at 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"While suspended, Mirarchi negotiated on behalf of the Thorpes a settlement with Nationwide for $324,000\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   As for the Pennsylvania Supreme Court Order, it merely constitutes an administrative action taken by the Court in 2019, years after the events giving rise to the dispute. It is irrelevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Consideration of the additional evidence requested by the Thorpes will not affect the\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   determination. Therefore, I will deny the Judicial Notice Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    3. the Mirarchi time records and other evidentiary matter\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    a.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   On April 9, 2019, MLS also filed its submission in response to the court's March 19, 2019 Order, which it styled as \"Memorandum of Law of Movant Mirarchi Legal Services, P.C.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Serving to Supplement the Record\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   in Connection with the Third Circuit Court of Appeals Mandate and Remand of the Motion for Payment of Certain Funds Held in Escrow.\" (Doc. # 713) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   As suggested by its title, MLS attached to the memorandum various documents that contain evidentiary matter not in the present evidentiary record:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   \u2022 a \"File Activity Log\" that purports to be a record of the time Mirarchi expended and costs incurred in this matter from November 20, 2014 through December 12, 2018;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   \u2022 documents that appear to verify expenses incurred by MLS in connection with the Third Circuit Appeal;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   \u2022 an itemization of the invoices MLS received from Fox Rothschild LLP (\"Fox Rothschild\"), the law firm that\n   represented MLS during the course of\n   <em>\n    Thorpe I\n   </em>\n   , and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   \u2022 copies of Fox Rothschild's state court complaint for unpaid legal fees (\"the C.P. Action\") and MLS's answer and counterclaim to that complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In the File Activity Log, MLS asserts that Mirarchi spent 326.30 hours in connection with this matter, for a total legal fee of $97,890.00 on a lodestar basis. In addition, MLS lists expenses incurred of $505.00 for filing in the Court of Appeals, $16,916.92 in appellate printing costs and $57,669.19 in legal fees owed to Fox Rothschild.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The File Activity Log concludes by stating that the \"Grand Total Quantum Meruit Claim\" is $172,981.11, an amount that far exceeds the $113,400.00 in Escrowed Funds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    b.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Thorpes object to the court's consideration of the additional evidence. I agree that this evidence should not be considered in fixing the amount of MLS's\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   entitlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   There are two (2) threshold problems with consideration of the documents attached to MLS's memorandum: (1) the evidence is unverified and (2) their submission as an attachment to the memorandum deprives the Thorpes of the opportunity to cross examine Mirarchi on the content of the documents - in particular, the File Activity Log.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   But most importantly, and decisively, MLS' submission is untimely in light of the\n   January 4, 2019 deadline set by the court's December 20, 2018 order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   By failing to respond to the December 20, 2018 order, the parties bound themselves to the record established during the course of\n   <em>\n    Thorpe I\n   </em>\n   . The March 18, 2019 order (the second post-remand order entered by this court) did not alter the December 20, 2018 order. It merely requested and authorized the filing of memoranda on specified issues; it did not reopen the evidentiary record or authorize MLS to submit additional evidence by attaching documents to its memorandum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   If MLS wished, belatedly, to supplement the record, the only proper course would have been to file a motion to extend the January 4, 2019 deadline and for leave to supplement the evidentiary record. Had such a motion been filed, and granted, MLS could have offered its additional evidence at a hearing, subject to the Thorpes' cross-examination and potential rebuttal evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Instead, MLS simply ignored the January 4, 2019 deadline set by the court and, more than two (2) months after the deadline expired, submitted additional evidence - without offering any explanation or excuse for its delay. This was improper because evidence may not be submitted to the court by attaching material to a post-hearing brief\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and because the submission was untimely.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In these circumstances, it is appropriate to enforce the January 4, 2019 deadline set by the December 20, 2018 order and disregard the exhibits attached to MLS's memorandum.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U.S. v.

Truly,\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   was an afterthought.

Therefore, the foundation of my\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   analysis will be the lodestar approach, but that calculation will be subject to modification based on other factual and equitable considerations that may be relevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

As explained below, I recommend that the lodestar be adjusted upward based on a qualitative evaluation of the value of the services that MLS provided to the Thorpes. However, I also recommend a second, downward adjustment of the award based on other equitable considerations, specifically, Mirarchi's unprofessional conduct during the relevant time period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    LaRocca\n   </em>\n   , the Pennsylvania Supreme Court stated that among the factors\n   to be considered in determining the reasonable value of an attorney's services are the results the attorney obtained and the amount of money in question. 246 A.2d at 339.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   In this case, the Thorpes obtained a settlement of $324,729.30, a substantial sum. The question is: what was the value of MLS's services that contributed to this outcome?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Based on the facts presented here, the mechanical lodestar methodology (which would yield an award of only $6,600.00) is too narrow an approach. Rather, equity warrants the consideration of more qualitative, holistic considerations in measuring the value of MLS's services in the C.P. Action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   When the Thorpes retained MLS, their lawsuit against Nationwide was floundering. Preliminary Objections to the complaint McDuffy filed on their behalf were pending and could have resulted in the dismissal of their lawsuit. McDuffy felt he lacked the expertise to overcome this obstacle and to generally navigate the litigation to a successful conclusion. The Thorpes then retained MLS. Working under some considerable time constraints, MLS responded to the Preliminary Objections and prevented dismissal of the C.P. Action. Eventually, Mirarchi persuaded Nationwide not to press its Preliminary Objections. Instead, Nationwide filed an answer to the amended complaint that MLS filed on the Thorpes' behalf.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   When MLS took on the representation, the Thorpes were in a vulnerable position in the C.P. Action. Its neutralization of Nationwide's dispositive motion, which permitted the litigation to proceed to the discovery phase, was a significant contribution to the eventual successful outcome of the litigation and should be considered in placing a value on MLS's services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Of course, there is no objective formula for measuring value in the context presented here. That said, I suggest that the following constitutes a fair valuation method in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   At the risk of oversimplification, litigation that does not settle can be categorized as having three (3) phases: (1) pleadings; (2) discovery; and (3) trial. Throughout all three (3) phases, representation may also involve settlement negotiations which may terminate the litigation at any point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Here, MLS made a substantial contribution in only one (1) of the three (3) litigation phases,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the pleading phase. MLS's contribution was limited to this one (1) phase of the litigation. MLS did no discovery. And, as a matter of public policy, should MLS should not receive any favorable consideration based on the settlement negotiations conducted while Mirarchi was under administrative suspension and engaged in the unauthorized practice of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   While one may consider it a form of \"rough justice\" that may or may not be appropriate in other factual settings, I consider it equitable in this setting to measure the value of MLS's services as constituting one-third of what otherwise would have been the contractual measurement of the value of the legal services. In other words,\n   on the particular facts presented here, I propose that the district adopt the finding that, as an initial matter, the presumptive value of the services provided is one-third (1/3) of the contractual contingent fee,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , one-third of $113,400.00, or $37,800.00.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   There is an additional equitable consideration that must be evaluated in fashioning a\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   award that leads me to recommend a further adjustment - this time downward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   MLS (acting through Mirarchi) acted inequitably in a variety of ways during the course of its relationship with the Thorpes. Mirarchi engaged in the unauthorized practice of law in negotiating a settlement of the C.P. Action. He failed to timely notify the Thorpes of his administrative suspension, as required by Pennsylvania law. He was uncooperative in his responses to the Thorpes' request for specific details regarding the duration of the suspension. And worse, in response to their inquiries, Mirarchi provided the Thorpes with information regarding the status of his professional license that was misleading, if not an outright misrepresentation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thorpe I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12185881\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/563/576/#p580\">\n    563 B.R. at 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   I am fully cognizant that the Court of Appeals panel held that Mirarchi's professional misconduct was insufficient to preclude MLS from obtaining a\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   award. But I read the panel's decision as holding only that, as a threshold matter, Mirarchi's misconduct was insufficient to warrant a\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     complete forfeiture\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   of his equitable\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   rights. In its decision, the panel evaluated Mirarchi's misconduct under an enhanced standard -\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , whether his conduct \"shock[ed] the conscience\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   The panel's employment of such a rigorous standard is consistent with the equitable maxim that \"equity abhors a forfeiture,\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Accurso v.

In making the equitable,\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   determination itself, Mirarchi' professional misconduct is a relevant consideration. Professional misconduct, by its very nature detracts from the value of the services rendered by an attorney. Furthermore, in light of the overall equitable nature of the\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   inquiry, consideration of an attorney's professional misconduct is appropriate in the fulfilling the court's function of balancing the competing interests of the parties and attempting to achieve an overall sense of fairness and justice:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   [O]ne who seeks the aid of an equity court is subjected to the imposition of such terms as the settled principles of equity require. The court may impose any reasonable terms on plaintiff, as the price of the decree, in order to require that he or she do equity before having equity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   30A\n   <em>\n    C.J.S.\n   </em>\n   Equity \u00a7 103 (West 2019) (footnotes omitted) (citing cases).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Thus, I conclude that it is permissible, appropriate and necessary for a court of equity to consider the professional misconduct of any attorney in determining the amount of a\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   This principle was applied in\n   <em>\n    United States v. 36.06 Acres of Land\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11557901\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/70/1272/\">\n    70 F.

(August 19, 2016 Transcript at 29; Ex. D-2). This arrangement excludes from the calculation the payment from the Escrowed Funds that already has been made to Lititz Properties, LLC pursuant to a court-approved settlement. Thus, the Thorpes' recovery will be limited to whatever amount of the Escrowed Funds is left after MLS's\n    <em>\n     quantum meruit\n    </em>\n    entitlement is determined. To the extent that the Thorpes prevail, McDuffy is entitled to one-third of that amount.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    In effect, McDuffy has delegated to the Thorpes the task of litigating with MLS the competing claims to the Escrowed Funds. If the Thorpes prevail, they are obliged to pay him in accordance with the fee agreement they made with McDuffy. Furthermore, McDuffy is well aware of this litigation, having testified in this case, but has made no effort to intervene. Belatedly, McDuffy filed a memorandum of law (to be discussed again in Part II.B,\n    <em>\n     infra)\n    </em>\n    , but at no time has he contended that he is entitled to a determination that any portion of the Escrowed Funds are payable directly to him.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    MLS also attached copies of the Court of Appeals opinion and docket.

Assuming\n    <em>\n     arguendo\n    </em>\n    that these time records are accurate and that the services were appropriate and provided a benefit to Thorpes (and, further, that Mirarchi's proffered hourly rate of $300.00 is reasonable), this suggests that, based on a lodestar analysis,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Part IV.A,\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    , MLS's quantum meruit entitlement would be approximately $36,000.00.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-142\">\n    The remaining amounts claimed by MLS, an additional $136,981.11 (an almost four-fold increase in the asserted\n    <em>\n     quantum meruit\n    </em>\n    claim) are based either on time personally expended by Mirarchi in pursuing his\n    <em>\n     quantum meruit\n    </em>\n    claim\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      after his termination as counsel by the Thorpes\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    or are legal expenses incurred by MLS in retaining outside counsel (Fox Rothschild) to pursue the\n    <em>\n     quantum meruit\n    </em>\n    claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    MLS does not offer any explanation or colorable legal basis for including these additional amounts in its\n    <em>\n     quantum meruit\n    </em>\n    request. The time spent by Mirarchi after his termination by the Thorpes, by definition, falls outside of the\n    <em>\n     quantum meruit\n    </em>\n    doctrine, whose purpose is to compensate a discharged attorney for the value of the services provided prior to the termination of the attorney-client relationship.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-144\">\n    As for the amount incurred by MLS in retaining Fox Rothschild, this expense was not incurred in connection with the C.P. Action, but rather in the\n    <em>\n     de facto\n    </em>\n    , separate \"collection\" proceeding in this court in which the Thorpes and MLS made competing claims to the Escrowed Funds.
