No. 56] and the Debtors' objection [Doc. No. 59]. Also before the Court is the Debtors' related Motion for Consent to retain inheritance money to purchase a vehicle [Doc. No. 44], which was filed before the motion to modify, and the trustee's response in opposition [Doc. No. 46]. At the request of the Court, both parties have filed supplemental briefs. [Doc. Nos. 55, 57].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court has jurisdiction to determine this matter pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and 157(b)(2)(A) and (L). These are the Court's findings of fact and conclusions of law as required by Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7052, made applicable to contested matters by Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 9014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Debtors filed chapter 13 bankruptcy on November 15, 2016. The Court confirmed the Debtors' amended plan on February 14, 2017. [Doc. No. 28]. Mr. Moore's father passed away on June 24, 2018, more than 180 days after filing. [Doc. No. 50]. In January or February 2019, Mr. Moore received an inheritance of $ 14,764.83 from his father's estate, which is being administered in the Probate Court of Hamilton County, Tennessee. [Doc. Nos. 44, 50].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 21, 2019, the Debtors filed a motion to retain inheritance to purchase a vehicle, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201303\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and 363(b)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Doc. No. 44]. The trustee objected to the relief requested on the\n   basis that the Debtors were seeking to retain non-exempt funds. [Doc. No. 46]. Soon after, the trustee filed a motion to modify the Debtors' chapter 13 plan, pursuant to \u00a7 1329, to increase the dividend to be received by unsecured creditors by the amount of Mr. Moore's non-exempt inheritance. [Doc. No. 56]. The confirmed plan is a 36-month plan with 10 months remaining. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] The trustee estimates the pro rata dividend to general unsecured creditors will be $ 47. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] The parties agree that, at a minimum, the Debtors are entitled to exempt $ 9,631. In her motion to modify, the trustee states the remaining $ 5,133.83 should be included in that which the unsecured creditors would receive when applying the best interest of creditors test and that the money should be treated as disposable income. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. The joint debt and the individual debt attributable to Mr. Moore specifically exceed the amount of the non-exempt inheritance proceeds. [Doc. No. 55, at 1].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Debtors argue that the positive change in their circumstances resulting from the inheritance should not be reviewed in isolation without considering their need for a new vehicle and the attendant expenses. [Doc. No. 57, at 6]. They dispute whether the trustee is correctly applying the best interest of creditors test to their plan and challenge whether a requirement that they commit all of their disposable income is applicable to a modified plan. They argue that the need for a working vehicle should be viewed as an additional expense that must be considered in any analysis of a motion to modify. Following a hearing on the motion to retain inheritance, the parties agreed that the exempt portions of the inheritance could be distributed to the Debtors to purchase reliable transportation while the Court determines whether the inheritance is property of the estate and whether the entire amount should be charged against the Debtors' exemptions or treated as increased expenses. An agreed order was entered to that effect. [Doc. No. 50].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Legal Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The contested matters at issue concern whether the inheritance is property of the estate and whether the modification proposed by the chapter 13 trustee is confirmable. If the inheritance is not property of the estate, it would not need to be exempted under \u00a7 522. If it is property of the estate, then the Debtors' circumstances have changed, and the trustee seeks to modify the plan to provide a greater dividend to unsecured creditors. The trustee argues that the money acquired by the Debtor is like the property specified in \u00a7 541, that it is included as property of the estate under \u00a7 1306(a)(1), and that the Debtors must comply with the Bankruptcy Code requirements for the use of those funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Debtors contend that the inheritance is excluded from the estate because it would be excluded by \u00a7 541(a)(5)(A). If it is not excluded under that code section, then the additional property should be available to help the Debtors complete their plan and for expenses before automatically going to the creditors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Inheritance as Property of the Estate\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Bankruptcy Code defines property of a chapter 13 estate in \u00a7\u00a7 541 and 1306. \"[T]he interplay between these two sections ... underlies the dispute\" now before the Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    In re Tinney\n   </em>\n   , No. 07-42020-JJR13,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%202742457\">\n    2012 WL 2742457\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (Bankr.

The estate includes \"all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.\" \u00a7 541(a)(1). It also includes some property acquired after the commencement of the case, such as property a trustee recovers through avoidance action (\u00a7 541(a)(4)), proceeds, products, and rents or profit (\u00a7 541(a)(6)), and relevant to this case, an inheritance received within 180 days of the commencement of the case (\u00a7 541(a)(5)(A)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   ).

If there was a reason to include an inheritance received within 180 days after filing in a chapter 7, then extending that period of inclusion to the end of a chapter 13 case is consistent with \u00a7 1306's inclusion of property acquired after the commencement of the case for the duration of the plan. Because the Debtor acquired the inheritance \"after the commencement of the case but before the case is closed, dismissed, or converted,\" the Court finds that the inheritance is property of the estate under \u00a7 1306(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Whether the Trustee's Modified Plan Meets the Requirements for Confirmation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Having determined that the inheritance is property of the estate, the Court must consider whether the proposed modification may be confirmed. The trustee has proposed a modification to include the inheritance less any exemption as an additional distribution to creditors. The trustee's reason for the modification is sound. Property of the estate is available to the Debtors' creditors unless it is properly exempted.\n   <em>\n    In re Sizemore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%206328260\">\n    2013 WL 6328260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    1. Is \"projected disposable income\" relevant to the Court's determination of whether the trustee's plan is confirmable?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Both parties refer to disposable income in their arguments. The Debtors\n   argue that in a chapter 13 their additional expenses, in addition to exemptions, should reduce the property available to creditors. To meet the confirmation requirements at the initial confirmation of a plan, a debtor is only required to commit his or her projected disposable income to creditors for the applicable commitment period.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(B). The determination of that amount requires consideration of not only income but also reasonable expenses. Although there is controversy about whether the \"projected disposable income\" test applies to a modification, the Debtors contend that they should have the benefit of the disposable income calculation to determine what should be available for creditors before they have to apply their exemptions to remove the property from the reach of their creditors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   This argument has some equitable appeal. All parties admit that the Debtors' vehicle no longer works and that purchasing a replacement vehicle is an action that benefits the Debtors and will assist in the completion of their plan. If these Debtors were to purchase a replacement vehicle on credit, and pay for it with a postpetition income increase, the Debtors might be moving for their own modification to reduce the payments to creditors due to increased expenses. They certainly would not need to claim an exemption in the increased periodic income. The Debtors contend there should not be a different result where the same need exists but a debtor receives an improvement in his or her financial circumstances in a lump sum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Upon a review of modification cases in which new assets or lump sums come into a case, this Court has not found authority for applying the type of disposable income analysis requested by the Debtors. Other courts have consistently allowed exemptions but have not considered expenses to reduce the amount available to creditors. The Court has found no basis in the Bankruptcy Code or the case law that would require such an analysis prior to a determination of what property should be paid to creditors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The trustee argues that the Debtors must commit these additional monies to the plan under \u00a7 1325(b). In the motion to modify, the trustee proposes to consider \"monies ... as disposable income.\" [Doc. No. 56, at 2, \u00b6 6]. The Debtors, while arguing for a disposable income analysis to limit what should be paid to creditors, oppose the application of the disposable income test as a reason that the trustee's plan should be confirmed. They argue that designating the inheritance money as \"disposable income\" poses \"a legal impossibility.\" [Doc. No. 59, at 1]. Section 1325(b)(2) describes \"disposable income\" as \"current monthly income received by the debtor\" less certain exclusions and reasonable expenses. As the Debtors point out, \"current monthly income,\" defined in \u00a7 101(10A), \"captures the six whole months of income immediately before the filing of the case.\" [Doc. No. 59, at 1]. Because the inheritance was not received during that time period, the Debtors argue it falls outside the statutory definition of disposable income.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Courts within the Sixth Circuit have \"wrestled with\" the issue of whether the disposable income requirement in \u00a7 1325(b) applies to chapter 13 post-confirmation modifications.\n   <em>\n    In re Martin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%206196566\">\n    2013 WL 6196566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4.

[Doc. No. 57, at 2.]. However, as discussed above, the Court has held that the inheritance is property of this estate. The Debtors are correct that the Court should not include the inheritance in what creditors would receive in a chapter 7 case when looking to see whether the trustee's modification has met the test. The Debtor received the inheritance more than 180 days after filing, so the inheritance would not be property of the estate under a chapter 7 absent a bad faith conversion of this chapter 13 case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 348(f)(2). However, the exclusion of the inheritance does not mean the test is inapplicable.

To evaluate good faith, a court should consider such factors as \"the debtor's income, the debtor's living expenses, special circumstances (such as unusually high medical expenses), the amount of plan payment as indicative of the debtor's sincerity, and 'the statutorily-mandated policy that bankruptcy provisions be construed liberally in favor of the debtor.' \"\n   <em>\n    In re Martin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%206196566\">\n    2013 WL 6196566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Brinkley,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5889811\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/505/207/#p215\">\n    505 B.R. 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 215 (Bankr.

M.D. Fla., Sept. 22, 2010) ). The trustee's modification to require an increase in payments after allowing the Debtors to take their exemptions would support what the Sixth Circuit has describes as the hallmark of a good faith plan-\"a sincerely intended repayment of prepetition debt consistent with the debtor's resources.\"\n   <em>\n    Metro Emps. Credit Union v. Okoreeh-Baah (In re Okoreeh-Baah)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10547472,6124316\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/836/1030/\">\n    836 F.2d 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1033 (6th Cir. 1988).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Debtors have not specifically objected to the modification as being proposed in bad faith, but they have raised the issue of whether the Court should consider not only the increase in assets that reflects a change in circumstances but also whether there have been increased expenses that should be considered in any determination of a \"debtor's resources.\" Here, the Debtors propose that any consideration of the \"totality of the circumstances\" should include the Debtors' allowed property exemptions plus demonstrated need with only the remainder going to the creditors. [Doc. No. 57, at 6]. The Debtors argue that they need the inheritance. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. The Debtors also argue that the inheritance \"is so small that the proceeds are either exempt or the non-exempt balance is an equivalent type of cash collateral under \u00a7 363(a) necessary for the Debtor's rehabilitation.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. The Debtors need a working vehicle. The vehicle that they owned when the case started no longer runs. The Debtors argue that this increased expense should be considered before the Court requires\n   the Debtors to use the remaining exemption to pay a necessary expense. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7]. The trustee has no issue with using exempt funds to obtain reliable transportation. Such a use \"fits squarely into the purpose of exemptions.\" [Doc. No. 55, at 5]. Her dispute is that the Debtors may not \"keep items necessary for living\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   exempt additional other property up to the amount of the allowed statutory exemptions.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Court does not entirely agree with the trustee's contention. If these Debtors were to purchase a replacement vehicle on credit and pay for it with a postpetition salary increase, the Debtors would not have had to claim any exemptions in the additional salary or increase the dividend to creditors. The Court is concerned that the result is so different when the same need exists but a debtor receives the financial improvement via a lump sum. Therefore, under a totality of the circumstances analysis, the Court finds that the Debtors should be given a chance to show whether their liabilities and expenses have increased along with their assets or income.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   With respect to the feasibility requirement, the plan proponent must show that a debtor \"will be able to make all payments under the plan and to comply with the plan[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6). \"While the feasibility requirement is not rigorous, the plan proponent must, at a minimum, demonstrate that [d]ebtor's income exceeds expenses by an amount sufficient to make the payments proposed by the plan.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Martin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%206196566\">\n    2013 WL 6196566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). This factor is where the Debtors' argument about their need for a new car and its impact on their financial circumstances may be most relevant. The Debtors' Schedule I and J, submitted on November 15, 2016, at the time of filing, indicated that the Debtors' monthly income was $ 2,698.20 and their monthly expenses totaled $ 2,421, leaving a monthly net income of $ 277.20. [Doc. No. 1, at 38]. Those schedules are now over two years old, and the Court must consider \"the debtor's actual income and expenses at the time of the proposed modification.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Martin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%206196566\">\n    2013 WL 6196566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4. Accordingly, to determine whether to confirm the trustee's proposed modified plan, the trustee must provide evidence of the modified plan's feasibility based on the Debtors' current income and expenses. The Debtors may object and show that, in their current financial circumstances, the trustee's proposal for creditors may leave them in such a position that they will be unable to complete the plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the Debtors' Motion for Consent to retain inheritance property [Doc. No. 44] is DENIED. The Court finds that the inheritance is property of the estate. The Court will defer ruling on the trustee's motion to modify until a further evidentiary hearing can be held on whether the plan meets the requirements of good faith and feasibility. The Court will reset a hearing on the confirmation of the trustee's motion for modification for May 23, 2019, at 2:30 p.m., in Courtroom A, Historic United States Courthouse, Chattanooga, Tennessee. The Debtors shall have until May 6, 2019, to file any amendment to their objection to the trustee's plan and to file amended Schedules C, I, and J if they wish to rely on exemptions and changed income and expenses in support of their objection to confirmation. If no amendments are filed, the trustee may rely on the sworn schedules on the docket and include the inheritance of $ 14,764.83 less any exemption claimed as additional property of the estate. The trustee shall have until May 15,\n   2019, in which to respond if she wishes to file any additional response.
