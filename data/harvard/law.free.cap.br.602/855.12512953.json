For example, during the period January 2016 through May 2016, Alex Santos, an Arlon employee who held no position with AFAP or HMR as an employee, officer or director, was regularly included in communications between the [HMR Directors] and HMR management. Further, during the period January 2016 through May 2016, Alex Santos drafted and circulated HMR Board resolutions. The 2016 HMR Board Resolutions drafted by Alex Santos of Arlon included after-the-fact resolutions for actions taken weeks and/or months before by the [HMR Directors], including the replacement of HMR's former CEO, Lewis McLeod with Joe Rainert (\"Rainert\"), as HMR's new CEO in April 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 The [HMR Directors] went to the Cumberland Facility on a number of\n   occasions during the first half of 2016. Sometimes, while on-site at the Cumberland Facility and un-accompanied by Jay Pack (who was the only HMR Board member who was not an Arlon principal or employee) the [HMR Directors] would hold a board meeting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 From January 2016 through May 2016,... Jay Pack (\"Pack\") was the only HMR Board member who was not an Arlon principal or employee. During this same time period, the [HMR Directors] disregarded corporate formalities and often simply did not include Pack on calls and emails where they were making decisions for HMR. On the rare occasions when Pack was included by the [HMR Directors] in discussions involving decision-making for HMR, Pack would simply rubberstamp whatever Arlon and AFAP asked him to approve, including an after-the-fact resolution to hire Rainert as HMR's CEO.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 After Rainert learned that HMR's primary client was dropping HMR, he immediately reached out to Dutton, Brooks and Weiner [the [HMR Directors]] to give them the news, but did not bother to include Pack in the communication.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 Following this, Brooks edited and approved a communication to be sent to the primary client concerning its decision to discontinue business with HMR. The communication was to be signed and sent by Rainert. Once again, Pack was not included in the exchanges about the communication to the primary client, nor was he even in the loop about the events that had transpired with the primary client.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Plaintiffs further assert that the HMR Directors were perceived to be representatives of Arlon and AFAP, and not HMR.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 The HMR executives who reported to the Cumberland Facility understood the control (both financial and otherwise) held by Arlon and AFAP over HMR and recognized them as the ultimate decision-maker for HMR. These HMR executives answered to the [HMR Directors], in their capacity as representatives of Arlon and AFAP, and complied with their requests and instructions whether they were on-site or not.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 Employees at the Cumberland Facility would always be told by HMR executives the day before any appearance by one or more of the [HMR Directors] that \"Arlon\" was coming and that employees should look their best. Conversely, the [HMR Directors] were never announced or introduced by HMR executives to employees as the \"HMR Board members.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 Arlon and AFAP, through the [HMR Directors], controlled and set terms and conditions of employment and compensation for management employees of HMR. One such HMR management employee indicated that\n   he was happy to join the \"Arlon Team\" after negotiating his HMR executive employment terms with one of the [HMR Directors]\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiffs also allege that the Arlon Defendants maintained financial control over HMR.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 At all relevant times, and in particular during the first half of 2016, Arlon and AFAP maintained financial control over HMR. In or about March 2016, HMR needed a cash infusion in order to continue to operate. Arlon's investment committee approved a cash infusion of $7,400,000 requested by HMR, but provided less than half of that amount to HMR in March 2016. Arlon and AFAP, through the [HMR Directors], determined in their sole discretion, and in the interests of Arlon and AFAP rather than in the interests of HMR, when (and whether) to dole out any portion of the remainder of the cash infusion that had been approved, rather than providing the full amount that had been approved for HMR's use. Arlon and AFAP, through the [HMR Directors], never released the remainder of the approved cash infusion even though they knew that HMR desperately needed the remainder of the approved cash infusion in order to continue operations at the Facilities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiffs further allege that Arlon and AFAP, through the HMR Directors, interacted with HMR on a weekly, if not daily, basis, instructing HMR on operations, regulatory compliance, and communications with regulatory agents and HMR's primary client.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   In particular, the Plaintiffs allege that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022 Brooks provided instruction concerning steps to be taken by HMR related to USDA audits at certain of the Facilities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 Michael Mayberry, general counsel of Arlon and Continental Grain Company, was the regulatory contact person to whom notice was to be given in the event of a food safety event at HMR requiring notification.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \u2022 The [HMR Directors], instructed HMR's CFO to provide extensive financial information to them on a weekly or more frequent basis. The CFO's gathering and provision of such information on such a regular basis took up a significant portion of his time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \u2022 In 2016, the [HMR Directors] interviewed prospective hires to fill the position of HMR's head of sales and marketing. Upon the [HMR Directors]' final approval, their preferred candidate was hired. Once hired, the new head of sales and marketing for HMR was introduced at HMR at a breakfast hosted by Arlon.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \u2022 In 2016, Arlon and AFAP, through the [HMR Directors], selected and instructed their own legal counsel to communicate with HMR's primary client once that client indicated its\n   intent to terminate its business with HMR.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \u2022 Arlon and AFAP, through the [HMR Directors], set the terms and conditions of employment and compensation for management employees of HMR.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \u2022 Arlon and AFAP, through the [HMR Directors], replaced HMR's CEO approximately one month before commencing the mass layoff(s) or plant closing(s) at the Facilities, with Joe Rainert. Rainert had a longstanding employment relationship with Arlon prior to being handpicked and hired by the [HMR Directors] as the final CEO of HMR.... Before and after he became CEO of HMR, Rainert knew that the [HMR Directors] expected him to act in the interests of Arlon, AFAP and their parent, Continental Grain Company, rather than HMR. Rainert agreed to do so and understood that Arlon was in complete control of HMR. Rainert viewed John Dutton as his boss, by virtue of John Dutton's position with Arlon.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Finally, the Plaintiffs allege that on or before May 1, 2016, Arlon and AFAP, through the [HMR Directors], \"instructed [HMR's CEO] to conduct a mass layoff or shutdown at each of the Facilities following the [HMR Directors'] failed attempt to repair the long-damaged relationship with HMR's primary client.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), a pleading must contain a short and plain statement showing that the pleader is entitled to some relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   The pleading standard does not require detailed factual allegations; it must be more than a defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   When reviewing a motion to dismiss, the court will \"accept all factual allegations as true, construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and determine whether, under any reasonable reading of the complaint, the plaintiff may be entitled to relief.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a plaintiff must show that the grounds of his entitlement to relief amount to more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of a cause of action's elements will not do.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \"A claim has facial plausibility when the pleaded factual content allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plausibility standard is not akin to the probability standard but requires more than the sheer possibility that a defendant acted unlawfully.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   Two principals underlie the\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   standard.

Background of the WARN Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \"The WARN Act was enacted in response to significant worker dislocation that occurred throughout the 1970s and 1980s when '[a]s companies were merged, acquired, or closed, many employees lost their jobs, often without notice.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"To ensure that laid-off workers and their families receive 'some transition time to adjust to the prospective loss of employment,' the Act requires employers to give sixty days' notice to all affected employees or their representatives prior to a mass layoff or a plant closing.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Employers violating the Act are liable for back pay and benefits.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The WARN Act defines \"employer\" as \"any business enterprise that employs ... 100 or more employees.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Complaint alleges that immediately prior to the mass layoffs, HMR employed approximately 400 employees at HMR's California Facility and 187 in HMR's Rhode Island facility, and 88 in HMR's Texas\n   facility.\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Complaint properly pleads that HMR was an employer that must comply with the federal WARN Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   An employer's bankruptcy, however, can muddle a WARN Act analysis. As described by one court;\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   The typical WARN Act case arises when a company decides for cost-saving or unionization reasons to close a plant and move its operations elsewhere. In those instances, the employer is aware of the impending move well before it occurs and is in a position to either give employees the required notice, or if it chooses otherwise, to pay the sixty days of a worker's lost wages and benefits. Bankruptcy is the atypical case. In the context of an impending bankruptcy, a WARN Act notice may hasten the collapse of the business by undermining management's best efforts to salvage it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   When a plant closure results from the corporate employer's insolvency, workers may have difficulty recovering WARN Act damages from the insolvent or dissolving employer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"As a result, WARN Act plaintiffs have pursued a variety of entities related to their direct employer, including parent corporations and lenders, on the theory that the related entities actually controlled the employer and should be treated as an employer for WARN Act purposes.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, the Plaintiffs seek to impose single employer liability on the Arlon Defendants.

Rainert even told HMR's primary client in an email sent on May 1, 2016 (just weeks after Rainert had been installed as HMR's CEO by Arlon and AFAP) that John Dutton was his \"boss\" and that Rainert had worked with Dutton for many years.

At the hearing on the motion to dismiss the First Amended Complaint, I engaged Plaintiffs' counsel in the following colloquy:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   THE COURT: [T]he trustee has produced 50,000 pages of documents, if I gave you leave to amend the complaint, what else could you tell me?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   I'm trying to figure out the uniqueness of this situation, and it hasn't struck me yet.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   COUNSEL: If it would assist Your Honor in determining whether we've tipped the scales in favor of facts that are not conclusory, we could provide more detail on the emails relating to direction ... with regard to regulatory communications and communication with the client, and other issues like that.\n   <footnotemark>\n    127\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   I then granted the motion to dismiss the First Amended Complaint, with leave to amend. However, the allegations in the Second Amended Complaint continue to lack sufficient specificity to support a plausible claim for single employer liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    III. The Second Amended Complaint does not contain sufficient facts to allege a plausible claim for employer liability under the California WARN Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Following the enactment of the federal WARN Act, California's state legislature enacted the California WARN Act to supplement the federal WARN Act by providing \"stronger worker protections.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    128\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Second Amended Complaint seeks to hold the Arlon Defendants liable as \"employers\" under the California WARN Act. They allege (in pertinent part):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   At all relevant times, each Defendant was an \"employer,\" as that term is defined in ... California Labor Code \u00a7\u00a7 1400\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   and continued to operate as a business until it ordered a mass layoff, plant closing or termination at each of the Facilities, as defined under the WARN Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    129\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The California WARN Act defines \"employer\" as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   \"Employer\" means any person, ... who directly or indirectly owns and operates a covered establishment. A parent corporation is an employer as to any covered establishment directly owned and operated by its corporate subsidiary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    130\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The Plaintiffs argue that the Arlon Defendants are liable for IIMR's violations of the California WARN Act because they are HMR's parent corporations. The Arlon Defendants argue that the California WARN Act does not impose \"strict liability\" upon parent corporations due to a subsidiary's violation of the Act. I conclude that the Second Amended Complaint fails to allege sufficient facts to allow claims\n   against the Arlon Defendants under the California WARN Act for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   First, I note that the Second Amended Complaint does not allege that Arlon is a \"parent corporation\" of HMR. The term \"parent corporation\" is not defined in the California WARN Act, but it is generally recognized that \"parent company\" is a company that has a controlling ownership interest in another company.\n   <footnotemark>\n    131\n   </footnotemark>\n   There are no allegations that Arlon has any ownership interest in HMR. The Second Amended Complaint alleges that HMR's direct parent (HMR Foods, LLC) is 100% owned by its sole member and parent, AFAP.\n   <footnotemark>\n    132\n   </footnotemark>\n   This does not allege that AFAP is HMR's direct parent, but I need not decide the issue of whether control through corporate layers is sufficient to satisfy a \"parent corporation\" requirement, because the plain language of the California WARN Act does not hold parent companies strictly liable for the subsidiaries' liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   It is the Court's \"fundamental task to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the statute.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    133\n   </footnotemark>\n   A court should \"focus on the statute's actual words, the most reliable indicator of legislative intent, assigning them their usual and ordinary meanings.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    134\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The California WARN Act provides that \"[a]n employer may not order a mass layoff, relocation, or termination at a covered establishment unless, 60 days before the order takes effect, the employer gives written notice of the order ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    135\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plain language of this section, read in conjunction with the definition of \"employer,\" provides that a parent corporation may also be liable\n   <em>\n    if it orders a shut down in violation of the Act.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    136\n   </footnotemark>\n   Assuming AFAP is a parent corporation for purposes of this motion, I have already determined that the Second Amended Complaint does not adequately allege facts to show that AFAP ordered the Facilities' closings. Instead, the Complaint alleges that the HMR Directors and CEO decided to close the Facilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The Arlon Defendants' motion to dismiss the California WARN Act claims will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   As required by\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Iqbal,\n   </em>\n   I have reviewed the Second Amended Complaint, disregarded the numerous conclusory allegations, and, relying on my experience and common sense, I have considered the remaining allegations in light of the five-factor balancing test adopted by the Third Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Pearson.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    137\n   </footnotemark>\n   I have concluded that the allegations show that the Arlon Defendants, as a financier and an\n   affiliated corporation, placed their representatives on HMR's board of directors to monitor the company. The allegations further show that the HMR Directors took actions and made decisions consistent with their positions. Accordingly, I conclude that Plaintiffs have failed to allege sufficient facts from which I may draw a reasonable inference that the Arlon Defendants could be liable as a single employer under the federal WARN Act or as an employer under the California WARN Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The Arlon Defendants' motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint will be granted.
