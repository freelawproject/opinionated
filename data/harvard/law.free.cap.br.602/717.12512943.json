Nakagawa, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   On May 15, 2019, the court heard Creditor 4Front Advisors LLC's Motion to Dismiss Bankruptcy Petition or, Alternatively, Motion for Relief from the Automatic Stay to Allow Receivership and Contempt Proceedings to Continue (\"Dismissal Motion\"). The appearances of counsel were noted on the record. After arguments were presented, the matter was taken under submission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On April 16, 2019, a voluntary petition for Chapter 11 reorganization (\"Petition\") was filed by CWNevada LLC (\"Debtor\"). (ECF No. 1). Attached to the Petition is a \"Resolution Authorizing Bankruptcy\" that identifies BCP Holding 7, LLC (\"BCP Holding\") as managing member of the Debtor, and that authorizes BCP Holding to seek Chapter 11 relief for the Debtor. The Petition filed on behalf of the Debtor is signed by Brian C. Padgett (\"Padgett\") as manager of BCP Holding, and by Michael D. Mazur, as the Debtor's general counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The voluntary Petition is a \"skeleton\" petition inasmuch as it is not accompanied by a schedule of assets and liabilities (\"Schedules\"), a statement of financial affairs (SOFA\"), or any of the initial information required to obtain bankruptcy relief. Moreover, the Petition is not accompanied by a \"creditor matrix\" setting forth the names and addresses of the Debtor's creditors. The Petition is accompanied by an unsigned List of Creditors Who Have the 20 Largest Unsecured Claims and Are Not Insiders (\"20 List\"). (ECF No. 4). Only ten creditors are identified on the 20 List.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On the same day the skeleton Petition and 20 List were filed, a Notice of Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Case (\"Bankruptcy Notice\") was issued by the clerk of the court informing creditors that a meeting of creditors would be held on May 16, 2019. (ECF No. 3). Because a creditor matrix was never filed by the Debtor, it appears that the Bankruptcy Notice was served only on the creditors appearing on the 20 List. (ECF No. 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 17, 2019, an Ex Parte Application for Order Authorizing Rule 2004 Examination [\"2004 Exam\"] of Brian C. Padgett (\"2004 Exam Request\") was filed by The CIMA Group, LLC (\"CIMA Group\"). (ECF No. 8). On April 19, 2019, the clerk of the court signed an order granting the request pursuant to Local Rule 5075(a)(2)(L) because the 2004 Exam Request sought to conduct the examination more than fourteen days later and did not include a request for production of documents (\"CIMA 2004 Order\"). (ECF No. 10). On the same date, CIMA Group filed a 2004 Exam notice which included a Subpoena for Rule 2004 Examination (\"2004 Subpoena\") that required the witness to produce various documents. (ECF No. 11).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 23, 2019, 4Front Advisors LLC (\"4Front\") filed the instant Dismissal Motion seeking dismissal of the Chapter 11 case based on Section 305(a)(1),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   or, Section 1112(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the alternative, 4Front seeks relief from the automatic stay under\n   Section 362(d) to allow it to proceed with collection activities under non-bankruptcy law. Numerous documents are attached to the Dismissal Motion and marked as exhibits \"1\" through \"24.\" (ECF No. 18). In support of the Dismissal Motion, 4Front filed the declarations of Kris Krane (\"Krane Declaration\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Cory L. Braddock (\"Braddock Declaration\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF Nos. 20 and 21).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 25, 2019, a combined joinder in the Dismissal Motion was filed on behalf of Highland Partners NV LLC, MI-CW Holdings NV Fund 2 LLC, and MI-CW Holdings LLC (collectively \"Highland Partners\"), as well as by Green Pastures Fund, LLC Series 1 (CWNevada, LLC), Jakal Investments, LLC, Green Pastures Group, LLC, Jonathan S. Fenn Revocable Trust, and Growth Properties, LLC (collectively \"Green Pastures\"). (ECF No. 26). In support of that combined joinder (\"Highland Joinder\"), Highland Partners and Green Pastures filed the declarations of David J. Malley, Esq. (\"Malley Declaration\"), Christopher R. Miltenberger, Esq. (\"Miltenberger Declaration\"), and Brandon Kanitz (\"Kanitz Declaration\"). (ECF Nos. 27, 28, and 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On April 26, 2019, a joinder in the Dismissal Motion was filed on behalf of Timothy Smits Van Oyen (\"Van Oyen\"). (ECF No. 37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On May 2, 2019, a joinder in the Dismissal Motion was filed on behalf of MC Brands, LLC (\"MC Brands\"). (ECF No. 47).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On May 7, 2019, a limited joinder in the Dismissal Motion was filed on behalf of The CIMA Group (\"CIMA Joinder\"), to which is attached copies of three documents marked as exhibits \"1\" through \"3.\" (ECF No. 50).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On May 7, 2019, Debtor filed an opposition to the Dismissal Motion (\"Opposition\") to which is attached four documents marked as exhibits \"A\" through \"D.\" (ECF No. 51). The Opposition is supported by the Declaration of Brian C. Padgett (\"Padgett Declaration\"). (ECF No. 52). On the same date, Debtor filed oppositions to the Highland Joinder, as well as the joinders filed by Van Oyen and MC Brands. (ECF Nos. 54 and 55).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On May 8, 2019, Debtor filed an opposition to the CIMA Joinder (\"Additional Opposition\"). (ECF No. 56).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On May 8 and May 9, 2019, Debtor filed a request for judicial notice (\"RJN\") of numerous documents marked as exhibits \"A\" through \"O.\" (ECF Nos. 57 and 60). Exhibits \"A\" through \"J\" apparently consist of copies of the \"Register of Actions\" or list of docket entries for proceedings of public record pending in State Court, and in this bankruptcy court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Exhibits \"K\" through \"O\" consist of documents that were not, until now, of public record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On May 13, 2019, 4Front filed a reply in support of the Dismissal Motion (\"4Front Reply\"), to which is attached five documents marked as Exhibits \"A\" through \"E.\" (ECF No. 68). On the same date, Highland Partners filed a reply in support of the Highland Joinder (\"Highland Reply\"). (ECF No. 69). On the same date, CIMA Group filed a reply in support of the CIMA Joinder (\"CIMA Reply\"), to which is attached a single document marked as exhibit \"1.\" (ECF No. 71).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Debtor is in the business of cultivating, producing, and distributing medical and recreational marijuana (\"Marijuana Business\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Padgett Declaration at \u00b6\u00b6 4-5.

Debtor apparently made a payment of $ 81,850 to the Nevada Department of Taxation (\"NDOT\") on April 23, 2019.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Marijuana Tax Return dated\n   March 29, 2019, attached as Exhibit \"K\" to RJN and as Exhibit \"D\" to Opposition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Debtor's business operations apparently are authorized under Nevada law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Debtor's Marijuana Business is prohibited under federal law by provisions of the Controlled Substances Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20812\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), Schedule I(c)(10) [Marihuana] and Schedule I(c)(17) [Tetrahydrocannibinols].\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Debtor's CBD Business, however, may no longer be prohibited under federal law as a result of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, Pub.

The Act amended the term \"Marihuana\" under the Controlled Substances Act to exclude hemp \"as defined under section 1639o of Title 7.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20802\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (16)(B). The Act also amended Schedule I(c)(17) of the Controlled Substances Act to exclude from the definition of \"Tetrahydrocannabinols\" the \"\n   <em>\n    tetrahydrocannabinols in hemp (as defined under section 1639o of Title 7)\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20812\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), Schedule I(c)(17). Under 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1639o(1), the term hemp \"means the plant Cannabis sativa L. and any part of that plant, including the seeds thereof and all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, and salts of isomers, whether growing or not,\n   <em>\n    with a delta-9 tetrahydrocannibinol concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) Because products derived from hemp plants containing restricted concentrations of tetrahydrocannabinols (\"THC\"), which is the active ingredient in marijuana, are no longer in violation of the Controlled Substances Act, the Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") apparently will assume a regulatory role for such products.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Under these circumstances, the portion of the Debtor's operations devoted to the Marijuana Business appears to be in violation\n   of federal law, while the portion devoted to the CBD Business might be excluded from the Controlled Substances Act if the CBD products sold by the Debtor are derived from the type of hemp permitted under federal law. Notwithstanding its operations of these two businesses in accordance with Nevada law, Debtor apparently defaulted on payment of many of its obligations, including the claim of 4Front. Before 4Front's Receivership Application could be heard by the State Court, however, Debtor filed its voluntary Chapter 11 Petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   No one disputes that the Debtor is a limited liability company formed under Nevada law. A limited liability company is treated as a \"corporation\" under Section 101(9)(A)(iv), and therefore is a \"person\" as defined under Section 101(41).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    AE Rest.

Because the Debtor in this case resides and has a place of business in Nevada, it is eligible under Section 109(a) to file a bankruptcy petition. Additionally, under Section 101(15), a person is included in the term \"entity.\" Under Section 301(a), a voluntary bankruptcy petition commencing a case may be filed by an entity. Because the Debtor is both a person and an entity, it clearly was permitted under Section 301(a) to file its voluntary Chapter 11 Petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As a result of filing a bankruptcy petition, the automatic stay arose under Section 362(a), applicable to all entities, barring various acts and actions from being taken or continued against the Debtor or property of the bankruptcy estate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (1 through 8).

That Chapter 11 proceeding was commenced in the bankruptcy court for the Western District of Washington and encompassed five related real estate entities. One of those entities, Cook Investments NW DARR (\"Cook DARR\"), leased property to an unrelated third party licensed under Washington law to grow marijuana. That lease violated, however, the provision of the Controlled Substances Act that prohibited the knowing lease of any space \"...for the purpose of manufacturing, distributing, or using any controlled substance...\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20856\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). The U.S. Trustee filed a motion under Section 1112(b)(1) to dismiss the Chapter 11 proceeding based on gross mismanagement as defined under Section 1112(b)(4)(B). The bankruptcy court denied the motion on the debtors' representation that an amended plan would include a rejection of the lease with the marijuana grower and payments under the plan therefore would not depend on a source that violates federal law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Geiger v.

The U.S. Trustee objected to confirmation of the amended plan, but not to the motion to reject the lease. An order was entered authorizing rejection of the lease. The U.S. Trustee objected that the amended plan was not proposed in good faith under Section 1129(a)(3), but did not renew the motion to dismiss under Section 1112(b)(1) based on gross mismanagement. The bankruptcy court overruled the plan objection and confirmed the amended plan under Section 1129(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1-2. On appeal, the federal district court affirmed both the plan confirmation order and the order denying the U.S. Trustee's motion to dismiss. As to dismissal based on gross mismanagement, the district court concluded that the U.S. Trustee had waived the objection by failing to renew the prior motion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. The district court also concluded that it was not an abuse of discretion to deny dismissal because the debtors might be able to propose a Chapter 11 plan that does not rely on income from the marijuana lease.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4. The district court emphasized that the debtors' plan of reorganization provided for payment of the single creditor whose judgment would be paid in full from non-marijuana income.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On further appeal, the Ninth Circuit again affirmed. In particular, the circuit panel addressed the U.S. Trustee's objection that the debtors' Chapter 11 plan did not meet Section 1129(a)(3) because it had not \"been proposed in good faith and not by any means forbidden by law.\" The Ninth Circuit held that the good faith requirement under Section 1129(a)(3) \"...directs courts to look\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   to the proposal of a [Chapter 11] plan,\n   <em>\n    not to the terms of the plan\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520874\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/922/1031/\">\n    922 F.3d at 1035\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (Emphasis added). Because the Debtor's plan had been negotiated during the Chapter 11 proceeding in good faith, it had not been proposed by any means forbidden by bankruptcy or non-bankruptcy law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520874\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/922/1031/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520874\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/922/1031/\">\n    at 1033-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . With respect to any alleged violations of the Controlled Substances Act, the court observed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   We do not believe that the interpretation compelled by the text [of Section 1129(a)(3) ] will result in bankruptcy proceedings being used to facilitate legal violations. To begin, absent waiver, as in this case, courts may consider gross mismanagement under \u00a7 1112(b). And confirmation of a plan does not insulate debtors from prosecution for criminal activity, even if that activity is part of the plan itself...There is thus no need to \"convert the bankruptcy judge into an ombudsman without portfolio, gratuitously seeking out possible 'illegalities' in every plan,\" a result that would be \"inimical to the basic function of bankruptcy judges in bankruptcy proceedings.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520874\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/922/1031/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520874\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/922/1031/\">\n    at 1036\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   With respect to dismissal for gross management within the meaning of\n   Section 1112(b)(4)(B), the Ninth Circuit concluded that the U.S. Trustee had waived the objection by failing to renew its motion at plan confirmation. The circuit panel reached that conclusion because the motion was not presented under Section 1112(b)(1) and therefore there was no opportunity for the bankruptcy court to consider whether any claim of gross mismanagement could be cured under Section 1112(b)(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520874\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/922/1031/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520874\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/922/1031/\">\n    at 1034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   While the Ninth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Garvin\n   </em>\n   is controlling when a good faith objection to plan confirmation is raised under Section 1129(a)(3), there is no proposed Chapter 11 plan before the court at this time. Similarly, the\n   <em>\n    Garvin\n   </em>\n   decision does not address other requirements for Chapter 11 plan confirmation, such as feasibility under Section 1129(a)(11).\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   At this stage, the Debtor wants to remain under the protection of the automatic stay while it tries to formulate a plan of reorganization. The\n   <em>\n    Garvin\n   </em>\n   panel did not preclude consideration of a motion to dismiss under Section 1112(b)(1), even at plan confirmation, but did not do so only because the U.S. Trustee had waived the ground by failing to renew its prior motion. So procedurally, the\n   <em>\n    Garvin\n   </em>\n   decision offers no guidance on whether dismissal under Section 1112(b)(1) on the basis of mismanagement under Section 1112(b)(4)(B), or any other ground, would be appropriate in the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On the other hand, the more obvious factual distinction is that the Chapter 11 debtor in\n   <em>\n    Garvin\n   </em>\n   was not engaged in the cultivation, production and distribution of marijuana. Unlike the debtor in\n   <em>\n    Garvin\n   </em>\n   , this is not a case where proceeds of the Marijuana Business would provide merely \"indirect support\" for a confirmed plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, the Marijuana Business operated by the Debtor appears to be the primary source of the Debtor's revenue and appears to be in clear violation of the Controlled Substances Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Perhaps more important is that the\n   <em>\n    Garvin\n   </em>\n   decision does not address whether dismissal\n   independently based on abstention under Section 305(a) is appropriate.

The court, however, did not agree with the U.S. Trustee that dismissal was a foregone conclusion, but instead gave the debtor the option to remain in bankruptcy by ceasing his illegal business operations. Specifically, the court enjoined the debtor from continuing with his marijuana business, ordered him to destroy all marijuana plants, and scheduled a further evidentiary hearing to determine the debtor's compliance with these conditions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5911988\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/532/53/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5911988\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/532/53/\">\n    at 59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Utilizing these principles, the court found \"cause\" existed to dismiss the case under Section 1112(b) because the debtors' business violated the Controlled Substances Act. Specifically, after conducting a four-day evidentiary hearing, the court did not find credible the debtors' explanation that it would try to distance itself from selling its products to entities engaged in marijuana-related activities. The court further found that the reduction of debtors' revenue from marijuana-related sources would devastate the debtor's income stream, thereby making confirmation difficult, if not impossible. Finally, even if the court required the debtors to extricate themselves from the marijuana industry, the court concluded that the cost and effort of ensuring compliance would be inefficient, costly, and difficult to monitor:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   In any event, the Court does not believe such an order [requiring the debtor to extricate itself from marijuana-related sources of business], or the remediation it would require, would be effective in this case. The Court cannot simply order Debtors to cease all sales to customers known to be involved in marijuana cultivation, because the usefulness of Debtors' products in illegal grow operations will continue to attract marijuana horticulturalists to Debtors' business, including those growing marijuana solely for personal use. Debtors have already acquired a venerable reputation for expertise in hydroponic marijuana growing, and it is difficult to imagine how Debtors could prevent customers from continuing to patronize Debtors' stores because of this reputation. Indeed, the evidence does not show Debtors' essential business model has changed post-petition, which, of course, is the relevant time to determine whether Debtors may remain in bankruptcy. In any event, any such order would require the Court, and interested\n   parties, to monitor the Debtors' sales and customers, which would be very difficult and inefficient. Further, in light of the acrimonious nature of [the relationship between the party-in-interest moving for dismissal] with the Debtors, the Court can be reasonably certain such an order would lead to costly and time-consuming future litigation over the Debtors' compliance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   To prevent this Court from violating its oath to uphold federal law, under the specific facts of this case, the Court sees no practical alternative to dismissal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12512576\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/597/111/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12512576\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/597/111/\">\n    at 132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The common theme of these voluntary Chapter 11 cases is the bankruptcy court's consideration of whether the debtor in possession could propose a feasible plan that did not rely on income received through a violation of the Controlled Substances Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    (3)\n    <em>\n     Chapter 7 Cases\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Relief under Chapter 7 is available to both individuals and non-individuals, and may be initiated both voluntarily and involuntarily.

Inasmuch as the recent inventory provided by its independent accountant may or may not include any CBD products, it is difficult to determine the significance of the Debtor's CBD Business. Moreover, there is no evidence of whether any portion of the Debtor's CBD Business includes the type of CBD products that are excluded from the Controlled Substances Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Upon the commencement of a Chapter 11 proceeding, a debtor in possession ordinarily is required to close its existing bank accounts \"and establish new debtor in possession accounts to be used for all transactions during the pendency of the case.\" UST Guidelines at 4.4.6(b). The new accounts must be established at a depository institution meeting the requirements of Section 345(b). Those requirements are designed to ensure the safety of the funds held by a trustee or debtor in possession as a fiduciary of a bankruptcy estate. A list of approved depositories is maintained by the U.S. Trustee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UST Guidelines at 4.4.6(a)(1). Padgett attests that the Debtor is attempting to establish debtor in possession accounts with the \"very same banks that 4Front has established its relationships with.\" Padgett Declaration at \u00b6 20. While 4Front has offered no evidence to the contrary, the Debtor's factual and legal position is a false equivalency: 4Front is not a debtor in possession and is not subject to the same requirement. The names of thirty-nine approved financial institutions, including Bank of Nevada, Bank of George, First Security Bank of Nevada, and Heritage Bank of Nevada, have been provided to the voluntary Chapter 11 debtor in possession.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Approved Depository List at 1. Because Debtor has never filed any Schedules nor a SOFA that would disclose any bank accounts that existed when it filed its voluntary Chapter 11 Petition, or which were closed prior to filing the Petition, the court does not know whether the Debtor even had any bank accounts to close.\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the very least, however, Debtor should be able to identify an approved depository institution in which it has attempted to open its required debtor in possession accounts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   It has not done so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   As a non-individual, fictitious legal entity, Debtor cannot proceed without legal counsel.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. High Country Broadcasting Co. Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10517090\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/3/1244/#p1245\">\n    3 F.3d 1244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1245 (9th Cir. 1993). The voluntary Chapter 11 petition was signed by the Debtor's general counsel, and such counsel conceded at the hearing on the Dismissal Motion that the Debtor must obtain separate, disinterested, bankruptcy counsel. The record also reveals that Padgett holds the majority of the membership interests of the Debtor,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   note 53,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , and also is the manager of BCP Holding, which is the manager of the Debtor. The record further discloses that Padgett previously provided some nature of legal services to the Debtor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2015 Financial Statement\n   at Note 3: Related Party Transactions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   The record also reveals that the Debtor's general counsel also represents Padgett personally and filed the Padgett Claim in one of the actions pending in State Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n   In that claim, Padgett represents that he \"is the owner of all rights, title and interest\" to funds that previously had been garnished by CIMA Group.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Padgett Claim at \u00b6\u00b6 3-4. Moreover, he also alleges that pursuant to a previously perfected security interest, he \"has the right of possession,\n   <em>\n    and owns all rights, title and interest in all of the assets of CWNevada\n   </em>\n   , including but not limited to all personal property, accounts,\n   <em>\n    money, deposit accounts, products and the proceeds therefrom\n   </em>\n   that existed or acquired afterwards.\" (Additional emphasis added).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5. Assuming these representations are accurate, Padgett at one time, or perhaps continuously, has provided legal services to an entity whose operations have resulted in nine separate lawsuits that are pending in various stages in State Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Padgett Declaration at \u00b6\u00b6 8, 14 and 15.\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n   More important, despite apparently perfecting only a security interest in the assets of the Debtor, he has made a verified claim in State Court that he actually owns all of the assets of the Debtor. In essence, the record before this court indicates that Padgett has taken positions that may be in actual and direct conflict with the interests of the Debtor, and that he also may be subject to claims by the Debtor that would be property of the bankruptcy estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The necessity of independent counsel to advise the Debtor is amply demonstrated by the record. While the Debtor is a limited liability company that, according to the Chapter 11 Petition, is managed by BCP Holding, as the managing member of the Debtor,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Resolution Authorizing Bankruptcy attached to Petition, it apparently is managed by a board of directors consisting of Padgett, Van Oyen, and Jennifer Lazovich.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2018 Padgett Declaration at \u00b6 3. Van Oyen had a twenty percent (20%) membership interest in the Debtor as of the end of 2015,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   note 53,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , and remains a member of the Debtor at this time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Van Oyen Affidavit at \u00b6 2. In addition to the board members he identifies, Padgett attests that the Debtor had two \"shadow\" directors, who apparently represented members of the Highland Partners and Green Pastures groups that purchased various promissory notes from the Debtor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2018 Padgett Declaration at \u00b6 4. Whatever may be the validity or source of the alleged intrigue in the management of the Debtor, there is no dispute that Van Oyen joined in the Receivership Application brought in State Court by 4Front and also joins in the instant Dismissal Motion. Thus, there appears to be no consensus amongst the Debtor's management in favor of Chapter 11 relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Notwithstanding the significant issues concerning management, the record also suggests that the Debtor's financial woes have been understated by that management. No one disputes that the April 23, 2019 payment was made to NDOT in the amount of $ 81,850.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Padgett Declaration at \u00b6 13.\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   That is a significant sum. The record also suggests, however, that as of May 3, 2019, the balance owing by the Debtor was $ 405,076.91.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Van Oyen Affidavit at \u00b6 4. In other words, the tax payment made by the Debtor seven days after filing the Chapter 11 petition barely made a dent in the amount likely owed to the State of Nevada. Additionally, no one disputes that the Debtor is the subject of an eviction proceeding for \"a commercial lease which is critical to the CWNevada's operations.\" Padgett Declaration at \u00b6 15. The record also suggests that as of May 3, 2019, the Debtor was $ 117,500 in arrears as to that commercial lease of the dispensary premises located at 6540 Blue Diamond Road in Las Vegas, in addition to related obligations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Van Oyen Affidavit at \u00b6\u00b6 5 and 6. Management simply ignores or apparently is unaware that a Chapter 11 debtor in possession is required to perform its obligations under any unexpired lease of commercial real property, particularly the payment of scheduled rent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20365\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The court has considered the role of the \"unclean hands\" doctrine in a bankruptcy case involving a marijuana-related debtor and the many parties that willingly do business with such an entity. It is clear that the Marijuana Business of this Debtor is not authorized under the Controlled Substances Act. It is equally clear that 4Front is a \"national consultant in the cannabis industry,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   note 6,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , and therefore has potential legal exposure under the Controlled Substances Act.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rent-Rite\n   </em>\n   (voluntary Chapter 11 dismissed based on gross mismanagement and unclean hands of the debtor),\n   <em>\n    with Medpoint Mgmt.\n   </em>\n   (involuntary Chapter 11 dismissed based on,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , unclean hands of petitioning creditors who did business with marijuana-related alleged debtor). Likewise, Highland Partners, Green Pastures, Van Oyen, MC Brands, and CIMA Group have potential legal exposure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   note 14,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . When all sides to a pending dispute may be accused of wrongdoing, a court in equity may simply deny relief to all sides and dismiss the case.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Green v.

But bankruptcy courts, like all courts, are required to consider the circumstances of each case rather than routinely dismissing entire swaths of petitions and requests filed by parties seeking\n   legal relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n   Public confidence and the integrity of the court,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   note 44,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , require no less. Thus, the court is not convinced that the \"unclean hands\" doctrine has an appropriate role in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   There may be cases where Chapter 11 relief is appropriate for an individual or a non-individual entity directly engaged in a marijuana-related business. For the reasons discussed above, this case is not one of them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   For the same reasons, the court instead concludes that the interests of creditors and the Debtor would be better served by dismissal of the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20305\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). The parties may return to State Court where the Receivership Application, among other matters, may be fully addressed. Having reached this conclusion, it is unnecessary to address 4Font's alternative request for dismissal under Section 1112(b), as well as the request for appointment of a Chapter 11 trustee under Section 1104(a). Because dismissal of the case results in a termination of the automatic stay under Section 362(c), it also is unnecessary to address 4Front's alternative request for relief from stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the Creditor 4Front Advisors LLC's Motion to Dismiss Bankruptcy Petition or, Alternatively, Motion for Relief from the Automatic Stay to Allow Receivership and Contempt Proceedings to Continue, Docket No. 18, be, and the same hereby is,\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS FURTHER ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the above-captioned Chapter 11 proceeding is\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED\n   </strong>\n   pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20305\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS FURTHER ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that all pending hearings in connection with the above-captioned Chapter 11 proceeding are\n   <strong>\n    VACATED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    The absence of a creditor matrix is significant because bankruptcy relief depends on proper notice being given to creditors and other parties in interest.

If Padgett owns all of the Debtor's money, as he claims, those funds must have been borrowed from Padgett, or was an additional capital contribution, either of which was subject to prior court approval under Section 364(b). If Padgett has only a security interest in the Debtor's assets, then the funds likely constitute \"cash collateral\" under Section 363(a) that cannot be used without consent or prior court approval under Section 363(c)(2). If other creditors assert a security interest or lien against the same assets, then the funds also cannot be used by the Debtor except with the consent of those creditors or prior court approval. A bankruptcy trustee, of course, can thoroughly investigate these assertions by waiving the attorney-client privilege of a non-individual debtor.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    discussion at note 42,\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6136225\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/265/1/#p11\">\n      supra\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6136225\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/265/1/#p11\">\n     .\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"62\">\n   <p id=\"p-176\">\n    If there are 8,700 residents of Nevada employed by the marijuana industry,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    discussion at note 52,\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219461\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/500/160/#p165\">\n      supra\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219461\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/500/160/#p165\">\n     ,\n    </extracted-citation>\n    then the impact of automatically denying a bankruptcy fresh start to those residents and their dependents would be unconscionable.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
