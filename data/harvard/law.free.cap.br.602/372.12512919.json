At each juncture of Plaintiff requesting sanctions against Defendant, this Court pushed the matter along in order to obtain a plenary understanding of the case and Defendant's behavior.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the June 19, 2018 hearing for Plaintiff's First Motion for Sanctions [ECF 31 in case 17-23522-JKO], this Court stated that it believed \u00a7 1927 sanctions are only appropriate \"late in the day\" particularly when litigation is ongoing-that day has now arrived. Upon consideration of the pleadings, reported out-of-court practices, and observed courtroom behavior, this Court finds that Peter Wizenberg unreasonably and vexatiously multiplied these proceedings, and, therefore, sanctions against Debtor-Defendant, Peter Wizenberg, are appropriate under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201927\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant filed his Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition on November 8, 2017. [17-23522-JKO, ECF 1]. Plaintiff, Defendant's brother, filed this adversary proceeding on January 16, 2018 [ECF 1], seeking to recover or turnover of money or property; to object to or revoke a discharge, to determine the dischargeability of Plaintiff's claim; to obtain an injunction from Defendant discharging his debt due to willful and malicious actions; and to determine a claim or cause of action removed from state court pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201452\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant Peter Wizenberg is a lawyer who was admitted to The Florida Bar in 2007.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Peter Wizenberg has represented parties in 40 cases before this Court, including his own current case as a Chapter 7 debtor and this current adversary proceeding, which involves disputes between Peter Wizenberg and his brother, the Plaintiff Howard Wizenberg. Those disputes arise out of property and other disputes following the death of their mother, Ann Wizenberg. Peter Wizenberg served as original personal representative of their mother's estate, was removed from that office by the Circuit Court for Seminole County, Florida, at the insistence of Plaintiff, and was succeeded by Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Pre-Trial\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant filed a Partial Motion to Dismiss [ECF 11] on February 23, 2018, in response to Plaintiff's Amended Complaint [ECF 8]. This Court denied the Partial Motion to Dismiss on February 27, 2018, stating that the Amended Complaint was sufficient because it \"plead a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case for each claim at this early stage in the litigation\" by providing a \"short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief ... [with] factual allegations presented rais[ing] the right to relief above the speculative level.\" [ECF 12]. Defendant filed his\n   <em>\n    43-page\n   </em>\n   Answer and Affirmative Defenses on March 13, 2018 [ECF 18]. Between March 25 and March 28, 2019, initial disclosures were filed [ECF 20, 21, 22, 23], and Defendant's\n   wife, Pantanassa Wizenberg, was subpoenaed [ECF 24] and served notice [ECF 25]. Defendant then filed a\n   <em>\n    46-page\n   </em>\n   Amended Answer and Affirmative Defenses [ECF 32] on March 28, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 23, 2018, Defendant filed a\n   <em>\n    33-page\n   </em>\n   Response [ECF 35] to Plaintiff's pleadings [ECF 32, 33, 34], and a\n   <em>\n    67-page\n   </em>\n   Motion for Summary Judgment [ECF 36] on March 30, 2018. Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [ECF 36], as well as Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment on Count II of the Complaint [ECF 34], were denied later on April 24, 2018 [ECF 50], due to the existence of genuine issues of material fact that must be resolved at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On April 18, 2018, this Court held a hearing on Plaintiff's Motion to Strike All of Defendant's Affirmative Defenses, and Defendant's First and Thirteenth Affirmative Defenses were stricken without prejudice. [ECF 48]. At the April 18 hearing, the Court pointed out to Defendant that he had \"asserted two affirmative defenses of the statute of limitations\" but he failed to say what the statute of limitation is or what statute applies. [ECF 59, p. 4]. The Court also highlighted that the \"rest of what [he] assert[ed] as affirmative defenses, are not affirmative defenses, the nature of which are set forth in the rules, but are simply elaborations on denials of various aspects of [P]laintiff's case in chief. [The Court] d[id] not understand why [Defendant] would call them affirmative defenses.\" [ECF 59, pp. 4-5]. The Court proceeded to strike two affirmative defenses, as they were just denials. [ECF 59, p. 18]; see also [ECF 48]. Defendant then filed Motion for Leave to Amend First and Thirteenth Affirmative Defenses Which Were Struck without Prejudice, and Second Amended First and Thirteenth Affirmative Defenses [ECF 58]. This Court entered an Order [ECF 50] on April 24, 2018, denying Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment on Count II of the Complaint [ECF 34] and denying Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment against Plaintiff [ECF 36].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On May 20, 2018, Defendant filed a\n   <em>\n    69-page\n   </em>\n   Motion to Dismiss Count II for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction (the \"Second Motion to Dismiss\") [ECF 62]. The hearing for the Second Motion to Dismiss was set for June 19, 2018 [ECF 65]. On June 5, 2018, in the main bankruptcy case, Plaintiff responded to the Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction by filing a Motion for the Imposition of Sanctions against Defendant pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201927\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (the \"First Motion for Sanctions\") [17-23522-JKO, ECF 31]. As Plaintiff stated in its First Motion for Sanctions, \"[o]ther than to needlessly increase the costs of litigation to Plaintiff, there can be no good faith basis for the Debtor to take the position that this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to determine whether his debt to the Plaintiff is dischargeable.\" [17-23522-JKO, ECF 31, p. 3].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Then, on June 5, 2018, Defendant filed a\n   <em>\n    153-page\n   </em>\n   Motion for Reconsideration of Order and Motion to Vacate Order Denying Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Motion for Reconsideration\") [ECF 68], even though the 14-day filing deadline from the time of the entry of the Order had lapsed, making the pleading untimely pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 9023 (albeit timely under Bankruptcy Rule 9024, applying Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) ). In Defendant's Motion for Reconsideration, Defendant states that the Court erred [ECF 68, pp. 12-13] in regards to the standard applied to deny Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [ECF 36]. This Court's Order [ECF 36], however, clearly states that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment was denied \"due to the existence of genuine issues of material fact that must be resolved at trial\" [ECF\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   50], which is the correct standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p247\">\n    477 U.S. 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 247-48,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p247\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p247\">\n    91 L.Ed.2d 202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986) (\"By its very terms, this standard provides that the mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact.\"). Defendant filed a 9-page Response in Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for Imposition of Sanctions against Defendant [ECF 73] on June 13, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The first hearing on the First Motions for Sanctions, on June 19, 2018, was continued to August 29, 2018, but the Court took time to address the implications of the then-pending motion for sanctions at the June 19 hearing. The Court began by stating that it believes (1) \u00a7 1927 relief is available against pro se parties who are not members of the bar, although, here, Defendant is a member of The Florida Bar, and (2) this Court has the ability and the constitutional and statutory right to grant \u00a7 1927 sanctions. In choosing not to rule on whether \u00a7 1927 sanctions should be imposed yet, the Court reasoned that it is reluctant to do so in a matter of ongoing litigation, and that such sanctions were more appropriate to consider \"late in the day.\" In an attempt to caution the Parties, the Court expressed its hope that the pending sanctions motion would encourage better behavior from the Parties since the Court-even at that point-believed the pleadings and motions filed in the case were overwrought. At multiple times throughout the hearing, the Court acknowledged the difficulty presented with family disputes but also urged the parties to use caution and act as professionals for the remainder of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On June 11, 2018, Defendant filed a\n   <em>\n    53-page\n   </em>\n   Motion to Compel Response to First Request for Production Filed by Defendant [ECF 69], which was subsequently withdrawn the same day [ECF 70]. On June 13, 2018, Defendant filed a\n   <em>\n    25-page\n   </em>\n   Motion for Leave to Amend [ECF 71] his 153-page Motion to Reconsider [ECF 68]. On July 12, 2018, Defendant filed his\n   <em>\n    25-page\n   </em>\n   Opposition [ECF 95] to Plaintiff's Motion to Compel and Motions to Limit Plaintiff's Deposition to One Day [ECF 92].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At Defendant's deposition on August 6, 2018, Plaintiff's counsel claimed on the record that Defendant raised his voice to him. [Defendant Deposition, p. 14, ll. 1-13]. At this deposition, Defendant also claimed he did not know what a privilege log is. [Defendant Deposition, p. 22, ll. 9-24]. Moreover, in response to Plaintiff's counsel's questions, the following back-and-forth occurred, in which Defendant attempted to depose himself:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff Counsel\n   </em>\n   : And if Howard was disinherited from the will, who would have gotten everything?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Defendant\n   </em>\n   : Me.

In this Supplemental Motion, Plaintiff alleged that during Defendant's wife's deposition, Plaintiff's counsel \"questioned Defendant's wife for approximately five (5) minutes,\" whereas Defendant \"insisted on asking wholly irrelevant and leading questions of his wife on 're-direct' for approximately an hour.\" [ECF 105]. Plaintiff also alleged that \"Debtor thereafter began\n   questioning Plaintiff on a myriad of wholly irrelevant issues,\" such as childhood incidents and a 2004 domestic violence case. [ECF 105].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   On August 16, 2018, Plaintiff filed another motion for sanctions in its Motion for Order to Show Cause Why Defendant Should Not be Held in Contempt of Court or Alternatively, to Compel Defendant to Produce an Adequate Privilege Log and for Attorney's Fees [ECF 107] pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20105\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). This Court entered an Order to Show Cause [ECF 110], which directed Defendant (1) to provide Plaintiff with a privilege log that complies with the Court's Order Granting Motion to Compel [ECF 102] and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(5), and (2) to appear at the Order to Show Cause hearing on August 29, 2018. [ECF 110]. On September 20, 2018, this Court issued an Order awarding attorney's fees to Plaintiff [ECF 129] pursuant to the Court's Order to Show Cause [ECF 110] due to Defendant's \"failure to fully comply with the Order Granting Motion to compel [ECF 102] without justification.\" On September 26, 2018, Defendant appealed stating that he \"in complete good faith, was unaware (and had totally forgotten from Evidence class taken fifteen years prior) that Defendant was required to send Plaintiff a privilege log, and Defendant did not do so.\" [ECF 142, p. 2].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   On August 22, 2018, Plaintiff filed his Motion to Strike Defendant's Trial Exhibits and to Preclude Sara Howeller from Testifying at Trial and for Attorney's Fees and Sanctions [ECF 116]. The basis of ECF 116 was that Defendant emailed Plaintiff a trial exhibit register two weeks after Defendant's deposition-on August 19, 2018-listing previously undisclosed emails between Defendant and Sara Howeller as well as a MasterCard statement. [ECF 116].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   At the hearing on August 29, 2018, on the First Motion for Sanctions [17-23522-JKO, ECF 31], the Court first addressed the issue of Defendant claiming not to know about privilege logs: \"[L]et's start with the issues relating to the privilege log. I'm unhappy with you, Mr. [Peter] Wizenberg. You hold yourself out as a lawyer, and you've been in practice for many years. Not knowing what a privilege log is and what is required is shocking to me.\" [17-23522-JKO, ECF 39, p. 3]. Next, Mr. Roher, Plaintiff's attorney, requested the Court exclude two evidence documents submitted by Plaintiff because Defendant did not produce them prior to Defendant's deposition even though they were in existence when Defendant submitted his other evidence prior to the deposition; Mr. Roher claimed the documents were \"intentionally withheld and untimely produced.\" [17-23522-JKO, ECF 37, pp. 6-7]. At that First Motion for Sanctions [17-23522-JKO, ECF 31] hearing, while addressing ECF numbers 107, 110, and 116, this Court stated, \"I'm satisfied that what was done here by you, Mr. [Peter] Wizenberg, was, intentionally or not, gamesmanship, and the way to deal with discovery improprieties is to exclude all exhibits which were produced by you subsequent to the taking of your deposition.\" [ECF 154, p. 9, ll. 4-9].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   On August 22, 2018, the Court granted ECF 116 in part (Defendant was precluded from introducing into evidence or utilizing any exhibits at trial that were not produced to Plaintiff prior to Defendant's August 6, 2018 deposition) and denied in part (Sara Howeller would not be prohibited from testifying at trial). [ECF 132]. The Court also awarded attorneys fees and costs incurred by Plaintiff against the Debtor. [ECF 132]. As of September 4, 2018, Plaintiff's attorney, Mark S. Roher, filed his Affidavit of attorney's fees. The Affidavit states that he billed Plaintiff a total of $ 2,880.00 \"at the discounted rate\n   of $ 300 per hour for a total hour of 9.6 hours ... in connection with compelling Defendant to produce a privilege log and to strike Defendant's trial exhibits.\" [ECF 125]. Mr. Roher's normal hourly rate is $ 400.00. [ECF 125].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   On October 1, 2018, Defendant filed a\n   <em>\n    132-page\n   </em>\n   Motion for Leave to Appeal Order Striking Defendant/Appellant's Trial Exhibits and Awarding Fees and Sanctions [ECF 149]. District Court Judge Cecilia Altonaga denied Defendant's Motion. [ECF 153].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   On November 5, 2018, Defendant filed a\n   <em>\n    104-page\n   </em>\n   Motion for Partial Summary Judgment for Count 1 against Plaintiff [ECF 172] regarding the dischargeability of debt under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6) claimed by Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [ECF 8]. In Defendant's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, Defendant (apparently unknowingly) demonstrates why it should not have been granted by presenting an abundance of disputed facts. [ECF 172]. Plaintiff filed a Motion [ECF 175] to Extend Time to File a Response to Defendant's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, which was granted [ECF 178], but not before Defendant filed its Opposition Response [ECF 176] to Plaintiff's request to extend time. In Defendant's Opposition Response [ECF 176], he disputed the length of an appropriate \"Thanksgiving holiday\" in trying to discredit Plaintiff's request for more time; this attempt seems, to this Court, unnecessary and uncivil.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   On December 10, 2018, Defendant filed his Reply to Plaintiff's Response to Defendant's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment for Count I against Plaintiff [ECF 180]. In that filing, Defendant hurls insults and provides narration that is both lengthy and unhelpful to the litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Defendant filed his Witness Statement Sworn Declaration of Fact of Sara Howeller, Esq. [ECF 188] on January 19, 2019. Plaintiff then filed a Joint Pretrial Stipulation of Uncontested Facts [ECF 189] on January 22, 2019. Plaintiff also filed a Motion to Extend Time to File Opening Statement [ECF 191] and it was granted [ECF 195], and Plaintiff filed his Opening Statement [ECF 194] on January 24, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   On January 26, 2019, Plaintiff filed a Motion in Limine [ECF 198] as to Exhibits \"F\" and \"G\" Attached to Defendant's Opening Statement and Request for the Imposition of Sanctions for Violations of Two Court Orders. The Motion in Limine was prompted by Defendant attaching to his\n   <em>\n    326-page\n   </em>\n   Opening Statement [ECF 190] two exhibits that were not produced prior to Defendant's deposition, which, Plaintiff asserted, brazenly violated the Court's Order Setting Trial [ECF 183]. The Order Setting Trial provides, \"Pursuant to this Court's Order [ECF No. 132 ], Defendant is precluded from introducing into evidence or utilizing any exhibits at trial which were not produced prior to Defendant's August 6, 2018 deposition.\" [ECF 183, p. 2]. In response, Defendant filed a 58-page Response Opposing Plaintiff's Motion in Limine and Request for the Imposition of Sanctions, etc. [ECF 201]. This Court, on January 28, 2019, granted Plaintiff's Motion in Limine in part (by striking Exhibits \"F\" and \"G\") and denied in part as to the request for sanctions. [ECF 203].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   In the process of preparing for trial, Defendant also filed a Supplement to Witness Statement Sworn Declaration of Fact of Sara Howeller, Esq. [ECF 196] on January 26, 2019. Plaintiff objected based of relevance, speculation, inadmissible hearsay, the best evidence rule, and the presence of legal conclusions. [ECF 199]. This Court sustained Plaintiff's objection by Order [ECF 204] and struck the Supplement to the Witness Statement Sworn Declaration [ECF 196] stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   The Order Setting Filing Disclosure Requirements for Pretrial and Trial [ECF 3] provides the following information regarding sworn declarations:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    8.b.\n   </strong>\n   Each statement of fact shall be separate, shall be sequentially numbered, and shall contain only facts that are relevant and material to the contested issue before the Court, avoiding redundancies,\n   <em>\n    hearsay, and other obviously objectionable statements\n   </em>\n   . (Emphasis added).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   Sara Howeller's \"Supplement to Witness Statement Sworn Declaration of Fact\" [ECF 196] is rife with what it\n   <em>\n    must not\n   </em>\n   contain - irrelevant material, hearsay, and obviously objectionable statements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   This Court also denied Plaintiff's \"137-page Opposition Response [ECF 202]\" in its request for a trial continuance. [ECF 204].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Trial\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   On January 29, 2019-the day of trial-Plaintiff was forced to object to two witness statements filed by Defendant the night before trial: the Witness Statement &amp; Sworn Declaration of Fact of Peter Wizenberg [ECF 205], and the Witness Statement and Sworn Declaration of Fact of Defendant's wife, Pantanassa Wizenberg [ECF 206]. Defendant filed ECF 205 and ECF 206 at 10:05 p.m. and 10:11 p.m., respectively, the\n   <em>\n    night before\n   </em>\n   trial. Plaintiff's objections to the two witness statements [ECF 207, 208], were sustained. [ECF 209]. This method of filing documents just hours before trial is utterly unprofessional, and it required Plaintiff and the Court to scramble. The Court found itself obliged to adjudicate motions on the morning of trial, which is why the Court entered ECF 209 at 9:37 a.m., even though the trial was supposed to begin at 9:30 a.m. This Court sustained Plaintiff's objections, and struck Peter Wizenberg and Pantanassa Wizenberg's witness statements. [ECF 209].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   In Court, at trial, Defendant-when asked if he had his exhibit register\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   -stated that he did not have a register because his printer broke, and that he \"expect[ed] [the Court] to accept the original copy of the deposition\" and witness statements without an exhibit register. [ECF 260, p. 9, ll. 2-17]. Upon the sustained objection of Plaintiff, the transcript offered by Defendant was deemed inadmissible since the transcription's deponent, Howard Wizenberg, was present at trial and, thus, was available for cross-examination. [ECF 260, p. 10, ll. 16-18].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   This Court was forced to orally reprimand Defendant. Specifically, at trial, Defendant continuously, bizarrely, and brazenly ignored clear rulings by the Court and attempted to coach his witness, Sara Howeller, Esq., while she was on the witness stand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <em>\n    Howard Wizenberg's Witness Examination\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   At trial, during cross-examination of the Plaintiff:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   <em>\n    Defendant-Examiner\n   </em>\n   : Isn't it true that you knew that I would-I had durable\n   power of attorney over my mother while she was unconscious?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff-Witness\n   </em>\n   : It is true you told me you weren't going to pull the plug until everybody in the family agreed, and then the next day you decided to pull the plug.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   <em>\n    Defendant-Examiner\n   </em>\n   : Objection.

Based on Peter Wizenberg's actions listed above and throughout this case, this Court finds that Peter Wizenberg has acted in bad faith. Peter Wizenberg has suffocated the Court's docket with painfully long and frivolous pleadings, many of which are based in neither law nor fact, including his motion [ECF 62] claiming this Bankruptcy Court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to determine the dischargeability of a debt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(I).\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   Bad faith can also be found by his withholding documentary evidence he claimed to be relevant prior to and throughout his deposition, and eventually submitting such documents some two weeks after his Deposition. In depositions of other witnesses, Peter Wizenberg inefficiently, continuously, needlessly and rudely carried on repetitive questions triggering the same objections repeatedly; in contrast, Plaintiff's counsel expressly stated his intention not to make transcripts \"very long.\" The effort to prolong depositions began prior to the actual events; for example, Defendant told Plaintiff that he would need multiple days to depose Plaintiff, which-based on the nature of the case, the amount dispute, and the facts present-was a grossly unnecessary and unreasonable projection. Although Defendant was representing himself, he is nonetheless an attorney with a duty to act appropriately both in this Court and in ancillary proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   Whether a claim is dischargeable is wholly within this Court's jurisdiction and is routinely brought before this Court for determination. At the end of the day, this case should have taken a fraction of the time and energy spent by not only the Parties, but by this Court.

But beyond the in court, in deposition, and out of court behavior, the length and content of many filings from the Defendant were malicious, vexatious, and altogether pointless in a way that increased the workload exponentially not only for Plaintiff's Attorney Mark Roher, but for this Court. The Court takes very seriously its obligation to read and dutifully contemplate every filing, and has accordingly slogged through every single page. Unfortunately, it is clear that from the beginning that Defendant Peter Wizenberg only had one goal in mind: extend this litigation as much as possible in an effort to drain his brother's financial resources. In the process, Defendant Peter Wizenberg has debased himself as an attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   The below is merely\n   <em>\n    some selected portions\n   </em>\n   of the filings from Mr. Peter Wizenberg that this Court finds to be either vexatious, malicious, or such an irrelevant or objectively pointless statement as to multiply these proceedings in an unreasonable manner. This following list is by no means an exhaustive catalogue of misconduct, but meant only to be illustrative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ECF 36 Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment Against Plaintiff (67 pages)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   7. While the plaintiff does indeed make an allegation of \"theft\" against defendant, the plaintiff pleads no facts whatsoever in his First Amended Complaint that\n   <em>\n    support\n   </em>\n   his mere allegation of theft. None. Zip. Nada. Rien. Zero. Gornisht.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   8. Absolutely no evidence whatsoever is proffered or adduced in support of plaintiff's allegation of willful and malicious injury, or the mental states required to sustain an allegation of bothe [sic] willful and malicious injury. None. Zip. Nada. Rien. Zero. Gornisht.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   14. It is noteworthy, that plaintiff has a very long history of making false allegations. One incredible example that can be adduced with documentation is his not credible allegation of \"domestic violence\" against his octogenarian mother, Ann Wizenberg, in 2005. Plaintiff is a tall, large, and very strong man, with a history of domestic violence against others, and his octogenarian mother was short, sickly with numerous medical problems, had trouble walking, and was very frail. A copy of the docket evidencing plaintiff's incredible allegation against his mother is attached hereto as Exhibit \"B\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   19. During the period of Ann Wizenberg's hospitalization and hospice stay, plaintiff Howard Wizenberg repeatedly came to the hospital and hospice and screamed at defendant, Peter Wizenberg, that he was a \"murderer\" for following his mother's frequently expressed wishes that if she were incapacitated and the doctors' stated that there was no hope of recovery, that she be allowed to die. Her wishes were stated in writing, and also were very often verbally expressed. Plaintiff Howard Wizenberg stated that he wanted his mother to be kept alive so that she would continue to receive monies monthly because she would still be alive, and he would inherit half those monies\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   20. While plaintiff Howard Wizenberg was engaging in extreme, vehement, nearly violent, animus, enmity, and hatred directed at defendant Peter Wizenberg, defendant\n   Peter Wizenberg, could have, while Ann Wizenberg was still alive and incapacitated, lawfully gifted items of her personal property to anyone. Incredibly, plaintiff, Howard Wizenberg alleges that Peter Wizenberg, a licensed attorney, instead of lawfully gifting items during his mother's incapacity, foolishly waited for her to die, and then foolishly illegally stole items from the estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   21. During Ann Wizenberg's hospitalization and hospice stay up to her death, defendant, Peter Wizenberg slept, every night overnight by his mother's bedside, and was with her almost virtually around the clock. Defendant's wife, Pantanassa Wizenberg, had to go to the home of Ann Wizenberg, to take our dog out for walks, where she encountered plaintiff Howard Wizenberg, illegally trespassing along with sister Genia Silverberg, (who was purposefully left out of Ann Wizenberg's will. (There was extreme enmity between mother and daughter for decades. Mother turned out to be totally in the right.) ransacking the house for things to steal. Pantanassa Wizenberg also, on or about Wednesday, September 8, 2010, three days before my mother's death, encountered plaintiff Howard Wizenberg having hired a locksmith to illegally change the locks on Ann Wizenberg's house. Howard Wizenberg and Genia Silverberg were frequently in and out of the house in the weeks and days prior to their mother's death, because Howard Wizenberg had the keys, and Pantanassa Wizenberg and defendant Peter Wizenberg were at the hospital and hospice. Plaintiff Howard Wizenberg had keys to Ann Wizenberg's house, and so, Peter Wizenberg, acting within the scope of his authority as Durable Power of Attorney, and fulfilling his fiduciary duty to protect his mother's assets, from the hospice telephoned a different locksmith to change the locks on his mother's house, to prevent plaintiff Howard Wizenberg from stealing property in the future, while Pantanassa Wizenberg paid for the locksmith's services. A copy of the locksmith's receipt is attached hereto as Exhibit \"E\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   22. The aforementioned events add background to understand the horrendous human drama that has played out culminating in plaintiff's breathtakingly diabolical and false and audacious \"big lie\" technique of filing thoroughly false, malicious, frivolous suits against his brother, defendant, Peter Wizenberg, with absolutely no evidentiary basis whatsoever, just a claimed and feigned \"assumption\"! There are many more horrendous facts about plaintiff's atrocious behavior, not mentioned herein.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ECF 62 Motion to Dismiss Count II For Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction (69 pages)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   The Court finds it unnecessary to reproduce the entirety of this document here, but simply states that the entire motion is preposterous on its face.

Plaintiff's history of dishonesty and theft by frequently criminally using his mother's credit card while she was unconscious and dying as evidenced by a MasterCard statement;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-263\">\n   m. Plaintiff's extreme hostility towards Defendant evidence by Plaintiff's calling social services to investigate Defendant, falsely accusing Defendant of abusing his unconscious dying mother in the hospice;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-264\">\n   n.

The Defendant himself erred in not immediately appealing the Court's clearly erroneous Order [ECF 84].

Unfortunately, if the Court clearly errs yet again, and goes on to clearly erroneously and egregiously impose sanctions against Defendant for Defendant's good faith Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction [ECF 62] said motion being both amply grounded in both the law and in fact, Defendant will of course, timely appeal, and, unfortunately, many people will need to devote their time and energies over the appeal of a clearly erroneous Order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ECF 176 Defendant's Response in Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for Two Day Extension to File Response to Defendant's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (3 pages)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-269\">\n   2.

Defendant asserts that the granting of Plaintiff's motion would evince extreme prejudice against Defendant by the court, most especially compared to the way the court has treated the Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-278\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ECF 180 Defendant's Report to Plaintiff's Response to Defendant's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment for Count I Against Plaintiff (6 pages)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-279\">\n   12. In addition to attempting to mislead the Court into clear error, by citing an inapt case, i.e., one that is off point, Plaintiff makes risible and demonstrably false claims in his Response. We will examine his ludicrously false claims in order of their occurrence. Parenthetically, Defendant cannot emphasize enough, that despite Plaintiff having a completely meritless and frivolous suit, a pure totally evidence-free complaint -- one totally devoid of even a scintilla of evidence implicating Defendant -- Plaintiff's claims are also substantively malicious, utterly false in substance -- hence wicked -- and his entire complaint is based upon nothing but his own numerous conclusory false allegations with absolutely ZERO corroborating evidence. It is Defendant's view that it would be breathtakingly astonishing -- especially to appeals courts -- if such a meritless, flagrantly evidence-free case was erroneously won by Plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-280\">\n   13. In paragraph 5 of Plaintiff's Response, Plaintiff writes: \"In fact, the following testimony of Plaintiff cited by Defendant in the motion demonstrates that Defendant stole some of Plaintiff's own personal items...\" Plaintiff's feeble and failed attempt at reasoning is, to pull no punches, quite sad. Plaintiff's own uncorroborated false assertions at what he claims existed, and when he claims it existed, and where he claims it existed, and what he claims was his, and what he claims was not his, does not and indeed cannot \"demonstrate\" that Defendant \"stole\" anything. 14. In paragraph 6 of Plaintiff's Response, Plaintiff falsely writes \"where he [Defendant] admits that there are also items at issue that belonged to Plaintiff.\" This is not only flat out false, it is an outright lie, apparently in an attempt to deceive the Court. Defendant admitted no such thing. Plaintiff's numerous claims are riddled with lies. Plaintiff lies about what existed, when it existed, where it existed, and that Defendant \"stole\" the allegedly existing items. Plaintiff cannot cite and is unable to point to any record evidence where Defendant \"admits that there are items at issue that belonged to Plaintiff[.]\" Defendant admitted nothing to Plaintiff's lies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-281\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ECF 190 Defendants Opening Statement (326 pages)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-282\">\n   12. Plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of evidence that each and every item was located in a place that was not accessible to any other human beings on planet Earth other than the defendant!\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-283\">\n   13. Plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of evidence that each and every item was not taken by other people, e.g., burglars, Howard Wizenberg, his sons, the\n   people in Sara Howeller's law office in Seminole County where Sara Howeller swore under penalty of perjury [ECF 188] that she kept a key to the home, Pantanassa Wizenberg, etc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-284\">\n   23. Plaintiff failed to even bother to allege in his false complaint [ECF 8] that he had title to the items listed in Exhibit C of his false complaint! This is easily proven by reading his false complaint and noting his abject failure to even allege title -- Oy!\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-285\">\n   35. Defendant knows, extremely well, that plaintiff has a very, VERY long history of extreme lying, and is an ardent practitioner of the \"big lie\" technique. Plaintiff understands perfectly well that one who lies as much and as HUGELY as he does is an outlier in the normal human population, and most people have no such experience with the vastness and depth of such pathological lying. So, they naively and credulously, when confronted with plaintiff's HUGE false accusations, that so much stuff was stolen -- a long laundry list -- these credulous people figure to themselves -- because they're used to dealing with normal human behavior -- 'well, at least some of what he claims is likely true'. This is precisely how plaintiff gets away with and is rewarded for his telling big lies. The \"big lie\" strategy is to throw enough \"stuff\" against the wall and hope that some credulous people will believe some of it, so some of it \"sticks.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-286\">\n   36. Plaintiff is so shameless and brazen with his false accusations, one small example will suffice: On September 6, 2005 he accused to the police his 80-year-old mother, Anna Wizenberg, who plaintiff testified on p. 63 of the transcript of his August 7, 2018 deposition, was sick and elderly and who had trouble walking, he accused her of domestic violence! Howard Wizenberg actually filed a petition against his own octogenarian mother for domestic violence! I leave Howard Wizenberg's veracity for any and all readers of this to judge. A copy of the docket evidencing his not credible accusation against his mother is attached hereto as Exhibit F.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-287\">\n   37. Defendant takes solace in the hope that court decisions in the United States are supposed to be based solely on admissible evidence and nothing but admissible evidence, and that there are higher courts which exist to correct the clear errors of the lower courts. In this case, plaintiff has no evidence, absolutely ZERO evidence for each of the elements of his false accusations, and it is absolutely impossible for a reasonable and unbiased factfinder to find in plaintiff's favor. This is defendant's ace in the hole -- especially if appeals will happen.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-288\">\n   66.

Plaintiff's [ECF 215] falsely imputes -- with absolutely zero evidence -- bad faith conduct on the part of Defendant, but does not discuss, of course, Plaintiff's own provable bad faith conduct, frivolous and vexatious actions, in his purposefully malicious, bad faith scheme of seeking to \"railroad\" the Defendant with respect to Plaintiff's bad faith transgressions regarding the privilege log. The issues specifically concerning Plaintiff's bad faith scheme regarding the privilege log and Defendant's good faith innocent conduct, is now outside of this Bankruptcy Court's hands and is currently the subject of an appeal in U.S. District Court, case number: 18-cv-62321-MGC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-291\">\n   and, of course, will likely ultimately be resolved there, or perhaps in the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-292\">\n   APPENDIX B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-293\">\n   Defendant's Motion for Reconsideration of Order And Motion to Vacate Order Denying Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-294\">\n   [ECF 68]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-295\">\n   <strong>\n    UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY COURT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-296\">\n   <strong>\n    SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-297\">\n   <strong>\n    FORT LAUDERDALE DIVISION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-298\">\n   In re:\n   <strong>\n    Peter Allan Wizenberg\n   </strong>\n   , Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-299\">\n   <strong>\n    Howard Wizenberg\n   </strong>\n   , Plaintiff\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-300\">\n   v.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-301\">\n   <strong>\n    Peter Allan Wizenberg\n   </strong>\n   , Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-302\">\n   Case No.\n   <strong>\n    17-23522-JKO\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-303\">\n   Chapter 7\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-304\">\n   Adv.

What follows is a horribly incomplete, yet nevertheless informative set of statements and background, given here\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the legal arguments of this motion are presented later in this document, under the heading \"Legal Arguments.\" The complete, untold story, is an appalling story, and, like many intrafamilial horror stories, almost all of it is undocumented, so, the most horrifying parts are not stated here.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-312\">\n   2. Plaintiffs get the emotional and psychological advantages of constituting, creating, and coloring a narrative, 'painting a picture' in their complaints, while defendants are disadvantaged by being limited to responding with mere and bare legalistic denials and affirmative defenses, and not giving their counter-narratives. The purpose of this statement and background is to point out and document -- where documentation is possible -- that Plaintiff's false and malicious accusations against Defendant in this case, are part and parcel of his nefarious attempts to 'game the system.' What's sadly quite remarkable is how far the system unfortunately lets one go, even when one has, as in this instant case, absolutely zero, yes,\n   <em>\n    exactly zero\n   </em>\n   evidence against another. Defendant is painfully and keenly aware that the uninitiated will find Plaintiff's extreme falseness and extreme maliciousness hard to fathom. Defendant\n   only hopes that this case will be decided\n   <em>\n    purely\n   </em>\n   on the bases of the evidence -- or more accurately, Plaintiff's utter total lack of implicating evidence -- and the law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-313\">\n   3. Plaintiff and Defendant are brothers. Plaintiff is 59 years old and Defendant is 55 years old.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-314\">\n   4. Plaintiff has, for more than half a century, engaged in appalling acts of extreme hatred, and multiple crimes, including but not limited to physical violence, and multiple forms of horrific abuse towards Defendant, including his false and malicious lawsuits and Bar complaints.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-315\">\n   5. As a boy, Plaintiff was so extremely physically violent and abusive and also emotionally and psychologically violent and abusive towards Defendant, and also towards our Holocaust survivor parents, and was in such frequent trouble with the police being called to our home due to Plaintiff's innumerable acts of domestic violence, that Plaintiff had to be removed, for years, from our home and live more than 20 miles away from the family's apartment in the Bronx, in a special facility for disturbed and troubled boys in Pleasantville, NY, and then later at another facility in New York City.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-316\">\n   6. Plaintiff has a demonstrated, long history of using a form of the \"big lie technique,\" and making incredibly false and malicious accusations against others.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-317\">\n   7. Plaintiff purposefully (and, unfortunately, quite successfully with one relatively new judge in particular, and also where people don't know him and cannot even begin to fathom his audacious falseness and extreme maliciousness) employs a form of the \"big lie technique\", where he falsely maligns others with multiple, huge, big lies -- utterly false -- so that his audience will be prone to credulously infer that it is likely that at least\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   parts of his big lies are true. Plaintiff's successful strategy is throw enough false and malicious lies \"against the wall\" and hope that \"some of it will stick.\" Plaintiff has learned that he doesn't need evidence, only lots of false detailed accusations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-318\">\n   8. An example of one of Plaintiff's false accusations, where there is a document that I can refer to, is his making a false and malicious accusation to the police, that our then octogenarian sickly, mother, a Holocaust survivor, a woman who at that time had many, many serious medical problems, and who had difficulty walking, was guilty of domestic violence against him. Plaintiff is approximately 6'2\" tall and weighs approximately 200 lbs. Our sickly, late octogenarian mother was 5'4\" tall. One shudders at the sort of mind, the sort of character, of a grown man making such an accusation against his own frail, elderly mother to the police! A copy of the online docket evidencing Plaintiff's not-credible (to say the least) accusation of domestic violence against our late mother is attached hereto as Exhibit \"A\".\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-319\">\n   9. Plaintiff also, incredibly, made numerous not-credible accusations against his ex-wife over the years, including for domestic violence. Plaintiff has a well known, (among those who've known him) history of violence and intimidation, and his ex-wife is much slighter and smaller than he is. A copy of the online docket evidencing Plaintiff's accusation\n   of domestic violence against his ex-wife is attached hereto as Exhibit \"B\".\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-320\">\n   10. Parenthetically, to illustrate with documentation Plaintiff's character and what a good, responsible citizen Plaintiff is, Plaintiff has a recent arrest record for driving without a valid driver's license. A copy of the online docket evidencing Plaintiff's arrest is attached hereto as Exhibit \"C\".\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-321\">\n   11. Plaintiff succeeded in making numerous false and extremely malicious accusations against his ex-wife, who had to rescue her young sons and flee him, in the Massachusetts Family Courts and thereupon successfully hoodwinked said Courts, and ultimately won physical custody of his two sons. Unfortunately, Defendant possesses no documents regarding this.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-322\">\n   12. Plaintiff has learned his lessons very well, that he can be amply rewarded, with little risk of downside, as he is almost always Judgment-proof or near Judgment-proof, by making utterly false, meritless, malicious accusations in the courts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-323\">\n   13. Plaintiff is savvy, and is keenly aware of, and purposefully attempts to 'build a [false] record' for his false and malicious accusations against others. In an email to Defendant, Plaintiff speaks of his ex-wife as \"trying to build a record\" in trying to make a case against Plaintiff. This email is evidence of Plaintiff's awareness of Plaintiff's own need to \"build a record\" when making his false accusations and explains\n   <em>\n    exactly\n   </em>\n   why Plaintiff schemed to go to the local police station and file a false and malicious police report against Defendant; to wit, to buttress his evidence-free and false and malicious case against Defendant with the credulous who cannot fathom the depths of how incredibly false and malicious a human being Plaintiff can be. A copy of Plaintiff's email to Defendant is attached hereto as Exhibit \"D\".\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-324\">\n   14. It is noteworthy that if one reads the police report, Plaintiff provides absolutely zero evidence to the police that implicates Defendant. The police report stated that Plaintiff accused Defendant, and, in the words of the report, that Plaintiff \"is sure the residence was not burglarized and Peter Wizenberg has the missing items.\" Note that this is purely an allegation, and is\n   <em>\n    not,\n   </em>\n   in any way, shape, or form,\n   <em>\n    evidence\n   </em>\n   . A copy of Plaintiff's false and malicious police report, in his attempt to build a false record, is attached hereto as Exhibit \"E\".\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-325\">\n   15. The police\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   even contacted Defendant regarding Plaintiff's false and malicious police report,\n   <em>\n    not even once\n   </em>\n   , despite having Defendant's address and telephone number. There is no record of, indeed there can be no record of, the police never following up on Plaintiff's false report of theft, indicating that the police did not find Plaintiff's false report credible or actionable in any way whatsoever.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-326\">\n   16. Plaintiff forged our late mother's signature and stole 150 shares of Disney stock, (now after a stock split those shares would be 300). Defendant, contemporaneous with the theft, was in communication with attorney Sara Howeller regarding\n   Plaintiff's theft of the Disney shares. Because Plaintiff is very likely judgment-proof, Defendant has chosen not to hire an attorney in Seminole County to pursue this against Plaintiff. A copy of emails of Defendant and attorney Sara Howeller communicating regarding Plaintiff's theft is attached hereto as Exhibit \"F.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-327\">\n   17. Plaintiff stole, from the estate, my late mother's dog, a white poodle/Maltese mix. It was my mother's express wish, expressed verbally to me, that I get her dog as she stated that Plaintiff is irresponsible regarding animals and was cruel to them as a youth. Indeed, Plaintiff, when he was approximately 22 years old, killed Defendant's pets, a cockatiel named \"Aristotle\" and two gerbils, \"Murray and Isaac.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-328\">\n   18. At trial in Seminole County, Florida, the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   evidence that Plaintiff could offer in his testimony that Defendant was linked to or guilty of the alleged disappearance of allegedly existing items that he allegedly had title to and that were allegedly located in our late mother's home was, in his own exact words, an \"assumption\", on page 8, line 1 of the official court transcript of his testimony. A copy of the transcript is attached hereto as Exhibit \"G.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-329\">\n   19. A blatant and brazen and thoroughly documented example of Plaintiff's utter lack of good faith and utter lack of any goodwill, and 'unclean hands' is the following: Our late mother's estate directed that her paid off house be sold and that the proceeds from the sale be divided evenly between Plaintiff and Defendant. However, after her death, Plaintiff moved himself in to the home to live there rent free. Moreover, Plaintiff purposefully vetoed and purposefully sabotaged a prospective sale of the home, by refusing to co-sign a contract, for $ 150,000.00, a very excellent price for that home at that time, with a ready, willing, and qualified buyer who signed a contract. Plaintiff refused a settlement where he would pay a fair market price for his half of the house. Ultimately, Defendant was forced to sue Plaintiff for Partition in Seminole County, Florida, Case Number: 2012-CA-5131-16-G incurring substantial attorney's fees, as Defendant lives in Broward County and the home was located approximately 250 miles away in Seminole County, and the house had to be sold at the Courthouse at auction, bringing in a lower price of $ 141,000.00, a price lower than the price a qualified buyer had offered. This waste of the estate's assets was caused by Plaintiff maliciously moving in to the home and maliciously preventing its sale. A copy of the Judgment that Defendant obtained in his suit against Plaintiff for Partition to force the sale of the home at auction, is attached hereto as Exhibit \"H\". A copy of an email referencing the $ 150,000 sale price to a prospective, qualified buyer is attached hereto as Exhibit \"I.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-330\">\n   20. As further evidence of Plaintiff's maliciousness, and utter lack of goodwill and utter lack of clean hands, the woman who was the successful bidder of the courthouse auction of our late mother's home, Linda Chadwick, was forced, by Plaintiff's maliciousness in his refusal\n   to move out and vacate the premises, to hire an attorney to go to court to have him forcibly evicted after she had won possession of the home. The documents evidencing this are attached hereto as Exhibit \"J\".\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-331\">\n   21. Defendant, whom his late mother called, \"the good son\", had initially, on or around the time of my mother's dying days, and shortly after her death, tried in good faith and in vain to come to an agreement whereby Plaintiff would purchase Defendant's share\n   <em>\n    at a below market price\n   </em>\n   , but Plaintiff refused. When dealing with Plaintiff, 'no good deed ever goes unpunished.' A copy of emails in which I entertain an offer to sell my share of the house to Plaintiff, which exhibits my good faith is attached hereto as Exhibit \"K.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-332\">\n   22. Plaintiff, and our half-sister, have a history of filing malicious and false complaints against Defendant with the Florida Bar, despite there having been no record anywhere of an attorney/client relationship between Plaintiff and Defendant nor any attorney/client relationship between half-sister and Defendant. Thus far, their prior Bar complaints have been found to have been meritless by the Florida Bar. However, a relatively new and recent complaint of Plaintiff's against Defendant is currently pending and is in abeyance with the Florida Bar, pending the outcome of Plaintiff's false and malicious lawsuits against Defendant, including this instant case. A copy of the Florida Bar's Dismissal of their earlier false and malicious complaints against me is attached hereto as Exhibit \"L.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-333\">\n   23. Defendant strongly believes, but has no documents as evidence, that Plaintiff is likely financing his lawsuit with monies from our wealthy half-sister. She was bitterly estranged from my mother for more than three decades, as my mother loudly, and extremely often, proclaimed that she was a \"thief.\" During my mother's last days of dying in a hospice, our half-sister and Plaintiff, without permission, illegally stayed and slept in our mother's home for many days, and were busily ransacking my mother's home stealing anything of our mother's belongings that they fancied they could get away with stealing. Defendant's wife eyewitnessed this first hand. Indeed, the half-sister stole Defendant's wife's perfume, and when physically confronted, sheepishly took it out of her purse and gave it back to Defendant's wife. Half-sister thought that the perfume belonged to our dying mother, that's why she swiped it -- along with many, many other things!\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-334\">\n   24. Defendant, while living in the hospice in the room with his dying mother, was forced to telephone a locksmith to change the locks on our mother's home in an emergency situation, because Plaintiff was,\n   <em>\n    illegally\n   </em>\n   , caught by Defendant's wife, red-handed, in the\n   <em>\n    criminal\n   </em>\n   act of having a locksmith\n   <em>\n    illegally\n   </em>\n   change the locks on our mother's home. The Police had to be called, but no arrest was made. A copy of the receipt for the locksmith who Defendant's wife, at Defendant's telephonic instruction, was forced\n   to hire, as part of his duty as his mother's Power of Attorney, to protect my mother's property from Plaintiff's and half-sister's thievery, is attached hereto as Exhibit \"M.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-335\">\n   25. It should be clear from all of the foregoing, that Plaintiff utterly lacks any good faith, lacks any goodwill, and lacks clean hands. Indeed, his hands are \"criminally filthy\" to a maximal degree.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-336\">\n   26. And now that Defendant has presented his counter-narrative, we proceed to the all-important, purely legal arguments as to why Defendant's Motion that the Court's Order Denying Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment should be Reconsidered be GRANTED, why the Order denying Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment should be VACATED, and exactly why Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment should be GRANTED by this Honorable Court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-337\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      LEGAL ARGUMENTS FOR MOTION\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-338\">\n   27. On Wednesday morning, April 18, 2018 among the hearings held in this case on that day, one of them was a very brief hearing by this Honorable Court on Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [ECF 36].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-339\">\n   28. Defendant argued for his motion for Summary Judgment against Plaintiff on Count I, and correctly and accurately pointed out that Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint had cited absolutely zero evidence\n   <em>\n    in support\n   </em>\n   of the allegations of wrongdoing in Count I. In short, though Plaintiff's Count I indeed has allegations, in an attempt to falsely fashion a Count for the nondischargeability of a debt due to its allegedly being willful and malicious, a debt to alleged thefts allegedly committed by Defendant against Plaintiff. What is of the utmost\n   <em>\n    legal\n   </em>\n   importance is that Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint and its Exhibits, and subsequent discovery responses have absolutely\n   <em>\n    zero\n   </em>\n   evidentiary support for the allegation of theft implicating Defendant.\n   <em>\n    Absolutely zero!\n   </em>\n   That Count I is\n   <em>\n    evidence-free\n   </em>\n   in its false attempt to implicate Defendant is the essence of why Count I should be dismissed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-340\">\n   29. Plaintiff's Count I consists of purely evidence-free assertions of wrongdoing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-341\">\n   30. It is precisely because Plaintiff's Count I is a purely\n   <em>\n    evidence-free\n   </em>\n   Count,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   that this Honorable Court mistakenly employed the wrong legal standard, that this Honorable Court erred by issuing an Order denying Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment. [ECF 50].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-342\">\n   31. At the hearing on Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment on April 18, 2018, during oral argument, the Defendant stated, \"With respect to the allegation of theft, the reason I moved for summary judgment of that is the plaintiff has so far provided zero evidence in support of the allegations. The plaintiff made an allegation. The plaintiff showed that the plaintiff went to the police and made a false police report, or made a police report. The plaintiff has cited zero, absolutely zero evidence in support of the allegation of theft.\" Page 20, lines 23 -25, and page 21, lines 1-6, Transcript of Hearing. A copy of\n   the official transcript of the hearing on April 18, 2018 is attached hereto as Exhibit \"N\".\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-343\">\n   32. At the hearing, this Honorable Court orally stated, in immediate response to Defendant's statement above, \"By and large, Mr. Wizenberg, evidence is something that is adduced at trial. The question is whether the complaint states a claim upon which relief can be granted. I find it does. I will deny both motions for summary judgment.\" Page 21, lines 7 -11, Transcript of Hearing, attached hereto as Exhibit \"N\".\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-344\">\n   33. Quite unfortunately for Defendant, this Honorable Court erred in stating that \"[t]he question is whether the complaint states a claim upon which relief can be granted.\" Defendant was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   in his motion seeking to dismiss the count, nor was Defendant invoking\n   <em>\n    F. R. Civ.
