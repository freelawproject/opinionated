A leveraged buyout of Hastings closed on July 15, 2014 (the \"Buyout Date\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hendrix Acquisition Corp. (\"Hendrix\"), a special purpose entity owned and controlled by Weinshanker, purchased all of the outstanding shares of Hastings for $21,406,824.80, or $3.00 per share.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   The acquisition was funded largely by a $15 million second-lien loan from Pathlight Capital (\"Pathlight\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Weinshanker also personally contributed just over $7 million to the transaction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the time of the buyout, Hastings had a first-lien revolving credit facility with Bank of America, N.A. (\"BofA\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Subsequent to the buyout, Hendrix was merged into DAC, a Delaware limited liability company that was owned 71.1% by Weinshanker and 29.9% by National Entertainment Collectibles Association (\"NECA\") (which was wholly owned by Weinshanker).\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   NECA subsequently transferred its ownership interest of DAC to Weinshanker, making Weinshanker the sole owner of DAC's membership interests.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Post-Buyout Transactions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After the Buyout Date, Weinshanker negotiated and closed several acquisitions under the ownership of DAC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Amended Complaint alleges that, despite misgivings by senior management, including Van Ongevalle, and Board members, including Van Ongevalle and Shrader, none of the Board members actively sought to prevent Weinshanker from engaging in such transactions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Amended Complaint also alleges that Weinshanker neither consulted with, called a meeting of, nor sought approval from the Board for actions taken on behalf of Hastings: specifically, the Board played no formal or informal roles in reviewing, contemplating, advising on or approving any of the material transactions or transfers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    i.

The Stock Purchase Agreement between SI and Sports Images provided that Sports Images' shares would be purchased for fifty percent of the sum of: (a) the amount of cash collected from sale of inventory and collection of accounts receivables as of the closing date, less amounts necessary to satisfy indebtedness of Sports Images; and (b) the net profits generated by Sports Images for a three-year period following the closing date from its existing vendor base.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, Weinshanker agreed to pay off, over time, Sports Images' $750,000 bank loan with Eastern Bank.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   To facilitate this transaction, SPI, a subsidiary of SI owned by Weinshanker,\n   purchased the assets of Sports Images.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hastings had no direct economic interest in the SPI acquisition; however, Weinshanker stated that the \"transaction was purely to the benefit of Hastings.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   Weinshanker stated that having a distributor under the DAC umbrella with Hastings allowed Hastings to leverage better terms with vendors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Almost immediately after the SPI acquisition closed, Weinshanker caused Hastings to purchase the assets from SPI for $3,000,000 in cash, although the SPI inventory was never actually handed over [or given physical possession of] to Hastings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, Weinshanker caused Hastings to enter into a consignment agreement with SPI, whereby Hastings would consign inventory to SPI for sale and receive, in return, 85% of the sale proceeds, with 15% retained by SPI as commission.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   This agreement was never memorialized in writing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   SPI and Hastings also entered into a Shared Services Agreement, in which Hastings agreed to perform the administrative functions of SPI for $5,000 per month.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Further, Weinshanker, acting through NECA, caused Hastings to transfer $1,621,500 to NECA on April 16, 2015, as a purchase of inventory; however, there is no evidence that any inventory was ever actually transferred, but was instead intended to satisfy a debt in the same amount that SPI owed to NECA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   On May 19, 2015, DAC acquired SPI, and SI dissolved.\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Amended Complaint alleges that Hastings' dealings with SPI caused, at minimum, $7.6 million in damages to Hastings and reduction in availability of the BofA revolver to $13 million.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    ii. MovieStop\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   MovieStop was a retailer of new and used movies and related merchandise.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   MovieStop was founded in 2004 as a division of GameStop, Inc. (\"GameStop\"), and spun off to private owners in 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following its spin-off from GameStop, MovieStop experienced financial distress and was at risk of having its line of credit cancelled.\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, the market for DVDs was on the decline, as video-on-demand services became more readily available.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   Despite pessimistic projections, Weinshanker aggressively pursued the acquisition of MovieStop.\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On October 31, 2014, MovieStop Acquisition, LLC, a special purpose vehicle created by Weinshanker, entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement with Jeffrey Wilson and Russell Howard, to purchase the membership interests of MovieStop.\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   The sole consideration for MovieStop's common membership interests was MovieStop Acquisition, LLC's assumption\n   of MovieStop's liabilities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   As part of the transaction, the preferred membership interests in MovieStop, held by GameStop, Inc., were redeemed for $627,000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Amended Complaint alleges that the purchase of GameStop's preferred equity interest was funded through Hastings' BofA revolver.\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   On or about July 22, 2015, the membership interests of MovieStop held by MovieStop Acquisition, LLC were transferred to DAC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Weinshanker testified that there was a three-part business rationale to support the acquisition of MovieStop. First, Weinshanker and the Hastings management believed that the acquisition could add \"trend\" to MovieStop's offerings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, combining MovieStop and Hastings would provide leverage with vendors, and better pricing to benefit Hastings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n   Third, the MovieStop retail format would allow Hastings to experiment with smaller facilities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    iii.

Pathlight Loan Payment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In connection with the leveraged buyout of Hastings, Pathlight made a second-lien term loan of $15 million (\"Pathlight Loan\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Pathlight Loan permitted, but did not require, a prepayment of up to $5,000,000 of the principal balance without penalty.

Choice of Law\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Before the Court can evaluate the merits of the claims based on state law, I must first decide which state law governs the claims. The allegations in the Amended Complaint involve Debtors organized or incorporated in Texas, Delaware, Massachusetts and Nevada, and actions relating to stores across the country.\n   <footnotemark>\n    89\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, Hastings, on whose behalf the Trustee is bringing the claims, is incorporated in Texas. Further, while Texas acknowledges the breach of fiduciary duty of obedience, Delaware does not. \"If the laws\n   differ, the next step in deciding choice of law is which state has the 'most significant relationship,' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    90\n   </footnotemark>\n   The most significant test relies on the Restatement (Second) of Conflicts, which sets forth factors to examine a conflict of laws situation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    91\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The first level involves a general test, weighing public policy issues of the jurisdiction. Restatement (Second) of Conflicts \u00a7 6 lists factors that the court should consider including: (1) the needs of the interstate and international systems, (2) the relevant policies of the forum, (3) the relevant policies of other interested states and the relative interests of those states in the determination of the particular issue, (4) the protection of justified expectations, (5) the basic policies underlying the particular field of law, (6) certainty, predictability, and uniformity of results, and (7) ease in the determination and application of the law to be applied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    92\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The second level of analysis concerns the specific area of law, in this case torts. Restatement (Second) of Conflicts \u00a7 145 provides specific factors to aid in the tort analysis. These factors include, \"(a) the place where the injury occurred; (b) the place where the conduct causing the injury occurred; (c) the domicile, residence, nationality, place of incorporation and of business of the parties; and (d) the place where the relationship, if any, between the parties was entered.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    93\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"The Restatement generally encourages courts to rely less on the Section 6 general principles than on the application of the factors found in the sections addressed to specific types of claims.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    94\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Given that this set of fiduciary duty claims rest on fiduciary duties not recognized in Delaware, conduct taking place in Texas, and a Texas corporation, \u00a7 145 dictates that the place with most significant relationship is Texas. While the stores are located throughout the country, the conduct and place of business both lie in Texas. That, coupled with Texas' recognition of the duty of obedience, makes Texas the appropriate jurisdiction and choice of law for the first set of fiduciary duty allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    ii.

Count I: Weinshanker Breach of Fiduciary Duty to Hastings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Amended Complaint adequately and plausibly alleges that Hastings has a cause of action against Weinshanker for breach of fiduciary duty. The Amended Complaint alleges several key transactions that were not in the best interests of the corporation, as the transactions benefitted\n   only Weinshanker or one of his directly or indirectly owned entities. The specific allegations include multiple breaches of this duty, and injury to Hastings due to immediate monetary losses and monetary loss based on lack of liquidity that would hinder the company in the future. Further, the Amended Complaint alleges facts showing that Weinshanker repeatedly benefitted personally and engaged in self-dealing through the use of Hastings. The Amended Complaint adequately alleges a disregard for the fiduciary duties owed to the corporation by Weinshanker. The specific breach of fiduciary duty allegations against Weinshanker include:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   (a) directing Hastings to fund the acquisition of MovieStop, despite no prospect of repayment, and no debt/equity interest in MovieStop, ensuring that Weinshanker would profit directly from any profits;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   (b) directing Hastings to purchase at least $3,000,000 of inventory from SPI, with no intention of delivery to Hastings;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   (c) directing Hastings to enter into a consignment relationship with SPI, whereby SPI would sell inventory for Hastings on consignment, but never intended to pay Hastings the amounts to which it was entitled;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   (d) directing Hastings to handle SPI and MovieStop's administrative activities without compensation;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   (e) directing Hastings to transfer $1,621,500 to NECA, despite no corresponding obligation to NECA;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   (f) directing Hastings to fund $1.375 million in production costs and inventory related to the Elvis Exhibition, with no documentation of repayment;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   (g) directing the non-essential Pathlight Paydown, which depleted assets of Hastings;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   (h) failing to present the transactions to the Board for consideration and a required majority vote of disinterested directors pursuant to TBOC \u00a7 21.418 ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   (i) failing to hold a single board meeting;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   (j) failing to consult with board members on acquisitions, liquidity and the BofA revolver;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   (k) failing to acknowledge the constitution of the Board, and duties and obligations of the Board.\n   <footnotemark>\n    114\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Count I meets the standard dictated by\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Iqbal.\n   </em>\n   The pleading sets forth the elements of the fiduciary duty standards, and states factual allegations, not mere conclusory statements. While the standards do not require detailed factual allegations, the Trustee sufficiently presents facts that support facial plausibility of the claims. Further, the Amended Complaint adequately alleges a breach of TBOC \u00a7 21.418. Weinshanker was an interested director and the facts adequately allege that he failed to disclose material facts related to the transactions to the other board members. Finally, the Court assumes the veracity of the allegations and determines that the allegations plausibly give rise to entitlement of relief. The Amended Complaint sufficiently lays the foundation for each breach of fiduciary duty claim, and each claim amounts to more than mere recitals of the elements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <em>\n    II. Count II: Non-Weinshanker Defendants\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   While the Trustee adequately states a claim for breach of fiduciary duty against Weinshanker, it fails to state a claim for breach of fiduciary duty against\n   the non-Weinshanker Defendants on behalf of Hastings. The critical inquiry here involves the third prong of the breach of fiduciary duty; injury to the plaintiff or benefit to the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    115\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Trustee has not shown any injury to Hastings for any conduct by, or, any benefit to, the non-Weinshanker Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Damages are a crucial element to breach of fiduciary duty, as minority shareholders are often subject to abuse by the hands of majority shareholders, especially in closely held corporations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    116\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, there are no minority shareholders to protect, as Weinshanker alone controlled Hastings. Further, the Trustee does not allege that the non-Weinshanker Defendants benefitted from any of the alleged wrongdoings. The Amended Complaint alleges only one conclusory allegation that there was a benefit from inaction: \"In the case of Herschopf and Shrader, failing to take any action to prevent the foregoing transfers and transactions from occurring, which would have resulted in their respective law firms potentially losing out on legal fee revenues.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    117\n   </footnotemark>\n   This conclusory allegation attempts to show that Herschopf and Shrader might have attempted to avoid a loss, but it does not lead to a reasonable inference that either party was rewarded for inaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Further, the Trustee has failed to state a claim for breach of duty of care by the non-Weinshanker Defendants. Under Texas law, a director must demonstrate the same care as \"an ordinarily prudent man would use under similar circumstances.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    118\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court went on to define \"similar circumstances,\" quoting from a treatise on corporations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   What may be regarded as negligence in one instance, or under certain circumstances, would not be regarded as negligence under other circumstances; the proper performance of their duties is a question of fact and must be determined in each case in view of all the circumstances. In considering such circumstances, regard may be had to the character of the corporation, the condition of its business, the usual method in which such corporations are managed, and any and all other relevant facts that tend to throw light upon the question of the proper discharge of the duty as a director.\n   <footnotemark>\n    119\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Under Texas law, the only director or officer conduct that subjects a defendant to liability, \"is that which is characterized by ultra vires, fraudulent, and injurious practices, abuse of power, and oppression on the part of the company or its controlling agency clearly subversive of the rights of the minority, or of a shareholder, and which, without such interference, would leave the latter remediless.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    120\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ultra vires conduct includes that which \"is beyond the scope of the powers of the corporation as defined by its charter or the law of the state of incorporation or illegal acts.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    121\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The Trustee did not allege fraud or ultra vires against the non-Weinshanker Defendants, but instead alleged mere mismanagement in their roles as directors. Under the circumstances, the pleadings do not adequately allege that the non-Weinshanker Defendants breached a duty of care to Hastings, rather that Weinshanker took actions on behalf of Hastings without informing the non-Weinshanker Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The Trustee also failed to allege breach of duty of loyalty against the non-Weinshanker Defendants. A director violates the duty of loyalty if he or she: \"(1) makes a personal profit from a transaction by dealing with the corporation or usurps a corporate opportunity, (2) buys or sells assets of a corporation, (3) transacts business in his or her officer's or director's capacity with a second corporation of which he or she is also an officer or director or is significantly financially associated, or (4) transacts corporate business in his or her officer's or director's capacity with a family member.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    122\n   </footnotemark>\n   Notably missing from this definition is a claim predicated on a director's failure to act. The Trustee does not allege that the non-Weinshanker Defendants were consciously avoiding their fiduciary duties or intentionally disregarded red flags, but simply that they took no action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    123\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The Trustee also does not allege that the non-Weinshanker Defendants acted in bad faith in abdication of their duties. Under Texas law, bad faith is irrelevant if there is no showing of ultra vires or fraud, such as the case here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    124\n   </footnotemark>\n   Bad faith conduct occurs when a director \"intentionally fails to act in the face of a known duty to act, demonstrating a conscious disregard for his [or her] duties.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    125\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Trustee failed to demonstrate that the non-Weinshanker directors consciously disregarded their corporate duties or intentionally failed to act on behalf of Hastings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The Trustee fails to allege that any of the non-Weinshanker Defendants were interested parties. The Amended Complaint implies that Herschopf is interested due to her firm's relationship with Weinshanker, but the Trustee does not allege any facts supporting any alleged personal loyalty. Herschopf did not become imbued with a personal interest solely by joining the board of a company that her law firm represents. The Trustee has failed to plead any facts indicating that the non-Weinshanker Defendants breached the duties of loyalty, care, good faith or fair dealing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Finally, the Trustee fails to allege that the non-Weinshanker Defendants breached TBOC \u00a7 21.418. The non-Weinshanker Defendants are clearly not \"interested parties\" under TBOC \u00a7 21.418 ; the non-Weinshanker Defendants were unable to approve transactions of which they were unaware. The Amended Complaint does not allege facts to the contrary, and the transactions in which Weinshanker was an interested party were never presented to the board for consideration. Therefore, the Amended Complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to state a claim under TBOC \u00a7 21.418.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <em>\n    III. Count III: Breach of Fiduciary duty by Van Ongevalle\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Van Ongevalle held a position at Hastings prior to the buyout, and later\n   became a director, president and the COO of Hastings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    126\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Amended Complaint adequately alleges that Van Ongevalle had a duty of care, loyalty and obedience to Hastings, yet breached the duty of care. Because Van Ongevalle was not only a longtime employee of Hastings, but also a director, president and COO, the Amended Complaint adequately alleges that Van Ongevalle had knowledge of the challenged transactions, and knew they were not in the best interest of Hastings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The specific breach of fiduciary duty claims against Van Ongevalle include:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   a.

Taking no action while Weinshanker directed Hastings to handle all of SPI's and MovieStop's back office functions, as well as a host of other administrative functions on behalf of Weinshanker's other entities, which went unreimbursed;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   e. Taking no action while Weinshanker directed Hastings to make the NECA Transfer to NECA, despite the fact that Hastings had no corresponding obligation to NECA, NECA never intended to repay Hastings, and the payment was for a debt owed by SPI to NECA or potentially Weinshanker himself;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   f. Taking no action while Weinshanker directed Hastings to fund $1.375 million in production costs and inventory advances to the Elvis Exhibition for the benefit of EAC, for which EAC did not possess the means or intent to repay Hastings, and without a documented mechanism for repayment;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   g.

Failing to consult with Weinshanker and other directors, in their capacities as directors, on material matters pertaining to Hastings, including the SPI and MovieStop acquisitions, the NECA Transfer, the Elvis Transfers, the liquidity crisis caused by Weinshanker's diversion of funds to his other entities, the Pathlight Paydown, and the depletion of Hastings' availability of the BofA revolver; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   j. Failing to understand or acknowledge the constitution of the Board and the duties and obligations of the Board.\n   <footnotemark>\n    127\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   These actions, and inactions, adequately allege a breach of duty of care, as the actions exhibit a lack of diligence in managing corporate affairs, without regard\n   to the consequences of these actions and failures to act. While the Amended Complaint adequately alleges a breach of duty of care, it does not adequately allege breach of loyalty or obedience. The Amended Complaint fails to plead facts showing that Van Ongevalle was personally interested in the outcome of the Hastings transactions, or personally benefitted from them. Therefore, the Amended Complaint is insufficient as to a breach of duty of loyalty claim. Further, the Amended Complaint does not allege a breach of duty of obedience, as ultra vires acts were not pled. The Amended Complaint does not allege that Van Ongevalle committed ultra vires acts or acted fraudulently. The duty of obedience claim also fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Finally, the Amended Complaint fails to allege a breach under TBOC. \u00a7 21.418. The Amended Complaint fails to allege that Van Ongevalle had a financial interest in, or held a managerial position with, any of Weinshanker's entities apart from Hastings. Under the\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   standard outlined above, the Amended Complaint adequately presents a breach of fiduciary duty of care, but fails to adequately present a breach of fiduciary duty of loyalty, duty of obedience or breach of TBOC \u00a7 21.418.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <em>\n    II.

Substantive Law\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   In Count One of the Amended Complaint, the Trustee alleges that once Hastings entered the zone of insolvency, Weinshanker's fiduciary duties of obedience, care, loyalty, good faith and fair dealing ran not only to Hastings, but to its creditors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    131\n   </footnotemark>\n   In Count Two, the Trustee alleges that when Hastings entered the zone of insolvency, Herschopf, Shrader, and Marrs owed fiduciary duties to Hastings' creditors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    132\n   </footnotemark>\n   In Count Three, the Trustee alleges that Van Ongevalle's fiduciary duties of obedience, care, loyalty, good faith and fair dealing ran to Hastings' creditors as well.\n   <footnotemark>\n    133\n   </footnotemark>\n   In each of these claims, Defendants argue that the Trustee lacks standing to pursue a breach of fiduciary duty claim on behalf of creditors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The creditors of an insolvent corporation have standing to bring derivative\n   actions against directors for breach of fiduciary duty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    134\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Gheewalla\n   </em>\n   Court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   When a corporation is\n   <em>\n    solvent\n   </em>\n   , those duties may be enforced by its shareholders, who have standing to bring derivative actions on behalf of the corporation because they are the ultimate beneficiaries of the corporation's growth and increased value. When a corporation is\n   <em>\n    insolvent,\n   </em>\n   however, its creditors take the place of the shareholders as the residual beneficiaries of any increase in value.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   Consequently, the creditors of an\n   <em>\n    insolvent\n   </em>\n   corporation have standing to maintain derivative claims against the directors on behalf of the corporation for breaches in fiduciary duties. The corporation's insolvency \"makes the creditors the principal constituency injured by any fiduciary breaches that diminish the firm's value.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    135\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The confirmed Plan transferred any rights of the Debtors to the Trustee to pursue claims against insiders, including derivative claims for breach of fiduciary duty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    136\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   When a corporation is solvent, shareholders have the right to bring derivative actions on behalf of the corporation against directors for breach of fiduciary duty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    137\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, this analysis changes when the debtor becomes insolvent. Insolvency is defined as having liabilities that exceed the value of assets, having stopped paying debts in the ordinary course, or being unable to pay them as they come due.\n   <footnotemark>\n    138\n   </footnotemark>\n   Which constituency has the right to pursue the breach of fiduciary duty claim is determined whether and when insolvency occurs. However, the Defendants argue that the Amended Complaint has not adequately alleged that the Debtors were insolvent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   To show insolvency, a plaintiff must allege either that a corporation was insolvent or became insolvent based on the alleged misconduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    139\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Amended Complaint alleges the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   96. All or substantially all of the acts and omissions of Weinshanker and the non-Weinshanker Defendants occurred while Hastings was clearly insolvent on a balance sheet basis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   97. As an initial matter, Hastings' insolvency was propelled by the Weinshanker-led leveraged buyout, which added $15 million of secured debt to the company's books. As a result, Hastings was insolvent by no later than July 28, 2014 (if not\n   as of the Buyout Date itself [i.e., July 15, 2014] ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   98. This insolvency substantially increased as a result of the acts and omissions of Weinshanker and the non-Weinshanker Defendants. By causing (in the case of Weinshanker) and facilitating or otherwise enabling (in the case of the non-Weinshanker Defendants) a series of disastrous and costly transactions that resulted in tens of millions of dollars of net cash outflows from Hastings, Hastings became progressively more insolvent, ultimately becoming unable to service its mounting secured and unsecured indebtedness, and eventually resulting in its chapter 11 filings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   118. Hastings became insolvent no later than July 28, 2014 (if not the Buyout Date), with the magnitude of such insolvency increasing in subsequent periods, through the petition date.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The Amended Complaint's recitation of the word \"insolvency\" is not enough to support a plausible claim under the\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   standard. Neither can the Court accept mere conclusory statements. The Trustee's allegations do not move the ticker from conceivable to plausible. \"To meet the burden of proving insolvency, a plaintiff must plead facts showing that the debtor-corporation has either (1) a deficiency of assets below liabilities with no reasonable prospect that the business can be successfully continued in the fact thereof, or (2) an inability to meet maturing obligations as they fall due within the ordinary course.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    140\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Amended Complaint contains details regarding the Defendants' alleged mismanagement, but despite allowing amendment to the original complaint, the Trustee continues to plead overly broad statements of insolvency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Having failed to adequately plead that Hastings was insolvent or became insolvent as a result of Defendants' actions, the Trustee's portion of claims numbered one, two, and three for breach of fiduciary duty owed to Hastings' creditors fail. The Motion to Dismiss these portions of the claims will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <em>\n    III. Aiding and Abetting\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <em>\n    i. Choice of Law\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Delaware's aiding and abetting standard is the same as Texas' standard, requiring knowing participation in a breach of another's fiduciary duty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    141\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, some Delaware case law holds that a party with a direct fiduciary relationship cannot aid and abet a breach of fiduciary duty. Texas courts have not spoken on whether aiding and abetting claims may be brought only against non-fiduciaries. But, Texas courts often look to Delaware law as persuasive authority;\n   <footnotemark>\n    142\n   </footnotemark>\n   therefore, I will examine the counts under similar Texas and Delaware law, but also look to specific Delaware provisions as persuasive authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <em>\n    ii. Substantive Law\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Aiding and abetting has been recognized as a \"dependent\" claim. Therefore, the derivative nature of an aiding and abetting claim will exist only with the success of the breach of fiduciary duty claim. The Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 876 states \"for harm resulting to a third person from the tortious conduct of another, one is subject to liability if he...knows that the other's conduct constitutes a breach of duty and gives substantial assistance or encouragement to the other so to conduct himself.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    143\n   </footnotemark>\n   To establish a valid claim for aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty, a plaintiff must prove \"(1) the existence of a fiduciary relationship, (2) a breach of the fiduciary's duty, ... (3) knowing participation in that breach by the defendants, and (4) damages proximately caused by the breach.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    144\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"A defendant knowingly participates in a breach of fiduciary duty if it acts with the knowledge that the conduct advocated or asserted constituted a breach.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    145\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   The Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 876 has been applied to determine whether a defendant knowingly participated in a breach of fiduciary duty. Section 876 provides that a defendant can be liable for \"harm resulting from the tortious conduct of another\" if the defendant:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   (a) does a tortious act in concert with the other or pursuant to a common design with him, or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   (b) knows that the other's conduct constitutes a breach of duty and gives substantial assistance or encouragement to the other so to conduct himself, or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   (c) gives substantial assistance to the other in accomplishing a tortious result and his own conduct, separately considered, constitutes a breach of duty to the third person.\n   <footnotemark>\n    146\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Further, the Supreme Court of Delaware determined that, \"knowing participation in a board's fiduciary breach requires that the third-party act with the knowledge that the conduct advocated or assisted constitutes a breach.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    147\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"The aider and abettor must act with scienter.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    148\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"The aider and abettor must act 'knowingly, intentionally, or with reckless indifference... that is, with an illicit state of mind.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    149\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   The Trustee fails to allege that the non-Weinshanker Defendants and Van Ongevalle had the necessary scienter to be liable for aiding and abetting Weinshanker. The Amended Complaint repeatedly alleges that the non-Weinshanker Defendants and Van Ongevalle \"knew or should have known\" of Weinshanker's actions and consequences, but fails to allege specific facts showing actual knowledge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    150\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Should have known\" is not enough to plead a claim for aiding and abetting, and the Amended Complaint does not allege adequate information to show that Van Ongevalle knew that Weinshanker's actions\n   would result in a breach of fiduciary duty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    151\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Delaware law generally prohibits aiding and abetting claims against parties that already stand in direct fiduciary relationships.\n   <footnotemark>\n    152\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is because wrongful conduct on the part of the fiduciary would give rise to direct liability for a breach of duty, rather than secondary liability on the theory of aiding and abetting. I previously established that the non-Weinshanker Defendants and Van Ongevalle had a fiduciary duty to Hastings. Under Delaware law, as persuasive authority, the aiding and abetting claims would be prohibited due to the non-Weinshanker Defendants and Van Ongevalle's direct fiduciary relationships.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Accordingly, the Amended Complaint fails to adequately allege aiding and abetting claims against the non-Weinshanker Defendants and Van Ongevalle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   <em>\n    IV. Alter Ego/Veil Piercing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   To state a claim for veil piercing, the plaintiff must plead facts supporting an inference that the corporation, through an alter ego, created an entity designed to defraud its investors and creditors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    153\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Specific facts a court may consider when being asked to disregard the corporate form include: (1) whether the company was adequately capitalized for the undertaking; (2) whether the company was solvent; (3) whether corporate formalities were observed; (4) whether the dominant shareholder siphoned company funds; and (5) whether, in general, the company simply functioned as a fa\u00e7ade of the dominant shareholder.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    154\n   </footnotemark>\n   The decision to pierce the corporate veil generally results from a combination of several factors and an overall element of unfairness or injustice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    155\n   </footnotemark>\n   Importantly, Delaware does not take such allegations lightly, therefore a plaintiff must do more than show that one corporation is an alter ego of another in a conclusory fashion in order for the court to disregard their separate legal existence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    156\n   </footnotemark>\n   While not impossible, persuading a Delaware court to disregard the corporate entity is a difficult task.\n   <footnotemark>\n    157\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   The Amended Complaint alleges that DAC's \"corporate\" veil should be pierced. Given that DAC is a Delaware limited liability company, Delaware law controls. The complaint must establish plausibility of a claim that defendants committed the wrongdoing. As\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   states, \"a claim has facial plausibility when the\n   pleaded factual content allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    158\n   </footnotemark>\n   The claim must establish plausibility by factual allegations, and not mere recitals of the elements of the claim or conclusory statements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    159\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   The Amended Complaint adequately alleges that corporate formalities were not observed. The Amended Complaint alleges that no board meetings were held, no board members were consulted on material matters pertaining to the various acquisitions and transfers, no board members were consulted concerning the depletion of Hastings' availability under the BofA revolver, and no constitution or duties of the board were acknowledged.\n   <footnotemark>\n    160\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the Court will deny the motion to dismiss Count IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   <em>\n    V. Attorneys' Fees and Costs\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Under the American Rule, \"absent express statutory provisions to the contrary, each party involved in litigation will bear only their individual attorneys' fees no matter what the outcome of the litigation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    161\n   </footnotemark>\n   Awarding attorney's fees is within the discretion of the court and an exception exists in equity when it appears that a party, or its counsel, has proceeded in bad faith.\n   <footnotemark>\n    162\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given that the attorney's fees are derivative of substantive claims, the request for attorney's fees fails for all dismissed claims. As to the remaining claims, awarding attorney's fees is within the discretion of the Court. The Court finds no grounds to indicate bad faith and denies the claim for attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Motions to Dismiss are denied in part and granted in part. The Motion to Dismiss Count I is denied with respect to Weinshanker's breach of fiduciary duty to Hastings, but granted as to Weinshanker's breach of fiduciary duty to Hastings' creditors. The Motion to Dismiss Count III with respect to Van Ongevalle's breach of the fiduciary duty of care is denied, but granted as to Van Ongevalle's breach of duty of loyalty and duty of obedience.
