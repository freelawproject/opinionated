SMITH, District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The undersigned presided over a jury trial pertaining to,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the debtors' misappropriation of trade secrets of a company which produces various food items, including fig spreads. The jury returned a verdict largely in favor of this company and against the debtors. A few months after the jury's verdict, the debtors filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   During the post-trial motions phase of the litigation, the parties entered into a settlement agreement after extensive negotiation before the undersigned. The settlement agreement contained language by which this court would retain jurisdiction over disputes arising under the agreement. The agreement also stated that the fig spread company would \"have the ability to pursue its current [unsecured] claim in Bankruptcy Court but will support any plan not inconsistent with this agreement as long as it pays out at least 10%.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In their final proposed chapter 11 reorganization plan, the debtors treated the fig spread company differently than other unsecured creditors. More specifically, while the plan provided that the fig spread company would receive 10% of its claim, the other unsecured creditors would receive at least 39% and possibly up to 50% of their claims. The fig spread company filed an objection to this plan, and the bankruptcy court scheduled a hearing on the objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The fig spread company then filed a motion for this court to withdraw the reference to the bankruptcy court. The fig spread company's argument is that they have shown cause as to why the court should permissively withdraw the reference in large part because of the court's involvement in the underlying proceedings,\n   the undersigned's role in negotiating the settlement, and this court's retention of jurisdiction over matters arising from the settlement agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The debtors oppose the motion noting that the objection to confirmation of the plan is a \"core\" proceeding under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2), which the bankruptcy court should address. In addition, they argue that the fig spread company has mistakenly stated that resolving the objection is premised only on interpreting the settlement agreement. Instead, they contend that the issue is whether the debtors have unfairly discriminated against the fig spread company in contravention of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201129\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . They also note that the bankruptcy court is sufficiently familiar with the proceedings to be able to address the objection and any issues with interpreting the language of the settlement agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For the reasons stated below, the court agrees with the debtors that the objection to the confirmation of the plan is a \"core\" proceeding under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2) which weighs against withdrawing the reference. In addition, the other factors relevant to the court's consideration of permissively withdrawing the reference in this case weigh against withdrawal. Accordingly, the movant has failed to show cause warranting permissive withdrawal of the reference, and the court denies the motion for withdrawal of reference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Moreover, even if the objection did not technically fall under section 157(b)(2)(L), it is still a \"core\" proceeding because \"it invokes a substantive right provided by title 11 or ... is a proceeding that, by its nature, could arise only in the context of a bankruptcy case.\"\n   <em>\n    CoreStates Bank, N.A. v.

Therefore, this weighs against this court withdrawing the reference to the bankruptcy court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    In re Pruitt\n   </em>\n   factors also do no warrant withdrawing the reference in this case. In the first instance, from a timing perspective, the court disagrees with Dalmatia that it acted promptly in seeking to withdraw the reference.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dalmatia\n   had notice by no later than June 6, 2018, that the Debtors were proposing to treat it differently than the other unsecured creditors seemingly based at least in part on the terms of the Settlement Agreement. It filed an objection to confirmation of the 4th amended plan on July 16, 2018, seemingly after receiving notice that the votes were in favor of approving the plan. While Dalmatia indicates that it unsuccessfully attempted to resolve the dispute through its good faith efforts to communicate with the Debtors, the bankruptcy court confirmed the plan (exempting Dalmatia's objection) on September 17, 2018. The bankruptcy court's order confirming the plan directed that Dalmatia file a praecipe to set a hearing date on its objection. Dalmatia filed its praecipe to set the hearing date on October 12, 2018, and the bankruptcy court entered an E-order on October 16, 2018 scheduling a hearing for November 14, 2018. Almost two weeks after entry of the order, Dalmatia filed the instant motion seeking withdrawal of the reference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   At bottom, it surely does not appear from the record that \"this [was] the first opportunity Dalmatia has had to seek withdrawal.\" Dalmatia Mem. at 8. Instead, Dalmatia filed its objection with the bankruptcy court in July and did not file the instant motion until the end of October, when the bankruptcy court had a hearing scheduled for approximately two weeks later. As such, this factor weighs against withdrawal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Secondly, there is no indication that withdrawing the reference will somehow expedite the bankruptcy process. While the court recognizes the possibility that the losing party before the bankruptcy court may seek to appeal from the adverse ruling, there are multiple potential possibilities as to what could occur even if this court withdraws the reference and a party is dissatisfied with this court's ruling. In other words, it is unclear that withdrawal will expedite the bankruptcy process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   As for the final factors, while the court admittedly retained jurisdiction to resolve disputes, this court is in no better position to determine whether the Debtors are unfairly discriminating against Dalmatia under the 4th amended plan than the bankruptcy court. In this regard, to the extent that part of the dispute centers on the terms of the settlement agreement, both this court and the bankruptcy court would seemingly have to follow principles of contract law to address the issue. Both courts would \"have to get up to speed\" by evaluating the parties' arguments and the applicable law, so it would not be any more economical to have this matter heard here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   And, the bankruptcy court would surely be in a better position to use its expertise to evaluate whether the Debtors are unfairly discriminating against Dalmatia in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201129\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   As a final note, the court recognizes that the settlement agreement in the Fig Spread Action provides for this court's retention\n   of jurisdiction over disputes arising from the agreement. Nonetheless, any issue over the interpretation of the agreement is only part of the overall issue as to whether the Debtors are unfairly discriminating against Dalmatia. This ultimate issue is best left to the expertise of the bankruptcy court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The court does not find that Dalmatia has shown sufficient cause to withdraw the reference to the bankruptcy court in this action. Dalmatia's objection to confirmation of the 4th amended plan is a \"core\" proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code because it either invokes a substantive right provided by title 11 or is a proceeding that could arise only in the context of a bankruptcy case. The objection, while partially involving interpretation of language in the settlement agreement, primarily concerns whether the Debtors are unfairly discriminating against Dalmatia. This is an issue that the bankruptcy court is in a better position to address in the first instance. Additionally, the\n   <em>\n    In re Pruitt\n   </em>\n   factors do not support cause for withdrawal of the reference.

Rather, Dalmatia rejected multiple lots of fig spread because it failed to meet Dalmatia's quality requirements, and Dalmatia directed Lancaster Fine Foods to stop further production. Debtors' Disclosure states that they \"liquidated this inventory on the open market in a commercially reasonable manner.\" This is a lie. They did not sell the fig spread on the \"open market,\" but rather they sold it\n    <em>\n     in secret\n    </em>\n    to Dalmatia's former distributor, FoodMatch, Inc. They also continued manufacturing fig spread using Dalmatia's trademark and trade dress without Dalmatia's knowledge or consent, and sold that product in secret to FoodMatch, as well.
