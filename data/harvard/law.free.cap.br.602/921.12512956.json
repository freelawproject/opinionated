Winnecour, Chapter 13 Trustee (\"Trustee Winnecour\"), at Doc. No. 49. Trustee Winnecour seeks to disallow Proof of Claim No. 24 filed by U.S. Bank, National Association, Trustee for Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency (\"Respondent\"), to the extent the claim contradicts Debtor's confirmed chapter 13 plan. Respondent argues that the confirmed plan cannot modify its lien for prepetition arrears. A hearing on the Objection was held March 13, 2019, and briefs were submitted by the parties. Oral argument was heard on July 2, 2019. The matter is now ripe for decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Debtor Tina L. Venanzio (\"Debtor\") filed for relief under chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code on February 20, 2014. Debtor filed a chapter 13 plan on February 25, 2014 at Doc. No. 9. Debtor included prepetition arrearages to Respondent in the amount of $4,895.00 in Section 3(a) of her plan, which provided for \"Long Term Continuing Debts Cured and Reinstated, and Lien (if any) Retained.\" No objections to the plan were filed, and the plan was confirmed on September 11, 2014. Respondent has never challenged notice or service of the plan or Confirmation Order during the course of the Debtor's case. At no point prior to confirmation did Respondent file any proof of claim or objection to Debtor's plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   All non-government proofs of claim were due June 23, 2014. Proof of Claim 24 was filed on June 23, 2015, exactly one year after the bar date had expired. The Claim filed by Respondent provides for arrears in the amount of $10,453.78. Trustee Winnecour filed an Objection to Proof of Claim No. 24 on January 23, 2019. Based on Trustee Winnecour's representations during oral argument, Debtor has completed all payments contemplated under the chapter 13 plan, including all payments due to Respondent under the plan. Accordingly, Trustee Winnecour takes the position that the mortgage arrears have been fully cured and Respondent is barred from claiming any additional amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   With the foregoing facts in mind, this Court must address whether to sustain or overrule Trustee Winnecour's Objection to Proof of Claim No. 24. Trustee Winnecour raises two main arguments as to why Proof of Claim No. 24 should be disallowed: (1) the claim was filed untimely, and (2) Debtor's confirmed chapter 13 plan is res judicata as to the amount of arrears to be paid to Respondent. The Court will address both arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Timeliness of Proof of Claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A claim is deemed allowed unless it is properly objected to by a party in interest, as provided for in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20502\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

W.D. Pa. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   It is uncontested that Proof of Claim No. 24 was filed untimely. All non-government proofs of claim were due June 23, 2014. Claim 24 was filed on June 23, 2015, exactly one year after the bar date had expired. Trustee Winnecour filed a proper objection to Claim No. 24 on January 23, 2019 on grounds that it was untimely and conflicted with the confirmed chapter 13 plan. Proof of Claim No. 24 is disallowed pursuant to \u00a7 502(b)(9) to the extent it claims arrears in an amount that exceeds the arrears provided for in Debtor's plan. Proof of Claim 24 contained a claim for arrears in the amount of $10,453.78, which is $5,558.78 higher than the arrears provided for in the Debtor's plan ($4,895.00). Therefore, Respondent's Proof of Claim is disallowed in the amount of $5,558.78.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Res Judicata Effect of a Confirmed Plan\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Section 1322(b)(5) of the Bankruptcy Code provides in relevant part that a chapter 13 plan may \"provide for the curing of any default within a reasonable time and maintenance of payments while the case is pending on any ... secured claim on which the last payment is due after the date on which the final payment under the plan is due.\" Section 1322(b)(5) allows a debtor to make regular maintenance payments and cure any arrears that exist on a mortgage during the pendency of a bankruptcy case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rogel v.

Debtor included the prepetition arrearages to Respondent in the amount of $4,895.00 in Section 3(a) of her plan, which provided for \"Long Term Continuing Debts Cured and Reinstated, and Lien (if any) Retained.\" Although not expressly stated, it is clear from the plain language of the plan that Debtor elected to cure and reinstate her mortgage pursuant to \u00a7 1322(b)(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   If the arrears as stated in the plan were insufficient to effectuate cure and reinstatement of the mortgage, Respondent was free to object. The plan language put Respondent on notice that Debtor was proposing a\n   <em>\n    cure\n   </em>\n   of the arrears in the amount of $4,895.00. Respondent does not contest that it had sufficient notice to object to the plan or to otherwise indicate that the arrears were incorrect.

In contrast, Respondent now seeks to punish Debtor for incorrectly stating facts that were in Respondent's control. Debtor had no reason to believe the arrears as stated in her chapter 13 plan were incorrect; Respondent filed no proof of claim prior to plan confirmation and failed to object to the plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Respondent \"elected to rely on [its] lien rights,\" seemingly so it could pounce on the unsuspecting Debtor with a claim for arrears that Debtor reasonably believes to have already been paid.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Respondent's Brief in Opposition, Doc. No. 68, at 6. Such a strategy is not supported by the Bankruptcy Code and flies in the face of the \"fresh start\" afforded to a Debtor who has completed her case in good faith.

The liens that survived discharge in\n   <em>\n    Woodard\n   </em>\n   were not provided for in the debtor's plan.

This Court does not disagree with the controlling legal principle that a lien passes through bankruptcy unaffected. However, said principle only applies if the lien is not addressed and treated in some fashion during the course of the bankruptcy case - either by being provided for in a\n   reorganization plan or avoided pursuant to a Code avoidance power.\n   <em>\n    Thomas v.

The holding of\n   <em>\n    Mansaray-Ruffin\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable to the facts of the present case. Unlike the debtor in\n   <em>\n    Mansaray-Ruffin\n   </em>\n   , the Debtor herein did not attempt to invalidate or modify a lien. Debtor merely sought to cure and reinstate her mortgage pursuant to \u00a7 1322(b)(5). An adversary proceeding is not required to effectuate cure and reinstatement of a mortgage under \u00a7 1322(b)(5). All that is required to implement \u00a7 1322(b)(5) is a chapter 13 plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the amount of arrears listed in the plan was incorrect, the proper remedy for Respondent would have been to object to plan confirmation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Lastly, this Court adopts the holding in\n   <em>\n    In re Miller\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   and finds it applicable to the facts in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the\n   <em>\n    Trustee's Objection to Late Filed Secured Claim\n   </em>\n   will be sustained. The Proof of Claim filed by Respondent at Proof of Claim Number 24 is both untimely and inconsistent with Debtor's confirmed chapter 13 plan. Proof of Claim No. 24 is disallowed in the amount of $5,558.78. The treatment of the mortgage held by Respondent is controlled by Debtor's confirmed plan. To the extent all payments contemplated under the plan have been made, as represented by Trustee Winnecour, the arrears have been cured in full. Therefore, any action or proceeding to collect or enforce a claim for any delinquent prepetition arrears inconsistent with the confirmed and completed plan is disallowed. An Order will be entered consistent with this Memorandum Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ORDER\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20157\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 157\n    </extracted-citation>\n    and 1334.
