Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On May 9, 2015 (the \"Petition Date\"), Pennysaver USA Publishing, LLC filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court subsequently entered an order providing for the joint administration of the Debtors' cases consolidating PennySaver USA, LLC, PennySaver USA Publishing, LLC, PennySaver USA Printing, LLC, Orbiter Properties, LLC, and Monthly Mailer, LLC (collectively the \"Debtors\") for procedural purposes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Office of the United States Trustee appointed Don A. Beskrone as the interim Chapter 7 Trustee of the Debtors' cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Beskrone now serves as the trustee (the \"Trustee\") in these cases pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20702\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As mentioned above, on November 13, 2017, Defendants Daniel Abrams, Alana S. Chaffin, Vijay K. Mony, and Virginia Anne Thornton (the \"Employee Defendants\") filed a Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint. Defendants OpenGate Capital Group, LLC (\"Capital\"), OpenGate Capital Management, LLC (\"Management\"), and Pennysaver Investors, LLC (\"Investors,\" and collectively with Management and Capital, \"OpenGate\") also moved to dismiss and joined the Employee Defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Andrew Nikou and Jay Yook (collectively with OpenGate, the \"OpenGate Defendants\") then joined OpenGate's Motion to Dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   As mentioned above, the Employee Defendant's motion to dismiss was granted, in part, and denied, in part, on July 11, 2018;\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   however, the Court did not rule upon the OpenGate Defendants' Motion to Dismiss at that time. This is the Court's ruling on OpenGate Defendants' Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Collectively, the Debtors formed the substance of Pennysaver, a business founded in 1962 that published a \"shopper\"-i.e., a weekly California newspaper that provided advertising space for local business, as well as classified ads. The Debtors filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy relief in this Court on the Petition Date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Debtors are Delaware limited liability companies. The other three non-Debtor Delaware LLCs at issue are Investors, Capital, and Management. Throughout the Complaint, the Trustee uses the term \"OpenGate\" to refer to a single entity and fails to distinguish between Capital, Management, and Investors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   OpenGate is a private equity firm that acquired Pennysaver in September 2013 from then-owner Harte-Hankes, Inc., in a leveraged buy-out that included $ 4 million in equity and $ 20.5 million of new secured debt from Capital One Business Credit Corp. (\"COBC\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Trustee alleges the following relationship between the LLCs at issue. Management and Capital directly managed Investors. Capital owned 98% of Investors' equity. Investors owned, directly or indirectly, the Debtors. Specifically, Investors was the sole member and manager of Debtor PennySaver USA, LLC. Management, Capital, and Investors are indistinct as a matter of day-to-day control. The OpenGate group acquired the Debtors on September 27, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Factual Allegations in the Complaint\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Trustee has filed claims against managers, members and employees of the Debtors, on behalf of the Debtors. The Debtors are separate Delaware limited liability companies, governed by operating agreements. The Debtors' rights and claims, if any, against managers and members are inherently contractual. The Trustee alleges that all of the OpenGate entities or individual defendants are jointly responsible for the alleged mismanagement of the Debtors, which, the Trustee alleges, resulted in harm to the Debtors' creditors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As the OpenGate entities are limited liability companies, direct claims of the Debtors against their managers and members must start and end with each Debtor's limited liability company operating agreement. The Trustee is in possession of all the Debtors' corporate records, and has even conducted a Rule 2004 examination of OpenGate. The Trustee's legal theory is that \"OpenGate\" and others are liable to all of the Debtors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   To acquire financing for its leveraged acquisition of Pennysaver, OpenGate presented putative lenders with rosy financial projections for Pennysaver that were premised upon a labor cost savings plan that it never attempted to implement (and likely, never intended to), and that were consistently more bullish about Pennysaver's future revenues than OpenGate's own internal projections (e.g., by showing the banks EBITDA 27-54% higher than the internal projections).\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Whether measured by going-concern value or liquidation value, the Debtors were never worth more than the amount of the COBC debt-they were insolvent from day one, and OpenGate was fully aware of that fact.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On or shortly after the Closing Date for the Pennysaver acquisition, OpenGate caused the Debtors to make $ 2 million in \"[d]istributions to Member\" to OpenGate (the \"Dividend\"). In addition, OpenGate caused the Debtors to pay $ 868,000 of closing expenses in connection with the acquisition (the \"Closing Expenses\"). The Debtors' payment of the Dividend and the Closing Expenses, according to the Trustee, was gratuitous-the Debtors received no value or other consideration in exchange for these payments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In April 2014, OpenGate caused the Debtors to distribute approximately $ 1.8 million to OpenGate for alleged tax obligations (the \"Tax Payment\"). The Trustee alleges that the Debtors received no value or other consideration in exchange for the Tax Payment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Shortly after the Closing Date, OpenGate caused one or more of the Debtors to enter into a management agreement with OpenGate whereby OpenGate was to provide certain \"management\" services to the Debtors, in exchange for a monthly \"fee\" of $ 83,333.33 (the \"Management Fees\"). The Trustee alleged that OpenGate caused the Debtors to pay Management Fees from October 2013 through December 2014, but it did not provide any management services-rather, it used the management agreement as a means to siphon cash out of Pennysaver.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Trustee continues that on January 9, 2014, Defendant Yook advised the Debtors' then-CEO, Liz Gaier, that Fusion Paperboard, one of OpenGate's other portfolio companies, was having liquidity problems and that the Debtors would need to provide it with a 30-day loan for $ 500,000. Realizing that a loan to an OpenGate affiliate would violate the Debtors' debt covenants with COBC, however, OpenGate ginned up an \"Agreement\" to be executed by the Debtors and Fusion Paperboard, which purported to allow the Debtors to sell scrap newsprint to Fusion Paperboard at 5% over \"prevailing rates,\" in return for paying Fusion Paperboard a $ 500,000 \"advance fee.\" The Trustee asserts\n   that this agreement made no economic sense for the Debtors because it would take them approximately 15 years to break even, and no rational economic actor-particularly one facing the Debtors' cash constraints-would have paid an \"advance fee\" of $ 500,000 to secure the modest economic benefits provided by the agreement. Against the advice of counsel (who warned that the agreement could be viewed as a disguised loan violated the Debtors' debt covenants with COBC), Yook pressed forward, advising in an email that \"[u]ltimately, what I care about is everyone cooperating and working on behalf of PennySaver's owners - i.e., OpenGate.\" The Debtors and Fusion Paperboard executed their purported agreement on January 14, 2014, and the Debtors wired Fusion Paperboard $ 500,000 that same day (the \"Fusion Loan\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Commencing in March 2014, and over the vehement (and repeated) objections from the Debtors' senior management, OpenGate caused the Debtors to put the four OpenGate Employees on their payroll. The OpenGate Employees were paid generous salaries and bonuses despite not working or performing any material amount of services for, or otherwise providing any material value to, the Debtors. And starting in 2015, while the Debtors were in the midst of a liquidity crisis and their management was instituting numerous cost-cutting measures, OpenGate directed the Debtors to give each of the OpenGate Employees a raise. In email exchange included in the Complaint, Ms. Gaier, expressed concern to Yook about cash to keep the company going, and disappointment that she had just eliminated $ 377,000 of her own managers' bonuses to save costs only to have Pennysaver turn around and pay bonuses to the OpenGate Employees. Yook told her to stay in her lane: \"[Y]ou need to delineate OG personnel from PS personnel, regardless of how the bonuses for the OG employees are being paid.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In July 2014, Fusion Paperboard went under while still owing the Debtors $ 300,000, thus exposing OpenGate to charges that it had improperly caused the Debtors to advance money to Fusion Paperboard. To deal with that risk, OpenGate promulgated a new version of history, where money had never been loaned or paid as an advance fee to Fusion Paperboard, but instead the $ 500,000 was retroactively characterized on the Debtors' books as a payment for a \"sublease\" from Pennysaver USA, LLC and Management, whereby Pennysaver would lease \"two office rooms\" in OpenGate's headquarters' suites. At some time in July or August 2014, the Fusion Paperboard \"Agreement\" morphed into a 55-month, $ 9,080/month \"sublease\" dated \"as of\" January 1, 2014, with a 24-month security deposit and 31 months of prepaid rent, for a grand total of $ 500,000.05. On August 12, 2014, Defendant Thornton gave detailed instructions to the Debtors' VP of finance to enter back-dated entries into the Debtors' ledgers to reflect the above payments, and then further instructed him to back-date additional entries for July to reflect an \"amended sublease,\" which showed total payments of $ 295,000 (since Fusion Paperboard appears to have paid the Debtors approximately $ 205,000).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   These instructions were in an email that is included in the Complaint (with the subject line: \"RE: Fusion deposit,\" in case there were any doubt what it was really about).\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Commencing in October 2014, OpenGate required the Debtors to start paying OpenGate $ 7,500 per month for IT consulting services by Matthew Ji (the \"IT Payments\"), an OpenGate employee who performed few or no IT services for the Debtors, but did perform them for OpenGate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   By the end of 2014, the Debtors were running short of cash because of the millions the Defendants had taken out of the company. OpenGate knew this, and was repeatedly warned about the consequences by the Debtors' operating management, but it kept withdrawing cash as long as there was cash to withdraw. Finally, in May 2015, with the Debtors' cash all but gone, OpenGate closed down the Debtors' operations without any advance notice, leaving employees and creditors holding the bag.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As summarized above, the Trustee filed an 18-count Complaint against the Defendants, including 14-counts against the OpenGate Defendants, which the OpenGate Defendants have moved to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Counts I-IX for Fraudulent Transfers\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Counts I though IX of the Complaint assert the following claims (i) fraudulent transfers claims against OpenGate under theories of \"actual\" and \"constructive\" fraud for payment of the Dividend, Closing Expenses and IT Payment; (ii) fraudulent transfer claims against OpenGate under the theories of \"actual\" and \"constructive\" fraud for distribution of the Tax Payment; and (iii) fraudulent transfer claims against OpenGate under the theories of \"actual\" and \"constructive\" fraud for distribution of the Management Fees. The Trustee casts a wide net in making these claims arguing that they are fraudulent transfer claims under \u00a7 548, including actual fraudulent transfers, constructive fraudulent transfers as well as Delaware and California state law claims against the Defendants. California and Delaware have both adopted the UFTA, rendering the elements for the State and Federal law claims essentially the same, with the main difference that under the state law claims the lookback period extends to four years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   For all other purposes, the state and federal law claims are identical.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   The OpenGate Defendants dispute that the Trustee has adequately pleaded all elements of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20548\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A), \u00a7 548(a)(1)(B), Delaware Code Section \u00a7 1304(a)(2)(a), and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%203439.04\">\n    Cal. Civil Code \u00a7 3439.04\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Defendants argue that both actual and constructive fraudulent transfer claims are subject to Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 9(b)'s particularity requirements and that the facts alleged do not sufficiently support a plausible inference that the Debtors received less than reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the allegedly fraudulent transfers. Furthermore, the Defendants argue that the Trustee must defeat a presumption of reasonable equivalent value when it comes to the payment of salaries, that the Trustee has no standing to sue\n   under 544(b), and that the Trustee has failed to meet the pleading standard required by\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   because the Trustee has failed to identify which of the Debtors was the entity to actually transfer funds to the Defendants and also fail the specificity requirement of which of the OpenGate received each transfer. The Court first examines which pleading standard is appropriate here, and then the elements that constitute constructive and actual fraudulent transfers as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1. Constructive Fraudulent Transfers\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Legal Standard for Pleading Constructive Fraud\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   This Court evaluates claims of constructive fraud under the notice pleading standard of Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 8(a)(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the motion to dismiss stage, to plead adequately a constructive fraud claim \"all that is needed ... is an allegation that there was a transfer for less than reasonably equivalent value at a time when the Debtors were insolvent.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Trustee must do more than merely recite statutory elements, but needs only to state facts with sufficient particularity to provide the defendant with fair notice of the charges against him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, complaints that identify the dates, amounts, source, and transferee of each of the alleged transfers successfully support claims of constructive fraudulent transfer under Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 8(a)(2)'s pleading standard.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Section 548(a)(1)(B) governs claims for constructively fraudulent transfers. It requires the Trustee to allege that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   (i) the transfers were made within two years of the petition date;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   (ii) the debtor received less than reasonably equivalent value in exchange of the transfers; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   (iii) the debtor either (a) was insolvent on the date that the transfers were made or became insolvent as a result of the transfers; or (b) was or was about to engage in a business or transaction for which any remaining property remaining\n   with the debtor was an unreasonably small capital; or (c) intended or believed that the debtor would incur debts beyond the debtor's ability to pay; or (d) the debtor made the transfer or incurred the obligation to or for the benefit of an insider, under an employment contract and not in the ordinary course of business.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Reasonably equivalent value and insolvency are generally factual determinations that should be reserved for discovery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   So long as \"the Trustee has identified the transfer by date and face amount and has alleged that it was for no consideration,\" the actual amount need not be scrutinized.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   Courts liberally review constructive fraud claims brought by a trustee, given his position as a third party outsider to the debtor's transactions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The same analysis applies to the Trustee's Delaware and California law constructive fraudulent transfer claims. Section 544(b) \"permits the trustee to step into the shoes of an existing unsecured creditor who could have avoided an action under state law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the pleading stage, the Trustee does not need to allege the existence of or name an unsecured creditor, and may claim avoidance of any transfers incurred by the debtor under \"applicable law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Section 1304(a)(2) of the Delaware Code and Section 3439.04(a) of the California Civil Code are the applicable law, and they govern fraudulent transfers as to present and future creditors.

R. Civ. Pro. 9(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   But, unlike the generalized pleading in\n   <em>\n    AgFeed\n   </em>\n   , the Trustee identifies explicitly that every Debtor corporation here is filing for bankruptcy jointly, and does not allege any third-party entities to have made the transfers. The Trustee's complaint does not suffer from the overall vagueness of the complaint in\n   <em>\n    AgFeed.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    In re Pitt Penn Holding Co.\n   </em>\n   , the complaint was found insufficient because it did not identify an avoidable transfer because the complaint failed to identify the defendant's compensation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, the complaint stated only that the defendant was paid \"far more than justified.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the case at hand, however, the Trustee has sufficiently stated the specific amount the OpenGate Defendants received, the dates they received the amounts, and that the made these payments for no material benefit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Trustee's Complaint has sufficiently pled that the OpenGate Defendants were not paid a reasonable equivalent value for their services or lack of services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Insolvency\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Trustee alleges that the Debtors were either insolvent, or rendered insolvent; were engaged in business or transaction, or were about to engage in such business or transaction, for which any property remaining with the Debtors was\n   an unreasonably small amount of capital; or intended to incur debts that would be beyond the ability of the Debtors to pay as such debts matured because the Debtors were insolvent from day one.\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   He describes the Debtors' declining financial performance and loan obligations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Defendants do not argue that the Trustee has failed to adequately plead the Debtors' insolvency. Insolvency is best left to discovery to determine and should not generally be decided on a motion to dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is because the determination of insolvency is highly fact-specific and \"should be based on seasonable appraisals or expert testimony.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   A motion to dismiss is not the proper place to bring in experts to determine insolvency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Court will grant, without prejudice, the constructive fraudulent transfer claims in Counts I-IX because the Trustee has not met the pleading requirements and has not given the Defendants fair notice as the Trustee has not indicated which OpenGate Defendant received each transfer (except in the allegation related to the transfer of the \"Distribution\" to Capital). As noted above, although, the Trustee correctly plead the transfer of the \"Distribution,\" however, as this allegation is intertwined within the same count as other transfers and as the Court is granting leave to amend,\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   this claim will also be dismissed for ease of administration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2.

It requires the Trustee to allege that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   (i) The transfers were made within 2 years before the petition date.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   (ii) The debtor voluntarily or involuntarily made such transfer with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any entity to which the debtor was or became, on or after the date that such transfer was made, indebted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   California's Section 3439.04(a)(1) and Delaware's Section 1304(a)(1) hold the same requirements as \u00a7 548(a)(1)(A).\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   The pleading requirements for both the state and federal claims are identical.\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n   The difference between the federal and state transfer claims is that the state transfer claims have statutory provisions of elements the Court can consider in evaluating actual intent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n   These same statutory elements are incorporated through case law into \u00a7 548 in the form of \"badges of fraud.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, in evaluating the actual fraud allegations, this Court need only evaluate the elements of \u00a7 548 as the elements for the state transfer claims are substantially the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   This Court evaluates claims of actual fraud under the notice pleading\n   standard of Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 9(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 9(b) requires a party alleging fraud or mistake to state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake. This is done to put defendants on notice of the precise misconduct with which they are charged.\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"But 'in the bankruptcy context, Rule 9(b) should be interpreted liberally, particularly when the trustee...is bringing the action.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under this standard, to plead adequately a constructive fraud claim the Trustee uses \"badges of fraud\" to allege fraudulent intent. These badges can include, but are not limited to:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   (i) The relationship between the debtor and the transferee;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   (ii) Consideration for the conveyance;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   (iii) Insolvency or indebtedness of the debtors;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   (iv) How much of the debtor's estate was transferred;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   (v) Reservation of benefits, control or dominion by the debtor over the property transferred; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   (vi) Secrecy or concealment of the transaction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   The presence or absence of any single badge of fraud is not conclusive. 'The proper inquiry is whether the badges of fraud are present, not whether some factors are absent. Although the presence of a single ... badge of fraud may cast suspicion on the transferor's intent, the confluence of several in one transaction generally provides conclusive evidence of an actual intent to defraud.' Additionally, a court may consider other factors relevant to the transaction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The Trustee must allege that the timing of the transfers occurred within two years before the petition date, that the Debtors were indebted, and voluntarily or involuntarily made the alleged transfer with the actual intent to deceive those to whom they were indebted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     i.

The Trustee has alleged sufficiently that there was no consideration given in exchange for the monies transferred to OpenGate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    71\n   </footnotemark>\n   The third badge of fraud is the insolvency of the Debtors. The Trustee has alleged sufficiently the Debtors' insolvency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The fourth badge of fraud is how much of the Debtors' estate was transferred. The Trustee alleges the specific dollar amount and that the amount was more than the Debtor could bear. The Trustee has plead that, in total, \"it appears that OpenGate caused close to $ 7 million (and perhaps more) to be diverted from the Debtors - who desperately required the funds - for no or inadequate consideration.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    72\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Although the Trustee does not allege what percentage of the Debtors' estate was transferred, he alleges sufficiently that the amount was most likely more than the Debtors could afford.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The fifth badge of fraud is that the Debtor reserved control of the property after it was transferred. This did not occur here. The sixth badge of fraud is secrecy or concealment of the transfer. There was no alleged secrecy involved in any of the alleged transfers to OpenGate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The Trustee has alleged sufficiently four out of the six badges of fraud. \"The confluence of several [badges of fraud] in one transaction generally provides conclusive evidence of an actual intent to defraud.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    73\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    c.
