Plaintiff, Jose C. Rodriguez, in his capacity as Chapter 7 Trustee\n   (the \"Trustee\" or \"Plaintiff\") filed his Response of Plaintiff Jose C. Rodriguez, in His Capacity of Chapter 7 Trustee of the Estate of Steven Jeffrey Cyr, to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 97) and Response of Plaintiff Jose C. Rodriguez, in His Capacity of Chapter 7 Trustee of the Estate of Steven Jeffrey Cyr, to Defendant Le Ann Mary Cyr's Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 103). The Trustee of the Bergerud Heritage Trust, Le Ann Mary Cyr (the \"BHT Trustee\"), filed her Reply to Response to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 102). The Court set the matters for hearing, the Parties each appeared through counsel and presented argument, and the Court took the matters under advisement. After considering the arguments made and the pleading of counsel, as well as the file and record in the case, the Court finds that the BHT Trustee's Motion to Dismiss should be granted in part, and denied in part, and Le Ann Cyr's Motion to Dismiss should be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This Court has jurisdiction over these Motions to Dismiss pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), 157(b)(2)(A) (administration of the estate), and (H) (proceedings to determine, avoid, or recover fraudulent conveyances).

On June 15, 2018, the BHT Trustee filed this Adversary Proceeding seeking a determination of the Trustee's interest in the Bergerud Heritage Trust (the \"BHT\") (ECF No. 1). Subsequently, the Trustee filed his Unopposed Motion to Realign the Parties to correct the posture of the case so that the Trustee would be designated as the Plaintiff and the BHT Trustee would be designated as the Defendant (ECF No. 34). The Court entered its Order Granting the Trustee's Unopposed Motion to Realign the Parties (ECF No. 36) and issued a resultant\n   <em>\n    Sua Sponte\n   </em>\n   Order Regarding Pleading Deadlines setting forth new deadlines for the Trustee to file an Original Complaint and the BHT Trustee to serve an answer or dispositive motion (ECF No. 55).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On October 30, 2018, the Trustee filed his Original Complaint of Plaintiff, Jose Rodriguez, In His Capacity as Chapter 7 Trustee of the Estate of Steven Jeffrey Cyr (ECF No. 61) (the \"Trustee's Original Complaint\"). As part of the Trustee's Original Complaint, the Trustee also added Le Ann Mary Cyr in her individual capacity (\"Le Ann Cyr\") as a defendant to this Adversary Proceeding. The Motions to Dismiss were filed, the Trustee filed his Responses thereto, and the BHT Trustee filed her Reply to the Trustee's Response. The Trustee asserts eleven claims for relief, ten of which are the subject of the Motions to Dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

(ECF No. 77, Exh. A, \u00a7 1.04, Sched. A). The BHT is identified as an irrevocable trust. Exh. B, \u00a7 1.03 (\"This Trust is irrevocable and neither of us can alter, amend, revoke, or terminate it in anyway.\"). Le Ann Cyr and Debtor are identified as Trustees of the BHT. Moreover, Debtor and Le Ann Cyr are designated as beneficiaries to the BHT. Exh. B, Art. 2. The specific objectives in creating the BHT include having:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Any gift made to the trust be treated as a completed gift for federal estate and gift tax purposes;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The assets of the trust estate, including life insurance proceeds, be excluded for federal estate tax purposes from our gross estates and the gross estates of our trust beneficiaries except to the extent we have explicitly granted a general power of appointment to a trust beneficiary; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The assets in this trust not be subject to the claims of any beneficiary's creditors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Exh. A, at \u00a7 1.05; Exh. B, \u00a7 1.05. Additionally, the Trust Documents contain the following spendthrift provision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   No beneficiary may assign, anticipate, encumber, alienate, or otherwise voluntarily transfer the income or principal of any trust created under this trust. In addition, neither the income nor the principal of any trust created under this trust is subject to attachment, bankruptcy proceedings or any other legal process, the interference or control of creditors or others, or any involuntary transfer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Exh. A, at \u00a7 8.02; Exh. B, \u00a7 10.02. Finally, the Trustee alleges that on or about August 1, 2017, Debtor was removed as a trustee of the BHT leaving Le Ann Cyr as the sole remaining trustee.

Count 1: Declaratory Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Under Count 1, the Trustee \"seeks declaratory judgment ... that the BHT is a self-settled trust or 'similar device' under [11] U.S.C. \u00a7 548(e)(1),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   all assets of which are property of the Debtor's estate and subject to the claims of creditors.\" The BHT Trustee argues that Count 1 fails to state a cause of action because the Trustee is asking the Court to ignore the existence of the BHT by alleging facts that lead to the conclusion that the BHT is a sham or illusory trust and as a matter of Texas law, such allegations are inapplicable here. To support its proposition, the BHT Trustee cites to\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Bradley v. Ingalls (In re Bradley)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5404187,3707027\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/501/421/\">\n    501 F.3d 421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 429 (5th Cir. 2007) (\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re Bradley\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re Bradley\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   involved a determination of whether and to what extent Bradley, the debtor and beneficiary to a trust, self-settled that trust such that any or all the assets belonging to the trust should be declared property of Bradley's bankruptcy estate. (Bankr. Case No. 02-12741-FM, Adv. Proc. No. 02-01183; ECF No. 411 at 3). The bankruptcy court reviewed Texas law governing spendthrift trusts, and ultimately concluded that to the extent that (1) Bradley transferred property to the trust and (2) the chapter 7 trustee met his tracing burden with respect to such transfers, the assets would be deemed self-settled under Texas law and therefore, subject to the claims of creditors and part of Bradley's bankruptcy estate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5404187,3707027\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/501/421/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 13-14 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20111.004\">\n    Tex. Prop Code Ann. \u00a7 111.004\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (14) (West Supp. 2004)). On appeal, the chapter 7 trustee argued \"that the bankruptcy and district courts erred because they stopped short of declaring that the [t]rust is a sham or illusory trust and that the trust property is\n   <em>\n    totally\n   </em>\n   included in the bankruptcy estate.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re Bradley\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5404187,3707027\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/501/421/\">\n    501 F.3d at 428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). The Fifth Circuit rejected this argument and concluded that in Texas, courts have not expanded the doctrine of illusory trusts beyond marital property situations; therefore, the bankruptcy court and district courts did not err in concluding that the trust\n   <em>\n    property in whole\n   </em>\n   was not property of the estate and that the trustee must satisfy a tracing burden with respect to each self-settled asset.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5404187,3707027\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/501/421/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5404187,3707027\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/501/421/\">\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5404187,3707027\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/501/421/\">\n    at 428-29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Court finds this case and\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Bradley\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   distinguishable. Under Count 1, the Trustee seeks a determination that BHT is a self-settled trust or similar device under \u00a7 548(e)(1)-a claim for relief not addressed in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Bradley\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . Moreover, the issue in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Bradley\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   was not whether the trust assets were subject to avoidance under \u00a7 548(e)(1), but rather a determination of whether the trust was a valid, lawful and binding trust under state law. (Bankr. Case No. 02-12741-FM, Adv. Proc. No. 02-01183; ECF No. 411 at 3). Section 548(e)(1) does not condition avoidance on a trust being deemed invalid and unlawful under state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The BHT Trustee asserts that the Trustee is using Count 1 as a means of\n   avoiding the tracing requirements articulated under\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Bradley\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . The Court will not speculate as to why the Trustee plead Count 1; however, the Court agrees that a determination that the BHT is a self-settled asset or similar device under \u00a7 548(e)(1) does not absolve the Trustee of any requirement to specifically identify the transfer of assets he seeks to avoid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Here, the Trustee seeks a determination that all assets of the BHT are property of Debtor's estate and subject to claims of creditors on the basis that the BHT is a self-settled trust or similar device. Section 548(e)(1) does not permit the avoidance of\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   transfers of assets to a self-settled trust or similar device on the sole basis that the trust at issue is a self-settled trust or similar device. Instead, the Trustee is required to specifically identify the assets transferred, as he did in Counts 2-11, and demonstrate that the elements of \u00a7 548(e)(1) are satisfied with respect to each asset. Therefore, while the Court does not agree that\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Bradley\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   disposes of Count 1, the Court concludes that, as a matter of law, the Trustee is not entitled to the relief it seeks under Count 1. As such, the BHT Trustee's Motion to Dismiss is granted with respect to Count 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Count 2: Transfer of Hillman Lawsuit Proceeds to the BHT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Trustee alleges that beginning December 2016, Debtor filed a lawsuit (the \"Hillman Lawsuit\") that was ultimately resolved by written settlement agreement executed on or about March 23, 2017. Pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement, Debtor was to be paid $ 1,000,000 on or before April 20, 2017, and another $ 600,000 in monthly installments on September 1, 2017 through November 1, 2018. The $ 600,000 was payable to the Debtor in three promissory notes in the amount of $ 200,000 each, which were to be executed by each of three defendants in the case. The Trustee alleges that the sums paid as a result of the Hillman Lawsuit were not paid to Debtor, but instead paid to the BHT at Debtor's direction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Trustee asserts four causes of action with respect to the payment of the Hillman Lawsuit proceeds to the BHT:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   1.

Specifically, the BHT Trustee asserts that the cause of action does not indicate whether the Trustee is alleging that such transfer was done with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud under \u00a7 548(a)(1)(A) or whether such transfer was a constructively fraudulent transfer under \u00a7 548(a)(1)(B). Moreover, to the extent that the Trustee alleges such a transfer was done with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud, the BHT Trustee argues that the Trustee's Original Complaint fails to satisfy Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) because the Trustee\n   does not allege facts establishing \"how\" and \"why\" the transfers were made with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud. Finally, to the extent the Trustee alleges such a transfer was a constructively fraudulent transfer under \u00a7 548(a)(1)(B), the BHT Trustee contends that the Trustee has failed to allege facts to support an allegation of insolvency as required under \u00a7 548(a)(1)(B)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   It is the Trustee's position that by alleging a cause of action under \u00a7 548(a)(1), the Trustee is providing fair notice that the Trustee is pursuing claims under both \u00a7 548(a)(1)(A) and (B). As to whether the Trustee has met the heightened pleading standard for his claim under \u00a7 548(a)(1)(A), the Trustee asserts that he has met such standard because the Trustee has plead with specificity at least three badges of fraud. Finally, with respect to the pleading of insolvency for purposes of a constructive fraud claim, the Trustee asserts that he has plead insolvency by stating that the Cyrs contemplated bankruptcy for more than a year and had gone as far as preparing and signing a proposed, joint chapter 11 petition. By pleading such facts, the Trustee asserts an inference can be made that the Cyrs were insolvent. The Trustee requests, however, that to the extent the Court disagrees with the Trustee, the Court order these claims to be replead rather than dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

The provision provides two bases by which the Trustee may avoid a qualifying transfer: actual fraud and constructive fraud. While each form of fraud shares common elements, the forms of fraud are distinguished by how fraud is proven. A transfer made with actual fraud involves a transfer made with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20548\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 548(a)(1)(A). On the other hand, a constructively fraudulent transfer is a transfer (1) which the debtor received less than\n   reasonably equivalent value in exchange for such transfer (2) made while the debtor experienced a form of statutorily-enumerated financial condition.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20548\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 548(a)(1)(B). Here, the Trustee does not identify specific allegations under Count 2 (other than logistical facts of the transaction) which allows the Court to draw a reasonable inference that the Trustee is pursuing actual and constructive fraud claims. For example, in response to other arguments, the Trustee asserts it has properly plead insolvency for a constructively fraudulent transfer claim. To prevail on a constructively fraudulent transfer claim, the Trustee must prove insolvency on the date of the transfer.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20548\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 548(a)(1)(B)(ii)(I). The Trustee alleges no facts regarding Debtors insolvency on the date of each transfer. Moreover, the Trustee's Original Complaint is comprised of 11 Counts which each contain multiple causes of action. For purposes of clarity and transparency, the Court agrees with the BHT Trustee that the Trustee's Original Complaint should be plead with more specificity as to which cause(s) of action under \u00a7 548(a)(1) the Trustee intends to pursue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    c.

Therefore, a cause of action for actual fraud involves both a pleading of the circumstances surrounding the transfer and conditions of a debtor's mind. As to the circumstances founding the transfer, the Trustee must plead with specificity that Debtor transferred an interest of the debtor in property or incurred an obligation within two years before the filling of a petition-the who, what, and when. Under Rule 9(b), the conditions of Debtor's mind, however, are not subject to such heightened pleading standard and the Trustee need only plead actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a present or future creditor generally-with factual allegations that show that relief is plausible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Iqbal\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 677-78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"It is true that Rule 9(b) requires particularity when pleading 'fraud or mistake,' while allowing '[m]alice, intent, knowledge, and other conditions of a person's mind [to] be alleged generally.'

Rule 9 merely excuses a party from pleading discriminatory intent under an elevated pleading standard. It does not give him license to evade the less rigid-though still operative-strictures of Rule 8.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The BHT Trustee argues that the Trustee's Original Complaint fails to satisfy Rule 9(b) because the Trustee does not allege facts establishing the \"how\" and \"why\" the transfers were made with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud. The Court does not agree that this is the proper inquiry. First, as previously noted, the heightened standard for pleading the circumstances of alleged fraud is context-specific and depends on the elements of the claim at hand. At the at the most, the Trustee need only allege the who, what, when, where and how the alleged fraud was perpetrated; facts alleging\n   <em>\n    why\n   </em>\n   the alleged fraud was perpetrated is not required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Second, to the extent that the Trustee must allege the \"how\" element, the Court does not agree that the Trustee must allege how the transfer was made with actual intent to hinder, delay, and defraud. As previously explained, Rule 7009(b) distinguishes between pleading the circumstances of the alleged fraud and the conditions of the defendant's mind at the time of the alleged fraud. Thus, the heightened standard requiring the specifics of the \"who, what, when, where, and how\" of the alleged fraud applies to the circumstances surrounding the fraud, not the conditions of the defendant's mind at the time of the alleged fraud. Therefore, to the extent that the Trustee needs to plead the how element, the Trustee need only plead the logistics of the transfer-for example, how the transfer was executed or the means by which the transfer occurred-not how the transfer was made with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   While the Court does not agree that the BHT Trustee's inquiry is the correct inquiry, the Court finds it necessary to interpret her argument broadly and therefore will address it accordingly. Under a broad interpretation of the BHT Trustee's argument, the BHT Trustee alleges that the Trustee did not plead how the transfer occurred. As previously discussed, the heightened standard for pleading the circumstances of alleged fraud is context-specific and depends on the elements of the claim at hand.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Buckley\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518235\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/900/640/#p647\">\n    900 F.3d at 647\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that \" Rule 9(b)'s particularity requirements are tied to the elements of fraud\" (citing\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Grubbs\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3642790\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/565/180/#p188\">\n    565 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   188-89 )).

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11). Moreover, the Trustee asserts that the Debtor and Le Ann Cyr have utilized the BHT to assemble and hold considerable assets and generate considerable income. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12). The Trustee also alleges that Debtor and Le Ann Cyr, both individually and as Trustees of the BHT have enjoyed unfettered access to the assets and income of the BHT, and routinely disregard the terms and restrictions of the BHT, whenever it suits them to do so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13). Finally, the Trustee alleges that on or about August 1, 2017, the BHT Advisor,\n   Mr. Norbert Gonzales, Jr., removed Debtor as Trustee of the BHT. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   With respect to \"the retention of possession, benefit or use of the property in question by the Cyrs,\" the Trustee alleges that Debtor and Le Ann Cyr have utilized the BHT to hold ownership interests in businesses and profit-making endeavors and made themselves employees of entities owned by the BHT (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11) and that both have enjoyed unfettered access to the assets and income of the BHT, and routinely disregard the terms and restrictions of the BHT, whenever it suits them to do so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13). The Court can reasonably infer that such alleged unfettered access to the BHT results in Debtor benefiting and using assets transferred to the BHT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Trustee also argues that it asserted factual allegations demonstrating that transfers to the BHT were made during a time when the Cyrs were contemplating bankruptcy. The Trustee alleges that the Cyrs contemplated bankruptcy for more than a year prior to filing chapter 7 bankruptcy on January 20, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16). The Trustee also asserts that as of January 7, 2017, Debtor and Le Ann Cyr had gone as far as preparing and signing a proposed, joint chapter 11 petition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Trustee does not specify which badge of fraud is manifested by such factual allegations and it is not clear to the Court which badge of fraud these facts are intended to support. At least two badges of fraud deal with the financial condition of the Debtor at the time of the transfer; however, the Court is not convinced that the Trustee has properly plead facts demonstrating either badge of fraud. For example, one badge of fraud involves the financial condition of the party sought to be charged both before and after the transaction in question. The Trustee has not asserted any facts alleging the financial condition of Debtor before each transfer. The Court is not convinced that contemplating bankruptcy and/or filing bankruptcy is sufficient to demonstrate the status of Debtor's financial condition. As acknowledged below, individuals seek protections provided by the Bankruptcy Code for a myriad of reasons, not solely because they are experiencing financial ruin. The second badge of fraud dealing with a debtor's financial condition involves the existence or cumulative effect of the pattern or series of transactions or course of conduct after the onset of financial difficulties. Again, the Court is not convinced that contemplating and/or filing bankruptcy is sufficient to demonstrate that Debtor was experiencing financial difficulties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   As previously noted, while it is not necessary that all or any one of the badges of fraud be established to support a finding of actual fraudulent intent by the debtor, more than one badge of fraud must be shown to establish actual fraudulent intent.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re Think3, Inc.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4117212\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/529/147/#p198\">\n    529 B.R. at 198\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At most, the Trustee has properly plead two of six badges of fraud: the family, friendship or close associate relationship between Debtor and the BHT and the retention of possession, benefit or use of the property in question by the Cyrs. To establish actual fraudulent intent under \u00a7 548(a)(1)(A), such intent must include intent to hinder, delay, or defraud present or future creditors. The Trustee does not allege any facts indicating that creditors were pursuing claims against Debtor at the time of or after the transfers were made. Without the allegations that such creditors existed, there can be intent to hinder, delay, or defraud present or future creditors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   As such, the Court finds that\n   the Trustee has not properly plead an intent to defraud for purposes of an actual fraudulent transfer claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    d.

Moreover, the Trustee asserts that this would indicate that the Cyrs believed they were insolvent, from which an inference of insolvency can be drawn. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   As Counsel for the Trustee conceded at the oral hearing, individuals file bankruptcy for reasons other than being insolvent. Therefore, the fact that the Cyrs contemplated bankruptcy prior to filing bankruptcy on January 20, 2018 does not necessary mean the Cyrs were insolvent. Moreover, \"insolvent\" is a defined term under the Code. Section 101(32)(A) describes an individual as insolvent when the sum of the individual's debts is greater than the individual's assets. The Code's definition of insolvency excludes both (1) \"property transferred, concealed, or removed with intent to hinder, delay or defraud such [individual's] creditors;\" and (2) the debtor's exempt property.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (32)(A). The Trustee presented no allegations regarding the value of the Cyr's debt relative to the value of the Cyr's assets at the time the transfers were made.

To prevail on such claim, the Trustee must properly plead four elements: (1) a transfer to a self-settled trust or similar device made on or within 10 years before the date of the filing of the petition; (2) a transfer by the debtor; (3) debtor is a beneficiary; and (4) debtor made the transfer with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors. The BHT Trustee asserts that the Trustee's claim's under \u00a7 548(e)(1) are barred as a matter of law because the assets transferred by Debtor are not self-settled assets under Texas law and therefore not subject to the claims of creditors. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   First, the plain language of \u00a7 548(e)(1) does not look to whether assets transferred to a self-settled trust or similar device are self-settled under state law. Section 548(e)(1) is completely devoid of any reference to non-bankruptcy law. Therefore, the requirements contained in the statute itself, not state law, determine whether the transfer of a particular asset is subject to a trustee's avoidance power under \u00a7 548(e)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Second, even if this Court were to define the term \"self-settled trust\" according to state law and the assets transferred by Debtor to the BHT are not self-settled under the Trust Code, the plain language of \u00a7 548(e)(1) permits avoidance of transfers made to self-settled trusts\n   <em>\n    or similar devices\n   </em>\n   . The Court agrees with the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Avers\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   court that \u00a7 548(e)(1) contemplates a broad application and applies to trusts or devices intended to shield assets from creditors, such as spendthrift trusts, where the debtor-beneficiary transfers assets to such device with an actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud present or future creditors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Finally, in this Court's opinion, \u00a7 548(e)(1) respects the rights of states who choose to shield self-settled assets from creditors and those states which do not. At common law, self-settled trusts were unlawful as a matter of public policy, and as the Fifth Circuit recognized in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Shurley\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , Texas has adopted such public policy:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   Public policy does not countenance devices by which one frees his own property from liability for his debts or restricts his power of alienation of it; and it is accordingly universally recognized that one cannot settle upon himself a spendthrift or other protective trust, or purchase such a trust from another, which will be effective to protect either the income or the corpus against the claims of his creditors, or to free it from his own power of alienation. The rule applies in respect of both present and future creditors and irrespective of any fraudulent intent in the settlement or purchase of a trust.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re Shurley\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"440221,11977887\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/115/333/\">\n    115 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   338 (citing\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Glass v.

To prevail under \u00a7 548(e)(1), a trustee must also prove an actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud present and future creditors. Absent such intent, whether a creditor can reach self-settled assets to satisfy their claims is determined by state law, and not the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The Court notes that a majority of the Parties' briefing was spent analyzing whether assets contributed by Debtor to the BHT were self-settled assets under Texas law. Because the finds that the Trust Code is not relevant for purposes of determining whether an asset is subject to the Trustee's avoidance powers under \u00a7 548(e)(1), the Court need not decide the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

The BHT Trustee does not contend that the assets at issue fall under any of the three categories of excluded assets. Instead, the BHT Trustee contends that because the plain language of section 112.035(g) prohibits the Court from deeming any property contributed by Debtor to the BHT as property contributed by a settlor, such property is not subject to avoidance. The Court disagrees. TUFTA distinctly identifies three categories of property which are not subject to avoidance for purposes of TUFTA; whether or not property is self-settled or not self-settled for purposes of the Trust Code's spendthrift provisions is not an enumerated basis for exclusion under TUFTA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

The Trustee also alleges that contemporaneously with the closing, Debtor and his spouse executed a Note in the amount of $ 1,680,000 to Broadway National Bank and a deed of trust granting Broadway Bank National Bank a lien on the Lake House.

In response, the BHT Trustee's counsel at the time filed a response whereby he represented on behalf of the BHT Trustee that the proceeds of the sale, except the first lien and usual closing expenses, will be retained by the BHT.

While the Trustee does not expressly incorporate the allegations under Count 4 into Count 5, the Court would be remiss to not consider the factual allegations and causes of action under Count 4 when determining whether a claim for relief exists under Count 5. The Court, however, agrees with Le Ann Cyr inasmuch as that if the Trustee does not prevail under Count 4, the Trustee's cause of action under Count 5 is not tenable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   As of the date of this Order, Count 4 has one remaining cause of action under TUFTA. The BHT Trustee moved to dismiss the Trustee's TUFTA claim under Count 4 on the basis that the Trust Code insulates Debtor's conveyances to BHT from creditors' reach. The Court rejected this argument. Because Count 4 has one remaining cause of action under which the Trustee could potentially prevail, dismissal of Count 5 is premature.

According to the Trustee's allegations, this property is property belonging to Oracle. The Trustee identifies\n   Oracle as an LLC and identifies the BHT as Oracle's owner. (ECF No. 61, \u00b6 38). As previously explained, in Texas, \"[a] member of a limited liability company ... does not have an interest in any specific property of the company.\" Bus. Org. Code \u00a7 101.106(b). Therefore, as a member of Oracle, the BHT had no interest in the assets and business transferred from Oracle to S &amp; L BHT.

The BHT Trustee's also seeks to dismiss Count 5 for the same reasons.
