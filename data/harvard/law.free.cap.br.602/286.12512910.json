On July 18, 2017, the sheriff of Essex County sold property located at 69-71 Stockman Place, Irvington, New Jersey (the \"Property\"), to 69-71 Stockman Place LLC (the \"LLC\") for $ 143,000. Doc. No. 17, \u00b6 8. More than 10 days later, on August 14, 2017, the debtor filed a motion with the New Jersey Superior Court to set aside the sale as defective because she did not receive notice of the sale. Doc. No. 17, \u00b6 7. The sheriff's deed has not yet been transferred. Doc. No. 17, \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 8, 2017, the debtor filed the instant chapter 11 case. On April 10, 2018, she commenced this adversary proceeding, and on February 1, 2019 she filed the Amended Complaint. Doc. No. 17. The debtor alleged that \"Before the purported, but invalid, Sheriff's sale of the Property occurred, the Debtor was prepared to commence a bankruptcy proceeding to stay the purported Sheriff's sale from proceeding. Before, at and after the occurrence of the purported, but invalid, Sheriff's sale of the Property, the Debtor was also prepared to obtain a satisfaction of the mortgage that relates to the foreclosure action with respect to the Property.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 14.

She alleged that the sale occurred within two years before the filing of her bankruptcy case, she received less than reasonably equivalent value, and she was insolvent or became insolvent as a result of the transfer.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20548\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 17. In addition to avoiding the transfer, the debtor seeks an order from this court requiring HSBC to accept $ 143,000 from the debtor rather than the $ 261,933 plus interest owed under the judgment because that is what it accepted from the LLC in full satisfaction of the mortgage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20548\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   HSBC filed the instant Motion to Dismiss on February 8, 2019.

It then argued that the sale was conducted in compliance with New Jersey law as HSBC in fact did provide the debtor with notice of the adjourned sale.

She repeated that \"had the Debtor received such notice, the Debtor would have commenced this Chapter 11 case before such purported sale could have proceeded.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147304\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/531/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , p.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Motion to dismiss standard\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   HSBC seeks dismissal of the Amended Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6),\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   incorporated into adversary proceedings by Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7012, for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.

The\n   <em>\n    BFP\n   </em>\n   Court was concerned with irregularities that hamper the exchange of reasonably equivalent value in exchange for property. \"How closely the price received in a forced sale is likely to approximate fair market value depends upon the terms of the forced sale-how quickly it may be made, what sort of public notice must be given, etc.\"\n   <em>\n    BFP\n   </em>\n   , at 540,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147304,6534573\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/114/1757/\">\n    114 S.Ct. 1757\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   One of my colleagues explained the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    BFP\n   </em>\n   as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Focusing on the manner in which foreclosed property is sold, the [Supreme] Court canvassed state foreclosure procedures, noting that foreclosure laws, in addition to providing notice to the borrower, typically require publication of a notice of sale, and \"strict adherence to prescribed bidding rules and auction procedures.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 542,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147304,6534573\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/114/1757/\">\n    114 S.Ct. 1757\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .... Presumably, by these comments, the Court was opining that state procedures are designed to solicit prospective purchasers and control auction processes in order to maximize the value achieved at such sales. The Court recognized the difficulty of valuing a property that must be sold within the strictures of state-prescribed foreclosure procedures, noting that \"property that\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   be sold within those strictures is simply\n   <em>\n    worth less.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 539,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147304,6534573\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/114/1757/\">\n    114 S.Ct. 1757\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ...

D.N.J. 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As will be discussed below, New Jersey's foreclosure laws do not require notice to the borrower of adjournments. Thus, the state's foreclosure laws were complied with here. But more importantly, the debtor has not proffered any authority for the proposition that a sale made\n   <em>\n    without notice to her\n   </em>\n   caused the sale price to fall below reasonably equivalent value. The court in\n   <em>\n    In re Ryker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9059160\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/301/156/\">\n    301 B.R. 156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.N.J. 2003), considered whether a \"defect in the Notice of Sale was of such a magnitude that it chilled competitive bidding, thwarted the purpose of foreclosure sales in New Jersey, and, as a result, violated New Jersey foreclosure law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9059160\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/301/156/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at 166. In\n   <em>\n    Ryker\n   </em>\n   , the issue was whether potential bidders had sufficient notice of a reduced amount to satisfy the foreclosure judgment. Here, the debtor acknowledges that a third party purchased the property, thus there was some competitive bidding as opposed to HSBC purchasing the property. She does not allege that, had she had notice, she would have bid more than the LLC did. Rather, she alleges that she would have attempted to further adjourn the sale and then file bankruptcy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Additionally, the debtor did not allege a value of the property that exceeds $ 143,000 to support that it was sold for less than reasonably equivalent value. Her request to pay $ 143,000 to HSBC suggests that she believes $ 143,000 is the true value, meaning that reasonably equivalent value was exchanged. She also failed to allege facts supporting that she was insolvent or became insolvent as a result of the transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Thus, the debtor failed to state a claim for relief under section 548(a)(1)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Vacate the sheriff's sale on state law equitable grounds\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Though neither New Jersey statute nor its Court Rules require re-advertising or re-posting of an adjourned sheriff's sale,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. \u00a7 2A:61-5, 61-6; N.J. Court Rules 4:65-2, 65-3, 65-4, both parties here recognize that equity can sometimes support vacating a sale to prevent injustice. \"This form of judicial interference is warranted only when necessary to correct a plain injustice; that is to say, where it would be inequitable and unjust not to set aside the sale due to fraud, accident, surprise, mistake or irregularities in the conduct of the sale.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Ryker\n   </em>\n   , at 167.
