About five years later, she filed a chapter 13 case; she obtained an order valuing at zero the junior lien held by Option One Mortgage Corporation, serviced by Appellee Real Time Resolutions, Inc. (\"RTR\"). RTR filed an unsecured claim in the full amount of the debt it believed it was owed; Ms. Washington objected on the ground that her personal liability had been discharged. The bankruptcy court overruled the objection, concluding that the discharge did not fully eliminate the claim and that the plain language of \u00a7 506(a) required the allowance of RTR's unsecured claim in the amount of $307,049.79.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We REVERSE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2012, Ms. Washington obtained a chapter 7 discharge, eliminating her personal liability on a debt secured by a second deed of trust on her residence in Corona, California. In June 2017, Ms. Washington filed this chapter 13 case. In her schedules, she valued her residence at $410,000, encumbered by a first mortgage in favor of Wells Fargo Home Mortgage in the amount of $577,069.53 and a second deed of trust in favor of RTR in the amount of $174,000. She then filed a \"Motion to Avoid Junior Lien on Principal Residence,\" seeking to have RTR's lien valued at zero.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   RTR did not oppose the motion, and the bankruptcy court granted it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the same hearing, the court confirmed Ms. Washington's chapter 13 plan, which provided for payment of 100 percent to holders of allowed general unsecured claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Thereafter, RTR filed a proof of claim, asserting a secured debt of $307,049.79. Ms. Washington filed an objection to RTR's claim in which she asserted that the claim needed to be amended or withdrawn because Ms. Washington had discharged the debt to RTR in her chapter 7 case. RTR did not file a response, but it amended its proof of claim to reclassify the claim as unsecured. After a hearing, the court issued a memorandum decision and order overruling Ms. Washington's objection and allowing RTR's claim as amended.\n   <em>\n    In re Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12511928\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/587/349/\">\n    587 B.R. 349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. C.D. Cal. 2018). The court found that the plain language of \u00a7 506(a)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   requires that the valuation of a lien under that section\n   <strong>\n    must\n   </strong>\n   result in an unsecured claim that had to be provided for in the chapter 13 plan. The court noted that there was a split of authority on the issue but found persuasive the cases holding that even where a debtor had discharged her personal liability on a secured claim in a chapter 7 case, a creditor whose lien was valued at zero in a subsequent chapter 13 case was entitled to an unsecured claim.\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Akram\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11120156\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/259/371/\">\n    259 B.R. 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. C.D. Cal. 2001).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The court also noted that the language of the Central District of California's form motion and order for valuation of a lien supported its conclusion. The form motion used by Ms. Washington, dated December 2012, included the following language: \"Respondent's claim on the junior position lien\n   <strong>\n    shall be allowed as a nonpriority general unsecured claim\n   </strong>\n   in the amount per the filed Proof of Claim.\" (Emphasis added.) The form order granting the motion, dated December 2013, states: \"The claim of the junior lienholder is to be treated as an unsecured claim and\n   <strong>\n    is to be paid through the plan pro rata with all other unsecured\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    claims\n   </strong>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Accordingly, the court concluded that RTR was entitled to an allowed unsecured claim for the entire amount of the debt. Ms. Washington timely appealed the court's order overruling her objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In November 2018, the bankruptcy court dismissed Ms. Washington's case for failure to submit to the chapter 13 trustee copies of her 2017 federal and state tax returns. RTR moved to dismiss the appeal as moot. A BAP motions panel denied the motion to dismiss because the bankruptcy court's decision as to claim allowance could have preclusive effect in a future proceeding with respect to the claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bevan v.

If the lien is determined to be wholly unsecured (i.e., if the value of the property less senior liens leaves no equity to which the junior lien may attach), the court values the lien at zero.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under \u00a7 506(a), the valuation of that lien results in an unsecured claim for the full amount owed.

Relying on that holding, the\n   <em>\n    Gounder\n   </em>\n   court reasoned that even though the creditor could not enforce its claim against the debtor personally, as of the petition date it retained its right to satisfy its claim against the debtor's property, which had become property of the estate.\n   <em>\n    In re Gounder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9500811\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/266/879/\">\n    266 B.R. at 881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 101(10) defines the term \"creditor\" as an entity \"(A) ... that has a claim against the debtor that arose at the time of or before the order for relief concerning the debtor; (B) ... that has a claim against the estate of a kind specified in section 348(d), 502(f), 502(g), 502(h) or 502(I) of this title; or (C) ... that has a community claim.\" All the creditors at issue in\n   <em>\n    Akram,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gounder\n   </em>\n   , and herein fall squarely-and only-within \u00a7 101(10)(A). There is no language in \u00a7 506(a) which suggests otherwise. In other words, if these creditors do not have an allowable unsecured claim against the Chapter 13 debtor, they do not have an allowable unsecured claim that must be paid through the Chapter 13 plan. Moreover, Congress knows how to turn a nonrecourse claim into a recourse obligation (see \u00a7 1111(b)(1)), and no such text can be found in \u00a7 506(a)(1).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4309737\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/521/337/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4309737\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/521/337/\">\n    at 341-42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The court also observed that its decision did not run afoul of\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   because the Supreme Court in that case did not mandate that the in rem claim becomes an allowed unsecured claim if a \u00a7 506(a) motion renders the secured claim valueless.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4309737\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/521/337/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4309737\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/521/337/\">\n    at 342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Importantly, this Panel has held that, for eligibility purposes, debts for which in personam liability has been discharged in a prior chapter 7 case cannot be counted toward the unsecured debt limitation of \u00a7 109(e).\n   <em>\n    Free v.

BAP 2015). Although\n   <em>\n    Free\n   </em>\n   deals with eligibility, its analysis is on point with the issue raised here. In that case, the debtors had received a chapter 7 discharge and then filed a chapter 13 case, intending to strip off two junior liens from their real property. The bankruptcy court granted the chapter 13 trustee's motion to dismiss the case because debtors' unsecured debts, including the two wholly unsecured junior liens, exceeded the statutory limit of \u00a7 109(e). The Panel reversed and remanded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Observing that \u00a7 101(12) defines a \"debt\" as \"liability on a claim,\" and \u00a7 101(5)(A) defines a \"claim\" as a \"right to payment,\" the Panel concluded that there could be no unsecured debt unless the creditor has a right to payment on an unsecured basis. Because \u00a7 524 provides that the discharge operates as an injunction against enforcement of a debt as a personal liability of the debtor, the creditor has no right to payment and thus has no claim. Accordingly, \"debts that were discharged in chapter 7 are not 'unsecured debts' \" for purposes of \u00a7 109(e).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4362922\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/542/492/#p497\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4362922\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/542/492/#p497\">\n    at 496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Panel concluded that the bankruptcy court had misread\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , observing that the Supreme Court had made only one determination, that \"the\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   right to proceeds from a sale of its collateral meant the secured creditor held a claim which could be addressed in a chapter 13\n   plan.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4362922\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/542/492/#p497\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4362922\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/542/492/#p497\">\n    at 497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Panel further noted that the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   had actually confirmed that the effect of the chapter 7 discharge was to extinguish the debtor's in personam liability.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4362922\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/542/492/#p497\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Notably, the\n   <em>\n    Free\n   </em>\n   Panel observed that the \"well-reasoned decision of the bankruptcy court\" in\n   <em>\n    Rosa\n   </em>\n   supported its opinion. The Panel restated the\n   <em>\n    Rosa\n   </em>\n   court's analysis as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   The [\n   <em>\n    Rosa\n   </em>\n   ] court observed that although \u00a7 101(5)(A) defines a claim and \u00a7 506(a) prescribes how a secured claim is to be treated, neither determined whether such claim was allowed for payment purposes. That determination was to be made if an objection was filed under \u00a7 502(b), as the debtor filed here. Because the personal liability had been discharged in the prior chapter 7, the court applied the discharge injunction provided by \u00a7 524(a)(2) to come to the unremarkable conclusion that no allowed claim remained for payment purposes in the chapter 13.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4362922\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/542/492/#p497\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4362922\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/542/492/#p497\">\n    at 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the bankruptcy court here skipped, as did the cases it relied on, a critical step in determining the status of the unsecured claim. Once the bankruptcy court valued the secured claim at zero under \u00a7 506(a), it concluded that the remaining unsecured claim was automatically an allowed claim in the chapter 13 case. But in light of Ms. Washington's claim objection, the court was required to consider whether the unsecured claim was enforceable against the debtor. Because it was not, the claim should have been disallowed. There is simply no statutory basis for resurrecting the debtor's personal liability or for treating the claim as a claim against the estate.\n   <em>\n    In re Rosa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4309737\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/521/337/\">\n    521 B.R. at 339, 342-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And the lien claim against property of the estate was conditionally avoided through the valuation motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   RTR argues that we cannot consider\n   <em>\n    Free\n   </em>\n   because Ms. Washington did not cite that case in the bankruptcy court. While we generally do not consider arguments not made to the bankruptcy court, there is an exception to that rule when the issue is purely one of law, and the opposing party will suffer no prejudice as a result of the failure to address the issue in the bankruptcy court.\n   <em>\n    Enewally v.

Those criteria are met here, and RTR does not allege otherwise. RTR also attempts to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Free\n   </em>\n   on grounds that it is an eligibility case. But RTR points to no part of the\n   <em>\n    Free\n   </em>\n   analysis that cannot logically be applied to the facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   We also reject the notion that the bankruptcy court's form motion and order play any part in the analysis. As noted, the forms used by Ms. Washington to value RTR's lien contained language requiring the unsecured portion of a bifurcated claim to be \"allowed\" (motion) and \"paid\" (order) as an unsecured claim under the chapter 13 plan. But local rules and forms must be consistent with the Bankruptcy Code and may not enlarge, abridge, or modify any substantive right.\n   <em>\n    Sigma Micro Corp. v.
