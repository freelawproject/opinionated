Michael Halfenger, Chief United States Bankruptcy Judge\n   In May 2018 James Raders sued debtor Michael Frantz in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida (the \"District Court\"). Raders alleges that in March 2016 Frantz convinced him to invest more than $3 million with Frantz through two limited liability companies Frantz purportedly controls. The investment was a bust, says Raders; Frantz bamboozled him.

A final count alleges that Frantz Ventures, L.L.C. is the alter ego of Michael Frantz and seeks a \"judgment piercing the corporate veil of Frantz Ventures, L.L.C. and making Mike Frantz responsible for any and all liabilities of such entity.\" ECF No. 14-2, at 21.

Raders sued Frantz for $3 million in damages arising out an alleged investment deal in Florida. Exhibit F to Raders's complaint shows litigation against Frantz by other creditors apparently arising out of other transactions in other parts of the country. See ECF No. 14-2, 57-124 (purporting to show a pending action against Frantz in Cook County, Illinois; 3 pending actions and an outstanding judgment in Johnson County, Iowa; and an outstanding judgment in Linn County, Iowa); see also\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 63-66 (alleging breach of contract by Frantz and seeking more than $4 million in damages in Cook County Circuit Court). Frantz's bankruptcy schedules list more than $38 million in non-priority unsecured claims and less than $4 million in assets. ECF No. 11, at 8 &amp; 32. His statement of financial affairs states that within a year before filing for bankruptcy he was a defendant in three actions that were still pending when he filed his bankruptcy petition, including Raders's action in the District Court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42.\n  </history>\n<p id=\"p-23\">\n   Beyond all this, Raders has suggested that he intends to pursue litigation against Frantz in the bankruptcy court to\n   seek a declaration that Frantz's debt to him arises out of fraud and thus should be adjudged nondischargeable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). Section 523(c) requires Raders to litigate his nondischargeability claim in the bankruptcy court. And if Raders intends to participate in the bankruptcy trustee's liquidation and distribution of Frantz's assets, Raders will have to file a claim in this court. Adjudication of any dispute over the validity of that claim is a part of the claims-allowance process-a core bankruptcy undertaking. What is more, the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure authorize the bankruptcy court to adjudicate claim allowance and claim nondischargeability in a single adversary proceeding. See Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3007(b) &amp; 7001(6). Thus, only in this court can Raders fully adjudicate his claim against Frantz.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-24\">\n   2\n  </p>\n<history id=\"p-25\">\n   Raders argues that cause exists to grant relief from the stay because the District Court has been presiding over his claim for some time and completion of adjudication there would simplify the adjudication of claims here. Raders relies on\n   <em>\n    IBM v. Fernstrom Storage and Van Co. (In re Fernstrom Storage and Van Co.)\n   </em>\n   , which applies a three-factor test \"for determining whether 'cause' exists\" to modify the stay, asking whether:\n  </history>\n<blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   a) Any great prejudice to either the bankrupt estate or the debtor will result from continuation of the civil suit,\n  </blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   b) the hardship to the [non-bankrupt party] by maintenance of the stay considerably outweighs the hardship of the debtor, and\n  </blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   c) the creditor has a probability of prevailing on the merits.\n  </blockquote>\n<p id=\"p-29\">\n<extracted-citation case-ids=\"6505026,10526492\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/938/731/\">\n    938 F.2d 731\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 735 (7th Cir. 1991) (alteration in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Pro Football Weekly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6119802\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/60/824/#p826\">\n    60 B.R. 824\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 826 (N.D. Ill. 1986) (\"An influential district court opinion ....\")).\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-30\">\n   The circumstances at issue in\n   <em>\n    IBM v. Fernstrom\n   </em>\n   , though, are significantly different from those at issue here. IBM contracted with a warehouse subsidiary of Fernstrom to store computers. A fire at the warehouse destroyed IBM's property. IBM recovered from its insurer. Then IBM (really, IBM's insurer) sued Fernstrom (really, Fernstrom's insurer). Fernstrom and its subsidiary had already filed bankruptcy petitions. Six years of extensive litigation later, Fernstrom sought to dismiss IBM's case against it based on its long-pending bankruptcy case. IBM filed a motion for relief from the automatic stay in the bankruptcy case and stipulated that it would recover only on Fernstrom's insurance policies. The bankruptcy court granted relief from the automatic stay to allow IBM's insurer to continue its civil action. The debtor appealed, and the district court and Seventh Circuit both affirmed. The Seventh Circuit viewed the litigation as being, effectively, against a non-debtor (Fernstrom's insurer) to recover non-estate property (the proceeds of Fernstrom's insurance policies). See\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 736 (\"[D]ebtors-defendants suffer little prejudice when they are sued by plaintiffs who seek nothing more than declarations of liability that can serve as a predicate for a recovery against insurers, sureties, or guarantors.\"). The court concluded that because IBM's non-bankruptcy litigation was at an advanced stage and would not have an economic effect on the reorganizing debtor, the circumstances supported the district court's decision affirming the bankruptcy court's decision to modify the stay to allow IBM's action to proceed.\n  </p>\n<history id=\"p-31\">\n   Here, however, Raders seeks to continue his pursuit of a money judgment against the debtor, Michael Frantz. If\n   Raders were to succeed in that pursuit, he could only collect from Frantz's bankruptcy-estate property by participating in the claims-allowance process in this court or from non-estate property Frantz might acquire in the future, if Raders can prove to the bankruptcy court that the claim is not subject to discharge. In contrast to IBM's pursuit of a claim principally against Fernstrom's insurer, Raders seeks to pursue Frantz's assets in a non-bankruptcy forum-a course contrary to \u00a7 362(a)'s core purposes of \"protect[ing] the debtor from an uncontrollable scramble for its assets in a number of uncoordinated proceedings in different courts\" and \"preclud[ing] one creditor from pursuing a remedy to the disadvantage of other creditors\".\n   <em>\n    Fox Valley Const.

And, unlike the six-year-old litigation in\n   <em>\n    Fernstrom\n   </em>\n   , which had \"spawned extensive discovery and numerous motions\",\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6505026,10526492\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/938/731/\">\n    938 F.2d at 733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the litigation between Raders and Frantz in the District Court is only at the beginning stages of discovery. On top of all this, Raders intends to litigate in the bankruptcy court, as he must, to seek a declaration that Frantz's debt to him is nondischargeable because it is for money obtained by fraud, and it is far more efficient to litigate both the fraud claim itself and the issue of nondischargeability in this court than to have the parties litigate the fraud claim in the District Court and return here to litigate nondischargeability. See\n   <em>\n    In re Chan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3751002\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/355/494/\">\n    355 B.R. 494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 507 n.11 (Bankr. E.D. Pa. 2006).\n  </history>\n<history id=\"p-32\">\n   As a result, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Fernstrom\n   </em>\n   , the totality of the circumstances do not weigh in the creditor's favor here, and the debtor does not bear responsibility for the \"problem\" of having litigation pending in multiple places. While Raders understandably prefers to litigate close to home by his Florida lawyers, the need to litigate in the bankruptcy court is a cost imposed on all creditors and inherent in \u00a7 362(a). Raders invested with entities that he knew were not located in Florida; the potential need to participate in bankruptcy proceedings elsewhere was a risk inherent in that undertaking. More important, Raders's suit against the debtor is the very type of litigation that the \u00a7 362(a) stay is designed to stop. Raders has not shown that cause exists to modify that stay to allow him to continue his District Court litigation against Frantz.\n  </history>\n<p id=\"p-33\">\n   III\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-34\">\n   A\n  </p>\n<history id=\"p-35\">\n   Raders alternatively asks this court for \"an order confirming that Dr. Raders and his attorneys may depose the Debtor as a member of [Frantz Community Investors, L.L.C. and Frantz Ventures, L.L.C.] in connection with the Florida Federal Court Litigation\". ECF No. 14, at 10. He seeks this relief because, although the District Court has allowed the litigation in Florida to proceed against these companies, Frantz contends that efforts to compel him to testify offend the automatic stay.\n  </history>\n<p id=\"p-36\">\n   Raders's request that the court \"confirm that the automatic stay does not prevent [him] ... from deposing the Debtor in connection with the Florida Federal Court litigation as to the limited liability company Non-Debtor Defendants therein\",\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11, is too amorphous to adjudicate. Raders does not present a notice of deposition or other discovery to which Frantz has objected and over which the parties are at loggerheads regarding application of the stay. He simply poses in the abstract the question of whether he can seek discovery against Frantz as a member of the company defendants.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-37\">\n   B\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-38\">\n   1\n  </p>\n<history id=\"p-39\">\n   The \u00a7 362(a) stay generally does not bar actions against non-debtors.

So, the stay in Frantz's case does not necessarily bar Raders from giving notice of depositions under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 30(b)(6) naming the Frantz companies as deponents. Rule 30(b)(6), though, requires the deponent (i.e., the company) to \"designate one or more officers, directors, or managing agents, or designate other persons who consent to testify on its behalf\", and discovery directed at Frantz-an individual party to the litigation, as well as a potential designee of the Frantz companies under Rule 30(b)(6) -could violate \u00a7 362(a)(1)'s prohibition on the continuation of proceedings against a debtor and, perhaps, the District Court's order allowing the litigation to proceed only against the company defendants.\n  </history>\n<p id=\"p-40\">\n   2\n  </p>\n<history id=\"p-41\">\n   Given the claims in the District Court litigation, forcing Frantz to testify in any capacity may be problematic.\n   <em>\n    Fernstrom\n   </em>\n   and other cases recognize an exception to the general rule that \u00a7 362(a) does not stay litigation against non-debtors \"where 'there is such identity between the debtor and the third-party defendant that the debtor may be said to be the real party defendant and that a judgment against the third-party defendant will in effect be a judgment or finding against the debtor.' \"\n   <em>\n    Fernstrom\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6505026,10526492\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/938/731/\">\n    938 F.2d at 736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    A.H.
