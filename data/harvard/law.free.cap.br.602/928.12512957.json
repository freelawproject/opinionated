Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In November 2014, Plaintiff Carol Kerkhof (\"Mrs. Kerkhof\") was diagnosed with malignant mesothelioma, a terminal cancer associated with asbestos exposure. ECF No. 15-1 at 9. On November 1, 2017, Mrs. Kerkhof and her husband, Stuart Kerkhof, filed suit in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County against a number of defendants, including Johnson &amp; Johnson and Johnson &amp; Johnson Consumer Inc. (collectively, \"J&amp;J\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 2. Plaintiffs allege \"that J&amp;J sold talcum powder products containing asbestos and that Mrs. Kerkhof's regular use of and exposure to J&amp;J's Baby Powder caused her to develop mesothelioma.\" ECF No. 15-1 at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs also named Imerys Talc America, Inc., one of J&amp;J's talc suppliers, as a defendant in the state court action, but the Circuit Court dismissed Imerys for lack of personal jurisdiction on April 19, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10. The Circuit Court also granted summary judgment in favor of all other defendants except J&amp;J.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. In January 2019, the Circuit Court set the case in for a two-week trial against J&amp;J to begin on September 24, 2019.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After having been dismissed from this lawsuit, Imerys Talc America, Inc. and two affiliates (collectively, \"Debtors\") filed a voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.

The Court cannot determine whether indemnification or shared insurance proceeds are necessarily triggered in this case. Indeed, without even a finding of liability on the underlying matter, the Court views any potential for indemnification far too speculative and hypothetical to justify the outcome that J&amp;J seeks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In this respect, and contrary to J&amp;J's contentions (ECF No. 18-2 at 10 n.5),\n   <em>\n    A.H. Robins Co, Inc. v. Piccinin\n   </em>\n   does not compel a different result.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1569624,6124925\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/788/994/\">\n    788 F.2d 994\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There, the Fourth Circuit allowed the stay of claims against non-bankrupt co-defendants. But the Court clarified that such relief was only available in \"unusual circumstances,\" where \"there is such identity between the debtor and the third-party defendant that the debtor may be said to be the real party defendant and that a judgment against the third-party defendant will in effect be a judgment or finding against the debtor.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1569624,6124925\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/788/994/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1569624,6124925\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/788/994/\">\n    at 999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Such an identity of relationship is missing here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   J&amp;J solely argues that because Debtors were the exclusive suppliers of the talc, J&amp;J has demonstrated a sufficiently strong relationship to confer \"related to\" jurisdiction. ECF No. 18-2 at 10. The Court disagrees. Debtors are no longer parties to this action, and yet the Montgomery County Circuit Court found that trial against J&amp;J can and will proceed. Furthermore, the Kerkhofs have brought independent claims against J&amp;J, including J&amp;J's alleged failure to warn and negligence in testing, manufacturing, and marketing the talcum powder products which allegedly caused Mrs. Kerkhof's mesothelioma.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 2 \u00b6 56. Most, if not all, of these claims do not implicate the Debtors or depend on Debtor liability. On this record, J&amp;J has not convinced this Court that it meets the requirements of\n   <em>\n    AH Robins\n   </em>\n   . Remand is therefore warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Remand on Equitable Grounds\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Alternatively, even if J&amp;J could establish \"related to\" jurisdiction, the Court deems remand appropriate on equitable grounds pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201452\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

In determining the propriety of equitable remand, courts in this District have considered a variety of factors, including:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (1) the effect on the efficient administration of the bankruptcy estate; (2) the extent to which issues of state law predominate; (3) the difficulty or unsettled nature of applicable state law; (4) comity; (5) the degree of relatedness or remoteness to the proceeding in the main bankruptcy case; (6) the existence of the right to a jury trial; and (7) prejudice to the involuntarily removed defendants.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    In re Railworks Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5582153\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/345/529/#p540\">\n    345 B.R. 529\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 540-41 (Bankr.

Md. 1998) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The equities here weigh heavily in favor of remand. The Kerkhofs brought claims against J&amp;J in a Maryland court, asserting state law claims which the parties have litigated for over 18 months in that forum. J&amp;J's notice of removal comes in the final months, if not weeks, before trial is to begin. The Kerkhofs, moreover, wish to try this case expeditiously because Mrs. Kerkhof's cancer is terminal. It is understandable, and important to this Court's consideration, that Mrs. Kerkhof maintain her trial date so that she may see this matter to the end, if her health permits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Balanced against the Kerkhofs' significant sacrifices to maintain the current trial date, is J&amp;J's attempt to delay and derail a trial on the merits based on Debtors' bankruptcy. This move is especially troubling when the Court is not at all convinced that a finding against J&amp;J will interfere with the routine administration of the bankruptcy\n   case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Power Plant Entm't Casino Resort Ind., LLC v.
