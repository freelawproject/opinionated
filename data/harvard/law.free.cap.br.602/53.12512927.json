Goldstein's complaint alleges the following facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Jason Zilberbrand is a discharged chapter 7 debtor who ran an aircraft brokerage business called Aurum Jets. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 8, 13, 14, 18). Zilberbrand filed his chapter 7 case in February 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8). Six months later, a creditor, David Gassman, moved to dismiss the case under section 707(a) of the Bankruptcy Code,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20707\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9). The motion was heavily litigated (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10) and eventually led to an evidentiary hearing on March 14 and 15, 2018 (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At the hearing, Zilberbrand appeared and testified about his financial circumstances. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13). Among other things, Zilberbrand testified that (a) the previous year he had made only $53,000 in income; (b) Aurum Jets was out of business; (c) he was not operating any kind of business; (d) he was unemployed; and (e) he was trying to get a consulting job of some kind. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13, 18-19, 25). No one else testified.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on Zilberbrand's uncontested testimony, the bankruptcy court found that Aurum Jets was out of business, Zilberbrand was unemployed, and Zilberbrand had no current source of income. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13). The court therefore denied Gassman's motion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Zilberbrand received his discharge on March 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Zilberbrand's testimony at the March 2018 bankruptcy hearing was false (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15, 33):\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 In June 2017, Aurum Jets or Zilberbrand had received a $97,000 commission on an aircraft sale. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25). Zilberbrand tried to hide the income by having it transferred to his wife's bank account and reporting it as her income on their joint tax return. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 On March 20, 2018, just days before the March 2018 hearing, Zilberbrand had updated his status on his Facebook page to show he was president of something called \"Vref,\" which he described as an \"Aircraft and Helicopter valuation guide.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 In June 2018, three months after the March 2018 hearing, either Zilberbrand or Aurum received a $63,294.80 commission from an aircraft sale. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22). Zilberbrand again tried to hide the income by having it transferred to his wife's bank account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 Meanwhile, Zilberbrand had moved in his divorce case to have the state court modify his child support obligations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11). At a deposition taken in the divorce case after Zilberbrand received his discharge, he confirmed that since March 2018 he had worked for Aerospace Data Solutions as president of Vref. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In January 2019, the state court determined that Zilberbrand had lied to the bankruptcy court at the March 2018 hearing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16, 31). Specifically, the state court found Zilberbrand was \"hiding assets\" from the bankruptcy court because he concealed the two aircraft sales commissions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16, 30-32). This court found Zilberbrand had no income, the state court said, only because it was unaware of the hidden commissions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The trustee in Zilberbrand's bankruptcy case, Ilene Goldstein, first learned of the evidence presented to the state court and the state court's findings the next month. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17, 39). She filed her complaint to revoke his discharge on March 12, 2019, within one year after the discharge was entered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Zilberbrand now moves to dismiss Goldstein's complaint for failure to state a claim. Goldstein opposes the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Zilberbrand's motion will be denied. The complaint states a claim to revoke his discharge - indeed, the question is not a close one. Most of Zilberbrand's arguments for dismissal are not even cognizable under Rule 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Rule 12(b)(6) Standards\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   To survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), a plaintiff's complaint must clear \"two easy-to-clear hurdles.\"\n   <em>\n    E.E.O.C. v.

But it does not work in every case. Here, for example, the fraud that Goldstein alleges in her complaint took place at a hearing on a section 707(a) motion, a hearing held\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the deadline for objections to discharge under section 727(a) but\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the discharge itself.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In a circumstance like this, the third element other courts mention cannot be met because Zilberbrand's fraud would not have supported a section 727(a) objection. By the time the fraud took place, the deadline in Bankruptcy Rule 4004(a) for an objection had passed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Section 727(d)(1) demands only that the debtor have obtained his discharge through \"fraud.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1). Other than a causal relationship with the discharge, it says nothing about the nature of the fraud. The better rule, then, is the one that prevails in this circuit: a plaintiff in a proceeding under section 727(d)(1) must plead and prove two elements, not three.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Goldstein's Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Goldstein's complaint alleges both of the claim's necessary elements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   First, Goldstein alleges that Zilberbrand obtained his discharge by fraud. The fraud consisted of Zilberbrand's false testimony at the March 18 hearing that he had only $53,000 in income during 2017, that his business was defunct, that he was unemployed, and that he was looking for work. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 13, 18-19, 25). In fact, he had made well over $53,000 in 2017, his aircraft brokerage business still appeared to be operating (since he received another commission three months after the March 2018 hearing), and he was not unemployed but was president of an aircraft valuation concern called Vref. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20-23, 25-27). Zilberbrand made these misrepresentations knowingly and with an intent to deceive, even going so far as to hide the commissions by transferring them to his wife. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 23, 27, 33, 37). Although Goldstein does not expressly allege that Zilberbrand would not have received a discharge but for his falsehoods, that is a reasonable inference from her allegations, and reasonable inferences must be drawn in her favor.\n   <em>\n    Trujillo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12521418\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/926/395/#p397\">\n    926 F.3d at 397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Second, Goldstein alleges that she did not know Zilberbrand's testimony was false until after he received his discharge. (Compl. \u00b6 39). The truth appears to have come out in the state court proceeding on Zilberbrand's motion to modify his child support obligation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16, 21, 30-32). At his deposition in November 2018, Zilberbrand admitted he had been working for Vref since March 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21). During the state court hearing in January 2019, it was revealed not only that Zilberbrand had received two commissions from Aurum Jets, one in 2017 and another in\n   2018, but also that he had tried to hide them by transferring the money to his wife's bank account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-23, 26-27). Only in February 2019, after the state court determined that Zilberbrand had lied about his income at the March 2018 hearing and had been \"hiding assets from the bankruptcy court,\" did Goldstein learn of the fraud. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15-16, 30-32, 39). By then, it had been nearly a year since Zilberbrand's discharge. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In short, Goldstein's complaint states a claim. It alleges facts supporting both elements of a claim under section 727(d)(1).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gordon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%202169872\">\n    2009 WL 2169872\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3.

Zilberbrand has no reasonable argument for dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Although he has no reasonable argument, Zilberbrand offers several. They are easily dispatched.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u2022 Zilberbrand asserts that Goldstein's \"sole allegation\" concerns Zilberbrand's 2017 income (Mot. \u00b6 13), and the complaint fails \"to make any allegations of false testimony\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25 (claiming \"the absence of any allegation that the Debtor ever testified falsely\"). Zilberbrand must be reading a different complaint. Goldstein specifically alleges that Zilberbrand testified - and testified falsely - about his 2017 income as well as about his employment status and the status of his business, Aurum Jets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u2022 Zilberbrand disputes Goldstein's allegations on the merits. He argues that the income she describes was not even his (Mot. at \u00b6 16-17) and attaches a 2017 tax return for Aurum Jets (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. A). He adds that Goldstein knew all the relevant facts well before discharge (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15). Zilberbrand insists she cannot prove either element of her claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   None of this matters.

Zilberbrand contends that Gassman brought the section 707(a) motion only because he missed the deadline to object to discharge under section 727(a). (Mot. \u00b6\u00b6 6, 11-12). Having lost on that motion, Zilberbrand says, Gassman is using the adversary proceeding to have the decision reconsidered. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   None of this matters either.
