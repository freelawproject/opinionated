The legislature also included a presumption that \"[p]roperty acquired within 6 months of the filing of the petition for bankruptcy\" was \"acquired in contemplation of bankruptcy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8934312\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/329/848/#p853\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   735 Ill.
