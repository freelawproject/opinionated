FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On September 12, 2014, Kimberly Nicholson (\"Debtor\") filed her voluntary Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. In her Schedule F, Debtor listed Citibank, N.A. (\"Citibank\") as an unsecured, nonpriority, undisputed creditor in the amount of $ 3,821.00 for a revolving consumer credit account with the account number having the last four digits of 1529.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 20, 2015, eCAST Settlement Corporation (\"Claimant\") filed Proof of Claim No. 5 (\"Claim\"). It asserts a claim of $ 3,937.42 for a credit card account which is identified by the last four digits of the account number, 1529. Additionally, attached to the Claim are a Statement of Claim (\"Statement of Claim\"), a Bill of Sale and Assignment between Claimant and Citibank (\"Bill of Sale and Assignment\"), and a pre-petition account statement (\"Account Statement\"), all of which allegedly provide that Citibank assigned the account underlying the Claim to Claimant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On October 22, 2018, Debtor filed her Objection to the Claim (\"Objection\"). In her Objection, Debtor disputes that Citibank assigned her account to Claimant and alleges a lack of documentation for such an assignment. On that same day, Debtor sent a letter, pursuant to Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure (\"Rule\") 3001(c)(3)(B), requesting Claimant produce additional information evidencing the account's underlying contract and assignment, but, allegedly, Claimant's response failed to produce the requested information. Due to this failure, Debtor argues that the Claim should be disallowed pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20502\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   because the Claim is unenforceable under Pennsylvania state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On November 21, 2018, Claimant filed its Answer (\"Answer\"). The Answer contains multiple arguments that the Claim should be allowed. Additionally, Claimant attached a form Affidavit (\"Affidavit\") signed by an employee of Citibank which states that \"the account ending in 1529 was sold to eCAST Settlement Corporation on or about 10/30/2014.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On December 11, 2018, a hearing was held on the Objection to the Claim (\"December 11 Hearing\"). At the December 11 Hearing, Claimant attempted to introduce the Affidavit into evidence to which Debtor objected arguing hearsay. Without ruling on this hearsay objection, Judge Thomas, who was then presiding over this case, set a briefing schedule and took the matter under advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On January 1, 2019, Claimant filed its Brief in Support of its Answer (\"Claimant's Brief\"). On that same day, Debtor filed her Brief in Support of her Objection (\"Debtor's Brief\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On February 13, 2019, this case was reassigned to me due to the untimely passing of Judge John J. Thomas. On March 13, 2019, the parties filed a Joint Statement for the Matter to be Decided Based on the Existing Record. The Objection is now ripe for decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In her Objection, Debtor alleges that Claimant never acquired the right to collect any debt Debtor owed to Citibank, and therefore, the Claim should be disallowed pursuant to \u00a7 502(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code and Pennsylvania state law. Debtor's Obj. to Proof of Claim No. 5 at 1-2, ECF\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   No. 78. In support of her assertion, Debtor provides that she sent Claimant a Rule 3001(c)(3)(B) request demanding that Claimant provide her with the account agreement underlying the Claim and the purported assignment transferring the specific account to Claimant.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20502\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   While Claimant did respond to this request, it was unable to provide the underlying contract between Debtor and Citibank or the assignment of the specific account from Citibank to Claimant. Br. in Supp. of Resp. to Debtor's Obj. to Proof of Claim No. 5 at 11-12, ECF No. 85. Regardless, Claimant brought the following arguments in favor of the allowance of the Claim: (1) the Claim satisfies Rule 3001(c)(3) ; (2) the Claim commands\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   validity; (3) Debtor fails to show a basis for disallowance of the Claim pursuant to \u00a7 502(b)(1)-(9); (4) Claimant complied with Rule 3001(e)(1) in filing its post-petition assignment; (5) the state law theories of recovery of account stated, unjust enrichment, and promissory estoppel support a finding in favor of Claimant; (6) Claimant should not be penalized pursuant to Rule 3001(c)(2)(D) ; and (7) Debtor's scheduling of the debt underlying the Claim is an admission against interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Allowance or disallowance of a proof of claim is governed by \u00a7 502 and Rule 3001.\n   <em>\n    In re Foy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3954074\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/469/209/#p212\">\n    469 B.R. 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 212 (Bankr.

Subsequently, \u00a7 502(b) provides that if a party in interest objects, the court \"shall determine the amount of such claim ... as of the date of the filing of the petition, and shall allow such claim in such amount,\" subject to several exceptions.\n   <em>\n    In re Milbourne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5923447\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/557/376/#p388\">\n    557 B.R. 376\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 388 (Bankr.

Initially, the claimant must allege facts sufficient to support the claim. If the averments in his filed claim meet this standard of sufficiency, it is \"\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   \" valid.\n   <em>\n    In re Holm\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6506210,1801767\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/931/620/\">\n    931 F.2d 620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 623 (9th Cir. 1991) (quoting 3 L. King,\n   <em>\n    Collier on Bankruptcy\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 502.02, at 502-22 (15th ed. 1991)). In other words, a claim that alleges facts sufficient to support a legal liability to the claimant satisfies the claimant's initial obligation to go forward. The burden of going forward then shifts to the objector to produce evidence sufficient to negate the\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   validity of the filed claim. It is often said that the objector must produce evidence equal in force to the\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6506210,1801767\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/931/620/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Windsor Communications Group, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6559060\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/45/770/#p773\">\n    45 B.R. 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 773 (Bankr. E.D. Pa. 1985). In practice, the objector must produce evidence which, if believed, would refute at least one of the allegations that is essential to the claim's legal sufficiency. If the objector produces sufficient evidence to negate one or more of the sworn facts in the proof of claim, the burden reverts to the claimant to prove the validity of the claim by a preponderance of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re WHET, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6112149\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/33/424/#p437\">\n    33 B.R. 424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 437 (Bankr.

To do so, Debtor argues that Claimant's failure to satisfy the requirements under Rule 3001(c)(3)(B) and Rule 3001(c)(1), coupled with Debtor's testimony at the December 11 Hearing, negates the\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   validity of the Claim and therefore disallows the Claim in its entirety unless Claimant can meet its ultimate burden.

Unjust Enrichment\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Under Pennsylvania law, the elements of unjust enrichment are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   (1) benefits conferred on defendant by plaintiff; (2) appreciation of such benefits by defendant; and (3) acceptance and retention of such benefits under such circumstances that it would be inequitable for defendant to retain the benefit without payment of value.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <em>\n    Sovereign Bank v.
