Cruickshank, the plaintiff and chapter 7 trustee of the bankruptcy estate of Blast Fitness Group, LLC (\"BFG\"), seeks damages and injunctive relief against over forty named and dozens of unnamed defendants, including CapeCapital LLC, a Massachusetts limited liability company, whose sole manager is defendant, Harold R. Dixon. CapeCapital was the sole manager of BFG. BFG filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   on January 26, 2016, at which time its debts exceeded $ 16 million. This adversary proceeding was commenced two years after the petition date on January 26, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   CapeCapital has moved under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), per Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7012(b), to dismiss 18 of 23 counts against it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, it seeks dismissal of count I (constructive fraudulent transfer under Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 548(a)(1)(B) ), count II (actual fraudulent transfer under Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 548(a)(1)(A) ), count III (constructive fraudulent transfer under Massachusetts Fraudulent Transfer Act (\"MFTA\") \u00a7 5(a)(2)), count IV (constructive fraudulent transfer under MFTA \u00a7 6(a)), count V (actual fraudulent transfer under MFTA \u00a7 5(a)(1)), count VII (\"turnover\" under Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 550 ),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   count VIII (unjust enrichment), count X (statutory reach and apply/ Bankruptcy Code \u00a7\u00a7 544 and 550 and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mass.%20Gen.%20Laws%20ch.%20214%2C%20%C2%A7%203\">\n    Mass.

It does not seek dismissal of the remaining counts against it for breach of fiduciary duty (count XV and XXVI),\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   corporate waste (count XXVII), breach of duty to preserve\n   assets, deepening insolvency (count XXVIII), or costs (XXX).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the outset, I note that the trustee does not contest dismissal of count XXIX. I will, therefore, grant CapeCapital's motion to dismiss that count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In addition to CapeCapital, other defendants, including Mr. Dixon, the law firm of Goodwin Procter LLP (\"Goodwin\") and two of its attorneys (collectively, the \"Goodwin Defendants\") also filed motions to dismiss. At a hearing held on these motions and others on June 14, 2018, the trustee agreed to the dismissal of his claim against CapeCapital for substantive consolidation (count XXIII), and I will therefore grant the motion to dismiss that count. The Goodwin Defendants' motions to dismiss were allowed in part and denied in part by my memorandum and order dated January 8, 2019.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cruickshank v.

CapeCapital was the sole manager of BFG, and Mr. Dixon, in turn, was the sole manager and a member of CapeCapital. \u00b6 3.

Fitness clubs at different locations were often operated through separate BFG subsidiaries, and those subsidiaries were often the actual tenants under the applicable leases for the premises. \u00b6\u00b6 251-52, 255-56. At all times relevant to the claims and causes of action alleged in the complaint, BFG was insolvent and insufficiently capitalized. \u00b6\u00b6 310-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2.

Additionally, under the terms of the asset purchase agreement, BFG was to receive 28 residual revenue streams associated with 28 closed Bally's fitness clubs which were derived from monthly electronic fund transfers of members of the closed fitness clubs. \u00b6 115.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On April 25, 2012, Mr. Dixon formed CapeCapital Maryland Heights, LLC, a Missouri limited liability company, CapeCapital West Hartford, LLC, a Connecticut limited liability company, and CapeCapital Irving, LLC, a Texas limited liability company, all of which were managed by Mr. Dixon and effectively owned by him (collectively, the \"Cape Real Estate Entities\") in order to take title to the Bally real estate. \u00b6\u00b6 18, 20, 22, 62, 145, 152, 157, 164. None of these entities was owned by BFG. \u00b6\u00b6 62, 163-64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   To raise part of the cash needed to complete the Bally transaction, the members of BFG agreed to sell a preferred membership interest in BFG to the Dixon Family Limited Partnership (an affiliate of Dixon and also a defendant in this action). \u00b6\u00b6 138-39. The Goodwin Defendants drafted and presented to BFG and its members a member consent dated April 27, 2012, which provided in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   WHEREAS, the Members and Managers [of BFG] are seeking to raise additional capital for the Company for purposes including, but not limited [sic], financing the growth of the Company's business through the acquisition, from Bally Total Fitness Corporation, a Delaware corporation (\"Bally\") and certain of ts [sic] affiliates, of operating assets\n   <strong>\n    and real property associated with additional health club facilities (the \"Bally Acquisition\") by a direct subsidiary of the Company.\n   </strong>\n   (Emphasis added).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=736%20N.E.2d%20373\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This consent was presented to BFG's members at a time when Mr. Dixon and the Goodwin Defendants were already planning to transfer the Bally real estate to entities not owned by BFG. \u00b6 140. Members of BFG, including Steven Borghi, relied on the member consent when they approved the admission of the Dixon Family Limited Partnership as a member of BFG and allowed the Bally transaction to move forward. \u00b6 142. They did so believing that BFG would receive the Bally real estate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4086275\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/631/592/#p594\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   According to emails exchanged between Goodwin attorneys and Bally's counsel on April 12, 2012, the Goodwin Defendants knew by that date that Mr. Dixon wanted to designate entities not owned by BFG to take title to the Bally real estate. \u00b6\u00b6 131-133.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   By the time the Bally transaction closed on April 30, 2012, Bally had sold the Bally real estate, worth over $ 4 million, to Mr. Dixon's LLCs, the Cape Real Estate Entities, for approximately $ 1 million. \u00b6\u00b6 62, 146, 153, 158. Mr. Dixon used BFG funds to subsidize his purchase of the Bally real estate. \u00b6\u00b6 63, 146, 153, 158, 178. In addition to the diversion of the Bally real estate to entities not owned by BFG, BFG also \"did not receive the full benefit of the Residual Bally Revenue Streams,\" as CapeCapital and Mr. Dixon directed that they be transferred to themselves or other third parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 116-117.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   At the time of the Bally transaction, BFG, Mr. Dixon and Mr. Borghi, Mr. Dixon's business partner and a member of BFG, were mired in a dispute with Elizabeth Beninati, the widow of Mr. Borghi's previous business partner in the discount fitness club business. \u00b6\u00b6 71, 73, 76-79. Ms. Beninati commenced a Massachusetts state court lawsuit against Mr. Dixon, Mr. Borghi and BFG on May 24, 2012, seeking millions of dollars in damages. \u00b6\u00b6 79, 376.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Following the Cape Real Estate Entities' acquisition of the Bally real estate, Mr. Dixon and CapeCapital directed BFG and/or its subsidiaries to enter into leases with the Cape Real Estate Entities and to make \"potentially over-market\" lease payments to them for the BFG clubs operating at the three Dixon-controlled properties at a time when BFG was insolvent. \u00b6\u00b6 63, 166, 181-83.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the direction of Mr. Dixon, the Cape Real Estate Entities sold the properties to third parties in separate transactions on December 31, 2013, June 26, 2014 and December 31, 2014, \u00b6\u00b6 148, 151, 154, 156, 159, 161, for prices significantly\n   in excess of their purchase prices, with the proceeds being distributed to Mr. Dixon or to unknown John Doe defendants. \u00b6\u00b6 148, 149, 154, 155, 159, 160. The Cape Real Estate Entities breached their lease agreements with BFG and/or its subsidiaries by terminating these leases prematurely to facilitate the sale of the Bally real estate, and CapeCapital and Mr. Dixon directed the closing of the clubs at those locations for that purpose. \u00b6\u00b6 150, 156, 161, 184.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3. The Lexfit and Newfit Transactions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In late 2012, while BFG was in litigation with Ms. Beninati, Mr. Dixon began transferring profitable BFG clubs to new entities in order to shield them from BFG's creditors such as Ms. Beninati. \u00b6\u00b6 82, 273, 308-309. Defendants, Lexfit, LLC, a Massachusetts limited liability company, and Newfit, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, both managed by Mr. Dixon and/or CapeCapital, were two of these entities. \u00b6\u00b6 9, 10, 103, 273.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On December 6, 2012, Mr. Dixon, CapeCapital and another defendant transferred sixteen of BFG's more profitable fitness clubs to Lexfit for no or nominal consideration. \u00b6\u00b6 274, 276. On January 30, 2013, Mr. Dixon, CapeCapital and another defendant transferred an additional eight of BFG's more profitable clubs to Newfit. \u00b6 283-84. BFG did not receive full consideration for these transfers. \u00b6 285. Also on January 30, 2013, Lexfit transferred eight of the clubs received from BFG in the December 2012 transaction to Newfit for less than full consideration. \u00b6\u00b6 289, 291, 293.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     4. Other Transactions with Third Parties\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   BFG could not pay its debts as they arose and it implemented a strategy, through Mr. Dixon and CapeCapital, of shifting assets from one fitness club to another. \u00b6\u00b6 255, 259, 312. At the direction of Mr. Dixon and CapeCapital, BFG would shut down a profitable club, transfer the club's assets-owned by a particular subsidiary of BFG-to one of its other wholly owned subsidiaries and leave the now asset-less subsidiary with its liabilities. \u00b6\u00b6 247, 255, 262. The transferred assets included, membership lists, club equipment, cash, receivables in the form of electronic funds transfers for scheduled membership payments, which were drawn from members' accounts, and other assets. \u00b6 255.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   A large number of BFG's creditors are landlords who leased space to wholly-owned entities of BFG. \u00b6 248. The landlords relied on guaranties from BFG, third party guarantors, or other obligors under the leases. \u00b6 249. BFG purchased workout clubs from sellers (such as Bally), assumed the sellers' obligations under existing leases and often breached its obligations to remove the sellers as obligors under the leases. \u00b6\u00b6 250, 359. When clubs were shut down, the subsidiary, which was the actual tenant under the lease, would stop making rent payments to the landlord. \u00b6 256. The landlord would sue the tenant, only to find that the assets of the tenant had been transferred to another subsidiary of BFG. \u00b6 257.

The trustee's opposition to CapeCapital's motion to dismiss provides clarification. The transfers the trustee seeks to avoid, in which CapeCapital was involved, consist of 1) the transfer to CapeCapital of BFG's interest in the Bally residual revenue streams; 2) BFG's payment of above market rent to Mykonos which is partially owned by CapeCapital; and 3) BFG's payment to CapeCapital of executive compensation and fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B.

If CapeCapital or others continued to receive those monies after 2012, those facts are not alleged in the complaint, and the trustee concedes in his brief that he will require discovery to determine when these payments ended. Although I will consider the voidability of the transfer of the Bally residual revenue streams with reference to counts III, IV and V, based on the MUFTA, it cannot form the basis of a fraudulent transfer claim under Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 548 due to the temporal restrictions of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   With respect to the other alleged transfers, I find that the trustee has not pleaded sufficient facts to support plausible avoidance claims under Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 548 or the MUFTA. Other than the amount of BFG's monthly rent at the Auburndale location at some point in time ($ 4,721), the complaint contains no allegations concerning the dates of rent payments made by BFG or why the lease should be considered above-market other than the allegation that one CapeCapital/Dixon affiliate, Newfit, paid a lower rental rate to Mykonos for an unspecified amount of office space. While one can infer that BFG leased the property \"at all material times,\" and paid the quoted rate at some point in time, one cannot determine from the complaint the amount of office space rented by BFG (and whether it was more or less than Newfit), or the market rates at the time for comparable office space. I am unable to draw a reasonable inference that BFG did not receive reasonably equivalent value in exchange for lease payments or that it made the lease payments with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors. The allegations concerning the Mykonos lease payments are conclusory and do not rise above the level of speculation for purposes of any fraudulent transfer count in the complaint, although they may form the basis for other plausible claims in the complaint against CapeCapital or other defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Likewise, the trustee has pleaded no facts concerning the dates or amounts of compensation or fees allegedly received by CapeCapital from BFG or its subsidiaries. Accordingly, I will not consider those claims in connection with any fraudulent transfer count in the complaint.

The trustee has pleaded sufficient facts to support a plausible claim that, in April of 2012, BFG had a contractual right to acquire the revenue streams for 28 closed Bally fitness centers, that it paid some amount under the Bally asset purchase agreement for that right, and that such right constituted an \"asset\" of BFG as defined in MUFTA \u00a7 2. Under the MUFTA's broad definition of \"transfer,\" which includes \"direct or indirect, absolute or conditional, voluntary or involuntary\" transfers of an asset or an interest in an asset, the trustee has also sufficiently alleged that BFG transferred its right to acquire the Bally residual revenue streams to CapeCapital in cooperation with Mr. Dixon. The trustee, however, failed to plead any facts concerning the value of the revenue streams, including how much it paid Bally for the right to acquire them, or what value, if any, it received from CapeCapital for the transfer. The trustee merely alleged that BFG \"did not receive the full benefit of the Residual Bally Revenue Streams.\" I construe that to mean that BFG acquired at least some value from the transfer to CapeCapital.

The trustee also did not allege the dates through which CapeCapital allegedly continued to receive the revenue stream payments. Accordingly, I cannot plausibly conclude that any conversion of BFG's right to receive the revenue streams took place during the applicable statute of limitations period. Likewise, there are insufficient facts in the complaint to plausibly support the conclusion that BFG paid over-market rents to Mykonos during the statute of limitations period. There are, however, sufficient allegations in the complaint that on January 30, 2013, a date within three years of the bankruptcy filing on January 26, 2016, Mr. Dixon and CapeCapital exercised dominion and control over BFG's property for the purpose of transferring eight of its profitable clubs to Newfit, which was managed by Mr. Dixon, without full consideration in order to shield assets from BFG's creditors (with Mr. Dixon later personally receiving payments from Mr. Eskandarian).

The trustee has sufficiently supported his claims with specific allegations concerning CapeCapital's pervasive control over BFG and Mr. Dixon's pervasive control over CapeCapital as well as the other entities. Further, the trustee has sufficiently alleged that Mr. Dixon used CapeCapital to promote fraudulent transactions in a common enterprise which benefited him and his other affiliates. Lastly, he has included numerous allegations about intermingling of business activity and assets among the entities. While mindful that veil piercing will be permitted in only rare situations, I find at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage, with all reasonable inferences drawn in the trustee's favor, the allegations are sufficient to support a plausible claim for veil piercing and/or alter ego determination against CapeCapital.
