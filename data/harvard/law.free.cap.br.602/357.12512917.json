Taylor (\"Taylor\"), the former accountant for debtor Yellow Cab Cooperative, Inc. (\"Debtor\" or \"YCC\"), for dismissal of this action filed by Randy Sugarman, the chapter 11 trustee of YCC (\"Trustee\"). The court took the matter under submission. For the reasons set forth below, the court finds that the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    in pari delicto\n   </em>\n   (also known as \"unclean hands\") bars the Trustee's action. Accordingly, the court will dismiss the adversary proceeding, with leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    The Complaint\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 31, 2018, Trustee filed an action in state court against Taylor asserting three causes of action: (1) Professional Negligence, (2) Accounting Malpractice, and (3) Conspiracy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On December 5, 2018, Taylor removed the action to this court [Dkt. 1]. On December 12, 2018, Taylor moved for dismissal of the action [Dkt. 4]. Thereafter, Trustee filed his opposition [Dkt. 10] and Taylor filed his reply [Dkt. 11].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Trustee alleges in paragraphs 17-22 of the complaint that YCC made improper patronage distributions from 2012-2015, and that Taylor calculated the amounts to be distributed. Moreover, the complaint alleges that Taylor willfully or negligently categorized multiple personal injury lawsuits as \"reasonably possible\" liabilities (Dkt. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 27-33), even though the claims were likely future liabilities (and at least one had been tried by a jury that ruled in favor of the plaintiff), and that he did not comply with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. According to Trustee, these errors (whether negligent or intentional) facilitated the improper transfer of funds to owner-drivers and the depletion of the company's assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In addition to alleging negligence and malpractice, Trustee asserted that Taylor had conspired with Debtor and its officers and directors to divest Debtor of \"valuable and necessary assets to allow improper distributions to YCC members and to hide money from creditors and judgment creditors.\" Dkt. 1 at \u00b6 16. Paragraph 16 summarizes Trustee's lawsuit and describes the purported misconduct giving rise to it:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   16. From at least 2007 until the Trustee was appointed, YCC was under the control of its officers and directors who\n   were also YCC members and medallion holders. There were no outside directors of YCC. On information and belief, Taylor\n   <em>\n    conspired with YCC's officers and directors to divest YCC of valuable and necessary assets to allow improper distributions to YCC members and to hide money from creditors and judgment creditors\n   </em>\n   . Specifically,\n   <em>\n    Taylor worked with YCC management to help funnel YCC assets to the unrelated entity, TPC, and its subsidiaries, calculated and assisted YCC in making economically irresponsible patronage distributions to YCC members, and negligently failed to properly account for judgments and liabilities of YCC so it could properly preserve assets and reserve sufficient capital to account for reasonably probable liabilities of YCC\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Taylor participated in and assisted YCC's management to funnel money away from YCC to line the members' pockets at the expense of the financial health of YCC.\n   </em>\n   This resulted in YCC being undercapitalized, underinsured, without sufficient reserves, and without the assets to meet its obligations and liabilities, which ultimately resulted in YCC's demise through bankruptcy and the non-payment of claims and judgments against YCC.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The complaint describes the two types of distributions made to members (Profit Distributions and Patronage Distributions) and alleges that YCC paid Patronage Distributions \"without regard to their reasonableness or the financial health of YCC.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 17-19. Trustee further alleges that Taylor provided YCC with an annual calculation of the Patronage Distributions and \"was fully aware YCC made unlawful Patronage Distributions to non-voting members not entitled to them, while technically insolvent.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 21-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Paragraphs 27-33 of the complaint focus on the inadequacies, errors, and misstatements in Taylor's audit reports. While the bulk of those allegations pertain to the facts giving rise to the professional negligence claim (the first cause of action), paragraph 33 is broader and appears to develop a deepening insolvency theory: \"Taylor conspired with YCC's officers and directors to avoid financial prudence with YCC, which would have shown YCC to be insolvent, so that the members could continue to take money out of YCC to YCC's and its creditors' detriment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   According to Trustee, Taylor's professional negligence, accounting and auditing malpractice, and conspiracy with YCC's officers and directors resulted in YCC's ultimate demise and non-payment of claims and judgments against YCC.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.; see also\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22, 33, and 45-46 of the Complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Taylor's Grounds for Dismissal\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Taylor asserted three grounds for dismissal of the Trustee's claims: (1) the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    in pari delicto\n   </em>\n   (or unclean hands) bars them; (2) any damages arising from the alleged conduct were not caused by him, but by YCC's officers and directors, who have already settled with the trustee; and (3) conspiracy is not an independent tort under California law. As discussed in more detail below, the court agrees with Taylor's first contention that the doctrine of unclean hands bars Trustee's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    A.

The lender asserted an\n   <em>\n    in pari delicto\n   </em>\n   defense, and the trustee argued that the defense was inapplicable, as she [the trustee] was not a wrongdoer and was not involved in the acts giving rise to the defense.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4041963\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/527/351/#p366\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The District Court disagreed, holding that even though the trustee was not a wrongdoer, the actions of the debtor's sole owner, member and manager were imputed to the debtor and thus the trustee:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   The Ninth Circuit has not addressed, in a published opinion, the applicability of the\n   <em>\n    in pari delicto\n   </em>\n   doctrine to claims brought by a liquidating trustee.

The\n   <em>\n    in pari delicto\n   </em>\n   defense therefore bars the claims of Trustee against Taylor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    B. Taylor's Other Defenses\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As noted previously, Taylor asserts that any damages arising from the alleged conduct were not caused by him, but by YCC's officers and directors, who have already settled with the Trustee. Causation is a factual issue, and but for the claims being barred under the\n   <em>\n    in pari delicto\n   </em>\n   doctrine, Trustee has alleged sufficient facts to survive a motion to dismiss based on lack of causation. That said, Trustee may have an independent claim for malpractice against Taylor not arising from and independent of the alleged fraud of the debtor and its members. The court will therefore dismiss all claims in the Complaint, with leave to amend the accounting malpractice claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the court will grant Taylor's motion to dismiss with leave to amend the accounting malpractice claim. Trustee shall file the amended complaint no later than May 31, 2019; if the amended complaint is timely filed, the adversary proceeding status conference will be held on June 28, 2019, at 1:30 p.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Counsel for Taylor shall upload an order granting the motion with leave to amend \"for the reasons set forth in the Memorandum\n   Decision entered on [date].\" Counsel for Taylor shall also comply with B.L.R. 9021-1(c) and file (on the docket, separate from the order) a certificate of service reflecting such compliance.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    The preface to the complaint states that the action is for professional negligence, deepening the insolvency of YCC, and accounting and auditing malpractice.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Interestingly, many of the allegations made by Trustee against Taylor are almost identical to the claims he made against YCC's officers and directors in\n    <em>\n     Sugarman v.
