S. Comp. Stat. 1913, \u00a7 4374.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">Neither the petition nor the affidavit upon which it was based charged the commission of any fraud. The sole charge was that the naturalization sought to he set aside and canceled was made by an order of the court on July 21, 1914, the same day on which the petition for naturalization was filed, in disregard of the provision of the statute, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-6\">\u201cIn no case shall final action be had upon a petition until at least ninety days have elapsed after filing and posting the notice of such petition.\u201d U. S. Comp. Stat. 1913, \u00a7 4354.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">The facts stated in the naturalization petition showed that the petitioner was entitled to be naturalized, and this was shown by the sworn answer filed in this case. This is not controverted by the government. In the opinion rendered by the District Judge it was stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-8\">\u201cIt is admitted by the government that the petition was filed in good faith, that the applicant was guilty of no fraud, and was entitled to be naturalized under the provisions of the act of 1910.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b943-9\">Such an admission is not otherwise shown by the record, but there has been no suggestion of the existence of a ground for contesting the appellee\u2019s naturalization if the proceedings on his application therefor shall conform to the requirements of the statute. It may be assumed that the last-quoted provision of the statute is a mandatory one, and that a court in which an application for naturalization is filed is not vested with a discretionary power to dispense with the observance of it. But we are not of opinion that it follows from this conclusi\u00f3n that a certificate of citizenship must be canceled and set aside when the facts are such as are disclosed by the record in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-10\">The remedy given by the statute is the means provided for protecting the right of the government to contest applications for naturalization and for excluding from citizenship those who, under the law, are not entitled to the privilege. The statute does not indicate a purpose to give the remedy when there has been no injury. The district attorneys are authorized to institute the proceedings only \u201cupon affidavit showing good cause therefor.\u201d The affidavit upon which this suit was instituted amounted to nothing more than an assignment of error of law apparent upon the face of the naturalization proceedings. It states no fact from which it may be inferred that a ground for contesting the application existed, or that the result might have been different if all the requirements of the statute had been complied with in the naturalization proceedings. It cannot be supposed that it was in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>the contemplation of the lawmakers that an affidavit would be sufficient to put upon the district attorney the duty of instituting the proceeding provided for if it showed no more than this one discloses. We think it is manifest that it was intended that the required affidavit 'should state facts constituting \u201cgood cause\u201d for instituting the proceeding, and should do more than point out errors of law in the proc\u00e9dure which led up to the naturalization. The conclusion is that the statutory remedy would be perverted from its obvious purpose of safeguarding things of substance, if it is permitted to be successfully resorted to without any showing that the issue of the attacked certificate of citizenship might properly have been denied at the time it was granted, if the procedure had been a strict compliance with all statutory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">The decree appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">MAXEY, District Judge, dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
