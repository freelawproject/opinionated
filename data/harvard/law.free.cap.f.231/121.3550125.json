The horse hair mats are superior to those made from camel\u2019s hair in durability, facility of use, and in that they save a larger percentage of the oil; but, as appears from a large number of standard works on the arts, of which the oourt may take judicial notice, horse hair mats had long been known and used in the art of expressing oil from seeds, and the patents are therefore apparently void for lack of novelty.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b135-20\">&lt;\u00a7^s&gt;For other cases see same topic &amp; KEY-NUMBER in all Key-Numbered Digests &amp; Indexes</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-8\">Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania; Oliver B.

Werk &amp; Co., the owners of two divisional patents, Nos. 758,574 and 758,575, granted April 26, 1904, to Robert F. Werk for an oil-press mat, filed a bill charging the F. T. Parker Company with infringement thereof. The claim of 758,574 in issue is for:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-15\">\u201cAn oil-press mat or cloth made entirely of long animal hair and consisting of warp and weft threads, said weft threads being composed exclusively of soft, pliable hair and the warp threads greatly exceeding the weft threads in number per square inch.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-16\">That of 758,575 in issue is for:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-17\">\u201cAn oil-press mat or cloth consisting of warp threads and weft threads, each composed exclusively of long hair derived from animals\u2019 tails and manes, which hair is soft and pliable; the warp threads exceeding the weft threads in number per square inch, and the weft threads being thicker than the warp threads.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-18\">On final hearing the court below entered a decree dismissing the bill on the ground of noninfringement. Thereupon the plaintiff took this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-19\">The case has given us some concern. It relates to the great 'field of cotton-seed oil extraction\u2014-an industry with which we are not familiar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>in this circuit. The testimony is meager and throws little, if any, light on the decisive questions involved. As the tonnage of cotton seed is double that of the cotton crop itself, as the value of by-product possibilities is now being recognized, and as the device .here involved made possible, inter alia,\u2019the recovery of more than 1% per cent, of oil and a reduction of 8 cents per ton in operative cost, it will be apparent that the case is one that challenges the attention of the federal courts to which is intrusted that most responsible commercial duty of decreeing the reward of a limited monopoly to a patentee who- contributes something novel, useful, and inventive to a great industry, or, on the other hand, of protecting such ah industry from the unwarranted burden of a monopoly by one who has really not given it anything of that character. In view of these facts we have felt constrained to give to this case a range of somewhat broader examination and discussion than its meager proofs suggest.1</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">As we have said, the case concerns the extraction of oil from cotton seed. The ordinary method of such extraction consists in chopping up, heating, and otherwise treating the cotton seed preparatory to pressing. This mash is next spread on a part of a mat of camel\u2019s hair. The other end of the mat is then doubled over the mash and the whole subjected to a pressure of several thousand pounds. This pressed the oil from the mash and strained it through the mat. For these camel\u2019s hair mats the patentee, Werk, substituted mats woven of horse hair, and on the two divisional applications as above he was granted the two claims quoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">It is apparent the essence o-f his invention, if such it be, consists, not in any new method of weaving mats, but in weaving them from the hair of other animals than camels. In other words, his device is an article of commerce, viz., an oil-press mat, woven it is true in a particular way, but in one claim limited to being \u201cmade entirely of long animal hair,\u201d and in the other to being \u201ccomposed exclusively of long hair derived from animals\u2019 tails and manes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">The proofs show that the horse hair mats of complainant have certain substantial advantages over those made of camel\u2019s hair, in that they last 20 days, as compared with the 5 days\u2019 life of a camel\u2019s hair mat. In the seed cake pressed on horse hair mats there remains an average of 5.92 per cent, of oil, while in that pressed on camel\u2019s hair 7.50 per cent, of oil is retained. The cost of camel\u2019s hair mats is 18 cents per ton of seed pressed, while with horse hair but 1\u00d3. In addition to this; the seed cake is imbedded in the camel\u2019s hair mat by pressure, and has to be separated by a special machine. It does not so imbed in the horse hair mats, and can be readily stripped off. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>will thus be seen that Werk\u2019s mat forms an important and valuable economical feature in the industry. Recognizing its value as a hair mat, the defendants wove their mats from the long hair of Chinamen\u2019s cues, which hair, it seems, is an article of commerce. The proofs satisfy us that such human hair mats have the same functional qualities in oil-pressing as horse hair mats.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">The value of Werk\u2019s device being shown by the proofs, the case resolved itself into two questions\u2014the validity of his patents and the infringement of their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">On the part of the defendants it is contended that the change from camel\u2019s hair to horse hair is a mere obvious substitution, and therefore does not involve invention. Moreover, it is alleged that, if there be invention in such change, the substitution of human hair for horse hair involves more invention, and for that reason, and because Werk\u2019s patent cl\u00e1ims must be restricted to horse or animal hair, they are not infringed by defendants\u2019 use of human hair. The term \u201ccamel\u2019s hair\u201d is somewhat misleading, for the covering of a camel is for the most part wool, which wool shades off into the few straggling long hairs which give it the name of camel\u2019s hair. But when woven into these oil mats it is the wool which malees it act differently from a horse hair mat, which has no wool in it. Without entering into a detail comparison of wool and hair, it suffices to say that the essential difference is the capacity of one, and the incapacity of the other, to mat, or \u201cfelt,\u201d as it is technically called. Felting is caused by the tiny hooks or scales on wool, which grip and mat on pressure and contact with other strands. A true hair has no such hooks, and therefore will not mat. It is this felting capacity that makes a camel\u2019s hair mat become so tight as to prevent, to a degree, the passage of oil, which a horse hair mat will pass. And it is the absence of this felting in a horse liair mat which makes it possible to strip off the seed cake, while it has to be mechanically torn from the felted camel\u2019s hair one. Felting, as its characteristic distinction from hair, is well known in the textile industries. Thus in Dooley\u2019s Book of Textiles it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-6\">\u201cThe chief characteristic of wool is its felting or shrinking power. This felting property, from which wool derives much of its value, and which is its special distinction from hair, depends in part upon the kinks in the fiber, but mainly upon the scales with which the fiber is covered. These scales or points are exceedingly minute, ranging from about 1,100 to the inch to nearly 3,000. The stem of the fiber itself is extremely slender, being less than one thousandth of an inch in diameter. In good felting wools the scales are more perfect and numerous, while inferior wools possess fewer serrations, and are less perfect in structure. In the process of felting the fibers become entangled with one another, and the little projecting scales hook into one another and hold the fibers closely interlocked. The deeper these scales fit into one \u00abmother the closer becomes the structure of the thread.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">This nonfelting of hair the patentee has taken advantage of in his device, and points out in one specification, where he says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-8\"><em>\u201c </em>* * * Hair strands afford good drainage for the oil, and impart a glossy surface to the fabric, that enables the cake to be introduced with facility and the article to be stripped with ease from the compressed material.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>And in the other:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-4\">\u201cThe highest grade of mat now in general nse is made from camel\u2019s hair hut camel\u2019s hair is objectionable, because it packs and felts together when in use to such an extent as to hinder the free flow of the oil, and the yield per ton of seed is greatly reduced by reason of this felting of the camel\u2019s hair. The oil is compelled to seek an outlet on the sides, where there is no cloth to hold the seed or meats from being washed out into the receiving tanks, which deteriorates the quality of the oil. Camel\u2019s hair also stretches from one-fifth to one-third of its original length, which is objectionable, as this requires the cloth to be cut too short to start with, and before it is worn out it has stretched too long for convenient handling. All these objections are overcome by the use of horse hair, and, the horse hair being soft, it retains all the good features of camel\u2019s hair.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">It has therefore seemed to us that the change from camel to horse hair mats was sufficient to constitute invention in this art, if such use of horse hair mats was first disclosed to the oil-pressing art by Werk. But just here Werk\u2019s patents meet a fatal obstacle, for a cursory examination of standard works shows that at most Werk\u2019s use of horse hair mats in the present practice of cotton-seed oil extraction was but a revival of an old and well-recognized use of tire horse hair appliances in the general art of oil extraction.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Turning to the 1895 edition of the Standard Dictionary, under the word \u201chair\u201d we find: \u201cHair cloth; specif.: mats woven from horse hair used in expressing oils,\u201d etc. The nature of this practice, thus briefly outlined in the dictionary, will be found by reference to the ninth edition of the British Encyclopedia, published in 1884, where under the head of \u201cOils,\u201d it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-7\">\u201cThe. sequence of operations in treating oil seeds for the separation of their contained oils is ordinarily as follows: (1) The crushing or grinding of the seed or other substance; (2) heating the oleaginous meal so prepared; and (3) expression of the oil by mechanical power.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">Under the head of \u201cPressing,\u201d the article then says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-9\">\u201cWith the least possible delay the meal is transferred from the heating kettles, so that the oil may be pressed out while the material still retains its-heat\u2014measured quantities, say 10 or 12 pounds of meal, are filled into woolen bags of strong, thick texture, sufficiently open and porous to allovy free flow of the expressed oil, yet having consistency enough to resist rupture by the enormous pressure to which it is subjected. Each bag is further placed <em>within \u2018hairs,\u2019 tliiclc mats of horse hairs hound with leather. </em>In some methods of working press-cloths\u2014not bags\u2014are used; and the construction of recent presses is such as to dispense with the use of bags or other coverings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">Samuelson on Oil Well Machinery, 1858 (in Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers) vol. 9, pp. <em>27-42, </em>says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-11\">\u201cThe bags after being filled are placed separately between what are called <em>the hairs, which are hags made of horse hair with an external covering of leather. </em>The same description of bags and hair are used, whether the oil be expressed by means of the stamper, screw, or <em>hydraulic press.\u201d </em>Page 31.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-12\">Spon\u2019s Dictionary of Engineering, 1874, vol. 3, in discussing Samuelson\u2019s article says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-13\">\u201cThe bags into which the seed is measured from the kettles hold 10 pounds of seed each, <em>the horse hair wrappers </em>into which they are deposited being 2% feet long.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>The use o\u00ed horse hair in oil extraction is referred to in British patent 2,645 of 1877, to H. C. Newburn, for improvements in apparatus for pressing and filtering beet root juice, oils, and other substances, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-4\">\u201cThe apparatus * * * acts both as a press and as a Alter. * * * These Alter cloths aro composed of three thicknesses\u2014the first consisting of perforated bands or straps, * * * the second of <em>coarse fabric of horse or other hair </em>which forms the supple and elastic part of the filter, and the last of a fine and uniform fabric, such as merino, cashmere, or alpaca, which constitutes the filter properly so called.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Brannt\u2019s Animal and Vegetable Fats and Oils, 1888:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-6\">\u201cThe material used in the manufacture of press-cloths and bags should be capable of great resistance, and while close enough to prevent any meal from penetrating, allow the oil to run out as freely as possible; properties not readily found combined in any one material. The most suitable materials are cotton, sheep\u2019s wool, and <em>horse hair.\u201d </em><footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">With such practices existing in the general art of seed-oil extraction, practices of which the court takes judicial notice, it follows that Work\u2019s patents did not disclose any such novel information to the cotton-seed art as warranted a grant to him of patent monopoly therefor based on the use of horse hair. This conclusion renders it unnecessary to discuss the question of infringement which the court below decided in favor of the defendant. In view of the fact that the references quoted were not given in evidence we will defer sending the mandate to the court below until such time has elapsed as will enable counsel to determine whether any such reasonable ground exists as warrants a motion for reargument or other form of relief to meet such references.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b136-7\"> Encyclopedia Americana, vol. 5, article Cotton-Seed Oil Industry, by <em>Thom </em>as B. Chaney, 1903 (cited by the University of Pennsylvania Library), shows the importance of the cotton-seed oil industry:. \u201cWhen it is considered that the seed of the cotton plant more than pays the entire expense of ginning, baling and tying the crop, the economy it effects is plainly seen. * * * In fact, the whole agricultural life of the South has been benefited by this formerly despised gift (the seed) of old King Cotton, and it is only just to say that the people are becoming appreciative of that fact.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b139-8\"> Tlie references above quoted were furnished by the Technical Department of the Carnegie library of Pittsburgh on request for publications showing the use of horse hair, prior to Work\u2019s patents, in the extraction of vegetable oil. As the court took judicial notice of the information thus disclosed by a highly specialized technical library, it was deemed fair to ascertain whether inquiry at libraries in other sections of the country would also disclose the prior use of horse hair mats in vegetable oil extraction. With that end in view inquiry was made by letter of large public libraries of tho leading Universities in the Bast and several in the South and West, and from colleges both Bast and West.

To these plates, which are inserted between the columns of the press, are attached iron rails in which the press rings are suspended, and serve as guides for the insertion and withdrawal of the latter. In addition to this, each plate is surrounded by a channel for catching the expressed oil. The filling of the press is a simple operation. On the perforated bottom of each ring is laid a cover of <em>plaited horse hair, </em>wool or felt, on which the meal is spread and covered with a <em>horse hair </em>cloth. When the rings are all filled pressure is applied, forcing the grooved upper surface of each plate into the ring above, and thereby causing the oil to flow out <em>through the horse hair cloth, </em>the perforated steel plate and the grooves of the press plate, into the oil channel.\u201d (Page 71.) \"The cleaned seeds are passed into a rotary cylinder containing 24 circular fixed knives and an equal number of cutters, which divide the seed into very small pieces. The hulls are thus separated from the kernels, and form a valued food for cattle. The kernels are pressed between rollers like those in a cane sugar mill, and the oil runs out. The mass is then put into woolen press bags, laid between <em>horse hair cloths </em>covered with ruffled leather to enable the oil to flow more freely, and submitted to hydraulic pressure.
