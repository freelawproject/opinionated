A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Au0\">In this suit plaintiff Michael Stott seeks to recover the difference between the price paid by his assignor, Eastman Dillon, Union Securities <em>&amp; </em>Co. (herein Eastman Dillon), for the purchase of 100 shares of Syntex Corporation<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the price at which the shares were sold. The cause was tried in the Law Division without a jury. Plaintiff was awarded a judgment of $5,451.71 plus interest and costs, and defendant Arthur Greengos appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">The record reveals that Donald J. Unger, an emplee of Eastman Dillon, testified for plaintiff. He stated that on Thursday, January 23, 1964, he received a telephonic \u201climit order\u201d from Greengos for the purchase of 100 shares of Syntex at not more than $167 per share; they were actually purchased the same day at a price of $164% per share; he called defendant that afternoon to confirm the transaction, and de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>fendant had requested him to sell if the stock reached a point $5 above tlie purchase price. Defendant\u2019s testimony was that he limited his order to a price of $164%. per share; he instructed Unger to sell if the stock went either up or down four or five points, and he never received a telephonic confirmation of purchase which he had specifically told Unger he required. We note that that alleged requirement was not pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Defendant further testified that on Saturday, January 25 he received a written confirmation of the purchase at $164%. Monday, January 27, he spoke with Unger and a Paul Pord, the Eastman Dillon office manager, and disclaimed any interest in the stock because it was purchased at a price % point above the limit of his order. Subsequently, upon receiving a, letter and a telegram demanding payment by noon January 31, he responded with a letter denying any interest in the stock due to the error in the purchase price. The shares were sold January 31 at the market price which had declined more than $50 per share.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Defendant urges three grounds for reversal: (1) there was no competent proof as to damages because neither the purchase nor the sale confirmation slips should have been admitted into evidence; (2) the court abused its discretion when it refused to grant an adjournment to tlie following day in order to allow defendant to produce a witness who failed to appear, and (3) the court committed error in refusing to consider the defense of statute of frauds under <em>N. J. 8. </em>12A :8-319 (c) of the Uniform Commercial Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Unger testified as to the practice of confirmation of purchase and sale, and that he knew, of his own knowledge, that the stock was sold as indicated in the confirmation of sale. The court allowed the documents in evidence as business entries. That ruling comports with the statutory requirements set forth in <em>N. J. S. </em>2A:82-35 and the judicial interpretations thereof. See <em>Mahoney v. Minsky, </em>39 <em>N. J. </em>208 (1963); <em>Hackensack Hospital v. Tiajcloff, 85 N. J. Super. </em>417 <em>(App. Div. </em>1964); <em>Fagan v. City of Newark, </em>78 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number><em>N. J. Super. </em>294 <em>(App. Div. </em>1963); <em>Webber v. McCormick, </em>63 <em>N. J. Super. </em>409 <em>(App. Div. </em>1960). Note, <em>Rule </em>63(13) of the <em>Proposed Buies of Evidence. </em>The fact that the confirmations may be styled self-serving does not affect their admissibility. <em>Mahoney v. Minsky, supra, </em>39 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>p. </em>219.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">The granting of an adjournment is discretionary with the trial court; an appellate tribunal may reverse a denial thereof only if the judicial action was \u201cclearly unreasonable in the light of the accompanying and surrounding circumstances\u201d and \u201cresulted prejudicially to the rights of the party complaining.\u201d <em>Smith v. Smith, </em>17 <em>N. J. Super. </em>128, 129, 133 <em>(App. Div. </em>1951), certification denied 9 <em>N. J. </em>178 (1952); <em>Fotopak Corp. v. Merlin, Inc., </em>34 <em>N. J. Super. </em>343, 347 <em>(App. Div. </em>1955). Here it does not appear that the testimony sought to be produced would have had any substantial effect on the resolution of the essential issues. Accordingly, the determination of the trial judge was not at odds with the doing of substantial justice and did not prejudice defendant\u2019s rights. See <em>R. R. </em>1:5-3 (b); 2:5.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Article Eight of the Uniform Commercial Code, <em>N. J. S. </em>12A:8-319, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-6\">\"A contract for the sale of securities is not enforceable by way of action or defense unless</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-7\">(a) there is some writing signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought or by his authorized agent or broker sufficient to indicate that a contract has been made for sale of a stated quantity \u25a0of described securities at a defined or stated price; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-8\">(b) delivery of the security has been accepted or payment has been \u00a1made but the contract is enforceable under this provision only to the \u25a0extent of such delivery or payment; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-9\">(c) within a reasonable time a writing in confirmation of the sale \u2022or purchase and sufficient against the sender under paragraph (a) has been received by the party against whom enforcement is sought :and he has failed to send written objection to its contents within ten \u25a0days after its receipt; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-10\">(d) the party against whom enforcement is sought admits in his pleading, testimony or otherwise in court that a contract was made for sale of a stated quantity of described securities at a defined or stated price.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Defendant contends that under subsection (c) Ms letter o\u00ed January 30, disclaiming any interest in the stock, raises the statute o\u00ed frauds defense and precludes enforcement of the agreement. Plaintiff argues that the statute does not apply to a transaction between a broker acting as an <em>agent </em>and his customer. The trial court agreed with plaintiff and ruled that the statute was not a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">The UC\u00dc provision is limited specifically to transactions involving a \u201ccontract for the sale of securities.\u201d See also <em>N. J. S. </em>12A :1-206, 12A:2-201 (DOC). The Code states that a \u201ccontract for sale\u201d \u201cconsists in the passing of title from the seller to the buyer for a price.\u201d <em>N. J. S. </em>12A :2-<em>106(1). </em>The question, then, is whether the transaction between Eastman Dillon and defendant involved a contract fox the sale of securities wherein the former was the seller and the latter the buyer, or, on the other hand, was their relationship one of agency whereby Eastman Dillon acted as defendant\u2019s agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Hesoar.-h has failed to reveal any reported judicial consideration of this issue under 8-319 of the Code. However, the <em>New Jersey Study Comment </em>states that the provisions of 8-319 are \u201cinapplicable to transactions between a broker and Ms customer. * * [T]he basis of Ms relationship with the customer is not that of buyer and seller, but that of principal and agent\u201d. <em>(Comment </em>7, at <em>p. </em>272). California has resolved the point by adding the following language toils version of the statute: \u201cA contract relating to the purchase or sale of securities between a broker acting as an agent and his principal is not subject to the provisions of the section.\u201d <em>California Commercial Code </em>(UCO), \u00a7 8319(2). The Permanent editorial Board considered the California variation hut rejected it because \u201cit merely states the obvious proposition that a contract between principal and agent by which the latter buys or sells for account of the former is not a \u2018contract of sale.\u2019 It is therefore unnecessary and perhaps confusing.\u201d Quoted in <em>Willier and Hart, Uni</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number><em>form, Commercial Code\u2014Reporter\u2014Digest </em>(1966), \u00a7 8-319, <em>p. </em>1-612.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The pre-UCC statute of frauds was <em>R. S. </em>46:30-10 (Uniform Sale of Goods Law). It, too, was limited in applicability to a \u201ccontract to sell or a sale of any goods or choses in action\u201d. <em>R. 8. </em>46:30-10(1). The weight of authority interpreting similar statutory provisions holds that, \u201cWhere one contracts with a broker to act as his agent in purchasing stock for him, such contract is one of agency rather than for the sale of goods, wares and merchandise. Such a contract of agency is not within the statute of frauds.\u201d <em>Cammann v. Edwards, </em>340 <em>Mo. </em>1, 100 <em>S. W. 2d </em>846, 850 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1936). Accord, <em>Campbell v.

J. S. </em>12A:1\u2014102(2) (a). The aim is to avoid the anachronisms of the past. In view of the criticism that the inclusion of any statute of frauds provision in Article Eight has received (see Guttman, \u201cInvestment Securities under the Uniform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>Commercial Code,\u201d 11 <em>Buffalo L. Rev. </em>1, 18\u201421 (1961)) and the observation that \u201cseventeenth-century procedural difficulties requiring such methods of proof no longer exist\u201d (Guttman, \u201cArticle 8\u2014Investment Securities,\u201d 17 <em>Rutgers L. Rev. </em>136, 144 (1962)), it is not likely that the Legislature intended, by adopting 8-319, to reverse the judicial determinations under the Sales Act and impose procedural requirements which are \u201cout of touch with modern methods\u201d of securities transactions. <em>Jbid. </em>It is the conclusion of this court that <em>N. J. S. </em>12A :8-319 does not apply to transactions between a broker and his customer and that the trial court was correct in refusing to recognize the statute of frauds as a defense to this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The judgment of the Law Division is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b116-11\">A stock listed on the American .Stock Exchange.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
