A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AcT\">Pursuant to leave granted under <em>R. R. </em>2:2-3(a), plaintiffs appeal from an interlocutory order of the Law Division denying their application for a preliminary injunction pending final hearing, and dissolving an <em>ex parte </em>temporary restraint theretofore granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">In their complaint plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment (1) permanently enjoining defendants from enforcing the provisions of <em>chapter </em>164 of the <em>Laws of </em>1966; (2) permanently enjoining defendant Plerbert Koransky from enforcing his Division Directive Ho. 14; (3) permanently enjoining defendants from interfering with or hindering plaintiff Accident Index Bureau, Inc. from examining and making copies of records made public by <em>B. 8. </em>34:15-59; (4) adjudging and declaring <em>chapter </em>164 unconstitutional and void, and (5) adjudging and declaring the directive unconstitutional and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">At oral argument the parties stipulated that we might make a final disposition of the appeal upon the basis of the record before us, except for a copy of the present advertising brochure now circulated by Accident Index Bureau, Inc. to be furnished to the court, as though the final hearing had been concluded upon the basis of the record as supplemented and the relief sought by plaintiffs had been denied. The brochure has been furnished and the record is agreeably supplemented thereby. Hillside Metal Products, Inc., a customer of the co-plaintiff, has been joined as a party plaintiff, but the issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>really concerns the validity of the statute and directive in their relation to Accident Index Bureau, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">This appeal is a sequel to our decision in <em>Accident Index Bureau, Inc. v. Hughes, </em>83 <em>N. J. Super. </em>293 <em>(App. Div. </em>1964), affirmed 46 <em>N. J. </em>160 (1965). We there held that an executive order by the Governor under \u201cThe Right to Know Law,\u201d <em>L. </em>1963, c. 73, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>47:1A-1 <em>et seq., </em>and a regulation based thereon by the Commissioner of Labor and Industry, deeming workmen\u2019s compensation records not to be public if the purpose of inspecting or copying them was to provide employers with information concerning prospective employees, were invalid. We concluded that the order and regulation contravened substantive due process. We need not repeat herein all of the reasons which impelled that conclusion or the details of the rationale of the Supreme Court in its affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Following that litigation and evidently motivated by a statement in the Supreme Court opinion to the effect that \u201cnothing we have said should be thought to question the power of the Legislature to deal with the problem\u201d (46 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>p. </em>166), there was adopted <em>chapter </em>164 of the <em>Laws of </em>1966, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-7\">\u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of the chapter to which this act is a supplement or of any other law, no1 records maintained by the Division of Workmen\u2019s Compensation shall be open to inspection or copying' by or on behalf of any person who seeks such inspection or copying for the purpose of selling or furnishing for a consideration to others reports or abstracts of workmen\u2019s compensation records or work-injury records pertaining to any individual, except in the case of an investigation by or on behalf of an employer in connection with any pending workmen\u2019s compensation case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">Obviously, this new statute is aimed at curbing only the activities of commercial agencies, such as Accident Index Bureau, Inc., engaged in the business of <em>\u201cselling or furnishing for a consideration to others\u201d </em>reports or abstracts of workmen\u2019s compensation records. The employers themselves, or their employees, are not barred from inspecting or copying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>the Workmen's compensation records for any purpose. It is the performance of this inspecting and copying by those who \u201csell or furnish\u201d the information to others \u201cfor a consideration\u201d which alone comes within the statutory bar. By way of exception the ban does not extend to the commercial agencies if the information is gathered in connection with any pending workmen's compensation case.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">Directive No. 14, issued by defendant Koransky as Director of the Division of Workmen\u2019s Compensation to all personnel on June 29, 1966, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-5\">\u201cNo records of the Division of Workmen\u2019s Compensation shall be inspected or copied by anyone unless and until the hereinafter form is signed by the persons seeking such inspection:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJp\">I, the undersigned, do hereby state under penalty of the law, that I seek the inspection or copying of the records of the Division of Workmen\u2019s Compensation concerning ............\u00a1............... on behalf of .................................................. (employer) in connection with a pending workmen\u2019s compensation ease by said....................................... (petitioner.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-10\">Date: .....................\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-11\">This directive is based upou <em>chapter </em>164 of the <em>Laws of </em>1966, effective June 18, 1966. The word \u201canyone\u201d appearing therein, we are told, is \u201conly meant to refer to parties covered by <em>chapter </em>164, and it is applied by the Division in accordance with this construction.\u201d If that is so the directive should have been no broader in its limitation than <em>chapter </em>164.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-12\">Manifestly, validity of the directive depends upon the statute upon which it is bottomed. Accordingly, we concern ourselves only with the challenge made to the constitutionality of this statute. In substance then, the new statute and directive thereunder would accomplish essentially what the executive order and Commissioner\u2019s regulation in the former case were intended to effect\u2014preclusion of a commercial agency from inspecting and copying workmen's compensation records for the purpose of informing employers of the industrial accident histories of prospective employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number><em>Chapter </em>164 represents a departure from the previous legislative policy with reference to workmen\u2019s compensation records. <em>B. S. </em>34:15-59 had provided: \u201cSuch records shall be open to the inspection of the public.\u201d The present enactment states plainly that they shall <em>not </em>be open to inspection and copying by persons who seek such inspection or copying in order to sell or furnish the information thus gathered to others \u201cfor a consideration,\u201d except in connection with any pending workmen\u2019s compensation case. Thus, plaintiff reporting agency is now effectively precluded from inspecting these records in order to supply employers with the workmen\u2019s compensation histories of prospective employees. On the other hand, the employers themselves have free access to these records for the very purpose for which the reporting agency has been heretofore engaged to gather the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">It is clear, then, that the law discriminates between those who may and those who may not inspect and copy these records\u2014albeit the purpose for the inspection and the copying is the same. The issue is whether such discrimination comports with the constitutional guarantees of due process of law and the equal protection of the laws. <em>United States Constitution, Amendment </em>XIV, <em>Section </em>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Not all classifications for purposes of Legislation are invalid. It is the invidious discrimination, lacking any valid basis for its existence, which violates the constitutional mandates. <em>David v. Vesta, </em>45 <em>N. J. </em>301 (1965). In that case, our Supreme Court upheld the New Jersey \u201cLaw against Discrimination,\u201d <em>N. J. S. A. </em>18 :25-1 <em>et seq., </em>applicable generally to the sale or rental of housing accommodations, even though accommodations in single-family homes and in certain two-family homes and three-family residences were not covered. As the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-6\">\u201cMore specifically, evils in the same field may be of different dimensions and proportions, and the reform may therefore take one step at a time, attacking- the evil where it seems most acute to the legislative mind.\u201d (at <em>p. </em>315)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>The court noted that the one who assails legislative classification must carry the burden of showing its arbitrariness. It further observed that a legislative classification having some reasonable basis is not invalid merely because it is not made with mathematical nicetjr or because in practice it results in some inequality. (45 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>pp. </em>314-315)</p>\n<p id=\"Ac0\"><em>David v. Vesta </em>reiterated what Chief Justice Weintraub had said earlier for the court in <em>New Jersey Restaurant Ass\u2019n v. Holderman, </em>24 <em>N. J. </em>295 (1957) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-4\">\u201cThus it is not enough to demonstrate that the legislative objective might be more fully achieved by another, more expansive classification, for the Legislature may recognize degrees of harm and hit the evil where it is most felt. * * * The Legislature may thus limit its action upon a decision to proceed cautiously, step by step, or because of practical exigencies, including administrative convenience and expense, * * * or because of \u2018some substantial consideration of public policy or convenience or the service of the general welfare.\u2019 * * * Hence it may \u2018stop short of those cases in which the harm to the few concerned is thought less important than the harm to the public that would ensue if the rule laid down were made mathematically exact.\u2019 \u201d (at <em>pp. </em>300-301)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">In that case the Commissioner of Labor and Industry had made a minimum fair wages standards order relating to restaurant occupations, but excepted restaurants operating in hotels. The order was held to be not violative of the equal protection clause because of such classification. The Chief Justice noted that \"where an act of the Legislature is challenged, there is no way to corral the considerations which moved the individual lawmakers to vote for the measure * * *; and if any state of facts can reasonably be conceived which would support the classification, the act must be sustained.\u201d (at <em>p. </em>301)</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">In our earlier opinion we found lacking any reasonable basis for distinguishing between an employer\u2019s agent or employee, who would be permitted to inspect and copy the records, and the employer\u2019s chosen independent contractor, who would not. 83 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>p. </em>301. We also found invidious the former classification which would deny the right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>a reporting agency to inspect and copy the records <em>before </em>the employment commenced, but permit it at any time <em>after </em>the hiring, no matter for what purpose or how short that period might be. The latter infirmity does not exist in the present statute and directive under review. The commercial agency is barred from inspection and copying <em>before and after </em>the hiring, except as to a pending workmen\u2019s compensation case. As to our assertion that the distinction between an employer\u2019s agent and his independent contractor was \u201carbitrary and discriminatory,\u201d 83 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>p. </em>301, the Supreme Court did not base its decision thereon, or express concurrence in that rationale. Eather, it found the regulation in question \u201cnot appropriate to the end in mind,\u201d 46 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>p. </em>165, and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-5\">\u201cA regulation denying access to the records by an independent agency which interferes with the basic objectives of the compensation law described above, with standards suitably expressed to forewarn, would be to the point.\u201d (at <em>p. </em>166)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">It went on to conclude, as noted above, that nothing it said \u201c'should be thought to question the power of the Legis!ature to deal with the problem.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">We noted in our former opinion, 83 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>p. </em>298, that the common law right of a citizen to inspect public records has never been an unlimited one. The right has been subject to the requirement of a lawful, proper and legitimate purpose and that it be \u201cnot adverse to the public interest.\u201d In adopting <em>chapter </em>164 the Legislature has evidently concluded that inspection and copying of workmen\u2019s compensation records of past histories of prospective employees, when done by commercial agencies such as plaintiff, is adverse to the public interest. It might have barred all persons, including prospective employers, from such an inspection, because of its solicitude for those disabled by reason of prior industrial accidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">Our public policy, as expressed in many provisions of our Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, is to help rather than hinder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>the disabled in their search for employment. The labor unions have for many years importuned the Legislature to restrain reporting activities such as those of plaintiff, particularly deemed obnoxious on account of the scare-type advertising indulged in. They expressed concern as to the adverse impact upon those seeking employment who had been or might be unfortunate victims of an industrial accident and honestly asserted a claim for benefits under the act. That serious, potential, adverse effect is well described by Justice Francis in his dissenting opinion in the former case. 46 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>pp. </em>167-170. Plaintiff\u2019s latest advertising brochure has been toned down, but its solitary and so-called \u201ctypical report\u201d detailed therein reflects that employee \u201cJohn Doe\u201d made 13 claims for workmen\u2019s compensation benefits, in seven of which \u201cno award\u201d was made. This selected and obviously extreme example of an accident-prone and oft-unworthy claimant speaks for itself. The warning \u201cWhy hire by Crystal Ball?\u201d present in the former brochure is repeated. A prior restraint upon a reversion to what plaintiff has done in the past in its advertising or what other similar agencies might do is not feasible in the face of the constitutional hurdles of freedom of speech and of the press.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">There is a conflict between plaintiff\u2019s commercial enterprise, because of its potentiality to induce the non-hiring of those previously disabled in industrial accidents, and the public policy of the State encouraging the employment of the disabled. The ready availability of plaintiff\u2019s services at a nominal cost, encouraged by its advertising no matter how innocuous it may presentty appear to be, has a tendency offensive to the public policy. The Legislature, in its wisdom, could properly find a substantial good to be accomplished, <em>viz., </em>the employment of the disabled, and an evil to be eliminated, <em>viz., </em>commercial activities disclosing for a profit to employers prior workmen\u2019s compensation histories of prospective employees with the consequential non-hiring of the victims of industrial accidents, no matter how honest were their claims. Its adoption of <em>chapter </em>164 may be re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>garded at least as a first step in fulfillment of its purpose. Substantive due process has been thus satisfied; and the distinction between who may and who may not inspect the records is not invidious to the point of denying plaintiff agency equal protection of the laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">We find lacking in merit plaintiff\u2019s contentions that <em>chapter </em>164 is invalid as a \u201cbill of attainder\u201d and also constitutes a palpable abridgment of freedom of speech. This statute is not a bill of attainder. \u201cThe singling out of an individual for legislatively prescribed punishment constitutes an attainder * * <em>Communist Party v. S. A. C. Board, </em>367 <em>U. S. </em>1, 86, 81 <em>S. Ct. </em>1357, 1405, 6 <em>L. Ed. 2d </em>625 (1961). Plaintiff agency has not been thus singled out. The statute is applicable to all similarly situated and will apply to others organized in the future. \u201cLegislatures may act to curb behavior which they regard as harmful to the public welfare, whether that conduct is found to be engaged in by many persons or by one.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at <em>p. </em>88, 81 <em>S. Ct., </em>at <em>p. </em>1406.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Nor has plaintiff\u2019s freedom of speech been enjoined by the statute. The dissemination of information is not absolute. It may be limited in order to obviate a threat to the public welfare. <em>Gibson v. Florida Investigating Committee, </em>372 <em>U. S. </em>539, 83 <em>S. Ct. </em>889, 9 <em>L. Ed. 2d </em>929 (1963). There are instances where denial of access to public records has been upheld as valid. See cases cited in our former opinion, 83 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>pp. </em>298\u2014299, and in Justice Francis\u2019 dissent, 46 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>p. </em>167. Presumably, the Legislature found a threat to the public welfare to exist when it enacted this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The Supreme Court expressed concern in its opinion, 46 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>p. </em>166, that the executive order and administrative ruling then involved might offend the existing statutory law, <em>e. g., R. S. </em>34:15-59, requiring that workmen\u2019s compensation records \u201cshall be open to the inspection of the public,\u201d and the \u201cEight to Know\u201d law, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>47:1A-1 <em>et seq. </em>That same concern does not exist in the present situation because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>the statute under review is an express legislative supplement of <em>Title </em>34, <em>Chapter </em>15.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">If this appeal had been limited to the question of the propriety of the trial court\u2019s denial of the preliminary injunction, we would have had no hesitancy in affirming that order. <em>Chapter </em>164 is presumptively valid. Plaintiffs, moreover, did not demonstrate the probability of irreparable harm being sustained by them pending a final determination. See <em>Citizens Coach Co. v. Camden Horse R. R. Co., </em>29 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>299 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1878). An interlocutory injunction should not issue if plaintiff\u2019s asserted rights are not clear as a matter of law. <em>General Electric Co. v. Gem Vacuum Stores, </em>36 <em>N. J. Super. </em>234, 236 <em>(App. Div. </em>1955). Certainly, that was the situation here.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">We hold that <em>chapter </em>164 of the <em>Laws of </em>1966 and Directive Uo. 14 of the Division of Workmen\u2019s Compensation are constitutional and valid. Accordingly, the interlocutory order denying plaintiffs\u2019 application for a preliminary injunction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">The matter is remanded to the Law Division for entry of a judgment declaring the statute and directive valid and denying the application for a permanent injunction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
