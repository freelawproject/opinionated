A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AxU\">Plaintiff sued her husband for maintenance and support for herself and the infant child of their marriage. The Chancery Division entered judgment for defendant. Plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">We gather these facts from the record: The parties were married on March 1, 1959. Plaintiff had a 15-year-old daughter by a previous marriage. It was planned that she would live with them and that defendant\u2019s mother, then residing in Hungary, would be brought to this country and that she would likewise live in their home. In September 19'61 a daughter was born of the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">The mother-in-law arrived on September 11, 1964; she was cordially received and took up residence with her son and daughter-in-law, they having obtained larger quarters for this purpose. It is undisputed that during the previous <em>Sy2 </em>years the marriage \u201cwas a very loving relationship\u201d; in the words of the wife, \u201cWe had as perfect a marriage as any marriage could be.\u201d Discord, however, soon developed. It is unnecessary to recount the details that generated an atmosphere of irritation. Suffice it to say, within a very short time after the arrival of the mother-in-law the incompatibility between her and plaintiff caused a disintegration of the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">The only witnesses at the trial were the litigants themselves. The wife testified that her husband\u2019s attitude toward her changed, she lost 20 pounds in weight, and the situation became \u201cas good as unbearable.\u201d A marriage counsellor and a psychiatrist were consulted, both of whom suggested that the mother-in-law move out of the apartment. When the wife told her husband that the prevailing conditions could not continue and that he would have to choose between living with her or living with his mother, \u201cHe chose to live with his mother.\u201d She stated that upon her suggestion that the mother-in-law \u201ccould live in a furnished room and eat with us and visit with us and stay with us during the day,\u201d de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>fendant said \u201che didn\u2019t bring bis mother over from Hungary so she could live in a furnished room.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Plaintiff, with her two daughters, left defendant on July 9, 1965. To a question whether her mother-in-law was present at the time she moved out, plaintiff replied, \u201cwhen the movers came, my husband was ready to leave for work. He kissed me good-bye with tears in his eyes, and his mother just sat there and Laughed out loud.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Defendant testified that his mother did not interfere with the functions of tlie household; he stated that he would accept his wife hack if she would live up to her agreement. He was interrogated from the bench as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-7\">\u201cThe Court: * \u00bb * As I understand it, prior to the time you got married, your wife agreed that your mother could come to live with you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-8\">The Witness : Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-9\">The Court : <em>Now, </em>supposing she hadn\u2019t agreed to let your mother come to live with you, would you have gotten married to her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-10\">The Witness : I don\u2019t think so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-11\">The Court : Well, now, if your wife would live up to her first agreement that your mother can live with you and her, would you want to go back to her again?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-12\">The Witness : Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-13\">It appears that this testimony weighed heavily in the deliberations of the trial judge who declared in his oral opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-14\">\u201c* \u00ab \u00ab tender ordinary circumstances, * <em>* </em>* [following] the holding of tlie Court in <em>Fraser vs. Fraser [infral, </em>a wife would be the mistress of her own home, and where the presence of a mother-in-law would\u2014or father-in-law would prohibit that, then, of course, she will have the prerogative of saying that one roof is not big enough for two females to reside under, and she would then be in a position to give her husband the choice of either herself or his mother, as in this ease. However, here we have a factor which does not, in my opinion, bring it within the perfect view' of the ruling in <em>Fraser vs. Fraser. * </em>* * [T]he marital contract was entered into conditioned upon the mother being a part of the household * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AhJ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>To the extent that the decision of the trial court is predicated upon any assumption that an enforceable ante-nuptial agreement existed, it is erroneous. We find the evidence insufficient to establish a contract. There was no more than planning and an expression of intent. In addition, under the statute of frauds, oral agreements in contemplation of marriage are unenforceable, <em>R. S. </em>25:1-5(c), and marriage is not such a part performance \u201cas will avert the operation of the statute and render it enforceable in equity.\u201d <em>Herr v. Herr, </em>13 <em>N. J. </em>79, 87 (1953). See also <em>Gilbert v. Gilbert, </em>61 <em>N. J. Super. </em>476 <em>(Ch. Div. </em>1960), affirmed 66 <em>N. J. Super. </em>246, 251 <em>(App. Div. </em>1961). Moreover, plaintiff carried out the premarriage arrangement to accept her mother-in-law into her house, and there is nothing in the record to suggest that she did not act in good faith. Rarely, however, will affirmative promises, indefinite as to duration, be interpreted as calling for perpetual performance. 1 <em>Willis-ton on Contracts (3d ed. </em>1957), \u00a7 38, <em>p. </em>113. Note, <em>Esslinger\u2019s, Inc. v. Alachnowicz, </em>68 <em>N. J. Super. </em>339, 350 <em>(App. Div. </em>1961). That salutary legal concept is certainly applicable in matters of domestic relations where the policy of our law is to preserve the marriage and eliminate contentious elements that do violence to it. \u201cThe home which a husband is obligated to provide for his wife must be one where she is free from abuse, violence, and interference by other persons, including his relatives.\u201d 26 <em>Am. Jur., Husband and Wife, </em>\u00a7 338, <em>p. </em>936 (1940). For that reason the understanding between the parties, to the extent that it may he considered as one to keep the parent in the household indefinitely, may not he enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Subsequent to the filing of the notice of appeal, the trial judge rendered a written opinion in which he declared that the single question for determination was whether the wife justifiably left her husband. He concluded, \u201c* * * the mother\u2019s presence there did not in any way give plaintiff any sufficient excuse or reason whatsoever to abandon the defendant, and the Court so finds.\u201d The opinion makes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>reference to <em>Fraser v. Fraser, </em>87 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>633 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1917), and <em>Gleason v. </em>Gleason, 15 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>197, 190 A. 82 <em>(Ch. </em>1936), affirmed o. b. 121 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>251 <em>(E. </em>A. 1937), with the comment that, \u201cThe proofs herein differ from the cases cited.\u201d We are convinced from our study of the record that, in the light of the rationale enunciated in the cited cases and similar authorities, the facts do not support the conclusions reached by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">In <em>Fraser </em>there was a petition for divorce based on the wife\u2019s desertion. She countered that the conduct of her mother-in-law, who lived in the same household, made her life intolerable, depreciating her position as mistress of the home, exposing her to humiliation and depriving her \u201cof the comfort and happiness she had a right to enjoy.\u201d In reversing the decision of the Court of Chancery which granted a divorce to the husband, the Court of Errors and Appeals held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-6\">\u201c* * \u201c This attitude [of neutrality] on the part of the husband is not, perhaps, such legal cruelty that it would justify a wife in leaving the home, but there is a species of cruelty which cuts deeper than a blow or the lash, and that is the weakening of a husband\u2019s love and affection through the disparagement of the wife by the husband\u2019s mother, and when not resented by him, but apparently sustained, is bound to destroy the happiness of the home. Under the circumstances it is his duty to remove the cause, and if he refuses it is a potent element in the consideration of the questions whether he did not consent to the separation, and whether he made a <em>bona fide </em>effort to induce his wife to return.\u201d (87 <em>N. J. Eq., </em>at <em>pp. </em>634-635)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Tbe <em>Gleason </em>case also involved a liusband who sought a decree of divorce on the ground of desertion. The court, however, dismissed his petition and the wife prevailed on her counterclaim for maintenance for herself and their children. There, the husband found it necessary, for business reasons, to move to Connecticut. He refused to take his wife and insisted that she live with his mother. The wife objected, asserting that she would live in one room if need bo rather than reside with her mother-in-law, but her spouse remained \u201cobdurate in his insistment.\u201d The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>decided that a husband is not privileged to deliberately select a place of residence so distasteful to his wife that she cannot be happy therein, saying, \u201cshe is entitled to a home in which she alone is mistress. It may of necessity be nothing more than a hovel on the edge of a swamp and she is in duty bound to go there but it is her privilege to be mistress thereof.\u201d (15 <em>N. J. Misc., </em>at <em>p. </em>200; 190 <em>A., </em>at <em>p. </em>83). See <em>Busboom v. Busboom, </em>187 <em>A. 2d </em>122, 123 <em>(D. C. Mun. Ct. App. </em>1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">An earlier case, <em>Riker v. Riker, </em>110 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>46 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1932), dealt with a husband who left his wife and made a home for his mother when the wife insisted upon finding the mother a place to live elsewhere than in the home of the parties. The court there observed: \u201cHowever commendable such display of filial duty may be, it is going far to say that such devotion may be permitted to conflict with the conjugal duty a husband owes to his wife.\u201d (At <em>p. </em>47) Accord, <em>Spafford v. Spafford, </em>199 <em>Ala. </em>300, 74 <em>So. </em>354, 357 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1917); <em>DeMauriac v. DeMauriac, </em>243 <em>Mich. </em>385, 220 <em>N. W. </em>786 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1928); <em>Brewer v. Brewer, </em>79 <em>Neb. </em>713, 113 <em>N. W. </em>161, 162, 13 <em>L. R. A. (N. S.) </em>222 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1907). A poignant observation in a Louisiana case is here appropriate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-5\">\u201c* * * rUt is common knowledge to all experienced in such matters that the female members of the husband\u2019s family frequently create, either intentionally or unintentionally an unsettled or disturbed condition of mind in the wife which is destructive of her happiness and comfort.\u201d <em>Verret v. Koelmel, </em>162 <em>La. </em>277, 110 <em>So. </em>421-422 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1926).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Here, the trial judge seemed to think that plaintiff had to prove positive, affirmative interference by the mother-in-law to justify her leaving. That is not so. While the evidence fails to establish direct interference on the part of defendant\u2019s mother in the wife\u2019s management of the physical and functional operations of the apartment, it abundantly demonstrates that the mother\u2019s presence, and the effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>thereof upon plaintiff, constituted such a serious psychological interference with the wife\u2019s enjoyment of her rightful status that within a few weeks her otherwise happy marriage of over live years was wrecked. See <em>Doucet v. Doucet, </em>158 <em>So. 2d </em>896, 899-900 <em>(La. Gt. App. </em>1963); <em>Verrel v. Koelmel, supra; Donald v. Donald, </em>155 <em>Pa. Super. </em>90, 38 <em>A. 2d </em>376, 378 <em>(Super. Ct. </em>1944); <em>Holloway v. Holloway, </em>203 <em>S. C. </em>339, 27 <em>S. E. 2d </em>457, 458 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1943); <em>Horkheimer v. Horkheimer, </em>106 <em>W. Va. </em>634, 146 <em>S. E. </em>614 <em>(Sup. Ct. App. </em>1929). Because of the continued presence of the mother-in-law, the Koch family, once united in domestic tranquility, became disturbingly fractious and discontented, culminating in a separation which might have been avoided had defendant taken reasonable and affirmative measures to eliminate the source of the friction and to save the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Plaintiff gave evidence that after she left her husband she communicated with him and on one occasion said, \u201cthere was so much love between us, it couldn\u2019t have all died.\u201d She continued, \u201cHo didn\u2019t say anything to that.\u201d Plaintiff also told the court that she would go back to live with her husband if his mother were to live elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">The husband chose a position of neutrality when it was within his probable power to effectuate a solution of the familial difficulties. We hold, in the circumstances of this ease, that the departure of the wife from the household was not obstinate but was justified and the separation is to be regarded as consensual on defendant\u2019s part. The separation being justifiable, the plaintiff is entitled to relief under <em>N. J. S. 2 A </em>:34-24. <em>Fraser v. Fraser, supra; Gleason v. Gleason, supra. </em>See generally 42 <em>C. J.
