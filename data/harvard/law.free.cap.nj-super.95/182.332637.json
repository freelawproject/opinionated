A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Akq\">Morgan Hand II died January 19, 1966 leaving a last will and testament dated December <em>23, </em>1964 which was admitted to probate January 31, 1966. The central issue of this appeal is whether Elisabeth J. Hand, his only child, has standing to contest the will. In it testator named his wife Mary G. Hand (herein plaintiff) as executrix and his daughter (herein defendant) as contingent executrix. He gave his daughter a specific legacy of $10,000 and directed that his residuary estate be paid to his wife, with a provision for payment thereof to the daughter in the event his wife should not survive him.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">Defendant filed a complaint in the County Court, Probate Division, demanding that the judgment of probate be set aside and that plaintiff-executrix be required to re-offer the will for probate in solemn form. She claimed (1) the will was not executed in accordance with <em>N. J. S. </em>3A <em>:3-2 et seq.; (2) </em>pursuant to a compact with plaintiff to make mutual, reciprocal and irrevocable wills, decedent had signed a prior will dated February 16, 1955 and plaintiff had made a similar will, and (3)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-9\">\u201c* * &gt;:&lt; By the terms 0f said mutual and reciprocal wills, * * * <em>[Elisabeth J. Hand\\ is the ultimate irrevocable beneficiary of either party talcing under either of said, mutual wills. </em>The alleged last will and testament of said Morgan Hand II dated December 23, 1964, breaches said compact, and it is contended that said breach was neither intended nor understood to have been effectuated by Morgan Hand II, and that said breach resulted to the detriment of * <em>* </em>* Elisabeth J. Hand.\u201d (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>The matter was brought on for hearing before the trial court by an order to show cause, at which time the court considered the pleadings, tlie record before the surrogate, affidavits of plaintiff-executrix and defendant-caveator, and the arguments of counsel. Plaintiff moved to dismiss defendant\u2019s complaint, and defendant, by a cross-motion, sought to take depositions and to pursue discovery with respect to the validity of the 1964 will. The trial court found defendant was not an aggrieved person under <em>R. R. 5 </em>:3-4(a) or an interested person under <em>R. R. </em>5 :3-4(b) and that she lacked standing to challenge the probate of the 1964 will.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">It is undisputed that decedent\u2019s 1955 and 1964 wills contain the same plan of testamentary disposition, except that the earlier instrument did not include a specific legacy to Elisabeth; under each will testator\u2019s wife, if she survived, was designated sole residuary beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Elisabeth\u2019s affidavit asserted that her parents executed identical, reciprocal wills under the terms of which she was \u201cthe ultimate and irrevocable beneficiary of either party taking under either will.\u201d Mary Hand deposed in her affidavit that, \u201cAt no time was there any type of a prior agreement, arrangement or understanding as to the disposition of our respective property upon our deaths except as each of us have provided in our wills.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Elisabeth premises her claim of standing to challenge the 1964 will on the following hypothesis: Her father\u2019s execution of the 1964 will was a breach of the 1955 agreement with his wife to make mutual wills; the breach of that agreement gives her mother the right to make any will she chooses and, thus, presents the possibility that she (Elisabeth) may not be the ultimate recipient of the estate now valued at approximately one-half million dollars. Elisabeth claims that the 1955 agreement gave her a vested interest which she must now move to protect because her mother refuses to challenge the 1964 will or to seek enforcement of the 1955 agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">The trial judge, in determining that defendant was not an aggrieved or interested person within the contemplation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number><em>R. R. </em>5:3-4, declared in his oral opinion, \u201cI see nothing in the record except affirmative admissions as to the validity of the 1955 will. The affidavit of the caveator in Paragraph III admits the validity of the 1955 will, and under the 1955 will she was nothing hut a contingent beneficiary.\u201d Defense counsel directed the court\u2019s attention to the seventh paragraph of Elisabeth\u2019s affidavit which reads, \u201cThat [1955] will, too, could be held to be invalid,\u201d whereupon the trial judge stated :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-4\">\u201cIt is a legal argument. It is a suggestion that the will could be held invalid. Anything could be. Mere imaginary possibilities could arise, and that is about the degree to which the argument in Paragraph VII rises * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-5\">There is nothing factually in the record to support the contention that the 1955 will was a product of any testamentary incapacity, fraud or deceit or undue influence, failure to comply with the proper execution requirements of the will. In fact, * * * the basis upon which this lady comes into court is that she had some type of mutual arrangement entered into between her father and her mother of which she is the beneficiary, and that is the thrust of her argument.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">On appeal to this court counsel for defendant urges in his brief that the argument that Elisabeth would receive more under the second will than she would receive under the first \u201coverlooks the contention of the defendant that the first Will was part of a mutually irrevocable compact, enforceable in a court of equity.\u201d That argument presupposes the validity of the 1955 will.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Assuming, without deciding, that decedent and his wife did in 1955 execute mutual and irrevocable wills to accord with an agreement supported by a valid consideration, and that the agreement was not terminated by them by mutual consent, the fact remains that even under the 1955 will the entire estate was left to Mary Hand to do with as she pleases during her lifetime. Defendant\u2019s remedy is not to prevent the probate of the 1964 will hut to seek equitable enforcement of the contract against the estate of her mother by impressing a trust upon the assets. See <em>Gromek v. Giizela, </em>36 <em>N. J. Super. </em>212, 217 <em>(App. Div. </em>1955); <em>Bank of Bogota v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number><em>Hess, </em>27 <em>N. J. Super. </em>91, 94 <em>(Ch. Div. </em>1953); <em>Callahan v. Federal Trust Co., </em>126 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>311, 313 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1939); <em>Tooker v. Vreeland, </em>92 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>340, 342 <em>(Ch. </em>1921), affirmed o. b., <em>sub nom. Tooker v. Maple, </em>93 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>224 <em>(E. &amp; A</em>. 921). See also 6 <em>Powell, Real Property </em>(1965), <em>par. </em>962, <em>p. </em>474; Annotation, \u201cJoint, mutual, and reciprocal wills,\u201d 169 <em>A. L. R. </em>9, 55-58 (1947); Annotation, \u201cEight of beneficiary to enforce contract between third persons to provide for him by will,\u201d 2 <em>A. L.

Hence, the probating <em>vel non </em>of the 1964 will would in no way enhance or diminish defendant\u2019s rights or benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\"> On the face of the 3964 will, defendant receives more than under the 3 955 will. The assertion that the later instrument breaches the collateral agreement allegedly made by her parents does not provide status for defendant to challenge it. See 5 <em>N. J. Practice (Clapp, Wills and Administration) (3d ed. </em>1962), \u00a7 120, <em>p. </em>212. It is essential that a contestant demonstrate aggrievement by the judgment of probate. <em>In re Coleman\u2019s Will, </em>27 <em>N. J. Super. </em>532, 535-536 <em>(App. Div. </em>1953) ; <em>In re Myers\u2019 Will, </em>20 <em>N. J. </em>228, 235 (1955). See also <em>In re Holibaugh\u2019s Will, </em>18 <em>N. J. </em>229, 232 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">It is urged, however, that the controversy at bar is controlled by <em>In re Lent, </em>142 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>21 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1948). There, the appellants were next of kin of Ella M. Lent who died in 1946. The will offered for probate was executed one month before her death and divided her estate into three parts, two parts going to charitable institutions and the third to respondent-executrix, a person not related to testatrix. Under a 1927 will testatrix gave her entire estate to various charities. Appellants filed a caveat to the probate of the 1946 will and the master to whom the matter was referred concluded that appellants had not made out a case and the will should be admitted to probate. On review, the vice-ordinary held that if the will of 1946 were declared invalid the will of 1927 would be effective and, since appellants took nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>thereunder, they had no standing to attack the later will; their appeal was dismissed. That determination was reversed by the Court of Errors and Appeals which held that \u201cin a case of this kind, involving the validity of a will, the next of kin, those who would take an interest in the event of intestacy, do have a standing to attack any and all wills of a decedent.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at <em>p. 22) </em>The court recognized that the 1927 will might also be contested, and noted the argument of appellants that they be given the opportunity of presenting evidence impugning the validity of that instrument. It was ruled, however, that the 1927 will could not have been attacked in the proceedings then pending since the will had not been offered for probate and the parties in interest, the beneficiaries and the executor, were not in court and could not be bound by a decree against their interests, the court saying, \u201cTherefore, it would seem that the only course which the appellants could pursue was to make their attack upon the will offered and if successful then make a further attack upon the earlier will when it was offered, as it would have to be.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at <em>p. </em>23)</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">\u25a0 <em>Lent </em>should be read in light of the time of its decision and the facts then under consideration. In the present case those interested in the respective wills are identical and all parties are before the court. A plenary trial and decision nullifying the probate of the 1964 will would not establish intestacy and the controversy would remain unresolved until the validity of the 1955 will was determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The objectives of <em>Art. </em>6, \u00a7 III, <em>par. </em>4 of our 1947 <em>Constitution </em>mandate the judiciary to give vitality to the \u201csingle controversy\u201d doctrine and to apply it when the ends of justice so require \u201cin any cause so that all matters in controversy between the parties may be completely determined.\u201d See, <em>e. g., </em>2 <em>Schnitzer and Wildstein, New Jersey Rules Service </em>A-IV-933 <em>et seq. </em>(1957); 5 <em>N. J. Practice, op cit., </em>at <em>pp. </em>212-213, <em>n. </em>13; <em>Ajamian v. Schlanger, </em>14 <em>N. J. </em>483, 485 (1954), <em>certiorari </em>denied 348 <em>U. S. </em>835, 75 <em>S. Ct. </em>58, 99 <em>L. Ed. </em>659 (1954); <em>Curley v. Curley, </em>37 <em>N. J. Super. </em>351, 358-360 <em>(App. Div. </em>1955). Recently, in <em>Falcone v. Middle-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number><em>sex County Med. Soc., </em>47 <em>N. J. </em>92, 94 (1966), our Supreme Court noted that \u201celemental considerations of fairness to the other party and the urgent need for eliminating the delay and wastage incident to the fragmentation of litigation dictated that all of the aspects of the plaintiff\u2019s controversy with the defendant be included within his legal proceeding.\u201d <em>Cf. In re Irvin\u2019s Estate, </em>19 <em>Misc. 2d </em>41, 186 <em>N. Y. S. 2d </em>500 (Surr. <em>Ct. </em>1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Subsequent to oral argument the court wrote to counsel requesting a clarification of defendant\u2019s position, in particular whether she concedes the validity of the 1955 will. In reply to that communication a memorandum of law was filed reasserting the rationale of <em>In re Lent, supra, </em>and citing authorities which we do not find controlling. The memorandum concluded with the statement, \u201cAppellant [Elisabeth Hand! neither admits nor denies the validity of the 1955 will * *</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">There is ample authority for a probate court to determine at one hearing the validity or invalidity of all existing wills of a testator. See 3 <em>Page on Wills (Bowe-Parker Revision </em>1961), \u00a7 2643, <em>p. </em>95, for the comment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-7\">\u201c* * i: In many eases a better understanding of the situation can be had and much time can be saved by determining the validity or invalidity of all of the wills at one hearing. Power of this sort has been held to exist; and the probate court has been upheld in compelling the submission for probate of other wills, in the proceeding which was started originally for the probate of one will.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">Accord <em>Lillard v.

When, as in the case at bar, it becomes apparent to the court * * * that the real ultimate controversy * * * is not being fully tried, and that in order to finally determine that controversy there will have to be a further trial * * *, it seems to us that the court should on its own motion suspend the proceedings to permit the filing of a petition * * * as to whether or not that later [or earlier] will should be admitted to probate. After that notice has been given, the hearing and trial to be held pursuant thereto can be consolidated with the suspended proceedings * * *. Although no precedent for such procedure has been cited * * * we believe that procedure will be, as Mr. Justice Marshall said in <em>Hocks v. Sprangers, </em>113 <em>Wis. </em>123, 140, 87 <em>N. W. </em>1101, 89 <em>N. W. </em>113, 116 <em>[Sup.
