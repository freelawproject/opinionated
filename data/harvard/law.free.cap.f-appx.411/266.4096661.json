The case involves a claim for unpaid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>workers\u2019 compensation insurance premiums allegedly owed to Liberty Mutual by Eastern Personnel, pursuant to a workers\u2019 compensation policy issued to Eastern Personnel. Liberty Mutual also claims that the president and sole shareholder of Eastern Personnel, Paul Day (\u201cDay\u201d), negligently misrepresented information upon which Liberty Mutual relied to its detriment in issuing the policy to Eastern Personnel and in determining, prior to litigation, the premium due for the policy in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">After conducting a bench trial, the district court issued a twelve-page memorandum opinion finding Eastern Personnel and Day jointly liable to Liberty Mutual for $427,160.62 in unpaid premiums. The district court entered judgment accordingly, and defendants then perfected this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">We review findings of fact made by district courts under the clearly erroneous standard and conclusions of law <em>de novo. Thomas v. Bryant, </em>614 F.3d 1288, 1303 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the judgment entered in favor of Liberty Mutual based on the district court\u2019s well-reasoned opinion filed on March 31, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
