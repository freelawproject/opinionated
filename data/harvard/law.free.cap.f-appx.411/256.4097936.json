Solis\u2019s withholding of removal and CAT claims were based on her assertions that a Honduran newspaper falsely accused her of murdering a third party, and that the victim\u2019s family would seek to harm her if she returned to Guatemala. In her petition for review, Solis argues that the BIA erred and abused its discretion by affirming the IJ\u2019s decision because: (1) \u201cindividuals who are mistakenly identified as murderers\u201d constitute a \u201cparticular social group\u201d under the INA, and thus qualify as a protected class for withholding-of-removal purposes; (2) she sufficiently proved her risk of future persecution by submitting evidence that a Honduran newspaper falsely accused her of murder; and (3) with regard to her CAT claim, the BIA failed to consider all the evidence supporting the claim, and failed to find that the IJ imposed a more stringent burden of proof than is required for CAT relief. After careful review, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">We review the BIA\u2019s decision as the final judgment, unless the BIA has expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir. 2007). Here, the BIA did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s decision and we therefore review only the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-12\">As a preliminary matter, we may not review a final order of removal unless \u201cthe alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). This requirement is jurisdictional, and bars review of claims not raised before the BIA even where the BIA addressed the issue <em>sua sponte. Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250-51 (11th Cir.2006). In the present case, the government argues that we lack jurisdiction to hear Solis\u2019s withholding-of-removal claim because she failed to challenge the IJ\u2019s finding that she could avoid persecution by relocating within Guatemala. Though that finding would be sufficient to defeat her claim, <em>see Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y. Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1375 (11th Cir.2006), we conclude that BIA\u2019s opinion did not incorporate it, and that it thus has no bearing on this appeal. <em>See Ruiz, </em>479 F.3d at 765 (holding that we review only the BIA\u2019s opinion unless it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision). Accordingly, we will consider Solis\u2019s withholding-of-removal arguments. On the other hand, we are deprived of jurisdiction over Solis\u2019s claim for CAT relief because she completely failed to raise it before the BIA. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1250-51.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-13\">We review the BIA\u2019s statutory interpretation <em>de novo. Quinchia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>552 F.3d 1255, 1258 (11th Cir.2008). Under <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984), we \u201cmust defer to an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute it is entrusted with administering if: (1) the lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>guage of the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the particular issue and (2) the agency\u2019s interpretation is reasonable.\u201d <em>Lin v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 555 </em>F.3d 1310, 1316 n. 4 (11th Cir.2009) (emphasis omitted). However, <em>Chevron </em>deference does not apply to non-precedential, single member decisions by the BIA that do not rely on existing BIA or federal court precedent. <em>Quinchia, 552 </em>F.3d at 1258-59. Instead, we may choose to apply \u201cthe lesser level of deference enunciated in <em>Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Company, </em>323 U.S. 134, 140 [65 S.Ct. 161, 89 L.Ed. 124] ... (1944),\u201d which would provide that a single BIA member\u2019s interpretation of a statute is persuasive authority. <em>Id. </em>at 1259. Alternatively, we could remand to the BIA to permit it to interpret the statute in a precedential three-member opinion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">We review the BIA\u2019s factual findings under the substantial-evidence test, <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005), and must affirm the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir. 2001) (internal quotations and citation omitted). Under this test, we view \u201cthe record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc). </em>Accordingly, to \u201cconclude the BIA\u2019s decision should be reversed, we must find that the record not only supports the conclusion, but compels it.\u201d <em>Ruiz, </em>479 F.3d at 765 (internal quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">To qualify for withholding of removal, an alien must show that if returned to her country, her \u201clife or freedom would be threatened in that country because of [her] race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). We interpret the INA\u2019s \u201cwould be threatened\u201d language as requiring the petitioner to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that she will be persecuted or tortured upon removal to her country. <em>Tan, </em>446 F.3d at 1375. The more-likely-than-not standard is not met when the alien can avoid a future threat by relocating to another part of the country designated for removal. <em>Id. </em>An alien must also establish a \u201cnexus\u201d between the feared persecution and a statutorily protected ground, such as membership in a particular social group. <em>Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 438 (11th Cir.2004). In other words, the alien must prove that she will be persecuted \u201cbecause of\u2019 her membership in the group. <em>See id. </em>Acts of private violence do not constitute persecution based on a statutorily protected ground. <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1258 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">We have emphasized that the \u201cparticular social group\u201d language within the INA\u2019s list of protected grounds should not serve as a \u201c \u2018catch all\u2019 for all persons alleging persecution who do not fit elsewhere.\u201d <em>See Castillo-Arias v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1190, 1198 (11th Cir.2006). Pursuant to the BIA, a group may qualify as a particular social group only if it has both immutability and social visibility. <em>See id. </em>at 1194-97 (deferring to the BIA\u2019s definition of \u201cparticular social group\u201d). In analyzing immutability, the BIA looks for characteristics that are \u201cfundamental to [group] members\u2019 individual identities or consciences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1196 (alteration and citation omitted). Examples of such characteristics include sex, color, kinship ties, or in certain circumstances, \u201ca shared past experience such as former military leadership or land ownership.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1193. While past experiences are by their very nature immutable, \u201cthis fact does not mean that any past experience that may be shared by others suffices to define a particular social group.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1194 (quo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>tation and citation omitted). In analyzing social visibility, the BIA looks for characteristics that are \u201chighly visible and recognizable by others in the country in question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">In this case, to the extent the single-member BIA panel interpreted the term \u201cparticular social group\u201d to exclude groups of persons misidentified as murderers by newspapers, we accept that interpretation as persuasive. We have previously stressed that the INA\u2019s \u201cparticular social group\u201d language should not serve as a catch-all for withholding-of-removal claims. We therefore conclude that being misidentified by a newspaper as a murderer falls outside the category of shared experiences that Congress intended to protect. Moreover, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Solis\u2019s fear of future persecution was too speculative to warrant relief. Accordingly, the record neither compels, nor supports, the conclusion that the BIA\u2019s decision should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b283-8\">. Solis also asserted an asylum claim below. We lack jurisdiction to review that claim because the BIA found it to be time-barred. <em>Sanchez Jimenez v. U.S. Att\u2019y. Gen., </em>492 F.3d 1223, 1231 (11th Cir.2007). Moreover, Solis did not challenge the denial of asylum on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
