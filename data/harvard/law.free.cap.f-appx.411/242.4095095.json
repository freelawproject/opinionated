On appeal: (1) the government argues that we lack jurisdiction over this appeal; and (2) Carter argues that the district court abused its discretion by denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce his sentence, pursuant to Amendment 706 of the Sentencing Guidelines. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">We review jurisdictional issues <em>de novo. United States v. Lopez, </em>562 F.3d 1309, 1311 (11th Cir.2009). In \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, we review a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority <em>de novo. United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-11\">As an initial matter, we reject the government\u2019s claim that because Carter\u2019s notice of appeal was untimely, we do not have jurisdiction over this appeal. A defendant\u2019s notice of appeal in a criminal case must be filed in the district court no later than 14 days after the challenged order is entered. Fed.R.App.P. 4(b)(1)(A); <em>see United States v. Fair, </em>326 F.3d 1317, 1318 (11th Cir.2003) (holding that the rules governing criminal cases apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings). Unlike civil appeal rules, the deadline in Rule 4(b) for criminal defendants is not jurisdictional because it is not grounded in a federal statute. <em>Lopez, </em>562 F.3d at 1311-13. Nevertheless, we must apply Rule 4(b)\u2019s time limits upon objection by the government to a defendant\u2019s untimely notice of appeal, which the government may raise for the first time in its brief on appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 1313-14. Under the \u201cprison mailbox rule,\u201d a <em>pro se </em>prisoner\u2019s court filings are considered filed on the date they are delivered to prison authorities to be mailed. <em>Williams v. McNeil, </em>557 F.3d 1287, 1290 n. 2 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 2747, 174 L.Ed.2d 249 (2009). Absent evidence to the contrary, there is a presumption that a prisoner delivered his pleadings to prison officials on \u201cthe day he signed it.\u201d <em>Washington v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 1299, 1301 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-15\">Although not expressly authorized by the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, a motion for reconsideration of an appealable criminal order will toll the time for filing a notice of appeal, and the time will begin to run anew if such motion is filed within the appeal period. <em>United States v. Dieter, </em>429 U.S. 6, 8-9, 97 S.Ct. 18, 50 L.Ed.2d 8 (1976); <em>United States v. Vicaria, </em>963 F.2d 1412, 1413-14 (11th Cir. 1992). Here, the district court denied Carter\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion on May 7, 2010. Carter filed a motion for reconsideration or rehearing, signed on May 17, within the 14-day appeal period. Fed. R.App.P. 4(b)(1)(A); <em>Washington, </em>243 F.3d at 1301. The district court denied Carter\u2019s motion for reconsideration or rehearing on June 15. Carter then filed a notice of appeal, signed on June 22, within the new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>14-day appeal period. Fed.R.App.P. 4(b)(1)(A); <em>Washington, </em>243 F.3d at 1301. Consequently, Carter\u2019s notice of appeal was timely.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">Turning to the merits, we are unpersuaded by Carter\u2019s claim that the district court erred by denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-5\">in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission ... the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Thus, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not permit a reduction in a defendant\u2019s imprisonment term if a retroactive amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guidelines range. <em>Id.; </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2). Moreover, a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding does not constitute a <em>de novo </em>resentencing and \u201call original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000) (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">The Sentencing Commission has made both Amendments 706 and 484 retroactive. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c); <em>see United States v. Armstrong, </em>347 F.3d 905, 909 (11th Cir. 2003) (noting that a Sentencing Guidelines amendment may be applied retroactively only when it is expressly listed in \u00a7 1B1.10(c)). Amendment 706, made retroactive by Amendment 713 in 2008, reduced the base offense level by two levels for most cocaine base offenses. U.S.S.G.App. C, Amends. 706, 713; <em>United States v. Douglas, </em>576 F.3d 1216, 1218 (11th Cir.2009). On the other hand, Amendment 484, which the Sentencing Commission made effective on November 1, 1993, had the effect of excluding certain substances from a defendant\u2019s drug quantity calculation. U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">First, the district court did not err in finding' that Amendment 706 did not lower Carter\u2019s applicable guidelines range. At his original sentencing hearing, the court adopted the PSI and found Carter responsible for at least 30 kilograms of cocaine base. Because Carter\u2019s offense involved more than 4.5 kilograms of cocaine base, Amendment 706 did not lower his applicable guidelines range. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>587 F.3d 1300, 1303 (11th Cir.2009) (noting that Amendment 706 did not lower defendants\u2019 base offense levels if they are responsible for more than 4.5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>kilograms of cocaine base), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2129, 176 L.Ed.2d 750 (2010). Accordingly, the district court properly determined that Carter was ineligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief under Amendment 706. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">In terms of Amendment 484, because the district court sentenced Carter in 2003, Amendment 484, which became effective in November 1993, is not a \u201csubsequent\u201d amendment within the meaning of \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Thus, the district court did not have authority to reduce Carter\u2019s sentence under Amendment 484. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>United States v. Stossel, </em>348 F.3d 1320, 1322 n. 2 (11th Cir.2003) (stating that a motion could be addressed under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) only if the appellant was arguing that his sentence should be modified \u201cbased on a subsequent sentencing guideline amendment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">Finally, to the extent that Carter challenges the district court\u2019s finding at sentencing that his offenses involved at least 30 kilograms of cocaine base, his argument fails because a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding is not a <em>de novo </em>resentencing, and \u201call original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781. Consequently, because Carter does not point to an applicable amendment that would allow him to challenge the district court\u2019s drug quantity calculation, he cannot challenge that finding through a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>Id. </em>Similarly, Carter\u2019s claim that the court violated <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), is unavailing because <em>Apprendi </em>did not involve a retroactively applicable guideline amendment and it did not provide an independent jurisdictional basis to reduce Carter\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005). (explaining that, because \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not provide a basis for a <em>de novo </em>resentencing, Supreme Court decisions by themselves do not provide \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief because they are not retroactively applicable guidelines amendments).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b270-7\">. In <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>597 F.3d 1190 (11th Cir.2010), the district court had initially granted \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief and reduced the defendant\u2019s sentence to 324 months' imprisonment, but after the government filed a motion for reconsideration, it granted tire government's motion and reimposed the defendant\u2019s original sentence of 360 months' imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>at 1192-94. On appeal, we concluded that the district court did not have jurisdiction after seven days had passed to modify and vacate Phillips's 324-month sentence imposed on resentencing, in part because \u201cSection 3582(c)(1)(B) does not in-elude a ten-day motion for reconsideration as an exception to the sentence modification prohibition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1200-01. Notably, the government has not argued in this case that based on <em>Phillips, </em>Carter's motion for reconsideration did not toll the time to appeal since the district court lacked jurisdiction to rule on it. But in any event, the district court here initially <em>denied </em>\u00a7 3582 relief, unlike in <em>Phillips, </em>where the district court initially granted \u00a7 3582 relief and the motion for reconsideration therefore asked the court to correct a resentencing error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b271-10\">. Because Carter does not challenge on appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration, he has abandoned any argument in that respect. <em>See United States v. Nealy, </em>232 F.3d 825, 830-31 (11th Cir.2000) (noting that issues not raised on appeal are abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
