We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-19\">The Plaintiffs brought this civil rights suit in district court based on a series of incidents and altercations at HISD schools involving HISD employees and the Plaintiffs. They consented to proceed before a magistrate judge. In response to the Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the magistrate judge recommended dismissing all of the Plaintiffs\u2019 claims. First, the magistrate judge recommended dismissing the Plaintiffs\u2019 claims on behalf of their children because the Plaintiffs lacked standing to sue as next of kin on behalf of their children, citing <em>Morgan v. Texas, </em>251 FedAppx. 894, 896 n. 2 (5th Cir.2007) (unpublished). Second, the magistrate judge recommended dismissing the Plaintiffs claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, and 1985(2) and (3), because the Plaintiffs did not allege any facts indicating race-based discrimination, nor any facts indicating that a conspiracy existed between the Defendants to deny the Plaintiffs\u2019 their civil rights. Third, the magistrate judge recommended dismissing the Plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 1986 claims because the Plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 1985 claims failed, citing <em>Lockett v. New Orleans City, </em>607 F.3d 992, 1002 (5th Cir.2010) (\u201cHaving failed to demonstrate a claim under \u00a7 1985, by definition Lockett cannot sustain a claim under \u00a7 1986.\u201d). Finally, the magistrate judge recommended dismissing the Plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 1983 claims because, even liberally construed, the Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint did not allege the deprivation of a federally protected right. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s memorandum and recommendation in full and issued a final judgment dismissing all of the Plaintiffs\u2019 claims and denying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>all requested relief. The Plaintiffs timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-3\">On appeal, the Plaintiffs contend that the magistrate judge and district judge should have recused themselves because they each have an interest in the HISD, and that the magistrate judge did not act neutrally but as an advocate for the Defendants. They also argue that \u201c[t]he mootness tagged on this case should ... be reversed and remanded in favor of appellants.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 28. \u201c \u2018Although we liberally construe the briefs of pro se appellants, we also require that arguments must be briefed to be preserved.\u2019 \u201d <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir. 1993) (quoting <em>Price v. Digital Equip. Corp., </em>846 F.2d 1026, 1028 (5th Cir.1988)). The Plaintiffs have made no argument for why the magistrate judge or district judge below should have recused themselves other than the conclusory statement that they had \u201csome kind of form of interest in\u201d the HISD. Furthermore, they have not explained their assertion that the magistrate judge acted improperly as an advocate for the Defendants, nor have they explained why they think that the magistrate judge deemed their claims moot. Besides these arguments, the Plaintiffs have failed to raise any other arguments that the district court erred in dismissing their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">Because the Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate any error in the district court\u2019s judgment, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b765-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
