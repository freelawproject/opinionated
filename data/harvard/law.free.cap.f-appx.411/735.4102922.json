The magistrate judge granted the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment and dismissed the suit. In this appeal, Riley insists that his rights were violated because more than three weeks passed between the day when he fell in the shower and hurt his back and the day when he saw a doctor. Additionally, he contends that defendant Olsen infringed his rights by denying him medication. He moves this court to supplement the record on appeal with medical records that were not presented to the magistrate judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-24\">We review the grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo. <em>Dillon v. Rogers, </em>596 F.3d 260, 266 (5th Cir.2010). A prisoner raises a viable claim of deliberate indifference to medical needs by showing that an official \u201cknows of and disregards an excessive risk to [his] health or safety.\u201d <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994); <em>Gobert v. Caldwell, </em>463 F.3d 339, 346 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-25\">Our review of the record and Riley\u2019s brief shows no error in the magistrate judge\u2019s decision. Rather, this review shows only that Riley disagrees with the treatment he was given, which is insuffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>dent to show deliberate indifference to serious medical needs. <em>See Gobert, </em>463 F.3d at 346; <em>Domino v. Texas Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, </em>239 F.3d 752, 756 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">The judgment is AFFIRMED, and Riley\u2019s motion to supplement the record is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b761-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
