For the following reasons, we will summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-13\">Yanez-Garcia, a federal prisoner currently incarcerated at FCI Allenwood in White Deer, Pennsylvania, pleaded guilty in 1999 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas to drug-related charges. <em>See United States v. Yanez-Garcia, </em>No. 99-cr-00055-l (S.D.Tex.). There is no indication that he appealed the verdict or his sentence, nor does he appear to have collaterally challenged the conviction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-15\">On July 8, 2010, Yanez-Garcia filed a petition for habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241 and 2243, within which he attacked the circumstances surrounding his guilty plea \u2014 specifically, the failure by both counsel and the presiding judge to warn him of the \u201cstrong possibility of deportation sanctions\u201d attendant to a conviction. This defective pleading process, he charged, violated his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel and his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process, as the plea was obtained in violation of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11. The District Court held that these claims should have been brought in a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Moreover, the mere fact that Yanez-Garcia was likely barred from filing a \u00a7 2255 motion due to the one-year Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) statute of limitations did not render \u00a7 2255 relief inadequate or ineffective. Thus, as Yanez-Garcia did not qualify for the \u201csafety valve\u201d exception to \u00a7 2255, the District Court dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-16\">We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. In reviewing the denial of a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition, we \u201cexercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions and apply a clearly erroneous standard to its findings of fact.\u201d <em>See O\u2019Donald v. Johns, </em>402 F.3d 172, 173 n. 1 (3d Cir.2005); <em>see also United States v. Friedland, </em>83 F.3d 1531, 1542 (3d Cir.1996) (\u201cOur review of the district court\u2019s order denying ... relief under 28 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 is plenary.\u201d). If the instant appeal does not present a substantial question, we may summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s decision. <em>See </em>LAR 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6; <em>United States v. Baptiste, </em>223 F.3d 188, 190 n. 3 (3d Cir.2000); <em>Tourscher v. McCullough, </em>184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">We are in full accord with the opinion of the District Court. It is well settled that \u201c[mjotions pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 are the presumptive means by which federal prisoners can challenge their convictions or sentences that are allegedly in violation of the Constitution.\u201d <em>Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120 (3d Cir. 2002). While 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e), sometimes known as the \u201csafety valve\u201d provision, allows a federal prisoner to challenge his conviction or sentence under \u00a7 2241, it affords this relief only if \u201cremedy by [\u00a7 2255] motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). Inadequacy is not presumed simply because the gatekeeping or timeliness requirements of \u00a7 2255 would forestall relief. <em>See Cradle v. United States ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 539 (3d Cir.2002). Instead, appropriate use of the safety valve is limited to rare circumstances, such as when a petitioner \u201chad no earlier opportunity to challenge his conviction for a crime that an intervening change in substantive law [negated].\u201d <em>See In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 251 (3d Cir. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">As Yanez-Garcia explicitly challenges the constitutionality of his conviction, he should have filed a \u00a7 2255 motion. That he is likely barred under the one-year limitations period is irrelevant. YanezGarcia has completely failed to show that he qualifies for relief under the \u201csafety valve.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Therefore, as no substantial questions are presented by this appeal, we will summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
