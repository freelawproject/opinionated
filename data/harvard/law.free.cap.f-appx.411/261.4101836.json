State Farm pled as an affirmative defense that Kinman failed to perform a condition precedent to the entitlement of benefits under the policy by refusing to attend a scheduled medical examination as required by the policy. The district court granted State Farm summary judgment, concluding that \u201c[n]o reasonable jury could conclude that State Farm\u2019s [medical examination] as requested and scheduled was unreasonable or that Kinman\u2019s refusal to submit to the [examination] was reasonable.\u201d Order, March 25, 2009 at 6. \u201cBecause Kinman\u2019s policy required him to submit to the [examination] and he unreasonably refused to do so, Kinman is not entitled to coverage under the uninsured motorist provision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-20\">Kinman now appeals, contending that the district court erred in concluding that attendance at the scheduled medical examination constituted a condition precedent to coverage, and, further, that issues of fact remained to be litigated regarding Kinman\u2019s failure to appear for the examination. We are not persuaded. We find no eiror in the court\u2019s analysis of the insurance coverage. As the court properly concluded, no material fact issue was presented and State Farm was entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
