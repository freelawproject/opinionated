We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Hector Gonzalez, now deceased, was previously employed by ICO, Inc. (ICO) at its Odessa, Texas facility. In 2002, Gonzalez and his family were involved in litigation in state court against ICO relating to Gonzalez\u2019s injuries from silica<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> exposure (\u201cthe Ector County Suit\u201d). The parties reached a settlement agreement to the Ector County Suit, and the state court entered an agreed judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">In 2008, Gonzalez died. Appellants, Gonzalez\u2019s surviving spouse and children, subsequently filed suit against ICO in state court, alleging gross negligence for Gonzalez\u2019s death (the \u201cUnderlying Lawsuit\u201d). The Underlying Lawsuit alleges that \u201cHector Gonzalez was exposed to dangerous levels of silica dust\u201d through sandblasting while employed by ICO from 1983 to 1988. It is further alleged that Gonzalez\u2019s death \u201cwas caused by respiratory failure caused by silicosis,\u201d a respiratory disease caused by prolonged inhalation of silica dust. <em>See </em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 2118.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">RLI had issued several insurance policies to ICO, including an umbrella liability policy (\u201cUmbrella Policy\u201d). After receiving the Underlying Lawsuit, ICO forwarded a copy of the suit to RLI and requested that it defend the lawsuit on ICO\u2019s behalf under the Umbrella Policy. RLI filed a suit for declaratory judgment in federal court, asserting that it did not have a duty to defend and or indemnify ICO against the claims in the Underlying Lawsuit. It later filed a motion for summary judgment. The district court granted RLI\u2019s motion, holding that RLI \u201cdid not owe either a defense or indemnity under\u201d the Umbrella Policy for the claims in the Underlying Lawsuit. Appellants timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-12\">STANDARD OF REVIEW AND APPLICABLE LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b723-13\">\u201cThis court reviews the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and its interpretation of an insurance contract <em>de novo.\u201d Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s London v. C.A. Turner Const. Co., </em>112 F.3d 184, 186 (5th Cir.1997) (citation omitted). Summary judgment is proper \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 56(a).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-14\">Under Texas rules of contractual interpretation, if an insurance contract is expressed in unambiguous language, its terms will be given their plain meaning and it will be enforced as written. If, however, a contract is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation, a court will resolve any ambiguity in favor of coverage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-15\"><em>Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s London, </em>112 F.3d at 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-16\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b723-17\">The Umbrella Policy contained several endorsements, including a \u201cPollution Exclusion Absolute\u201d (\u201cPollution Exclusion\u201d). The Pollution Exclusion stated that the Umbrella Policy did not cover bodily or personal injury arising as a result of the \u201ccontamination of the environment by pollutants that are introduced at any time, anywhere, in any way.\u201d It defined \u201cpollutants\u201d as \u201csmoke, vapors, soot, fumes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>acids, sounds, alkalis, chemicals, liquids, solids, gases, waste, ... and all other irritants and contaminants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">RLI argues that this court should affirm the district court because (1) Gonzalez contractually released ICO from the claims in the Underlying Lawsuit<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (2) the state court\u2019s judgment in the Ector County Lawsuit disposed of any claims in the Underlying Lawsuit between Appellants and ICO.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We need not address these issues because, as discussed below, Appellants\u2019 claim is barred by the Pollution Exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Appellants argue that the Pollution Exclusion does not apply to the injuries alleged in the Underlying Lawsuit, namely death resulting from silica dust exposure. We disagree. The Pollution Exclusion on its face excludes injuries arising from exposure to <em>\u201call ... </em>irritants and contaminants.\u201d The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has classified silica dust as an air contaminant. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.1000. Inhaling silica dust can result in silicosis, a type of pneumoconiosis. Pneumoconiosis is \u201ca disease of the lungs caused by the habitual inhalation of irritant material.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1746, 2118. In addition, several district courts have applied substantially similar pollution exclusions to silica-related claims and have concluded that they are pollutants. <em>See, e.g., Mt. Hawley Ins. Co. v. Wright Materials, Inc., </em>2005 WL 2805565, at *4 (N.D.Tex. Oct. 27, 2005); <em>Clarendon Am. Ins. Co. v. Bay, Inc., </em>10 F.Supp.2d 736, 744 (S.D.Tex.1998). Silica dust is unambiguously a \u201cpollutant\u201d under the language of the Pollution Exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">Appellants nonetheless argue that the Pollution Exclusion is ambiguous when considered in conjunction with the rest of the Umbrella Policy. Their arguments are unconvincing. They first argue that the Pollution Exclusion is patently ambiguous because it is too broad and a reasonable person would not know what was excluded. But Texas courts only look to the reasonable expectations of a party if there is an ambiguity; \u201cneither conflicting expectations nor disputation is sufficient to <em>create </em>an ambiguity.\u201d <em>Forbau v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., </em>876 S.W.2d 132, 134 (Tex.1994). The language in the Pollution Exclusion unambiguously applies to claims arising from \u201ccontamination of any environment by pollutants that are introduced at anytime, anywhere, in any way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">Next, appellants argue that a separate Asbestos Exclusion in the Umbrella Policy creates an inference that silica dust claims are not included by general Pollution Exclusion. But \u201csuperfluous exceptions are commonplace\u201d in insurance contracts and \u201chave the effect merely of makfing] assurance doubly sure.\u201d <em>Williamson v. J.C. Penney Ins. Co., </em>226 F.3d 408, 411 (5th Cir.2000) (quotation omitted) (alteration in original). Even if the Pollution Exclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>covers the same claims as the Asbestos Exclusion, this does not raise an inference that the Pollution Exclusion does not cover silica dust claims. The existence of a separate exclusion for asbestos does not create ambiguity in the Pollution Exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Appellants finally argue that the Umbrella Policy as a whole is ambiguous because there is a conflict between the Pollution Exclusion Endorsement and the original Umbrella Policy. In Texas, \u201c[e]ndorsements to a policy generally supersede and control over conflicting printed terms within the main policy.\u201d <em>Mid-Continent Cas. Co. v. Bay Rock Operating Co., </em>614 F.3d 105, 115 (5th Cir.2010) (citation omitted). Because the terms of the Pollution Exclusion supercede any conflicting language in the original Umbrella Policy, the Pollution Exclusion unambiguously controls what is covered by the policy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Silica dust is unambiguously a \u201cpollutant\u201d under the Pollution Exclusion. Because the Underlying Lawsuit only alleges injuries arising out of the contamination of air from silica dust, RLI does not have a duty to indemnify ICO for the claims in the Underlying Lawsuit as a matter of law. The district court correctly granted summary judgment to RLI.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">For the reasons described above, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b722-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5\u2122 Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b723-10\">. Silica is the second most common mineral in the earth's crust and the main chemical compound in sand and quartz. Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 2117 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b724-6\">. Appellants argue that Gonzalez's contact is inapplicable because the Underlying Lawsuit raises an independent claim under the Texas Worker\u2019s Compensation Act (TWCA) instead of a derivative claim under the Wrongful Death Act. The Texas Courts of Appeal are divided on whether the TWCA provides an independent cause of action for wrongful death. <em>Compare Ross v. Union Carbide Corp., </em>296 S.W.3d 206, 213-17 (Tex.App. \u2014 Houston 2009) (no independent claim) <em>with Zacharie v. U.S. Nat. Res., Inc., </em>94 S.W.3d 748, 756-57 (Tex.App.\u2014 San Antonio 2002) (independent claim).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b724-11\">. The judgment stated that the parties had settled and requested entry of a judgment, which \"finally disposefd] of all the parties' present and future rights and obligations by, to, and between each other.\u201d Appellants argue that, as part of the settlement, Alma Gonzalez expressly reserved her right to sue ICO for any claims covered by the Umbrella Policy. Alma Gonzalez's express reservation conflicts with the judgment's disposition of her right to sue ICO, and it is possible that the judgment's disposition of all claims was a scrivener\u2019s error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b725-10\">. Appellants also attempt to apply <em>Mesa Operating Co. v. California Union Insurance Co., 986 </em>S.W.2d 749 (Tex.App.\u2014Dallas 1999), to create an ambiguity in the Umbrella Policy. <em>Mesa Operating </em>is easily distinguishable. <em>Mesa Operating </em>involved a \u201cfollowing form\u201d umbrella policy that explicitly adopted the coverage of the underlying insurance, whereas the Umbrella Policy contains no \u201cfollowing form\u201d provision. <em>Id. </em>at 753. Even if the Umbrella Policy were a \"following form\" policy, the Pollution Exclusion would supercede the adopted coverage to the extent that the original Umbrella Policy conflicted with the endorsement. <em>Mid-Continent Cas. Co., </em>614 F.3dat 115.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
