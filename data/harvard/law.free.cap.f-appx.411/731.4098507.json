White\u2019s first claim, alleging the use of excessive force against him during a prison riot, was dismissed as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2). His second claim, alleging the destruction of various items of personal property (including a family bible and legal papers) by prison guards in the wake of a prison riot, was dismissed after the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants. We now AFFIRM the district\u2019s court judgment with respect to both of White\u2019s claims. Moreover, White\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">We review the district court\u2019s dismissal of White\u2019s excessive force claim as frivolous for abuse of discretion. \u201c[Wjhenever prison officials stand accused of using excessive physical force in violation of the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, the core judicial inquiry is ... whether force was applied in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline, or maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.\u201d <em>Hudson v. McMillian, </em>503 U.S. 1, 5-7, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992). As the Supreme Court has held, \u201c[t]he Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition of \u2018cruel and unusual\u2019 punishments necessarily excludes from constitutional recognition <em>de minumus </em>uses of physical force.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9, 112 S.Ct. 995. What constitutes an injury for purposes of an excessive force claim is dependent upon the context in which it arose. <em>Williams v. Bramer, </em>180 F.3d 699, 704 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">Here, White alleges that during a prison riot, prison officials removed all inmates from their cells, including White himself, conducted a strip-search of the inmates, and forced them to lay down on hot concrete for over an hour. As a result, White claims his elbows were bruised and bleeding and he had a red mark on his head. Those relatively minimal injuries, as prison officials worked to restore discipline after a prison disturbance, do not rise to the level to justify a claim under the Eighth Amendment. <em>See Baldwin v. Stalder, </em>137 F.3d 836, 840 (5th Cir.1998) (holding that the fact finder in an excessive force case must bear in mind that prison officials \u201cmay [have] to act quickly and decisively\u201d and are therefore entitled to \u201cwide-ranging deference\u201d). Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing White\u2019s excessive force claim. <em>See Black v. Warren, </em>134 F.3d 732, 733-34 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">We also find no error in the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on White\u2019s property claim, which we review <em>de novo. Dillon v. Rogers, </em>596 F.3d 260, 266 (5th Cir.2010). Under the Supreme Court\u2019s well-settled <em>Parratt/Hudson </em>line of cases, \u201ca deprivation of a constitutionally protected property interest caused by a state employee\u2019s random, unauthorized conduct does not give rise to a Section 1983 procedural due process claim, unless the State fails to provide an adequate post-deprivation remedy.\u201d <em>Allen v. Thomas, </em>388 F.3d 147, 149 (5th Cir.2004); <em>See also Parratt v. Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527, 541-44, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 (1981); <em>Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 533, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>burden is on the complainant to show that the state\u2019s post-deprivation remedy is not adequate. <em>Myers v. Klevenhagen, </em>97 F.3d 91, 94 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">White did not allege that he was deprived of his property in accordance with any prison policy, practice, or custom, or that the deprivations of his property were in any way authorized by the prison. Nor has he shown that summary judgment was inappropriate because the district court relied on credibility determinations. Rather, White\u2019s chief allegation is that certain prison officials maliciously destroyed his property in contravention of prison policy. That brings his case directly within the <em>Parratt/Hudson </em>rubric. White did not show that Mississippi fails to provide an adequate post-deprivation remedy for his claim. To the contrary, this court has held that Mississippi\u2019s post-deprivation remedies for civil litigants in similar circumstances satisfy due process. <em>Nickens v. Melton, </em>38 F.3d 183, 185 (5th Cir.1994). Even if, as White claims, he had no access to a replevin action under Mississippi law because his possessions were destroyed rather than simply taken, the district court properly observed that he had at least two other forms of adequate post-deprivation remedies available to him. <em>See </em>Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 11-38-1 (claim and delivery); <em>Wilson v. General Motors Acceptance Corp., </em>883 So.2d 56, 68-69 (Miss.2004) (setting forth the elements for a conversion claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b757-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b758-5\">. Appointment of counsel is not required in civil cases except in exceptional circumstances, which depend on the nature and complexity of the case and the abilities of tire litigant pursuing the case. <em>Cooper v. Sheriff, Lubbock County, Tex., </em>929 F.2d 1078, 1084 (5th Cir.1991). This case does not present complex issues, and White has shown himself capable of pursuing his claims. Therefore, his motion for appointment of counsel is denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
