Liebman indicated that he understood as much and that he was \u201choping it [would] be the same,\u201d as he did not want to \u201cinconvenience the Court, or upset anyone.\u201d Following the change, the trial court sentenced Liebman as a habitual offender to various concurrent terms of imprisonment, the longest being thirty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-17\">Following state appellate and post-conviction proceedings, Liebman challenged his conviction in the Southern District of Florida, claiming, among other things, that his pleas were involuntary as the result of ineffective assistance of counsel. According to Liebman, he was under the influence of the psychotropic antidepressant, Elavil, during his plea proceedings. In particular, Liebman alleged that counsel knew he was under the influence of a double dose of the drug on the day he changed his plea to no contest, but that counsel neglected to inform the court. Liebman claims that, had the court been so informed, the outcome of his proceeding would have been different, in that the court would have rejected his pleas as involuntary. Following a categorical deni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>al of relief below, we granted Liebman leave to appeal a single, narrow issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACI\">Whether the state court made a decision that was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law or made an unreasonable determination of fact when it found that counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise concerns about Liebman\u2019s competency to be sentenced due to his mental condition prior to and during the March 30 sentencing hearing and the increased dosage of his psychotropic medication on the morning of the sentencing hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Because we decide that Liebman has failed to demonstrate the requisite prejudice under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">We begin by noting that, in our order granting Liebman\u2019s Certificate of Appealability, we specifically rejected Liebman\u2019s contention that the state court unreasonably determined that his March 1 guilty pleas were voluntary. Those pleas followed two separate mental competency evaluations, as well as a thorough plea colloquy. Consequently, in evaluating Liebman\u2019s ineffective-assistance claim, we limit our determination of whether Liebman can show <em>Strickland </em>prejudice to the events that followed his initial guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">To demonstrate prejudice under <em>Strickland, </em>Liebman must show that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068. In the context of an ineffective-assistance challenge to the voluntariness of a guilty or no-contest plea, Liebman must show there is \u201creasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\u201d <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 59, 106 S.Ct. 366, 370, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985). Particularly in light of his prior, voluntary guilty plea, we believe Liebman can show no such reasonable probability.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">In a summary order, Liebman\u2019s state post-conviction court disposed of his various claims on the merits \u201cfor the reasons stated in the State\u2019s Response\u201d to Liebman\u2019s petition, triggering the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act\u2019s restrictions on federal habeas relief. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254; <em>see also Harrington v. Richter, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 770, 784-85, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011) (concluding that the summary nature of a state court\u2019s decision does not lessen the deference that it is due); <em>Wright v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>278 F.3d 1245, 1254 (11th Cir.2002) (same). We need not reach any of Liebman\u2019s arguments about performance issues because, even if we assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that Liebman\u2019s counsel performed deficiently by failing to alert the court that his client was under the influence of medication,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Liebman has not made an adequate showing of prejudice to warrant further proceedings. <em>See Holladay v. Haley, </em>209 F.3d 1243, 1248 (11th Cir.2000) (\u201c[A] court need not address the performance prong of <em>[Strickland] </em>if the defendant cannot meet the prejudice prong, or vice versa.\u201d (internal citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>We agree with the district court that the facts do not show Liebman\u2019s original March 1 guilty plea was constitutionally deficient. Liebman has failed to explain how he was prejudiced by the events thereafter, except to baldly assert that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pled guilty and instead gone to trial. Though it is certainly possible that Liebman\u2019s state of mind may have deteriorated in the interim between his plea colloquy and his sentencing hearing such that counsel should have intervened when Liebman attempted to change his plea,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we see little, if anything, in the record to suggest any such deterioration or resulting harm. During the sentencing hearing, Liebman himself stated, \u201cI do not wish in any means [sic] to inconvenience or burden the courts with any trials that I don\u2019t think I can win with any defense.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In short, Liebman simply fails to make a plausible case that, but for his alleged incapacitation and counsel\u2019s errors, he would have insisted on going to trial. Even assuming the truth of an alteration in his Elavil consumption, Liebman has illuminated no reasons that his plea calculus changed or would have changed from the time he voluntarily pled guilty until the time that he altered that plea to no contest.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">Liebman attempts make his prejudice case by pointing to a portion of the sentencing hearing transcript where he told the court, \u201cI wish to withdraw my guilty plea <em>in order to reserve my right to appeal, </em>entering pleas of no contest\u201d (emphasis added). Since, absent a preservation agreement, no material differences exist in a defendant\u2019s appellate rights after a no-contest plea versus a guilty plea, we interpret Liebman\u2019s argument to contend that this confusing statement demonstrates that, had he been of sound mind, Liebman would have pursued a course of pleading that would have preserved broader appellate rights: <em>viz., </em>taking his case to trial. Leaving aside any issues related to the fact that Liebman was not necessarily entitled to withdraw a constitutionally made guilty plea, we find this argument unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">Though such a statement might indicate Liebman misunderstood the consequences of his no-contest plea, such a subjective misunderstanding alone is not necessarily sufficient to render his plea involuntary. <em>Cf. United States v. Plain, </em>748 F.2d 620, 622 (11th Cir.1984) (per curiam). Furthermore, to the extent that this misunderstanding should have alerted counsel and the court to some possible cognitive defect in Liebman\u2019s mental process, Liebman has failed to indicate exactly which appellate issues he wished to preserve such that, had he known his appellate rights under an open no-contest plea were severely limited, he would have chosen instead to take his case to trial. In other words, while his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>statement at the sentencing hearing might be probative of his attorney\u2019s performance, without more, it stops short of demonstrating prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">At its core, <em>Strickland </em>is designed to help us identify and reverse judgments where an attorney\u2019s error has undermined our confidence the case\u2019s outcome. <em>See </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068. Here, we are confident that Liebman\u2019s case was properly resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b288-12\">. Liebman's pleas were \"open\u201d and not pursuant to any plea agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b288-18\">. According to Liebman\u2019s brief, Liebman asked his counsel to implement the change. When counsel refused, Liebman addressed the court directly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b289-8\">. Because Liebman has never been afforded an evidentiary hearing, the record is silent on what his counsel actually knew relating to Liebman\u2019s medication. However, even if Liebman\u2019s allegations are true, they would not necessarily result in our finding deficient performance. <em>See Miles v. Stainer, </em>108 F.3d 1109, 1113 (9dr Cir.1997) (\"Assuming arguendo that [counsel] had reason to doubt his competence on the day of the guilty plea, we are not willing to say that her failure to bring the matter to the court's attention \u2014 which would jeopardize the plea bargain, against her client's wishes \u2014 is a transgression that violates <em>Strickland's </em>\u2018strong presumption' of reasonable conduct.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b290-5\">. A defendant\u2019s mental competency is not static. <em>See Indiana v. Edwards, </em>554 U.S. 164, 175, 128 S.Ct. 2379, 2386, 171 L.Ed.2d 345 (2008) (\"Mental illness itself is not a unitary concept. It varies in degree. It can vary over time. It interferes with an individual's functioning at different times in different ways/').</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b290-6\">. This statement occurred while Liebman was allegedly under the influence of the increased dose of Elavil, so we are loath to give it much weight in evaluating Liebman's state of mind. However, it is somewhat probative.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b290-10\">.Additionally, he has shown no prejudice that might have arisen solely from the fact that his conviction followed from a plea of no contest versus a plea of guilty, and we can think of none. <em>See United States v. Caraway, </em>474 F.2d 25, 28 (5th Cir.1973) (\"Under normal circumstances, a plea of nolo contendere is the legal equivalent of a guilty plea and a waiver of all nonjurisdictional defects.\u201d), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>483 F.2d 215 (5th Cir.1973) (en banc) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
