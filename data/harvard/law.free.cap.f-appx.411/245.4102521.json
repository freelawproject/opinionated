He argues that the district court erred in (1) finding that he was subject to a four-level increase for being an organizer or leader, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(a); (2) imposing a two-level increase for sophisticated means, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(9)(C); and (3) determining that the total number of victims exceeded fifty, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(2)(B). He also contends that his sentence was substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">A defendant\u2019s role as an organizer or leader is a factual finding that we review for clear error. <em>United States v. Jiminez, </em>224 F.3d 1243, 1250-51 (11th Cir.2000). We will not find clear error unless \u201c \u2018we are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1177 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Glassroth v. Moore, </em>335 F.3d 1282, 1292 (11th Cir. 2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">To assess whether a defendant was an \u201corganizer or leader of a criminal activity,\u201d we consider several factors, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-8\">(1) the exercise of decision making authority, (2) the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, (3) the recruitment of accomplices, (4) the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, (5) the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, (6) the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and (7) the degree of control and authority exercised over others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-9\"><em>United States v. Gupta, </em>463 F.3d 1182, 1198 (11th Cir.2006) (citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 cmt. n. 4). Not all of these considerations need to be present. <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>426 F.3d 1344, 1356 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). \u201cSection 3B1.1 requires the exercise of some authority in the organization, the exertion of some degree of control, influence, or leadership.\u201d <em>United States v. Yates, </em>990 F.2d 1179, 1182 (11th Cir.1993) (per curiam) (quoting <em>United States v. Brown, </em>944 F.2d 1377, 1385 (7th Cir.1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-11\">Deonarinesingh argues that, at most, he manufactured or supplied the counterfeit checks but that he did not engage in the organization or management of the conspiracy or its participants. An United States Secret Service agent testified that Deonarinesingh specifically instructed employees of check cashing stores to give him checks drawn on small businesses\u2019 accounts from specific banks and for specific amounts. Then, either the store\u2019s employees or his recruiters would give the checks to Deonarinesingh, at which point he would make the counterfeit checks. Finally Deonarinesingh would give the checks to his recruiters, who would drive check passers to the banks that he indicated and would bring the money back to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-12\">On this record, Deonarinesingh had a leadership role in the conspiracy. While most of the conspiracy\u2019s participants did not know each other, they knew Deonarinesingh and described him as the \u201cboss.\u201d Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err in concluding that Deonarinesingh was an organizer or leader of the conspiracy under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-14\">This Court reviews a finding that a defendant used \u201csophisticated means\u201d for clear error. <em>United States v. Robertson, </em>493 F.3d 1322, 1329-30 (11th Cir.2007). The Guidelines state that two levels are added to a defendant\u2019s base offense level \u201cif the offense involved sophisticated means.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 (b)(9)(c). \u201cSophisticated means\u201d refers to \u201cespecially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>complex or especially intricate offense conduct pertaining to the execution or concealment of an offense,\u201d and ordinarily includes conduct like hiding assets or transactions \u201cthrough the use of fictitious entities, corporate shells, or offshore financial accounts.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n. 8(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Accordingly, Deonarinesingh argues the district court clearly erred in finding he used sophisticated means because there was nothing especially complex or intricate about his conduct. He contends that at best, he used a widely available program like Adobe Photoshop, a scanner, a computer, and widely available blank check forms to create counterfeit checks, and that there was no evidence that he engaged in any complex financial transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">But the fact that Deonarinesingh did not use offshore bank accounts or route transactions through fictitious business entities is unavailing. <em>See United States v. Campbell, </em>491 F.3d 1306, 1315-16 (11th Cir.2007) (affirming sentence and holding in tax case that use of campaign accounts and credit cards issued to other individuals constituted sophisticated means designed to conceal defendant\u2019s fraud from authorities). And \u201c[t]here is no requirement that each of a defendant\u2019s individual actions be sophisticated in order to impose the enhancement. Rather, it is sufficient if the totality of the scheme was sophisticated.\u201d <em>United States v. Ghertler, </em>605 F.3d 1256, 1267 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The district court did not clearly err in finding Deonarinesingh used sophisticated means. Deonarinesingh specifically told employees of check cashing stores that he wanted checks that were drawn on small businesses and from specific banks for amounts between $800 and $1,000. He personally manufactured counterfeit checks, told recruiters and check passers where to negotiate checks, and called banks to confirm that there was money in the accounts. The scheme took years of planning, coordination, and efforts of the many individuals involved in the criminal operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">Arguably, no single aspect of Deonarinesingh\u2019s activity was itself sophisticated, but in light of the nature and extent of his entire scheme, we have no \u201cdefinite and firm conviction\u201d that the district court committed a mistake when it enhanced Deonarinesingh\u2019s sentence for sophisticated means. <em>See United States v. Cook, </em>336 Fed.Appx. 875, 879 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam) (no clear error where counterfeit check fraud conspiracy \u201cemployed a number of procedures to ensure that the victim banks and account holders would not realize what was happening\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">A defendant\u2019s base offense level is increased by four levels if the relevant offense involved fifty or more victims. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(2)(B). A \u201cvictim\u201d is \u201cany person who sustained any part of the actual loss determined under subsection (b)(1).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n. 1. The Guidelines define \u201cactual loss\u201d as \u201creasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm that resulted from the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at n. 3(A)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">Deonarinesingh contends that there were only two victims, Bank Atlantic and Wachovia. He argues we should follow the reasoning in <em>United States v. Yagar, </em>404 F.3d 967 (6th Cir.2005), and find the individual account holders were not \u201cvictims\u201d because the banks fully reimbursed them for their temporary losses. In <em>United States v. Lee, </em>427 F.3d 881, 895 (11th Cir.2005), this Court declined to adopt the reasoning of <em>Yagar </em>because it did \u201cnot comport with the Guidelines.\u201d Instead, we held that victims who were reim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>bursed for their temporary losses still counted as victims under the Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at 894-95. We may not disregard the holding of a prior Eleventh Circuit opinion unless the Supreme Court, or this Court sitting <em>en banc, </em>overrules that opinion. <em>United States v. Kaley, </em>579 F.3d 1246, 1255 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The testimony of the bank investigator established that well over fifty individual account holders were defrauded, and under our precedent in <em>Lee, </em>those individual account holders qualify as victims for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(2)(B). We thus find no reversible error in the district court decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Deonarinesingh was sentenced to 97-months\u2019 imprisonment, which was at the low end of the guidelines range of 97 to 121 months. The district court did not abuse its discretion by sentencing Deonarinesingh at the low end of the guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">We review sentences for reasonableness, using an abuse-of-diseretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). When evaluating the \u201csubstantive reasonableness\u201d of a sentence, we consider the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, the party challenging the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). We determine whether the sentence is substantively reasonable based on the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. While a within-guidelines sentence is not <em>per se </em>reasonable, we ordinarily expect it to be reasonable. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">Deonarinesingh argues his sentence is unreasonable because his codefendants were given lower sentences. But we have held that \u201c[disparity between the sentences imposed on codefendants is generally not an appropriate basis for relief on appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Regueiro, </em>240 F.3d 1321, 1325-26 (11th Cir.2001) (per curiam). \u2018While \u00a7 3553(a)(6) speaks of \u2018the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct,\u2019 the provision is more concerned with the unjustified differences across judges or districts than between co-defendants in a single case.\u201d <em>United States v. Edinson, </em>209 Fed.Appx. 947, 949 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (quoting <em>United States v. Boscarino, </em>437 F.3d 634, 638, (7th Cir.2006)). Moreover, Deonarinesingh has failed to show that his 97-month sentence was unreasonable compared to the sentences of his co-defendants, especially given his extensive level of participation in the offense and his criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
