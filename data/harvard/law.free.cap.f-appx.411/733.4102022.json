This court upheld on appeal the district court dismissal of Hymes\u2019s complaint against the State and its agencies as barred by the State\u2019s Eleventh Amendment and thus did not address the dismissal of the complaint as barred by the Rooker-Feldman<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> doctrine. <em>Hymes v. State of Miss., </em>289 Fed.Appx. 673 (5th Cir.2008). In his post-appeal Rule 60(b)(6) motion, Hymes challenged the magistrate judge\u2019s prejudgment denial of his motion to amend the complaint to add the individual state court judges who comprised the \u201ctribunals\u201d as named defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-11\">Hymes\u2019s motion to proceed IFP on appeal is construed as a challenge to the district court\u2019s certification decision that the appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Thus, his request \u201cmust be directed solely to the trial court\u2019s reasons for the certification decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This court\u2019s inquiry into whether the appeal is taken in good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-12\">Hymes challenges the district court\u2019s determination that his motion to amend was untimely and that, even if the complaint had been amended, it was barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. For the first time in the instant appeal, Hymes challenges the validity of the scheduling order and argues that he showed good cause for deviating from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-13\">The record shows that Hymes sought to amend to name certain state government officials and, later, to add the state court judges after the amendment deadline had expired, and Hymes did not seek an extension of that deadline. As this court noted in dicta in the prior appeal, the lower court had broad discretion in enforcing its scheduling order. <em>Hymes, </em>289 Fed.Appx. at 675. None of Hymes\u2019s arguments present the type of exceptional circumstances warranting Rule 60(b)(6) relief from the district court\u2019s final judgment. <em>See Edward H. Bohlin Co., Inc. v. Banning Co., Inc., </em>6 F.3d 350, 357 (5th Cir.1993). Nor do they show that the denial of his Rule 60(b)(6) motion was so unwarranted as to consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>tute an abuse of discretion. <em>See Seven Elves, Inc. v. Eskenazi, </em>635 F.2d 396, 402 (5th Cir.1981). Accordingly, he has not shown nonfrivolous issue for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Hymes\u2019s appeal does not involve legal points that are arguable on the merits, <em>see Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220, and his IFP motion is therefore denied. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 197. Because the resolution of Hymes\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s certification order requires resolution of the merits of his appeal, the appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See id.; see also </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b760-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
