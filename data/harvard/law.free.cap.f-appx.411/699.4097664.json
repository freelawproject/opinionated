He fell eighteen feet off of scaffolding after sustaining an electrical shock from touching a high-voltage electrical wire. He brought claims of both negligence and negligence <em>per se </em>against Entergy, the electric utility that placed and operated the electrical wire. This appeal arises from the district court\u2019s summary judgment in favor of Entergy, which was itself based on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>district court\u2019s order granting Entergy\u2019s motion to exclude the testimony of the plaintiffs sole expert, Billy Seward. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">We review the district court\u2019s summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same legal standards used by the district court. <em>Moss v. BMC Software, Inc., </em>610 F.3d 917, 922 (5th Cir.2010) (citation omitted). Summary judgment is proper if there is \u201cno genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). Although the court views all evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, mere conclusory allegations cannot defeat summary judgment. <em>Moss, </em>610 F.3d at 922 (citations omitted). No genuine issue of material fact exists when the non-moving party fails to establish the existence of an element essential to that party\u2019s case. <em>Nichols v. Enterasys Networks, Inc., </em>495 F.3d 185, 188 (5th Cir. 2008). \u201cRule 56 does not impose upon the district court a duty to sift through the record in search of evidence to support a party\u2019s opposition to summary judgment.\u201d <em>Adams v. Travelers Indem. Co., </em>465 F.3d 156, 164 (5th Cir.2006). We review a district court\u2019s decision to exclude expert testimony for an abuse of discretion. <em>Nunez v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>604 F.3d 840, 844 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">The district court granted summary judgment on the basis that, \u201c[ajbsent [the expert\u2019s] testimony, plaintiff has no admissible evidence of the applicable standard of care or of Entergy Mississippi\u2019s breach thereof.\u201d As such, we address first, whether the district court\u2019s exclusion of Seward\u2019s testimony was proper,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and second, whether the district court properly granted summary judgment. First, as the district court noted in its thorough order, Seward is not qualified to testify as an expert in high-voltage electrical systems, the pertinent factual issue in this case. He is an electrician whose experience is limited to low-voltage systems, and he admitted in his deposition that he has no knowledge of high-voltage systems. He likewise admitted that he is not familiar with the National Electrical Safety Code (NESC), the very statute that Childs advances as supporting a claim of negligence per se. The district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding Seward\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-11\">Second, given that exclusion, Childs failed to present sufficient evidence to preclude summary judgment. Entergy filed a motion for summary judgment arguing that Childs failed to present any evidence of the standard of care or Entergy\u2019s breach. In response, Childs filed a perfunctory, two-page opposition that completely failed to identify any genuine issue of material fact, despite the fact that the district court had granted Childs\u2019s motion for extension of time to file his response. Instead, Childs vaguely referred to Seward\u2019s deposition testimony, the defendant\u2019s responses to discovery requests, and \u201cthe pleadings and the deposition testimony.\u201d Conclusory allegations are far from sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact for trial. <em>See Adams, </em>465 F.3d at 164. The district court properly granted summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-12\">Now, on appeal, Childs argues that no expert testimony was required to establish her claims because the applicable standard of care is established by the NESC. Childs waived this argument by not presenting it to the district court. <em>See Keenan v. Tejeda, </em>290 F.3d 252, 262 (5th Cir. 2002). Moreover, even if this argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>had been made to the district court, the argument is meritless. Assuming for the sake of argument that Childs did not need an expert witness to establish the standard of care in a negligence <em>per se </em>case, she would still have to produce evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Entergy failed to comply with the NESC; her response in opposition to summary judgment faded to do so. <em>See Adams, </em>465 F.3d at 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b726-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b727-7\">. Although Childs does not argue on appeal that the district court erred in excluding his expert, but rather that he did not need an expert witness at all, we address it nonetheless as the basis of the district court\u2019s summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b726-20\">.
