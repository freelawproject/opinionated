Florence\u2019s unlabeled, <em>pro se </em>pleading, which we liberally con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>strue as a motion seeking permission to challenge his convictions (consistent with the district court\u2019s prior order requiring him to seek such leave), was denied by the district court on the ground that, contrary to Florence\u2019s assertion, <em>United States v. O\u2019Brien, </em>560 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 2169, 176 L.Ed.2d 979 (2010), did not apply to his case. On appeal, Florence argues that the district court erred in denying him leave to challenge his convictions because his indictment was unconstitutionally defective for failing to specify the type of gun, violating his due process rights, and the government\u2019s failure to prove the type of gun to the jury at trial resulted in insufficient evidence to support his convictions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">We review orders relating to a district court\u2019s injunction on <em>pro se </em>filings for abuse of discretion. <em>See Miller v. Donald, </em>541 F.3d 1091, 1096 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">Three principles govern this appeal. First, a claim is frivolous if it \u201clacks an arguable basis either in law or in fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1100. Second, when a prisoner has previously filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, he must apply for and receive permission from the court of appeals before filing a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A), 2255(h). Absent such authorization, the district court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction to consider any claims in the motion or issue a certificate of appealability with respect to them. <em>See Williams v. Chatman, </em>510 F.3d 1290, 1295 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">Lastly, a prisoner may alternatively bring an action for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 by showing that the \u00a7 2255 remedy is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention\u201d under the \u201csavings clause\u201d of \u00a7 2255. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e); <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). The savings clause applies only if a petitioner demonstrates that: (1) his claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) that Supreme Court decision establishes that the petitioner was convicted of a nonexistent offense; and (3) circuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised at his trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir.1999). The district court will not review a claim filed under \u00a7 2241 until the petitioner shows that the savings clause applies. <em>See id. </em>at 1244 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-14\">Here, Florence has not demonstrated that he merited the district court\u2019s permission. Indeed, the record does not reflect that he was sentenced based on the type of gun he used in the robbery, and his claims were therefore frivolous. Moreover, even if his claims had a sufficient factual basis, neither \u00a7 2255 nor \u00a7 2241 gave the district court jurisdiction to consider their merits because it would have been an unauthorized successive \u00a7 2255 motion, and \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause did not apply. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Florence leave to challenge his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b257-10\">. Florence also appears to raise an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel challenge, but this issue was not raised before the district court, and we therefore will not consider it. <em>Dohrmann v. United States, </em>442 F.3d 1279, 1282 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
