We review the denial of a motion to reopen \u201cunder a highly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 303 (5th Cir.2005). The BIA\u2019s decision will be upheld as long as it is not \u201ccapricious, racially invidious, utterly without foundation in the evidence, or otherwise so irrational that it is arbitrary rather than the result of any perceptible rational approach.\u201d <em>Singh v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 484, 487 (5th Cir.2006). The BIA\u2019s factual findings are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, meaning that this court may not overturn the BIA\u2019s factual findings unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">Quintana-Florian was ordered removed in absentia when he failed to appear for a hearing in 1998. In 2008, he sought to reopen the removal proceedings on the ground that he had not received notice of the hearing date.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-9\">To rescind an order of removal within 180 days after the order, the alien must \u201cdemonstrate that [his] failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i). An order of removal may be rescinded at any time if the alien demonstrates, inter alia, that he did not receive notice \u201cin accordance with paragraph (1) or (2) of [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 ] 1229(a).\u201d \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-14\">The BIA found, and Quintana-Florian does not dispute, that his motion was filed more than 180 days after the removal order. He argues, however, that the 180-day time limit should be equitably tolled based upon the ineffective assistance of his previous counsel of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-15\">\u201c[A] request for equitable tolling of a time- or number-barred motion to reopen on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel is \u2018in essence an argument that the BIA should have sua sponte reopened the proceeding based upon the doctrine of equitable tolling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, </em>543 F.3d 216, 219-20 (5th Cir.2008) (citation omitted). We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision not to reopen removal proceedings sua sponte. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we need not address Quintana-Florian\u2019s arguments of equitable tolling and ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b733-16\">The BIA\u2019s finding that Quintana-Florian was notified of the removal hearing via service to his previous counsel of record is supported by substantial evidence in the record. As Quintana-Florian has pointed to no evidence that compels a contrary conclusion, he has not established that the BIA abused its discretion in finding that he received notice of the hearing in compliance with \u00a7 1229(a)(1) and (a)(2) and that he therefore could not reopen his removal proceedings pursuant to \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii). <em>See Chun, </em>40 F.3d at 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-18\">Because the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Quintana-Florian\u2019s mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>tion to reopen, we need not address his argument that the in absentia removal order in the underlying immigration proceeding violated his due process rights. We have held that the denial of a motion to reopen cannot violate an alien\u2019s due process rights because the relief sought in such a motion is discretionary in nature. <em>See Gomez-Palacios v. Holder, </em>560 F.3d 354, 361 n. 2 (5th Cir.2009). Thus, Quintana-Florian\u2019s argument that his due process rights were violated by the lack of any evidentiary hearing in connection with his motion to reopen is without merit. The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b733-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
