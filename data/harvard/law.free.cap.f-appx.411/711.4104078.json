Jones, federal prisoner # 26216-077, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582 motion to reduce his 310-month sentence imposed following his guilty plea conviction for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine. Jones argues that the policy statement in U.S.S.G. 1B1.10, p.s., that only the amendments listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(c) may be applied retroactively is contrary to the holding in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and that the district court\u2019s decision to apply amendments is now discretionary. He contends that \u00a7 1B1.10 and \u00a7 3582 are unconstitutional insofar as they apply a mandatory sentencing scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary reduction of a defendant\u2019s sentence where the sentencing range is later lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009). However, it applies only to retroactive guidelines amendments, as set forth in the guidelines policy statement. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.10(a), p.s.; <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 28-29 (5th Cir.1994). The district court\u2019s interpretation or application of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo while its decision whether to reduce a sentence is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 237. Amendment 709 is not listed as an amendment covered by the policy statement in \u00a7 1B1.10(c). <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.10(c). Thus, the district court was not authorized to reduce a sentence based on Amendment 709. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. 1(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-13\">Insofar as Jones relies on <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court and this court have determined that <em>Booker </em>does not apply to sentencing reductions under \u00a7 3582 and that it does not alter the mandatory character of \u00a7 1B1.10\u2019s limitations on sentence reductions. <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2692, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010); <em>Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 238. Thus, Jones\u2019s argument that the district court was not bound by the policy statement in light of <em>Booker </em>has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-16\">Jones also argues that the Supreme Court recognized in <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), that the district court may depart from the Guidelines. These Supreme Court cases did not hold that the district court may depart from the guidelines range although the guideline amendment relied upon by the movant is not listed in \u00a7 1B1.10(c). The limitations in \u00a7 1B1.10 are mandatory and, thus, would preclude such a departure. <em>Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 237-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-17\">The district court did not err in denying the motion to reduce Jones\u2019s sentence. The sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b738-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under die limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
