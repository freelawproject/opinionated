At sentencing, the district court assessed a 16-level enhancement under Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(i), after determining Escobar was previously deported following a felony conviction for possession, with intent to distribute, methamphetamine and aiding and abetting, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, for which he was sentenced to 42 months\u2019 imprisonment. Escobar contends the district court lacked sufficient evidentiary basis for finding he had sustained this prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-24\">According to Escobar, the district court plainly erred in applying the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(i) enhancement because: it lacked judicial records establishing his prior conviction; and it could not apply the enhancement based solely on the presentence investigation report\u2019s characterization of the conviction. Escobar contends the court\u2019s application of this \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(i) enhancement, and the resulting increase of his sentence beyond \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s statutory maximum of two years\u2019 imprisonment, was plainly erroneous in the light of the lack of proof of his prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-25\">As Escobar concedes, he failed to object on this ground at sentencing. Therefore, review is only for plain error. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Garcia-Arellano, </em>522 F.3d 477, 480 (5th Cir.2008). To show reversible plain error, Escobar must show a clear or obvious error that affects his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United </em>States,-U.S.-,-, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If reversible plain error is shown, our court retains discretion to correct it and, generally, will do so only if it seriously affects the fair<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>ness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">Our court granted the Government\u2019s unopposed motion to supplement the appellate record with a certified copy of the indictment, plea agreement, factual r\u00e9sum\u00e9, and criminal judgment from Escobar\u2019s prior felony drug-trafficking offense, case no. 4:00-CR-041-E(02), from the Northern District of Texas. In determining whether the district court committed reversible plain error, we consider the appellate record supplemented with those documents. <em>See Garciar-Arellcmo, </em>522 F.3d at 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Escobar admitted in his motion for a downward variance in district court that, he had been \u201cconvicted of a federal drug offense\u201d, resulting in his deportation in 2003. Moreover, he has <em>not </em>contended, here or in the district court, that he was not the person convicted in case no. 4:00-CR-041-E(02). Based on the record on appeal, as supplemented, Escobar has failed to show plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b767-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
