The district court ordered that Profit\u2019s civil rights suit be stayed until the alleged improper state criminal prosecution was concluded because Profit\u2019s civil rights claims attacked the legality of a detainee\u2019s arrest, prosecution, and detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-19\">The district court may deny a motion for leave to appeal IFP by certifying that the appeal is not taken in good faith and by providing written reasons for the certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a). This court\u2019s inquiry into whether the appeal is taken in good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). If a prisoner opts to challenge the district court\u2019s certification decision, the prisoner may file a motion in the court of appeals for leave to proceed IFP, which \u201cmust be directed solely to the trial court\u2019s reasons for the certification decision.\u201d <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202. This court, however, may dismiss the appeal as frivolous when it is apparent that an appeal would be merit-less. <em>Id. </em>at 202 n. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-20\">In his brief, Profit sets forth legal concepts but fails to brief any argument regarding the district court\u2019s certification decision or, in particular, the district court\u2019s decision to stay his suit. Although we liberally construe pro se briefs, <em>see Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). By failing to discuss the district court\u2019s rationale for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>staying his complaint, Profit has abandoned the issue, and it is the same as if he had not appealed the judgment. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Furthermore, notwithstanding Profit\u2019s failure to brief, the district court correctly stayed the proceedings in this civil action pending the resolution of the criminal charges against Profit. <em>See Wallace v. Koto, </em>549 U.S. 384, 393-94, 127 S.Ct. 1091, 166 L.Ed.2d 973 (2007); <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 487 n. 8, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994); <em>Mackey v. Dickson, </em>47 F.3d 744, 746 (5th Cir. 1995). Thus, Profit has failed to demonstrate that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal, and this appeal is without arguable merit. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b734-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
