Nathaniel (\u201cNathaniel\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s order granting the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks\u2019 (the \u201cDepartment\u201d) motion for summary judgment and dismissing Nathaniel\u2019s sex discrimination, unlawful retaliation, and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court concluded that Nathaniel failed to create a fact issue as to whether the defendant\u2019s reasons for not promoting Nathaniel were pretextual and failed to set forth evidence to support a prima facie case for retaliation. Nathaniel raises three issues on appeal: (1) whether the district court\u2019s opinion was based on a fundamental error of fact; (2) whether a genuine issue of material fact existed as to the Department\u2019s proffered reasons for not promoting Nathaniel; and (3) whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the Department on Nathaniel\u2019s retaliation claim. We conclude that the district court did not err in granting the Department\u2019s motion for summary judgment and in dismissing Nathaniel\u2019s claims, and, therefore, we AFFIRM-</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Nathaniel began working for the Department on July 1, 2003, as a Park Worker I. Nathaniel\u2019s duties consisted of collecting fees at a ranger station. She inquired several times about opportunities for advancement and sought to be promoted to the position of Park Worker II, but she did not obtain a promotion. At the time she filed this lawsuit, Nathaniel was still employed by the Department in the position of Park Worker I.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-10\">In 2005, the Department hired Craig Belton (\u201cBelton\u201d) as a part-time employee. In 2006,.Belton indicated that he was interested in a full-time position and was promoted from his part-time position to a full-time Park Worker II position.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-11\">Nathaniel filed a sex discrimination charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) in January 2007, claiming that she was discriminated against because she \u201chad been employed longer, [she and Belton] perform the same duties, and [she] can \u25a0work any time, but [Belton] cannot because of his (8-5:00) primary job.\u201d The EEOC issued Nathaniel a right to sue letter on May 21, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-12\">Nathaniel filed suit on August 17, 2007 in Mississippi state court claiming that the Department violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cTitle VII\u201d), by unlawfully discriminating against her based on sex and unlawfully retaliating against her for bringing a sex discrimination claim. Nathaniel claimed that in December 2006, the Department retaliated against her by no longer allowing her to work in the office.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Otherwise, she stated that she retained the same job duties. Her complaint also included a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress and punitive damages. The Department removed the lawsuit to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi on September 18, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>After the parties conducted discovery, the Department moved for summary judgment, which the district court granted, entering a final judgment on May 25, 2010, 2010 WL 2106953. Nathaniel timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW AND JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">We review a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standard as the district court. <em>Gen. Universal Sys., Inc. v. HAL Inc., </em>500 F.3d 444, 448 (5th Cir.2007). Summary judgment is appropriate if the moving party can show that \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.CivP. 56(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>TIG Specialty Ins. Co. v. Pinkmonkey.com, Inc., </em>375 F.3d 365, 369 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">A. <em>Whether the district court\u2019s opinion ivas based on a fundamental error of fact.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">Nathaniel contends that the district court erred in finding that Belton worked for the same employer for nine years because his previous employer \u2014 SMMH\u2014 was not a state agency. We conclude that Nathaniel\u2019s first point of error is meritless. The district court found that the fact that Belton had a longer history of working for a single employer was a legitimate, nondiseriminatory reason for hiring Belton. Belton\u2019s longest period of employment with a single employer was nine years, as opposed to Nathaniel\u2019s longest period of employment with one employer, which was three years. The district court\u2019s decision to conclude that the Department\u2019s proffered reason constituted a non-discriminatory reason was not a \u201cfundamental error of fact.\u201d The Department relied on the longevity of prior employment in making its decision, and the district court properly concluded that it should not substitute its own judgment for that of the Department\u2019s when \u201cevaluating what types of experience are most valuable for an employee ... in the absence of proof that the standards were not consistently applied or were so irrational or idiosyncratic as to suggest a cover-up.\u201d <em>EEOC v. La. Office of Cmty. Servs., </em>47 F.3d 1438, 1446 (5th Cir.1995). We find it irrelevant whether Belton\u2019s pri- or employment was with a state agency or with a private entity and reject Nathaniel\u2019s first point of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-12\">B. <em>Whether a genuine issue of material fact existed as to the Department\u2019s proffered reasons for not promoting Nathaniel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A4zg\">Nathaniel next argues that the district court erred in giving conclusive weight to the Department\u2019s proffered reasons for hiring Belton rather than Nathaniel, and that the court should have considered whether the Department\u2019s reasons were pretextual. The district court held that Nathaniel set forth a prima facie case for sex discrimination. According to the burden-shifting framework of <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), once the plaintiff meets her burden of establishing a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the defendant to provide a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the decision. <em>Id. </em>at 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817. If the defendant does so, as the Department did in this case, the burden then shifts back to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>plaintiff to show that the defendant\u2019s proffered reason is a pretext for unlawful discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 804, 93 S.Ct. 1817. Here, the Department offered the following reasons for promoting Belton over Nathaniel: his longer history of stable work discussed above, the fact that he had a college degree and Nathaniel did not, and a legislative directive to move part-time employees into full-time positions. See Miss. State Bd. Policy <em>&amp; </em>Procedures Manual, \u00a7 4.21.10 (Rev. Apr. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">Nathaniel relies on <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000), in which the Supreme Court held that \u201ca plaintiffs prima facie case ..., combined with sufficient evidence for a reasonable factfinder to reject the employer\u2019s nondiscriminatory explanation for its decision, is adequate to sustain a finding of liability for intentional discrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 140, 147-49, 120 S.Ct. 2097. Nathaniel\u2019s reliance on <em>Reeves </em>is misplaced. In <em>Reeves, </em>the plaintiff offered substantial evidence to discredit the defendant\u2019s proffered reason for firing the plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>at 151-53, 120 S.Ct. 2097. Unlike <em>Reeves, </em>Nathaniel did not offer any evidence to discredit the Department\u2019s assertion that it hired Belton rather than Nathaniel because of a legislative directive, the fact that Belton had a college degree, and the fact that Belton had a more stable work history.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">On appeal, Nathaniel argues that the Department failed to explain \u201cwhy [it] could not meet this [legislative] directive by promoting [Nathaniel] to the position of Park Worker II and offering the full-time position of Park Worker I to Mr. Belton .... \u201d Nathaniel\u2019s argument, however, ignores the fact that the Department was only required to provide a \u201clegitimate, non-discriminatory reason\u201d for not hiring Nathaniel; it was not required to persuade the court that \u201cit had convincing, objective reasons for preferring the chosen applicant above the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Tex. Dep\u2019t of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 256-57, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981) (holding that \u201c[t]he Court of Appeals ... misconstrued the nature of the burden [ofj <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>and its progeny\u201d by placing \u201con the defendant the burden of persuading the court that it had convincing, objective reasons for preferring the chosen applicant above the plaintiff\u2019). Instead, the \u201cburden on the employer is only one of production, not persuasion, involving no credibility assessments.\u201d <em>Russell v. McKinney Hosp. Venture, </em>235 F.3d 219, 222 (5th Cir.2000). The Department offered three legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for hiring Belton, and Nathaniel failed to rebut these reasons. Therefore, we hold that the district court properly concluded that Nathaniel failed to raise any issue of material fact indicating that the Department\u2019s proffered reasons were pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">C. <em>Whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the Department on Nathaniel\u2019s retaliation claim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">Finally, Nathaniel asserts that the district court erred in failing to find that a genuine issue of material fact existed with respect to Nathaniel\u2019s retaliation claim. Rule 56 makes clear that if, after a party has adequate time for discovery, it fails to provide evidence on one element of its prima facie case, \u201cthere can be \u2018no genuine issue as to any material fact,\u2019 since a complete failure of proof concerning an essential element of the nonmoving party\u2019s case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial.\u201d <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). We conclude that the district court properly granted summary judgment to the Department on Nathaniel\u2019s retaliation claim because Nathaniel failed to provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>evidence to support several elements of her prima facie case.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">To establish a prima facie case for unlawful retaliation under Title VII, Nathaniel must show that: \u201c(1) she engaged in protected activity; (2) an adverse employment action occurred; and (3) a causal link exists between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Turner v. Baylor Richardson Med. Ctr., </em>476 F.3d 337, 348 (5th Cir.2007). Nathaniel proved the first element, because bringing a sex discrimination claim is a protected activity. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a); <em>Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry. v. White, </em>548 U.S. 53, 63, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006). However, Nathaniel failed to offer sufficient evidence as to the second and third elements of her prima facie case.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">First, Nathaniel offered no evidence that not being allowed to work in the office after December 2006 constituted an adverse employment action. She has not explained what \u201cworking in the office\u201d means and how it differs from anything else she still does. While it is true that a lateral reassignment may be actionable, it is not automatically so. <em>White, </em>548 U.S. at 71, 126 S.Ct. 2405. The plaintiff must demonstrate that \u201ca reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse, which in this context means it might well have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68, 126 S.Ct. 2405 (internal quotations omitted). Instead, in her deposition, Nathaniel testified that she held the <em>same position </em>\u2014 fee collector at the ranger station \u2014 that she had when she started working for the Department. Therefore, Nathaniel\u2019s argument on this point fails, because she failed to offer any evidence to show that the Department\u2019s decision not to allow her to work in the office was a materially adverse action.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">The district court\u2019s judgment dismissing Nathaniel\u2019s claims is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b714-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b714-8\">. Nathaniel did not appeal the dismissal of her intentional infliction of emotional distress claim, and this opinion does not address it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b714-13\">. Nathaniel contends that \u201cAs of December the 6th, I wasn't allowed to work back down in the office anymore.\u201d She does not explain how the failure to work in the office impacted her other duties or how the office duties were superior to any duties she retained.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b715-10\">. Effective December 1, 2010, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 has been amended, and the summary judgment standard is now reflected in Rule 56(a). The amended Rule 56 contains no substantive change to the summary judgment standard. Therefore, we cite to the amended rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b717-7\">. Additionally, the directive not to work in the office came before the event for which the retaliation allegedly occurred. The directive was December 6, while her claim of discrimination was not made until the following month. Her \"mistaken perception\u201d argument, <em>see Fogleman v. Mercy Hospital, Inc., </em>283 F.3d 561 (3d Cir.2002), based on an alleged hearsay statement about \u201cgoing to the Governor\u201d made at an unknown time does not serve to resurrect this claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
