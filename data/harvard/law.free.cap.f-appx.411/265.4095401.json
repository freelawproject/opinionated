Although Hernandez was charged with a conspiracy involving 1,000 kilograms or more of marijuana, at his plea colloquy he admitted to a conspiracy involving only 272 kilograms of marijuana. The district court accepted his guilty plea and sentenced Hernandez to ten years imprisonment, which is the mandatory minimum penalty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 1,000 kilograms or more of marijuana. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(vii). Despite the fact that Hernandez failed to object in the district court, he now contends that the it erred by not considering the marijuana quantity to be an \u201cessential element\u201d of his charged offense. Based on that premise, he argues that the district court should have rejected his guilty plea because he admitted to a conspiracy involving only 272 kilograms and, for the same reason, that there was not an adequate factual basis under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure for the district court to accept his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">We review these issues for plain error because Hernandez failed to raise them in the district court. <em>See United States v. Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d 1012, 1019-20 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cTo establish plain error, a defendant must show there is (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1020</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">We have held that drug quantities are sentencing factors as opposed to elements of an offense defined in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841. <em>See United States v. Baker, </em>432 F.3d 1189, 1233 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 \u201cthe specific amount and type of drugs are <em>not elements of the offense </em>\u201d) (emphasis added). Accordingly, because drug quantity is a sentencing factor, the district court did not err, much less plainly err, by not considering it to be an element of the Hernandez\u2019s offense. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
