He was sentenced to concurrent 235-month prison terms on each count. Pursuant to Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the district court subsequently reduced his sentence to 188 months of imprisonment. On appeal of the reduction, Thomas argues that the district court was without authority to impose the original sentence and erred by failing to reduce his sentence below 188 months. Both of these issues are foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">A \u00a7 3582(e)(2) proceeding is not a full resentencing but an opportunity for a sentence reduction based on limited circumstances prescribed by the Sentencing Commission. <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691-94, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010); <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 236-39 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009). As the issue related to the original sentence was unaffected by the amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines, the district court lacked authority to address the issue pursuant to a motion under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-12\">A district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) below the minimum of the amended guideline range only if the defendant\u2019s sentence was below the guideline range applicable at the time of the original sentencing. <em>See DilIon, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2691-92. Contrary to Thomas\u2019s allegation, the original sentence was not less that the applicable guidelines range at the time, and the district court could not have imposed a sentence less than 188 months pursuant to a motion under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on the amended guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-15\">The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b769-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
