Although the complaint sets forth numerous allegations, we briefly summarize the allegations that are relevant to our disposition of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">Dixon was convicted in 1994 of first-degree burglary; based on his history of prior felony convictions, he was sentenced as an \u201chabitual offender\u201d to life imprisonment. <em>See Dixon v. State, </em>673 A.2d 1220, 1223 (Del.1996). Under Delaware law, a life sentence is required for \u201c[a]ny person who has been 2 times convicted of a felony ... and who shall thereafter be convicted of a subsequent felony[.]\u201d 11 Del.Code \u00a7 4214(b). The Delaware Supreme Court has \u201cheld that the legislature intended to reserve the habitual offender penalties for those individuals who were not rehabilitated after the specified number of separate encounters with the criminal justice system and a corresponding number of chances to reform.\u201d <em>Buckingham v. State, </em>482 A.2d 327, 330 (Del.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-12\">Dixon contends in this suit that the predicate felony convictions that formed the basis for his habitual-offender sentence were the result of conduct that he engaged in while suffering from chemical dependency or drug addiction. He alleges that the state officials named here as defendants failed, allegedly due to a discriminatory animus, to afford opportunities for Dixon to receive drug treatment following his earlier convictions. In doing so, Dixon claims, defendants failed to afford him a \u201cchance to reform\u201d so that he could avoid becoming an habitual offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-13\">Dixon asserts that his chemical dependency is a disease and \u201cdisability\u201d under the ADA, and that his disease went untreated despite the State having received federal funds to provide treatment. Claiming that defendants were \u201cdeliberately indifferent\u201d to his need for treatment so that he could avoid future felony convictions, Dixon asked the District Court, <em>inter alia, </em>to declare his habitual-offender sentence unconstitutional \u201cbecause [he was] never provided the requisite number of treatment opportunities before being declared incorrigible under habitual offender proceedings.\u201d Complaint at \u00b6 35. Dixon also sought class certification on behalf of other inmates similarly situated.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-14\">The District Court granted leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>(\u201cIFP\u201d). In a subsequent order, the Court dismissed the complaint <em>sua sponte </em>under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and 1915A(b)(2) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and determined that any amendment to the complaint would be futile. Dixon and his fellow plaintiffs timely filed this appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>This Court has appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We exercise plenary review over a district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of an IFP complaint for failure to state a claim. <em>Allah v. Seiverling, </em>229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The District Court rejected Dixon\u2019s Title II claims for a variety of reasons, but we need only address one of those reasons\u2014 the statute of limitations \u2014 because it plainly dictates dismissal. A district court has authority to dismiss a complaint <em>sua sponte </em>under \u00a7 1915(e) where, as here, the statute of limitations defense is obvious from the face of the complaint and no development of the factual record is required. <em>See, e.g., Fogle v. Pierson, </em>435 F.3d 1252, 1258 (10th Cir.2006). \u201c[T]he statute of limitations applicable to claims under Title II of the ADA ... is the statute of limitations for personal injury actions in the state in which the trial court sits.\u201d <em>Disabled in Action v. SEPTA, </em>539 F.3d 199, 208 (3d Cir.2008). The state at issue here, Delaware, has a two-year limitations period. <em>See </em>10 Del.Code \u00a7 8119. \u201c[A] federal cause of action accrues when the plaintiff discovers, or with due diligence should have discovered, the injury that forms the basis for the claim.\u201d <em>Disabled in Action, </em>539 F.3d at 209 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Dixon was sentenced as an habitual offender in 1994. He filed this suit thirteen years later, on June 16, 2007. Dixon is plainly time barred as to any claim that he might assert under Title II based on an alleged failure to afford treatment for his drug addiction \u2014 treatment which, according to the \u2019 complaint, should have been provided in the years prior to Dixon\u2019s 1994 sentencing as an habitual offender. It is clear that any amendment to the complaint to correct this defect would be futile. <em>See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., </em>293 F.3d 103,108 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">Insofar as Dixon\u2019s pro se complaint can be read liberally to assert a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, such as a claim of deliberate indifference to a past serious medical need for drug treatment, <em>see </em>Complaint at \u00b6 31, the same two-year statute of limitations period applies. <em>See McDowell v. Delaware State Police, </em>88 F.3d 188, 190 (3d Cir.1996). Our review of the complaint reveals no basis for any claim under \u00a7 1983 that can be said to have accrued within two years prior to Dixon\u2019s filing of this suit on June 16, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">Finally, we agree with the District Court that Dixon\u2019s request to have his sentence declared unconstitutional improperly crosses the line into a request for habeas corpus relief. As this Court has explained, \u201cwhenever the challenge ultimately attacks the \u2018core of habeas\u2019 \u2014 the validity of the continued conviction or the fact or length of the sentence \u2014 a challenge, however denominated and regardless of the relief sought, must be brought by way of a habeas corpus petition.\u201d <em>Leamer v. Fauver, </em>288 F.3d 532, 542 (3d Cir.2002). Title II and \u00a7 1983 do not provide a means for Dixon to overturn his presumptively valid criminal sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">In sum, and after a review of the entire record, we conclude that Dixon\u2019s claims were properly dismissed. Because his appeal lacks arguable legal merit, <em>see Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989), we will dismiss it under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). Dixon\u2019s motion for summary action is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b470-10\">. Plaintiffs Salih Hall and Kenneth M. Smith initially joined in the appeal. Smith later voluntarily withdrew, and Hall was dismissed from the appeal after he was denied leave to proceed IFP and failed to pay the filing fee. Dixon, the lone remaining appellant, is proceeding IFP on appeal. Our review is limited to Dixon's claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
