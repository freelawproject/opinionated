Redmond commenced this action by filing a pro se complaint against the Four Seasons Hotel in Philadelphia, claiming that, on March 3, 2006, a security guard prevented Redmond from entering the hotel lobby because of his race. Redmond sought damages for an alleged violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1982. The District Court granted <em>informa pauperis </em>status and dismissed the complaint <em>sua sponte </em>under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), noting that the suit is barred under the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>and also time-barred under the statute of limitations. Redmond appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review is plenary. <em>Allah v. Seiverling, </em>229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir.2000). We must dismiss an <em>in forma pauperis </em>appeal if we determine that it is \u201cfrivolous or malicious.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i); <em>see Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 324-25, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-12\">The District Court correctly concluded that this suit is barred. Redmond raised precisely the same allegation against the Four Seasons Hotel in a prior suit, which the District Court dismissed on the merits. <em>See </em>E.D. Pa. Civ. No. 09-cv-05698. In addition, the District Court denied Redmond\u2019s motion for reconsideration in the prior suit and expressly rejected the merits of his claims under \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1982 for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Given the prior dismissal on the merits, the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>bars Redmond \u201cfrom initiating a second suit against the same adversary based on the same \u2018cause of action\u2019 as the first suit.\u201d <em>Duhaney v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>621 F.3d 340, 347 (3d Cir.2010). In addition, as fully explained by the District Court, Redmond\u2019s claims are plainly time-barred under the statute of limitations. Accordingly, we will dismiss this appeal under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
