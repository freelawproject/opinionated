Carcamo contends that the district court erred by imposing a 16-level crime of violence enhancement based on his prior Texas conviction for indecency by contact with a child under 17 years of age, a violation of Texas Penal Code \u00a7 21.11(a)(2). He argues that the Texas conviction is not within the enumerated offense of sexual abuse of a minor because an offense under \u00a7 21.11(a) can be committed against a victim who is 16 years of age. The Government moves for summary affirmance or, in the alternative, for an extension of time to file a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-21\">As Carcamo concedes, his argument is foreclosed by circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Ayala, </em>542 F.3d 494, 495 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Zavala-Sustaita, </em>214 F.3d 601, 604 (5th Cir.2000). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED, and the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED. The alternative request for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b789-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
