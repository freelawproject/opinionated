The Government argues that the appeal is barred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>by the waiver of appeal provision in Carpintero\u2019s written plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">This court reviews de novo whether a waiver provision bars an appeal. <em>United States v. Baymon, </em>812 F.3d 725, 727 (5th Cir.2002). The district court must personally address the defendant in open court, inform him of the terms of the appellate waiver, and determine that he understands the waiver. Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(1)(N). In the instant case, the magistrate judge erroneously advised Carpintero at rearraignment that his waiver did not bar an appeal from a \u201ctotally unreasonable\u201d sentence. This was an incorrect characterization of the appeal waiver and did not comply with Rule ll(b)(l)(N). The waiver was therefore unknowing and involuntary and does not apply to bar the instant appeal. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>187 F.3d 516, 517-18 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Consequently, we address the merits of Carpintero\u2019s argument that his sentence, which represented an upward variance from the guidelines range, is substantively unreasonable, reviewing the district court\u2019s sentencing decision under a highly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>see also United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008). This court also reviews whether the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors support the sentence and gives deference to the district court\u2019s determination that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors justify the variance. <em>United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 349 (5th Cir.2008). \u201cA sentence is unreasonable if it (1) does not account for a factor that should have received significant weight, (2) gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or (3) represents a clear error of judgment in balancing the sentencing factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 392 (5th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">Carpintero\u2019s argument that the sentence he received was unreasonable is conclusional and unsupported by any legal authority. He does not point to an overlooked sentencing factor, nor does he argue that the district court gave weight to an improper factor or incorrectly balanced the factors. <em>See id. </em>Moreover, the district court supported its sentencing determination with reference to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, specifically citing \u00a7 3553(a)(1), the nature and circumstances of the offense and Carpintero\u2019s history and characteristics, and \u00a7 3553(a)(2), the need to provide just punishment, adequate deterrence, and public protection from further crimes of Carpintero.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">Carpintero\u2019s argument that his criminal history adequately reflected his criminal past misrepresents the court\u2019s reasoning. The court did not rely on the inadequacy of his criminal history score but on the similarity of his prior criminal convictions to show that he had three times impersonated an immigration official with the intent to defraud, a pattern which demonstrates his likelihood to recidivate. This fact, in combination with the facts that Carpintero\u2019s prior lenient sentence had not deterred him and that his criminal conduct was escalating, as evidenced by the large number of victims in this case, were proper factors on which to base an upward variance. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(1) and (2). Carpintero\u2019s mere disagreement with the sentence he received is insufficient to show that his sentence is unreasonable or that the district court abused its sentencing discretion. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50-51, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>see also United States v. Rowan, </em>530 F.3d 379, 380 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b719-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
