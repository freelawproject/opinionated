Cooper does not dispute that he suffers from diabetes mellitus requiring oral hypoglycemic medication for control, but he contends that he does not suffer from bipolar disorder. After the FAA denied his application, Cooper filed a petition for review with the National Transportation Safety Board (\u201cNTSB\u201d). Based on his undisputed diabetes diagnosis, the administrative law judge dismissed Cooper\u2019s appeal without a hearing. Cooper then appealed to the full NTSB, which denied the appeal and affirmed the administrative law judge\u2019s decision. Cooper moved for rehearing, reargument, reconsideration, and modification of the order. The NTSB denied Cooper\u2019s motion, and he filed a timely petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-13\">Cooper argues that the NTSB erred in denying his appeal without conducting a hearing on the contested issue of whether he suffers from bipolar disorder. Under the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), we review an agency decision to determine if it was arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A); <em>see also City of Abilene v. EPA, </em>325 F.3d 657, 664 (5th Cir.2003). Where the denial of a medical certificate hinges on a disputed issue of fact, it may be \u201carbitrary and capricious to deny [the petitioner] a hearing at which he could offer evidence.\u201d <em>Singleton v. Babbitt, </em>588 F.3d 1078, 1085 (D.C-Cir.2009). By the same token, \u201ceven when a statute mandates an adjudicatory proceeding, neither that statute, nor due process, nor the APA requires an agency to conduct a meaningless evidentiary hearing when the facts are undisputed.\u201d <em>United States v. Cheramie Bo-Truc No. 5, Inc., </em>538 F.2d 696, 698 (5th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>Cir.1976). The general medical standards for a first-class airman medical certificate require that the applicant have \u201c[n]o established medical history or clinical diagnosis of diabetes mellitus that requires insulin or any other hypoglycemic drug for control.\u201d 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 67.113(a). It is undisputed that Cooper failed to meet this requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Cooper argues that he was entitled to a hearing on his alleged bipolar disorder nonetheless, because the correctness of that diagnosis is relevant to his eligibility for the special issuance of a medical certificate by the Federal Air Surgeon. The FAA concedes that, despite Cooper\u2019s ineligibility under the general medical guidelines, he may seek a special issuance of a medical certificate pursuant to 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 67.401. <em>See Reder v. FAA, </em>116 F.3d 1261, 1263 (8th Cir.1997) (considering appeal of denial of special issuance of medical certificate). Cooper\u2019s potential eligibility for a medical certificate via that alternative process, however, is immaterial to the NTSB\u2019s review of his initial denial of a certificate below. Both the administrative law judge and the NTSB made clear that their rulings were based solely on the Cooper\u2019s undisputed diabetes diagnosis. Cooper has identified no authority to support the contention that the NTSB is required to engage in additional fact-finding that would serve no purpose other than to assist (or hinder) Cooper in his application for a special issuance of the denied certificate. The NTSB\u2019s duty is to review whether an application \u201cmeets the applicable regulations and standards\u201d for the issuance of an unrestricted certificate. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 44703(d)(2). Once the Board concluded that Cooper did not meet those regulations and standards, a hearing on additional matters was unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">For the foregoing reasons, Cooper\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b718-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b718-14\">.
