He contends that his sentence was both procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-21\">Umana\u2019s base offense level for violating 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 was 8. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2L1.2 (Nov. 2009). His presentence investigation report increased that base offense level by 16 because Umana had re-entered the United States after being convicted of a crime of violence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A). That prior crime of violence was his 1998 state court conviction for child abuse, for which he received a sentence of 31 days in prison and 1 year of probation. Because of the 16-level increase, his offense level came out to 24, which was reduced 3 levels for his timely acceptance of responsibility, resulting in a final offense level of 21. That level, combined with his criminal history category of IV, resulted in an advisory guidelines range of 57-71 months. The PSR also indicated that under the applicable sentencing guidelines, Part K of Chapter 5 and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, there was no basis for a departure, and none of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors appeared to war<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>rant a sentence outside the advisory guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Umana initially filed an objection to the 16-level increase in his offense level, arguing that his 1998 conviction for child abuse did not qualify as a crime of violence. At the sentence hearing, however, his counsel withdrew that objection, stating that he was doing so only \u201c[ajfter further research and review.\u201d The court asked Umana himself whether he understood the consequences of withdrawing the objection, and he replied affirmatively. The court then inquired whether Umana had any objections to the factual accuracy of his PSR or to the probation officer\u2019s application of the advisory guidelines, and to both questions Umana replied that he had none.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The court then heard argument from both sides about what sentence to impose. Umana offered in mitigation only the argument that his \u201crepeated trips\u201d to the United States had been \u201cpurely economical for him to find a job and make money.\u201d Umana himself declined several times to say anything further on his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">When asked for its recommendation, the government conceded that it was a \u201cclose call\u201d whether under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 Umana\u2019s criminal history \u201csubstantially overrepresented the ... seriousness of [his] criminal conduct and likelihood to be a recidivist.\u201d The government maintained that the advisory guidelines had been calculated correctly, but it asked for a sentence \u201cbetween the lower end of the [advisory guidelines] range and the midpoint,\u201d pointing out that Umana\u2019s conviction for child abuse was \u201ca ten year old offense\u201d for which he had received \u201ca relatively short sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">In response Umana\u2019s counsel agreed with the government \u201ctotally,\u201d noting that while the child abuse conviction was a crime of violence under the guidelines, the \u201cfactual scenario and the disposition\u201d of that earlier conviction made it sound like a relatively \u201cmild\u201d crime. The court then inquired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-10\">Oh, so you\u2019re recommending to the Court also that he be sentenced at the lower end \u2014 or I believe the suggestion of [the government] was somewhere toward the lower end of the guidelines as opposed to the top of the guidelines or close to the top of the guidelines?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">To which Umana\u2019s counsel responded, \u2018Yes, Your Honor.\u201d Umana himself then indicated he agreed with the representations of his counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">The court imposed a sentence of 60 months, a term only three months above the lowest end of Umana\u2019s guidelines range and significantly below the statutory maximum of 20 years. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b). In imposing that sentence the court stated that it had considered the advisory guidelines and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and found that a sentence of 60 months was \u201csufficient but not greater than necessary to comply with the statutory purposes of sentencing.\u201d The court also imposed a three-year period of supervised release together with a number of \u201cspecial conditions,\u201d including that Umana not re-enter the United States in the event he was deported, that he participate in an approved domestic violence program, and that he submit to random drug and alcohol testing. The court then asked both Umana and his counsel whether they had any objections to either the sentence or the manner in which it had been pronounced, and neither did.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-14\">Umana raises two main arguments about the procedural reasonableness of his sentence. First he argues that the district court failed to adequately explain its consideration of his prior child abuse convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>tion and the resulting 16-level increase in his offense level. Second he argues that the district court\u2019s mere recitation of the fact that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors was an insufficient explanation of his sentence in light of the concerns raised about that child abuse conviction and whether it tended to over-represent his criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">We typically review the procedural reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion, making sure the district court properly calculated the guidelines range, treated the sentencing guidelines as advisory, considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, did not select a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, and adequately explained the chosen sentence. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The government argues, however, that because Umana raised no objections at the sentence hearing to any aspect of the procedural reasonableness of his sentence, including the court\u2019s explanation of that sentence, we should review only for plain error. The standard of review makes no difference here, because we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The district court must state at the sentence hearing its reasons for imposing a particular sentence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c). But the court is not required to \u201cstate on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the section 3553(a) factors\u201d or to discuss each of them individually. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005) (citation omitted). To satisfy that standard, \u201c[a]n acknowledgment that the district court has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors will suffice.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Umana\u2019s sentence was proeedurally reasonable because the district court properly calculated the guidelines range, treated that range as advisory, and adequately explained the sentence and its consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. While Umana is correct that the court did not provide an elaborate explanation for the sentence it chose or detail its consideration of each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, those facts do not make for procedural error here. The sentence hearing itself, as the government points out to this Court, was \u201cas uncontroversial as they come,\u201d with the parties agreeing to the facts in the PSR, the offense level, the criminal history category, the advisory guidelines range, and even the appropriateness of a sentence at the low end of that range. Given those circumstances, the explanation the court offered for the sentence it chose was adequate, and we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">Umana also contests the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, arguing that it was greater than necessary to achieve the purposes of sentencing. We normally review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard, examining the actual sentence imposed in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 56, 128 S.Ct. at 597, 600. After performing that examination, we will vacate a defendant\u2019s sentence \u201cif, but only if, we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">We need not conduct that inquiry here, however, because the record shows that Umana requested the actual sentence that the court imposed. \u2022 His counsel spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>cifically agreed when the court asked, \u201cSo you\u2019re recommending ... that [Umana] be sentenced ... toward the lower end of the guidelines ... ?\u201d And he was. Having asked for the sentence he got, Umana\u2019s challenge to it is barred by the doctrine of invited error. <em>See United States v. Love, </em>449 F.3d 1154, 1157 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (applying the \u201ccardinal rule of appellate review that a party may not challenge as error a ruling or other trial proceeding invited by that party\u201d in rejecting a defendant\u2019s challenge to his sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
