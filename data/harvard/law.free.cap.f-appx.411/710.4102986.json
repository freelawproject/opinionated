Medina contends his sentence: should <em>not </em>be accorded the presumption of reasonableness applied to a within-Guidelines sentence given that it was enhanced by a Guideline lacking empirical support; and is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to accomplish the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-22\">Medina urges not applying the presumption of reasonableness on the claim that Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2, upon which his 16-level enhancement was based, lacks empirical support. He concedes this assertion is foreclosed by our precedent, but raises it to preserve it for possible further review. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-24\">Regarding his substantive-unreasonableness claim, Medina contends his sentence is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) because Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2, unsupported by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>empirical data, double-counts his prior conviction by allowing its use both to increase his offense level and calculate his criminal-history score. He further maintains the Guidelines range: overstated the seriousness of his offense because his conduct was not violent; and did not properly account for his personal history and characteristics, including his motive for reentry.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Medina\u2019s substantive-unreasonableness claim is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 360. Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the advisory sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, the district court must still properly calculate the Guideline-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005). When, as here, the district court imposes a sentence within a properly-calculated Guidelines range, we accord great deference to the sentence and apply a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51-52, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>United States v. Newson, </em>515 F.3d 374, 379 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Although he made related objections in district court, Medina did not object to the reasonableness of his sentence; therefore, that claim would likely be reviewed only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007). Deciding whether to apply plain-error review is unnecessary, however, because Medina has failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness under the more lenient abuse-of-discretion standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">Contrary to Medina\u2019s assertion, the court adequately weighed the \u00a7 3553 sentencing factors. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir. 2006). It considered Medina\u2019s criminal history category of IV, and noted that six of his prior convictions were not considered in that category. Although Medina contends the court erred in using his 15-year old burglary-of-a-dwelling conviction in its sentence enhancement, Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2 does not place age limitations on prior convictions. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). The court also considered Medina\u2019s motive for reentry, and his not having understood the punishment for such offense, but determined that a 60-month sentence was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-10\">Finally, Medina\u2019s contention that his criminal record is improperly double-counted under Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2, without any empirical basis, is also foreclosed by our precedent. <em>E.g., United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009) (recognizing discretion afforded district courts in applying Guidelines to particular facts); <em>see also Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 366-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b736-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
