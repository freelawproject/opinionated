For the reasons that follow, we will vacate the order of the District Court and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-23\">On November 9, 2009, Oleson filed a complaint pursuant to <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). He named several prison officials as defendants and alleged that they (1) refused to replace his wheelchair, (2) refused to relocate him to a unit with a first-floor meeting room, (3) removed items from his cell, (4) required him to wait outside in the rain for his turn to enter the dining building, and (5) deleted visitors from his visitor log. The District Court sua sponte dismissed the complaint for failure to exhaust. Oleson filed a motion for reconsideration, attaching documents that he thought demonstrated that he had exhausted his remedies. The Dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>trict Court granted the motion, but again dismissed the complaint for failure to exhaust. The defendants were never served. Oleson appealed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">\u201c[E]xhaustion is mandatory under the [Prison Litigation Reform Act, 42 U.S.C. 1997e <em>et </em>seq.] and [ ... ] unexhausted claims cannot be brought in court.\u201d <em>Jones v. Bock, </em>549 U.S. 199, 127 S.Ct. 910, 918-19, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007). However, as we made clear in <em>Ray v. Kertes, </em>285 F.3d 287, 295 (3d Cir.2002), \u201cfailure to exhaust is an affirmative defense to be pleaded by the defendant.\u201d In some limited circumstances, it may be appropriate for the District Court to sua sponte dismiss a complaint for failure to exhaust, such as when the plaintiff expressly concedes that he or she has failed to exhaust a claim. <em>See Id. </em>at 293 n. 5. Oleson made no such concession. To the contrary, he claims to have exhausted his administrative remedies. Nor is Oleson\u2019s failure to exhaust \u201capparent from the face of the complaint\u201d or his other filings. <em>Id. </em>at 297. It may be \u2014 a question we do not reach \u2014 that the documents Oleson submitted to the District Court do not prove that he exhausted available remedies; however, as in <em>Ray, see Id., </em>they do not prove that he did not exhaust, either. To dismiss on this basis improperly places the burden on Oleson, instead of on the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Accordingly, we will summarily vacate the District Court and remand for further proceedings. Appellant\u2019s motion for a court order directing prison staff to provide him with new wheelchair castors is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b473-8\">. We have jurisdiction to hear this appeal. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review of a district court's dismissal for failure to exhaust is plenary. <em>Spruill v. Gillis, </em>372 F.3d 218, 226 (3d Cir.2004). Summary action is warranted if an appeal presents no substantial question. LAR 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
