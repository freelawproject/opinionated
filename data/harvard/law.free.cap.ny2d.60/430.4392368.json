The trial court properly refused to permit expert testimony regarding defendant\u2019s intent or his ability to have an intent to commit the crimes with which he was charged. <em>(Kulak v Nationwide Ins. Co., </em>40 NY2d 140; <em>People v Creasy, </em>236 NY 205; <em>People v Paschall, </em>91 AD2d 645; <em>People v Graydon, </em>43 AD2d 842; <em>People v Buffington, </em>29 AD2d 229; <em>People v Roff, </em>67 AD2d 805; <em>People v Ciaccio, </em>47 NY2d 431.) II. In the circumstances of this case, the trial court\u2019s holding that the defense expert witness\u2019s statement of what defendant would be like in a stuporous condition, be stricken, did not constitute reversible error. <em>(People v Roff, </em>67 AD2d 805; <em>People v Crimmins, </em>36 NY2d 230.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b487-8\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b487-9\">Kaye, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">During the early hours of June 27, 1979, defendant, one of a group of youths, entered a Radio Shack store by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>running through a plate glass window; and several items were stolen. The evidence in this prosecution for burglary and related offenses showed that prior to the break-in, defendant had consumed up to a case of beer, smoked several marihuana cigarettes, and ingested 5 to 10 Valium tablets. The key issue for the jury\u2019s determination was whether defendant could have formed the requisite intent for the crimes charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">The trial court permitted the defense to introduce the expert testimony of a forensic psychiatrist skilled in drug and alcohol abuse, but announced in advance that it would not allow inquiry about defendant\u2019s state of mind, his intent or ability to have intent, or blackouts, because those were the ultimate questions to be decided by the jury. Additionally, the court struck expert testimony perceived to be approaching, by indirection, these ultimate questions, indicating that such testimony would pre-empt the jury\u2019s function.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Because the wrong standard was applied, the testimony of defendant\u2019s expert on the key issue was erroneously circumscribed. We therefore reverse the conviction and order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">In a sense, opinion testimony of an expert witness necessarily enters upon the jury\u2019s province, since the expert \u2014 and not the jury \u2014 draws conclusions from the facts, which the jury is then asked to adopt. Such testimony, however, is admissible where the conclusions to be drawn from the facts \u201cdepend upon professional or scientific knowledge or skill not within the range of ordinary training or intelligence.\u201d <em>(Dougherty v Milliken, </em>163 NY 527, 533; <em>De Long v County of Erie, </em>60 NY2d 296.) Both sides may of course cross-examine and impeach the opposition\u2019s experts, and adduce different opinions through their own experts. <em>(Selkowitz v County of Nassau, </em>45 NY2d 97, 103.)</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">While controversy about opinion testimony going to the ultimate questions has brewed elsewhere,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in this State the test has been different. For testimony regarding both the ultimate questions and those of lesser significance, admissibility turns on whether, given the nature of the subject, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>\u201cthe facts cannot be stated or described to the jury in such a manner as to enable them to form an accurate judgment thereon, and no better evidence than such opinions is attainable.\u201d <em>(Van Wycklen v City of Brooklyn, </em>118 NY 424, 429; <em>Noah v Bowery Sav. Bank, 225 NY </em>284, 292.)</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The admissibility and bounds of expert testimony are addressed primarily to the sound discretion of the trial court, and review beyond the intermediate appellate level is generally unwarranted. <em>(Selkowitz v County of Nassau, </em>45 NY2d 97, <em>supra.) </em>It is for the trial court in the first instance to determine when jurors are able to draw conclusions from the evidence based on their day-to-day experience, their common observation and their knowledge, and when they would be benefited by the specialized knowledge of an expert witness. Here, the trial court permitted a psychiatrist to testify generally on the subject of defendant\u2019s condition given his drug and alcohol consumption, but felt constrained to draw the line at the expression of an opinion regarding the defendant\u2019s ability to form intent, only because such an opinion went to the ultimate question and would usurp the jury\u2019s function. The court failed to exercise its discretion because it erroneously perceived that it had no discretion to exercise. This was not a proper application of the test for expert testimony, and presents a legal issue for review by us. <em>(People v Williams, </em>56 NY2d 236.)</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Had the trial court exercised its discretion with respect to expert testimony on the subject of intent<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it could have found such evidence admissible. While jurors might be familiar with the effects of alcohol on one\u2019s mental state, the combined impact of a case of beer, several marihuana cigarettes and 5 to 10 Valium tablets on a person\u2019s ability to act purposefully cannot be said as a matter of law to be within the ken of the typical juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">Despite considerable latitude permitted in questioning the expert, the blanket preclusion of testimony regarding intent was not harmless error. The announced imposition of limits on the expert\u2019s testimony, and the striking of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>testimony, denied defendant the opportunity to elicit opinions going directly to the issue of intent. The jury was left with the expert\u2019s generalized observations about the effects of alcohol and drug consumption, without his application of these observations, in the form of opinion testimony, to the element of purposeful activity. Further, expert testimony regarding the ability of a person, though stuporous, to answer simple questions, was stricken because it was perceived to be reaching the ultimate question, yet defendant\u2019s ability to answer simple questions shortly after the crime was emphasized by the People as a mark of his ability to have formed the requisite intent. Finally, the fact that defendant\u2019s counsel in summation argued from testimony that would have been given by the doctor, but was disallowed, does not eliminate the prejudice; lawyers\u2019 argument is not the equivalent of expert medical testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b488-9\">. (See Advisory Committee\u2019s Note, Federal Rules of Evidence, rule 704 [US Code, tit 28]; Proposed Code of Evidence for State of New York, \u00a7 704.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b489-8\">. We do not suggest that questions to such an expert could properly have been framed in terms of \u201cintent,\u201d since his perception of that term might differ dramatically from the statutory definition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b490-5\">Chief Judge Cooke and Wachtler and Simons, JJ.</author>\n<p id=\"ANT\">(concurring). We agree with the majority that the trial court failed to exercise its discretion and therefore the matter must be remitted for a new trial <em>(People v Williams, </em>56 NY2d 236). However, we cannot join the majority in that portion of its opinion in which it attempts to determine what the trial court \u201cmight\u201d have done had it exercised discretion. That is unnecessary and would practically direct the discretion which the trial court should be free to exercise for itself at the new trial. In addition, the hypothetical discussion focuses only on those factors favoring admission of the expert\u2019s opinion. A review of the record shows that there were competing factors which might have justified the court to limit the expert\u2019s testimony in the exercise of discretion if the court had, in fact, exercised discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">An expert\u2019s opinion is only as sound as the facts upon which it is based and there is some question as to whether this defendant established a sufficient foundation to support the doctor\u2019s testimony. The only evidence of the quantities of drugs and alcohol consumed by the defendant came from the testimony of codefendant Carl Silva, who had previously pleaded guilty. Silva admitted that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>intoxicated that night and he testified that he could not recall who the other youths with them were or how much alcohol and Valium he had consumed during the evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">In short had the court exercised discretion it might just as correctly be said that it did not abuse its discretion as a matter of law by limiting the expert to general testimony about the properties of the substances consumed and their probable effect on defendant when the only facts submitted to support the expert\u2019s opinion were found in the testimony of a codefendant who was too drunk to remember what he had had to drink the same night.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Judges Jasen, Jones and Meyer concur with Judge Kaye; Chief Judge Cooke and Judges Wachtler and Simons concur in result in a memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Order revers\u00e9d, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
