At the direction of its attorney, Robert T. Weisswasser, the Fund drew a check on defendant Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company payable to Pitney, Hardin &amp; Kipp, a New Jersey law firm which represented another party in a pending lawsuit against the Fund. The check was delivered to Weisswasser to be used as payment in settlement of the pending litigation but neither the New Jersey lawyers nor their clients received any of the proceeds. Instead, Weisswasser forged the indorsement of the payee\u2019s name, deposited the check in his account at defendant-appellant Chemical Bank and then withdrew the proceeds and absconded. He was subsequently found dead from a bullet wound in the head.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">Plaintiffs sought to recover the loss in this action against defendant drawee, Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, which had forwarded moneys to satisfy the check from the Fund\u2019s account to defendant-appellant, Chemical Bank, and against defendant-appellant, the depositary bank. The action against Manufacturers was dismissed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>Inasmuch as the forged indorsement of the drawer\u2019s agent was effective to negotiate the check, the drawee did not act wrongfully in honoring it (see Uniform Commercial Code, \u00a7 3-405, subd [1], par [c]). Insofar as the indorsement may have been irregular or the directions of the restrictive indorsement were not followed, the drawee was not liable to plaintiffs because only the depositary bank was charged with the responsibility of checking the restrictive indorsement and complying with the directions it contained (Uniform Commercial Code, \u00a7 3-419, subd [4]). Special Term granted plaintiff summary judgment against the depositary, Chemical Bank, however, and the Appellate Division affirmed its order. We granted leave to appeal and we now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">In holding the depositary liable, both Special Term and the Appellate Division relied upon our decision in <em>Underpinning &amp; Foundation Constructors v Chase Manhattan Bank </em>(46 NY2d 459). In <em>Underpinning </em>we acknowledged the general rule that the drawer of a check paid by a depositary over a forged indorsement normally has no cause of action against the depositary for the obvious reason that either the forgery is effective to transfer the instrument, as it is here, or if it is not, the depositary has received nothing of the drawer for which the drawer may recover. In both instances, the drawer\u2019s action is against the drawee who has honored the check and debited the drawer\u2019s account. In those circumstances in which the statute provides that the forgery is effective to transfer the check, it does so on the premise that because the drawer has dealt with the forger, the drawer can best avoid the loss. Accordingly, the drawer may not recover from the drawee (see, generally, Uniform Commercial Code, \u00a7 3-405). In most cases, however, the forgery is not effective to transfer the instrument and the drawee is liable because it is in a position to detect the forgery before payment. Thus, in such cases it is the drawee, as between two innocent parties, who is accountable for the loss (see <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith v Chemical Bank, </em>57 NY2d 439, 444-445). As to the depositary, we held in <em>Underpinning </em>that notwithstanding the general rule, the drawer may recover from it in those \u201ccomparatively rare instances\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>when the depositary has acted wrongfully and yet the drawee has acted properly in honoring the check because the forgery is effective (at p 466). The wrong in <em>Underpinning </em>was the payment by the depositary in disregard of the restrictive indorsement. That is plaintiffs\u2019 claim here. They contend that Chemical Bank is similarly liable because it accepted the check and paid funds over to the credit of Weisswasser contrary to the terms of a restrictive indorsement on the. check.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">The writing on the back of the Fund\u2019s check appeared as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-5\">\u201cPay to Special Account #012-043478 <em>&amp;/ </em>Pitney, Hardin &amp; Kipp For Deposit Only Special Account 012-043478\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">Special account No. 012-043478 at Chemical Bank was the business account of attorney Weisswasser. The Appellate Division ruled that absent a clear indication to the contrary, the words \u201cfor deposit only\u201d meant for deposit to the account of the payee \u2014 not the account of the person presenting the check. Inasmuch as the bank had no account for Pitney, Hardin &amp; Kipp, it was on notice of the forgery and should have questioned the indorsements. Instead, it deposited the proceeds to the special account. Thus, the court held it was liable to the drawer for doing so contrary to the directions of the restrictive indorsement (Uniform Commercial Code, \u00a7 3-206, subd [3]).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">In <em>Underpinning, </em>the checks were restrictively indorsed \u201cfor deposit only\u201d, followed by the stamped name of the payee. The payees had no account in the depositary bank, however, and we found a violation of the restrictive indorsements because the depositary did not, indeed it could not, deposit the proceeds in the accounts named as it had been directed to do. Instead, in clear violation of the indorsements, the depositary either credited the checks to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>the account of the forger or paid cash to him. Thus, it failed in its obligation to deposit the checks to the account of the payee as the indorsement required. To contrast, this check was deposited to the credit of the depositary\u2019s customer, the owner of the special account. The bank contends that its actions in doing so were proper because there were two indorsements on the check, a special indorsement by Pitney, Hardin &amp; Kipp, effective to transfer the check to Weisswasser, identified by the number of his special account, and a restrictive indorsement effective to transfer the check for deposit to the credit of Weisswasser, again identified by the number of his special account. Though no signature appeared under the second indorsement, characterized by the bank as the restrictive indorsement, when it received the check, it contends that it was authorized to accept the check with the restriction and supply the missing signature (see Uniform Commercial Code, \u00a7 4-205, subd [1]).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">If the names had been used in place of the special account number, the correctness of the bank\u2019s conduct would be clear. Thus, the critical issue is whether the indorsements were effective even though the customer was identified by his account number rather than his name. If the account number was sufficient to identify the transferee and as a signature, the depositary honored the directions given it and it is not liable to plaintiffs. -</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Indorsement is the method by which the holder of an instrument transfers it to another. In the broadest sense, an indorsement is a writing on the back of the instrument. The signing evidences the contract the indorser enters into with the other parties on the instrument. A special indorsement \u201cspecifies the person to whom or to whose order\u201d the instrument is to be paid and requires a further indorsement by the party named before it can be transferred (Uniform Commercial Code, \u00a7 3-204, subd [1]). A restrictive indorsement requires the taker to apply the proceeds of the instrument in a manner consistent with the indorser\u2019s directions, in this case to credit the proceeds by depositing them to the account identified on the back of the check (see Uniform Commercial Code, \u00a7 3-205). The two types of indorsements may validly appear on the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>instrument, as they did in this case, and a single indorsement may be both special and restrictive, as is the direction contained in the first three lines appearing on the back of this check.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">However the writings on the back of this check are interpreted, the depositary followed the instructions given and it is not liable for plaintiff\u2019s loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">If it is contended that the writing must be considered as two indorsements and that the special indorsement was not proper because the statute requires transfer to a \u201cperson\u201d, as indeed it does, then the answer is that there is no requirement that the person be identified by name nor any prohibition against identification by bank account number, title or similar means.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That, the account number was used rather than the name of the owner of the account does not alter the designation when the account is in existence and identifiable as belonging to a specific person. Furthermore, there is no specific requirement of the form of the signature necessary for a valid indorsement. Once the indorsee was identified by number, the indorsement could be executed consistent with it (see <em>Brown v Butchers &amp; Drovers\u2019 Bank, </em>6 Hill 443 [where the indorsement was made with numbers 1-2-8]). The code provides only that an indorsement must be \u201cwritten by or on behalf of the holder and on the instrument\u201d or allonge (Uniform Commercial Code, \u00a7 3-202, subd [2]) and that where \u201can instrument is made payable to a person under a misspelled name or one other than his own he may indorse in that name or his own or both\u201d (Uniform Commercial Code, \u00a7 203). That conclusion finds support in the rule that a person may use any name or mark as a means of identification, a common legal principle adopted in the code in the provision that a signature is made by use of any name, including any trade or assumed names upon an instrument or by a word or mark in lieu of written signatures (Uniform Commercial Code, \u00a7 3-401, subd [2]).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>If it is contended that the first three lines constituted both a special and a restrictive indorsement and the remainder surplusage, the depositary followed the indorser\u2019s directions when it deposited the proceeds of the check to account No. 012-043478, the account of its customer. Thus, its examination of the check disclosed either a negotiation of the check to its customer by special indorsement and then a direction to deposit the proceeds to his account or a single indorsement, both special and restrictive to similarly deposit the proceeds. It is the direction to deposit to the account of the customer and the bank\u2019s action in honoring that direction which distinguishes the case from the facts in <em>Underpinning </em>and establishes that the bank\u2019s action accorded with reasonable business practice for there are many instances in which a family member or a business may indorse for deposit funds to the credit of another and a depositary is not on notice of chicanery because of it nor is it liable if it faithfully follows such a direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment denied, defendant-appellant\u2019s cross motion for summary judgment granted, and the complaint dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Judges Jasen, Jones, Wachtler, Meyer and Kaye concur with Judge Simons; Chief Judge Cooke concurs in result in the following memorandum: \u201cI concur. Insofar as the majority opinion infers that the first three lines of the indorsement might not be treated in some instances as a restrictive indorsement, I cannot agree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b281-12\">. Uniform Commercial Code (8 3-206, subd [3]) provides: \u201cExcept for an intermediary bank, any transferee under an indorsement which is conditional or includes the words \u2018for collection\u2019, \u2018for deposit\u2019, \u2018pay any bank\u2019, or like terms (subparagraphs (a) and (c) of Section 3-205) must pay or apply any value given by him for or on the security of the instrument consistently with the indorsement\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b283-6\">. The code defines a \u201cperson\u201d as an \u201cindividual or an organization\u201d. An organization \u201cincludes a corporation, government or governmental subdivision or agency, business trust, estate, trust, partnership or association, two or more persons having a joint or common interest, or any other legal or commercial entity\u201d (see Uniform Commercial Code, \u00a7 1-201, subds [28], [30]). The definition is inclusive, not exclusive, and as the Official Comment states, \u201corganization\u201d includes every kind of entity other than an individual. The definition is broader than others found in the statutes (see General Construction Law, \u00a7 37).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
