Section 258-b (subd 5, par [b]) entrusts the Commissioner with discretion whether or not to allege as an issue at the claim hearing, the reasonableness of claimant\u2019s business judgment. The statute does not require an affirmative finding of <em>good </em>judgment as a precondition for the payment of every claim. <em>(Matter of Dairylea Coop. v Walkley, </em>38 NY2d 6.) II. The Commissioner gave explicit consideration to the extension of credit issue. His decision that there was no legitimate issue with respect to individual farmers was a sound exercise of discretion. <em>(Matter of Dairylea Coop. v Walkley, </em>38 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>NY2d 6.) III. The arguments of the majority of the court below are without merit. <em>(Matter of Eastern Milk Producers Coop. Assn. v State of New York Dept. of Agric. &amp; Markets, </em>58 NY2d 1097.) IV. Petitioners\u2019 claim that Glen &amp; Mohawk was not a licensed milk dealer is a verbal quibble. <em>(Matter of Glen &amp; Mohawk Milk Assn. v Barber, </em>77 AD2d 127, 52 NY2d 704, 828.) V.

These checks had been issued for May milk with no checks having been issued by the corporation for milk delivered to it during the month of June. The unpaid farmers and dairy farmer cooperatives filed claims against the Milk Producers Security Fund pursuant to section 258-b of the Agriculture and Markets Law. After conducting a hearing, the Commissioner issued a determination ordering immediate payment from the fund of one half of the amount of each of the certified claims. Petitioners then commenced this CPLR article 78 proceeding seeking to annul the Commissioner\u2019s determination. Special Term denied the relief sought and dismissed the petition. A divided court in the Appellate Division reversed and remitted the matter to the Commissioner. We granted leave to appeal pursuant to CPLR 5602 (subd [a], par 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Petitioners consist of (1) licensed milk dealers who are contributors to the security fund and (2) dairy farmer/producers who did not deal with Glen &amp; Mohawk, but who rely on the fund as security in their sales to other dealers. For the reasons stated by the majority at the Appellate Division the petitioners have standing to bring this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Turning to the merits of petitioners\u2019 claims, the Commissioner\u2019s determination is challenged on two bases. First, it is contended that payments to claimants of Glen &amp; Mohawk are prohibited by statute (Agriculture and Markets Law, \u00a7 258-b, subd 5, par [d]) because the dealer is not licensed. The Commissioner found that Glen &amp; Mohawk was properly licensed within the meaning of subdivision 2 of section 401 of the State Administrative Procedure Act. The application of section 401 and the determination that the dealer\u2019s license had not expired were correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Petitioners\u2019 second contention is that the Commissioner was precluded from allowing claims arising out of the extension of credit by the claimants until a hearing is held to determine whether such extensions of credit consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>tuted a reasonable exercise of business judgment. Paragraph (b) of subdivision 5 of the statute provides that: \u201cNo claims against the producers security fund shall be allowed for * * * sales of milk by a producer to a milk dealer subsequent to its failure to pay within the time periods prescribed * * * where the commissioner finds, after due notice and opportunity of hearing, that such extension of credit, whether direct or indirect, to such milk dealer by the producer did not constitute a reasonable exercise of business judgment\u201d. Plainly, the statute commits the decision whether to take issue with the reasonableness of claimants\u2019 extension of credit solely to the discretion of the Commissioner. If he concludes that there is reason to believe that the milk dealer failed to exercise reasonable business judgment in extending credit a hearing should be ordered. Inasmuch as the Commissioner\u2019s investigation did not lead him to question the claimants\u2019 business judgment, he was not required by the statute to hold a hearing on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be modified by dismissing the petition and reinstating the Commissioner\u2019s determination, and, as so modified, the order should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b125-5\">Jasen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AiY\">(concurring in result). Inasmuch as I do not believe the petitioners have standing to bring this proceeding, I would dismiss the petition for the reasons stated in the dissenting opinion of Justice T. Paul Kane at the Appellate Division. The clear legislative intent negates review of the Commissioner\u2019s determination by persons other than claimants and defaulting milk dealers. (Agriculture and Markets Law, \u00a7 258-b, subd 5, pars [c], [d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Chief Judge Cooke and Judges Jones, Wachtler, Meyer, Simons and Kaye concur in <em>Per Curiam </em>opinion; Judge Jasen concurs in result in a memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Order modified, with costs to the Commissioner against the petitioners only, in accordance with the opinion herein and, as so modified, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
