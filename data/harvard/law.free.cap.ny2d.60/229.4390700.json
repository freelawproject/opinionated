M. J. </em>(455 US 191), we conclude that there is no constitutional infirmity in the application of section 479 of the Judiciary Law and provisions of the Code of Professional Responsibility to respondents\u2019 conduct in approving the mailing by the legal clinic in which respondents are partners to some 1,000 realtors in the Albany area of a letter quoting fees for listed real estate transactions. The order of the Appellate Division finding, respondents guilty of misconduct in so doing but imposing no sanction is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">The committee\u2019s petition to the Appellate Division alleged that respondents were admitted to practice in New York, were partners in the legal clinic of Cawley and Schmidt, and were guilty of professional misconduct in that they approved for mailing on the letterhead of the clinic a letter, the body of which is set forth in appendix A of this opinion and the intent of which was to solicit engagement to render legal services in connection with real estate closings, which letter was mailed in August and September of 1979 to approximately 1,000 realtors in the Albany geographical area.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-11\">Respondents\u2019 motion to dismiss the petition was denied ' on the basis of our holding in <em>Matter of Greene </em>(54 NY2d 118) that to the extent that section 479 of the Judiciary Law and DR 2-103 (A) of the Code of Professional Responsibility proscribe advertising of attorneys\u2019 services by di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>rect mail addressed to real estate brokers, those provisions are a constitutionally valid regulation of commercial speech. After the Supreme Court\u2019s denial of certiorari in <em>Greene </em>(455 US 1035), respondents served their answer denying misconduct or that the intent of the letter was to solicit real estate closings, but otherwise admitting the allegations of the petition. The answer pleaded as complete defenses that respondents\u2019 conduct was constitutionally protected free speech, that section 479 of the Judiciary Law on its face forbids all lawyer advertising and thus proscribes constitutionally protected speech, that section 479 on its face violates due process because not all lawyer advertising can be proscribed and the section fails to give sufficient notice of what lawyer advertising is in fact proscribed, and that section 479 as applied to respondents violates due process in that the section was not interpreted to apply to respondents\u2019 conduct until after their letter was sent. It pleaded, further, in mitigation, their assumption based on advice of counsel that their mailing was a permissible form of lawyer advertising.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Respondents then moved to refer the issues raised by the pleadings for a hearing. The Appellate Division denied that motion<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and found respondents guilty of misconduct but, noting that the letters were sent prior to the Appellate Division decision in <em>Greene </em>and in apparent good faith reliance on <em>Bates v State Bar of Ariz. </em>(433 US 350), determined that no sanction should be imposed (88 AD2d 1089). Respondents\u2019 appeal to our court was dismissed (58 NY2d 689) for want of a substantial constitutional question, but, as already noted, the Supreme Court thereafter granted respondents\u2019 petition for certiorari, vacated our order and remanded for further consideration (460 US_, 103 S Ct 1763).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">Respondents now characterize our construction of the governing statute and disciplinary rule in <em>Matter of Greene </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>as a ban on all third-party mailings by attorneys and argue that what is regulated is the content rather than the manner of speech, which under i?. <em>M. J. </em>is permissible only \u201cwhere the particular advertising is inherently likely to deceive or where the record indicates that a particular form or method of advertising has in fact been deceptive\u201d (455 US, at p 202). They suggest, further, that because <em>Greene </em>was decided after their letter was mailed, their due process right to specificity in the statute controlling their advertising activity has been violated. In our view the first argument misconstrues both our <em>Greene </em>decision and the scope of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Matter of R. M. J., </em>and the second overlooks Supreme Court First Amendment cases decided prior to respondents\u2019 mailing as well as governing due process law.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Phrased as it is in terms of deception, the first argument all but ignores the crux of the holding in <em>Greene </em>which was that there is \u201ca substantial governmental interest in preventing conflicts of interest in attorney-client relationships which the statute directly protects and for which there is no adequately protective less restrictive alternative.\u201d (54 NY2d, at p 127.) That holding was supported by citations to <em>Matter of Primus </em>(436 US 412),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Ohralick v Ohio State Bar Assn. </em>(436 US 447), <em>N. A. A. C. P. v Button </em>(371 US 415) and <em>Mine Workers v Illinois Bar Assn. </em>(389 US 217), all of which establish the substantiality and propriety of the interest. It was, moreover, pointed out that although the potential for conflict had played a part in sustaining a limitation on speech only in <em>Ohralick, </em>the other cases had turned on the broader protection afforded associational activity or, as in <em>Primus, </em>\u201cpolitical expression and association,\u201d in the context of which \u201ca State must regulate with significantly greater precision\u201d (436 US, at p 438). Here, of course, neither political expression nor associational activity is involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">That the <em>R. M. J. </em>opinion speaks in terms of deception and makes no mention of conflict of interest is not surpris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>ing, conflict of interest being totally unrelated to the advertising under consideration in that case. To read <em>R.M.J. </em>as restricting to deception the activity that may be controlled is, however, to attribute to the court the unlikely intent to overrule <em>Primus, N. A. A. C. P. </em>and <em>Mine Workers sub silentio </em>and to ignore entirely the citation in the <em>R. M. J. </em>opinion of <em>Ohralick </em>(455 US, at p 202).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Nor can it properly be said that the regulation is of all third-party mailings. The <em>Greene </em>opinion expressly limited its \u201cruling to third-party mailings to brokers\u201d (54 NY2d, at p 126). Although it also noted that the regulation was of \u201call third-party mailings, not just mailings to brokers\u201d <em>(id.), </em>that statement must be read in its context, which limits it to third-party mailings involving a conflict of interest. Thus, the regulation was held to be of manner rather than content because of the <em>\u201cdetriment to society in the potential conflict of interest that may be generated when those in need of legal services are approached indirectly </em>through a broker\u201d <em>(id.; </em>emphasis supplied), and the associational activity cases were distinguished on the basis of \u201cthe absence of monetary stakes for the union or other community group\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p 128), without which there would be no significant danger of conflict or overreaching <em>(Woll v Attorney Gen., </em>409 Mich 500, 550, on remand 116 Mich App 791; see <em>Matter of Primus, </em>436 US, <em>supra, </em>at pp 429-431).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Unlike the statute involved in <em>Bolger v Youngs Drug Prods. Corp. </em>(463 US_, 103 S Ct 2875), which prohibited the mailing of unsolicited advertisements for contraceptives, the regulatory provisions here in issue, as limited by our holdings in <em>Matter of Koffler </em>(51 NY2d 140) and <em>Matter of Greene (supra), </em>impose no general ban upon all mailings by attorneys to others than potential clients. What is proscribed is mailing to that limited number of third persons who themselves may have dealings with potential clients of the attorney from which a conflict of interest may result. Wholly unrelated to the content of the letter, the proscription is not against the attorney making known to potential clients the availability of his services or even against his doing so through third parties, but against his doing so in a particular manner: through a third party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>whose interests may be more closely intertwined with those of the attorney than with those of the client. But the proscription would not foreclose a solicitation such as those involved in the <em>N. A. A. C. P., Mine Workers </em>and <em>Primus </em>cases, all <em>supra </em>(see, also, Ann., 5 ALR4th 866, 877), because such a solicitation presents no potential for conflict of interest.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For like reason the fact that a title company remains free to solicit referral business from real estate brokers is simply irrelevant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Nor do we read <em>R.M.J. </em>as invalidating the proscription as thus defined, as the dissents suggest, because it concerns a potential rather than an actual conflict or specific detriment to a particular client. The Supreme Court held in <em>Ohralick (supra), </em>that where a lawyer\u2019s exercise of judgment on behalf of his client may be clouded by his own pecuniary self-interest and the transaction is not visible or open to public scrutiny, or otherwise subject to effective oversight, the State may constitutionally impose a prophylactic measure whose objective is the prevention of harm before it occurs (436 US, at pp 461, 464-467; see, also, <em>Matter of Primus, </em>436 US, at p 434). Far from repudiating that concept, the court in <em>Matter of R. M. J. </em>noted that in <em>Ohralick </em>\u201cthe Court held that the <em>possibility </em>of \u2018fraud, undue influence, intimidation, overreaching, and other forms of \u201cvexatious conduct\u201d \u2019 <em>was so likely </em>in the context of in-person solicitation, <em>that such solicitation could be prohibited\u201d </em>(455 US, at p 202 [emphasis supplied]). We have spelled out in <em>Matter of Greene </em>(54 NY2d, at p 129), and need not now repeat, how the prohibition of third-party mailings by attorneys to recipients whose client-referrals may involve the recipient and the attorney in a conflict detrimental to the interests of the client relates to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>governmental interest, and why it is not more extensive than necessary to serve that interest. We add only, in light of respondents\u2019 suggestion that even a client-referral based on social contact may involve a conflict of interest, that it is not unreasonable for the State to conclude that broker-referrals will more often than not result in conflict but that social-referrals are not inherently conducive of conflict <em>(Ohralick v Ohio State Bar Assn., </em>436 US, at p 466; <em>Schaumburg v Citizens For Better Environment, </em>444 US 620, 637-638, n 11).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Although respondents have a right to fair notice of the acts for which they can be punished, they had notice from section 479 of the Judiciary Law and DR 2-103 (A) of the Code of Professional Responsibility that all solicitation of legal business was proscribed and, as we noted in <em>Matter of Greene </em>(54 NY2d, at p 124), those provisions remain in effect except as they infringe upon constitutionally protected free speech. True, respondents did not have the benefit of either <em>Matter of Koffler </em>(51 NY2d 140, supra) or <em>Matter of Greene </em>(54 NY2d 118, <em>supra) </em>before their letter was sent, but they were then chargeable with-knowledge from <em>Ohralick </em>and <em>Primus, </em>both decided by the Supreme Court on May 30, 1978, and its earlier decisions in <em>N.A.A.C.P. </em>and <em>Mine Workers, </em>that the constitutional invalidity of section 479 did not necessarily extend to solicitation involving personal contact and the potential for conflict of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">In the light of that knowledge and the long-standing absolute legislative proscription, respondents\u2019 fair notice rights were not violated <em>(People v Epton, </em>19 NY2d 496, 506, remittitur amd 19 NY2d 1017, app dsmd and cert den 390 US 29, reh den 390 US 976, second reh den 398 US 944; <em>Dombrowski v Pfister, </em>380 US 479, 491, n 7; see <em>Rose v Locke, </em>423 US 48; <em>Wall v Attorney Gen., </em>409 Mich, at p 544). Application of <em>Greene's </em>construction to conduct occurring prior to that construction involves no violation of respondents\u2019 due process right when, as is here the case, it is clear that respondents\u2019 conduct has been judged not by the legislative standard alone but by that standard as constitutionally limited (see <em>Shuttlesworth v City of Birmingham, </em>382 US 87, 92).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b288-9\">. Other than denial of the legal conclusion that they were guilty of misconduct, respondents denied only the allegation of specification 2 that \u201cThe intent of said letter was to solicit real estate closings through the realtors of prospective purchasers and sellers of real property\u201d. The intent of the letter is, however, a matter of interpretation of its words in light of the circumstances of its transmission. For the reasons stated in <em>Matter of Greene </em>(54 NY2d 118, 126), we agree that the necessary implication of transmittal of the letter to real estate brokers was to have clients of the brokers referred to respondents for legal work. We agree with the Appellate Division, therefore, that no hearing was required.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b289-8\">.

See <em>Schaumburg v Citizens For Better Environment </em>(444 US 620, 637-638, n 11) pointing out that charitable solicitation because not so inherently conducive to fraud and overreaching as is attorney solicitation could not be prohibited. For like reason the fact, noted in footnote 2 of Chief Judge Cooke\u2019s dissent, that there is no proscription against an attorney representing a client referred by a broker, does not invalidate the regulation under consideration. The potential for conflict is substantially greater when it is the lawyer who seeks client referrals from the broker than when the broker, unsolicited, refers a client to an attorney.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b291-7\">. To the extent that the argument raises equal protection clause objections, as respondents\u2019 citation of <em>Carey v Brown </em>(447 US 455) and <em>Police Dept. of Chicago v Mosley </em>(408 US 92) suggests, the issue is not properly before us, respondents\u2019 answer having raised only free speech and due process defenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b293-5\">Chief Judge Cooke</author>\n<p id=\"A8Q\">(dissenting). I respectfully dissent. A per se prohibition of direct-mail lawyer advertising to real estate brokers cannot be sustained under the First Amendment free speech clause, particularly in view of the Supreme Court\u2019s instruction in this case to reconsider the rule embraced in <em>Matter of Greene </em>(54 NY2d 118) in light of its decision in <em>Matter of R. M. J. </em>(455 US 191).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">The majority reasons that direct-mail advertisement of legal services to real estate brokers, regardless of how it is framed, <em>necessarily </em>involves a request by the attorney to the broker to solicit the latter\u2019s prospect to employ the advertising attorney\u2019s services (see <em>Matter of Greene, supra, </em>at p 126). This, in turn, gives rise to an attorney\u2019s potential conflict of interest between the client and the referring broker. This conflict is said to manifest itself and cause injury to the client through \u201c[t]he possibility that the lawyer\u2019s view of marketability of title may be colored by his knowledge that the referring broker normally will receive no commission unless title closes, the improbability that the attorney will negotiate to the lowest possible level the commission to be paid to the broker who is an important source of business for him (or suggest to the client that he do so), [and] the probability that the lawyer will not examine with the same independence that he otherwise would the puffery that the broker has indulged in to bring about the sale\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p 129). In the majority\u2019s view, the appropriate means to obviate these potential harms is an absolute ban on direct-mail lawyer advertising to real estate brokers.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">This restriction on the attorney\u2019s constitutional right to advertise (see <em>Matter of R. M. J., </em>455 US 191, <em>supra; Bates v State Bar of Ariz., </em>433 US 350; <em>Matter of Kojffler, </em>51 NY2d 140) is characterized as a reasonable time, place, and manner restriction, rather than a content-based restriction (at pp 234-235; <em>Matter of Greene, </em>54 NY2d, at pp 126-127) because \u201c[w]holly unrelated to the content of the letter, the proscription is not against the attorney making known to potential clients the availability of his services or even against his doing so through third parties, but against his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>doing so in a particular manner: through a third party whose interests may be more closely intertwined with those of the attorney than with those of the client.\u201d (At pp 234-235.) As a mere restriction on the manner of speech, the majority argues that the regulation may be sustained under the First Amendment because an attorney has effective alternative means of advertising and the regulation is rationally related to the advancement of the State\u2019s interest in protecting clients against retaining attorneys with a conflict of interest (at pp 235-236; <em>Matter of Greene, supra, </em>at pp 126-127).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The majority\u2019s analysis errs in fundamental respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">It is true that the State may place restrictions on the time, place, and manner of protected speech so long as such a restriction is reasonable (see <em>Consolidated Edison v Public Serv. Comm., </em>447 US 530, 536). To be considered a time, place, or manner restriction, however, a restriction \u201cmust be \u2018applicable to all speech irrespective of content\u2019 \u201d <em>(id., </em>quotin<em>g Erznoznik v City of Jacksonville, </em>422 US 205, 209). Thus, the government may regulate how, when, or where a message is delivered, but only without reference to the message\u2019s substance (see <em>Grayned v City of Rockford, </em>408 US 104, 115; <em>Cox v Louisiana, </em>379 US 536, 554). For example, the State may restrict large street demonstrations to times other than rush hour as a reasonable time and place regulation stemming from its interest in public safety and order (see <em>Cox v Louisiana, supra). </em>Similarly, the State, as a reasonable restriction on the manner of speech, may require that the use of \u201coveramplified loudspeakers\u201d be modulated to protect its interest in public peace (see <em>Grayned v City of Rockford, </em>408 US 104, 116, <em>supra; Kovacs v Cooper, </em>336 US 77, 87). Such regulations, to be enforceable, must be, as mentioned, neutral in terms of the content of speech, and \u201cmust be narrowly tailored to further the State\u2019s legitimate interest\u201d <em>(Grayned v City of Rockford, supra, </em>at pp 116-117).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">Time, place, or manner regulations are evaluated under a less rigorous standard than content-based restrictions (see <em>Linmark Assoc. v Willingboro, </em>431 US 85, 93). If the former is reasonable, and rationally related to a legitimate State interest, it will be upheld so long as there exist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>effective alternate means of communication (see <em>Virginia Pharmacy Bd. v Virginia Consumer Council, </em>425 US 748, 771). For a content-based restriction to be sustained, at least with respect to protected, .nonmisleading commercial speech,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the State must assert a substantial State interest and the restriction may extend only in proportion to the degree the interest is served (see <em>Matter of R. M. J., supra; Central Hudson Gas &amp; Elec. v Public Serv. Comm., </em>447 US 557, 566). Moreover, the State must show that there are no less-restrictive means of regulation <em>(Central Hudson Gas &amp; Elec. v Public Serv. Comm., supra, </em>at p 566).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">When the State seeks to restrict the time, place, or manner of speech with reference to a particular type of message such a regulation has been held to be an attempt to control content (see <em>Consolidated Edison v Public Serv. Comm., </em>447 US, <em>supra, </em>at p 537; <em>Erznoznik v City of Jacksonville, </em>422 US, <em>supra, </em>at p 209; <em>Police Dept. of Chicago v Mosley, </em>408 US 92, 95). For example, regulations have been struck down as content-based restrictions when they prohibited placing \u201cFor Sale\u201d signs on residential property but not signs with other messages (see <em>Linmark Assoc. v Willingboro, </em>431 US 85, 93-94, <em>supra), </em>prohibited exhibiting movies that are visible from a public street only when the movie contains nudity <em>(Erznoznik v City of Jacksonville, supra), </em>and prohibited inserting messages in utility bills only when the insert addresses a controversial public issue <em>(Consolidated Edison v Public Serv. Comm., supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">In analyzing the present case, certain basic factors are noted. The subject regulation is plainly content-based. Although, indeed, it regulates a manner of speech, the regulation is not, as the majority contends, \u201c[wjholly unrelated\u201d to the speech\u2019s content. The restriction is invoked solely by reason of the message\u2019s nature \u2014 attorney advertising. \u201cThat the proscription applies only to one mode of communication * * * does not transform this into a \u2018time, place, or manner\u2019 case\u201d <em>(Linmark Assoc. v Willingboro, supra, </em>at p 94).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>Moreover, there is no claim here that the advertisement was false or misleading. The message itself was not unlawful. The court is concerned here only with whether a lawyer\u2019s protected right to advertise may be restricted by an absolute ban on direct-mail advertising to real estate brokers.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">For the regulation to be consistent with First Amendment protections, \u201cthe State must assert a substantial interest and the interference with speech must be in proportion to the interest served. Restrictions must be narrowly drawn, and the State lawfully may regulate only to the extent regulation furthers the State\u2019s substantial interest\u201d (Matter <em>of R. M. J., </em>455 US 191, 203, <em>supra </em>[citation and n omitted]). It may be assumed that the State\u2019s interest in protecting individuals from retaining attorneys with conflicts of interest is substantial. The issue, therefore, narrows to whether the regulation may be said to reasonably advance this interest and, if so, whether the degree to which the interest is advanced justifies the interference with petitioner\u2019s First Amendment right to advertise.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The State has not established that the problem asserted actually exists or that it has attempted to control the problem through less restrictive means that have failed (cf. <em>Matter of R. M. J., supra, </em>at p 206). This concept that the regulation of lawyer advertising must be related to a State interest and should proceed on a least restrictive path is the import of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Matter of R. M. J. (supra). </em>It is true, as the majority points out, that much of that case involved questions of whether the ethical rules of the Supreme Court of Missouri that regulate lawyer advertising were a proper means of protecting against potentially deceptive advertising. But many of the rules prohibited absolutely the inclusion of certain information in advertising (see <em>Matter of R. M. J., supra, </em>at pp 193-195). And, in each instance, the rigid formulation of the State rules were found not sufficiently related to the interests of the State to be upheld <em>(id., </em>at pp 205-206). Of particular relevance to this appeal was the court\u2019s review of a rule that permitted the mailing of professional announcement cards only to \u201clawyers, clients, former clients, personal friends, and relatives\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p 196). The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>would not sustain the rule because no interest or established problem was proffered to justify the limitation, and even assuming any interest existed, there was no indication that that problem could not be attended in a less restrictive means.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The blunt conclusion that all direct-mail lawyer advertisements to brokers necessarily pose a grave potential threat that, in the event that a referral results from the advertisement, the lawyer will not act in the best interests of the client is unsubstantiated. Similarly, the assertion that the complete prohibition of direct-mailings to brokers will mitigate conflicts of interest not otherwise deterred is unre\u00e1listic. These points are self-evident and have been made before (see <em>Matter of Greene, </em>54 NY2d 118, 133-135, <em>supra </em>[Fuchsberg, J., dissenting]). It need only be reiterated here that the rule announced in <em>Matter of Greene (supra) </em>and reaffirmed in this appeal does not advance any substantial State interest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">In any event, the rule as drawn interferes with free speech disproportionately to the interest it purportedly furthers. In the present case, the ban on direct-mail advertisements to brokers is complete. It is imposed irrespective of whether the intent of the advertisement, as indicated by its text, is to seek the referral of clients or is merely to give notice of the availability of the lawyer\u2019s services (at p 232, n 1; <em>Matter of Greene, </em>54 NY2d 118, 126, <em>supra). </em>In the majority\u2019s view, the lawyer\u2019s request for referral is a \u201cnecessary implication\u201d of any advertisement sent to a broker, whether it be a mere notice of the opening of a law office (see <em>Matter of R. M. J., </em>455 US, at p 206) or a neutral statement of the services provided by a law office or lawyer. To the extent that the rule does not differentiate between (1) advertisements that relate solely to disseminating neutral information and (2) advertisements that intimate that the broker should intercede as an intermediary and actively solicit on behalf of the lawyer, it constitutes an unjustified imposition on a lawyer\u2019s right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>advertise (see <em>Matter of R. M. J., supra; Matter of Primus, </em>436 US 412, <em>supra; Bates v State Bar of Ariz., </em>433 US 350, <em>supra). </em>Moreover, any asserted interest in mitigating potential conflicts of interest in the attorney-client relationship would be as adequately served by the less restrictive means of, for example, reviewing mailings to brokers to ensure they do not include such intimations (see <em>Matter of R. M. J., supra; Central Hudson Gas &amp; Elec. v Public Serv. Comm., </em>447 US 557, 566, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed and the petition dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b295-7\">. Content-based restrictions on noncommercial speech will be sustained \u201conly in the most extraordinary circumstances\u201d <em>(Bolger v Youngs Drug Prods. Corp., </em>463 US.\u2014 , \u2014 , 103 S Ct 2875, 2879 [n omitted]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b297-7\">. It is noteworthy that, as a general matter, attorneys need not decline to represent a client who has been referred by a broker (see, generally, DR 2-105, DR 2-109, DR 5-101) nor are they proscribed from placing nonmisleading advertisements in publications whose primary readership may be real estate brokers (see, generally, DR 2-100 \u2014 2-101).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b298-6\">Kaye, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQd\">(dissenting). Advertising by attorneys may be regulated only where the advertising in question is inherently deceptive, or where there is a finding that a particular method of advertising has in fact been deceptive or subject to abuse. <em>(Matter of R. M. J., </em>455 US 191, 202-203.) Here, there is no contention that respondents\u2019 advertising is inherently deceptive or misleading. The clear direction <em>o\u00edR. M. J. </em>is that, in such situations, prohibition of advertising can be sustained only when the record establishes that the method of advertising is in fact misleading or subject to abuse (455 US, at p 207).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">There is no finding that respondents\u2019 method of advertising is in fact misleading or subject to abuse. On this point, the majority states only that the predicate for the prohibition of respondents\u2019 advertising was spelled out in <em>Matter of Greene </em>(54 NY2d 118). But there is no finding in <em>Greene </em>that this method of advertising is in fact misleading or subject to abuse. The decision in <em>Greene </em>to prohibit such advertising was based on the <em>possibility </em>that the lawyer\u2019s view of marketability of title may be colored, the <em>improbability </em>that the attorney will negotiate the lowest possible broker\u2019s commission, and the <em>probability </em>that the lawyer will not examine the broker\u2019s puffery with the independence he otherwise would (54 NY2d, at p 129). It is clear from <em>R.M.J. </em>that prohibition of attorney advertising cannot be founded on such hypothesis.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">Since the ban imposed on respondents\u2019 advertising lacks any factual predicate, there is no need to reach the questions of whether it should be characterized as one of form or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>content, or whether some less restrictive alternative would address the imagined potential for conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Judges Jasen, Jones, Wachtler and Simons concur with Judge Meyer; Chief Judge Cooke and Judge Kaye dissent and vote to reverse in separate dissenting opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Following remand by the United States Supreme Court and reinstatement of the appeal herein by this court, order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-16\">APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"ANQ\">Dear Realtor:</p>\n<p id=\"ASrZ\">We recognize that the costs attendant to the sale or purchase of a home are a real concern to your clients that may indeed influence whether a transaction will even take place.
