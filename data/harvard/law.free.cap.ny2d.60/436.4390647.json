The Civil Service Law and the city charter make the city Personnel Director responsible for establishing civil service policy and administering the Civil Service Law in New York City. The City Civil Service Commission, which is a neutral, independent body performing a quasi-judicial function, was not intended to have final and unreviewable authority over determinations of the city Personnel Director. Accordingly, he, the City of New York, and his department are empowered and have standing to seek judicial review of determinations of the commission. <em>(Matter of Rahill v Bronstein, </em>32 NY2d 417; <em>Matter of B. T. Prods. v Barr, </em>44 NY2d 226; <em>People ex rel. Municipal Gas Co. v Public Serv.

II. Respondent Lombardi is not entitled to veterans\u2019 preference credit on account of his three-hour mobilization during the postal workers\u2019 strike of March, 1970. The determination of the court below to affirm the award of such credit directly conflicts with determinations by this court in <em>Matter of Rahill v Bronstein </em>(32 NY2d 417) and <em>Matter of Rubin v Conway </em>(273 App Div 559, affd 298 NY 711). <em>(Mitchell v Cohen, </em>333 US 411.)

Appellants lacked both standing and statutory authority to commence the instant proceeding. <em>(Matter of Pooler v Public Serv.

Retirement System, </em>95 Misc 2d 876.) II. The decision of respondent Civil Service Commission to grant veterans\u2019 preference to respondent Lombardi, was neither arbitrary, capricious, nor unlawful. <em>(Matter of Pell v Board of Educ., </em>34 NY2d 222; <em>Matter of Nadel v New York City Civ. Serv. Comm., </em>85 AD2d 567; <em>Hornstein v Laird, </em>327 F Supp 993; <em>Matter of Lore v Forbes, </em>173 Misc 1066, 259 App Div 806, 283 NY 778; <em>Matter of Silberglitt v McNamara, </em>300 NY 465; <em>Matter of Walling v Schechter, </em>9 Misc 2d 621, 8 AD2d 605, 7 NY2d 814.) III. The Personnel Director is barred, pursuant to subdivision 4 of section 50 of the Civil Service Law, from revoking respondent Lombardi\u2019s promotion based upon facts known to the Department of Personnel prior to respondent Lombardi\u2019s appointment as sergeant. <em>(Matter of Nadel v New York City Civ.

Based solely on that service, they claimed veterans\u2019 preference credits, which would place them ahead of other officers who achieved higher scores on police department promotional examinations. These related appeals raise two questions: first, whether appellant, the city Personnel Director,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> has standing to challenge the decisions of respondent City Civil Service Commission awarding the preference credits and second, assuming the challenge is procedurally proper, whether on the merits the commission\u2019s decisions should be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\"> Each case before us had its genesis in disallowance of the claimed veterans\u2019 preference credits by appellant on the ground that, while respondent police officers were called for active duty, they were dismissed without having been used. On administrative appeal by the officers, respondent commission reversed and granted the applications, relying on an opinion of the Supreme Court, New York County, in <em>Stendrini v D'Ambrose </em>(NYU, Dec. 5, 1977, p 11, col 2) that reservists called for active duty during the postal strike were entitled to veterans\u2019 preference credits without any minimum period of service. Appellant then brought article 78 proceedings challenging the commission\u2019s decisions. Special Term dismissed the petitions, holding that appellant lacked standing to seek judicial review and that on the strength of <em>Stendrini </em>the commission\u2019s decisions had rational bases and the Appellate Division affirmed, without opinion. We now reverse the orders below on both grounds. Appellant has standing to maintain these article 78 proceedings against respondent commission; the commission\u2019s decisions awarding veterans\u2019 preference credits to respondent police officers should have been annulled.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The conclusion that appellant lacked standing rested on the assumptions that this was merely an intra-agency dispute, that this court\u2019s decisions setting forth the basis for standing apply only to private parties seeking review of agency action taken against them, and that appellant has no standing to sue in the absence of an express legislative grant of authority. These premises are incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Appellant\u2019s challenge is not a mere intra-agency dispute. Under the legislative scheme for administering the civil service laws, it is appellant who is assigned the power and responsibility to set civil service policy in New York City, to enforce the civil service laws, and to assure the legality of appointments. Respondent commission has none of these duties, but instead functions, in prescribed circumstances, as a board to review determinations by appellant and by other agency heads.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">Subdivision 4 of section 15 of the Civil Service Law empowers New York City to administer the provisions of the Civil Service Law through whatever form of administration it chooses to prescribe in its city charter. The New York City Charter provides that the Personnel Director \u201cshall have all the powers and duties of a municipal civil service commission provided in the civil service law or in any other statute or local law\u201d (NY City Charter, \u00a7 811). Among appellant\u2019s responsibilities are to \u201cpreserve and promote merit and fitness in city employment\u201d (NY City Charter, \u00a7 810, subd a), to establish and determine the appropriateness of eligible lists for civil service appointments (NY City Charter, \u00a7 813, subd a, pars [4], [5]), and to promulgate rules and regulations in furtherance of and consistent with the Civil Service Law (NY City Charter, \u00a7 813, subd c). In addition, in the exercise of the powers of a municipal civil service commission, appellant has the powers and duties to administer the provisions of the Civil Service Law (Civil Service Law, \u00a7 17), to prescribe and enforce rules for implementing the provisions of the Civil Service Law and section 6 of article V of the Constitution (Civil Service Law, \u00a7 20, subd 1), to investigate the qualifications of applicants both before and after appointment and to revoke appointments where there is a finding of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>illegality in the appointment (Civil Service Law, \u00a7 50, subd 4), and to maintain actions in the Supreme Court to enjoin any violation of the Civil Service Law or rules and for such incidental relief as may be necessary (Civil Service Law, \u00a7 102, subd 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Respondent commission, by contrast, has not been delegated the general powers and responsibilities of a municipal civil service commission. The only powers reserved to respondent are those of an appeals board: to hear and decide appeals by persons aggrieved by appellant\u2019s determinations (NY City Charter, \u00a7 812, subd c), and to hear and decide appeals in disciplinary proceedings (Civil Service Law, \u00a7 76).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">It is thus clear that appellant, not respondent commission, has both policy-making authority and functional responsibility for civil service matters in New York City. Appellant is a municipal body separate from respondent commission. <em>(Matter of Department of Personnel v City Civ. Serv. Comm., </em>94 AD2d 5, 8.) This is not a situation where appellant would lack standing to sue because the Legislature intended that one agency, as a mere agent of another, would be bound by the latter\u2019s determinations. (See <em>Matter of Beaudoin v Toia, </em>45 NY2d 343; <em>Matter of Clemente v Fahey, </em>45 NY2d 756.) The fact that respondent may serve as an appeals board for appellant\u2019s determinations does not preclude appellant from seeking review of those decisions by which appellant is aggrieved. <em>(Matter of Flacke v Freshwater Wetlands Appeals Bd., 53 </em>NY2d 537, 540.)</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">In <em>Matter of Dairylea Coop. v Walkley </em>(38 NY2d 6, 8-11) and <em>Matter of Bradford Cent. School Dist. v Ambach </em>(56 NY2d 158, 163-164), we set forth three criteria for standing. Special Term refused to apply the factors identified in <em>Dairylea </em>because it believed they were limited to \u201cprivate parties seeking review of agency action taken against them.\u201d Our subsequent decision in <em>Bradford </em>shows this belief was mistaken. Whether the challenge is raised by a private entity or, as here, by a governmental officer or agency with policy-making authority and functional responsibility in the subject area sought to be reviewed, the factors to be applied in determining standing to seek review of an administrative decision are the same: (1) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>interest asserted must be arguably within the zone of interest to be protected by the statutory or constitutional provisions sought to be enforced; (2) the administrative decision for which review is sought must be shown to have a harmful effect upon the party asserting standing; and (3) there must be no clear legislative intent negating review. Appellant meets these criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">First, the very sections of the Civil Service Law and the New York City Charter which give appellant the power and responsibility to ensure that city personnel such as respondent police officers are appointed and promoted in accordance with a system of merit and fitness establish that appellant\u2019s interest is within the zone of interest sought to be protected by the Civil Service Law. In <em>Bradford, </em>we held that a school board\u2019s interest and responsibility for determining whether a teacher is properly certified was sufficient to fulfill the \u201czone of interest\u201d test for standing to challenge the decision of the Commissioner of Education that overruled the school board\u2019s determination and awarded certification to a teacher. <em>(Matter of Bradford Cent. School Dist. v Ambach, </em>56 NY2d 158, 163-164, <em>supra.) </em>Appellant\u2019s interest is no less deserving of protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Second, respondent commission\u2019s decisions have a harmful effect upon appellant. Those decisions requiring promotional preferences irrespective of length or type of service interfere with the authority and discretion given to appellant to enforce the Civil Service Law and, if allowed to remain in force, would result in a significant policy determination by one entity that is within the authority of another. This is sufficient injury to justify standing. <em>(Matter of Bradford Cent. School Dist. v Ambach, </em>56 NY2d 158, 164, <em>supra; Matter of Department of Personnel v City Civ. Serv. Comm., </em>94 AD2d 5, 8, <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Third, there is no clear legislative intent negating review.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On the contrary, authority for appellant to seek judicial review of the commission\u2019s decisions regarding preference credits may be implied from its statutory powers and responsibilities in this area. (See <em>Matter of Flacke v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number><em>Freshwater Wetlands Appeals Bd., </em>53 NY2d 537, 542, <em>supra.) </em>Appellant has both authority and responsibility to establish and determine the appropriateness of eligible lists for civil service appointments, including promotion, to revoke appointments where such were the result of illegality or irregularity, and to maintain actions for injunctive and other incidental relief against violations of the Civil Service Law. If, as appellant suggests, respondent commission\u2019s decisions and awards were made in derogation of the requirements of the Civil Service Law, the promotions of respondent police officers are exactly the sort of illegal or irregular appointments appellant has the power and duty to revoke. Appellant\u2019s authority to commence an article 78 proceeding is a necessary implication from its power and responsibility to police the legality and regularity of civil service appointments. \u201cIt is the duty of the appropriate administrative officers of the State or its civil divisions to discontinue an illegal employment when they note its illegality, and if rights based upon such employment are asserted in the courts, the legality of the appointment should not go unchallenged by public officers\u201d. <em>(Palmer v Board of Educ., </em>276 NY 222, 226.)</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\"><em>Matter of Pooler v Public Serv. Comm,. </em>(58 AD2d 940, affd 43 NY2d 750) requires no different result. In <em>Pooler </em>the question presented was whether the State Consumer Protection Board had standing to bring an article 78 proceeding to review an order of the Public Service Commission in a rate case. Unlike appellant, the Consumer Protection Board is not a separate governmental body charged with the enforcement and administration of a body of laws and regulations, but rather a group charged with co-ordinating activities of State agencies performing consumer protection functions and reporting to the Governor and Legislature, with statutory power to \u201cinitiate, intervene in, or participate in any proceedings before the public service commission\u201d. (Executive Law, \u00a7 553, subd 2, par c.) In denying the right to seek judicial review of a Public Service Commission order, the Appellate Division in <em>Pooler </em>concluded that the Consumer Protection Board did not have \u201cthe status of a separate legal being with the right to initiate litigation in pursuit of its purposes,\u201d and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>authority to seek such review was not a \u201cnecessary implication from those powers which the Legislature saw fit to set forth\u201d (58 AD2d 940, <em>supra), </em>and we affirmed on the Appellate Division memorandum (43 NY2d 750, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">But <em>Pooler </em>does not require that in every instance there be express legislative authority to sue before a public body may seek judicial review of administrative actions. Given the limited statutory authority of the Consumer Protection Board, the board in <em>Pooler </em>did not have functional responsibility within the zone of interest to be protected and, with respect to actions of the Public Service Commission in particular, the Legislature expressly restricted the board\u2019s role to agency proceedings. Here there is no corresponding lack of identifiable interest, and no legislative intent to limit appellant\u2019s role to the administrative arena.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Having determined that appellant has standing to bring these article 78 proceedings, we turn to the merits of the dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">Respondent police officers sought veterans\u2019 credits pursuant to the New York State Constitution and the Civil Service Law. Section 6 of article V of the Constitution provides: \u201cAppointments and promotions in the civil service * * * shall be made according to merit and fitness to be ascertained, as far as practicable, by examination which, as far as practicable, shall be competitive; provided, however, that any member of the armed forces of the United States who served therein in time of war, who is a citizen and resident of this state and was a resident at the time of his entrance into the armed forces of the United States and was honorably discharged or released under honorable circumstances from such service, shall be entitled to receive * * * two and one-half points additional credit in an examination for promotion\u201d. This constitutional provision is given effect by section 85 of the Civil Service Law. The term \u201cveteran\u201d is defined as \u201ca member of the armed forces of the United States who served therein in time of war\u201d. (Civil Service Law, \u00a7 85, subd 1, par [a].) The terms \u201ctime of war\u201d and \u201carmed forces of the United States\u201d are in turn defined as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>\u201cThe term \u2018time of war\u2019 shall include the following wars for the periods herein set forth:</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">\u201cHostilities participated in by the military forces of the United States, from the first day of January, nineteen hundred sixty-three to the twenty-ninth day of March, nineteen hundred seventy-three.\u201d (Civil Service Law, \u00a7 85, subd 1, par [c], cl [4].)</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">\u201c \u2018Armed forces of the United States\u2019 means the army, navy, marine corps, air force and coast guard, including all components thereof, and the national guard when in the service of the United States pursuant to call as provided by law. Pursuant to this definition no person shall be considered a member or veteran of the armed forces of the United States unless his or her service therein is or was on a full-time active duty basis, other than active duty for training.\u201d (General Construction Law, \u00a7 13-a.)</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">In <em>Stendrini v D Ambrose </em>(NYLJ, Dec. 5, 1977, p 11, col 2, supra) the court held that New York City police officers in the Armed Forces reserves who spent four days on active duty during the 1970 postal strike were entitled to veterans\u2019 credits because of that service. The rationale for that decision was a literal reading of the statutes to mean that the officers\u2019 service was \u201cin time of war\u201d because it occurred within the dates of the Vietnam hostilities set forth in the Civil Service Law, and that the service was \u201cin the armed forces\u201d because the General Construction Law imposes no minimum period of service as a requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">The question of entitlement to veterans\u2019 credits of employees who, as here, rendered brief service during dates which coincidentally fell within a \u201ctime of war\u201d was addressed in both <em>Matter of Rubin v Conway </em>(273 App Div 559, affd 298 NY 711), where a policeman on part-time duty as a reservist for up to four days per month between October, 1942 and September, 1945 was denied veterans\u2019 credits, and <em>Matter of Rahill v Bronstein </em>(32 NY2d 417), where veterans\u2019 credits were denied to policemen who, as reservists, saw active duty in the Armed Forces for training purposes during a \u201ctime of war\u201d specified in section 85 of the Civil Service Law. In those decisions it was held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>the term \u201cmember of the armed forces\u201d must be given a restrictive interpretation limited to those whose war-time service was significant, full-time duty. That rationale is dispositive of the present appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Appointments and promotions by merit and fitness based on competitive examination are at the heart of the civil service system. Preferences such as veterans\u2019 credits are antithetical to that competitive merit system. The constitutionality of such preferences has been insured only by a consistently restrictive construction, complying as fully as possible with the injunction of the Constitution that appointments and promotions be based on merit and fitness. <em>(Matter of Rahill v Bronstein, </em>32 NY2d 417, 423, <em>supra; Matter of Barthelmess v Cukor, </em>231 NY 435.) In the case of veterans, preferences are viewed as society\u2019s expression of gratitude for their sacrifice and for the disruption of their lives that accompanies full-time military service. <em>(Matter of Rubin v Conway, </em>273 App Div 559, 561, affd 298 NY 711, <em>supra.) </em>The intent of the Legislature in providing for veterans\u2019 credits to \u201cmembers of the armed forces\u201d was to extend those preferences to persons who had been divorced from their civilian employment by reason of their full-time service, where re-employment and rehabilitation were considered necessary. <em>(.Matter of Rahill v Bronstein, </em>32 NY2d 417, 424, <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">There was no intent to grant promotional preference to persons whose military service was performed without any interference with their normal employment or mode of life. To extend veterans\u2019 credits to such persons would dilute the reward conferred on ex-servicemen who made full-scale sacrifices, at the direct expense of others who have demonstrated higher ability on competitive examinations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Such an inequitable result would create \u201ca class * * * accorded preferential treatment which is unjustified by the \u2018debt of gratitude\u2019 which underlies the preferences given full-time, active-duty war veterans.\u201d <em>(Matter of Rahill v Bronstein, </em>32 NY2d 417, 425, <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Respondent police officers, who were called up for assistance during a postal strike which fortuitously occurred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>during a \u201ctime of war,\u201d were not divorced from their civilian lives. Indeed, they were dismissed within a matter of hours precisely so that their civilian occupations would suffer no disruption. In such circumstances, no justification exists for an award of veterans\u2019 preference credits. The decisions of respondent commission to reverse the determinations of appellant and grant veterans\u2019 credits to respondent police officers were, therefore, based on a misapprehension of legislative intent and a disregard of the prior rulings of this court. <em>Stendrini v D Ambrose (supra), </em>which is inconsistent with that intent and those rulings, cannot serve as a rational basis for the action taken by respondent commission, and should not be followed. Where, as here, the initial administrative determinations are based on an accurate interpretation of legislative intent, they should not be set aside. The decisions made by respondent commission should therefore have been annulled on appellant\u2019s petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">In summary, we hold today that under section 6 of article V of the Constitution and section 85 of the Civil Service Law, veterans\u2019 credits should be awarded for civil service appointments and promotions only where the applicant\u2019s service as a \u201cmember of the armed forces\u201d during a \u201ctime of war\u201d was on a full-time basis evidencing a sacrifice in the form of disruption of civilian life and divorce from civilian occupation. It is not enough that an applicant\u2019s service fall within the literal definitions of \u201cmember of the armed forces\u201d and \u201ctime of war\u201d if that service did not significantly interfere with the applicant\u2019s normal employment and way of life. To the extent that <em>Matter of Silberglitt v McNamara </em>(300 NY 465) may be read to suggest otherwise, that decision should not be followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">Respondent Lombardi, who was initially granted veterans\u2019 credits by appellant, makes the additional argument that appellant is barred from rescinding his credits and revoking his promotion under subdivision 4 of section 50 of the Civil Service Law and the doctrine of estoppel. This argument is unpersuasive. Respondent Lombardi received his promotion only as a result of the veterans\u2019 credit awarded by respondent commission in violation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>provisions of the Civil Service Law. The very language of subdivision 4 of section 50 of the Civil Service Law empowers appellant to revoke appointments or promotions where, as here, there is a finding of illegality, whether or not the facts upon which the illegality was based were known prior to the appointment or promotion. (See <em>Matter of Wolff v Hodson, </em>285 NY 197, 202.) Furthermore, estoppel may not be applied to preclude a State or municipal agency from discharging its statutory responsibility. <em>(Public Improvements v Board of Educ., </em>56 NY2d 850.) This is particularly true where, as here, the estoppel is sought to be applied to perpetuate an appointment based on a misreading of constitutional and statutory requirements. <em>(Matter of McLaughlin v Berle, </em>71 AD2d 707, affd 51 NY2d 917; <em>Matter of Hauben v Goldin, </em>74 AD2d 804.)</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Accordingly, the orders of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, appellant\u2019s petitions should be granted, and the decisions of respondent commission should be annulled.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b496-7\">. While the City of New York is also an appellant, no separate argument is made on its behalf. \u201cAppellant\u201d throughout this opinion refers to the city Personnel Director.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b499-8\">. By contrast, the Legislature has specified that in disciplinary appeals the commission\u2019s decisions are to be final and unreviewable.

I concur in the result because I</p>\n<p id=\"AfW\">agree with the majority that the city Personnel Director has implied authority to maintain this action and therefore comes within the rule stated in <em>Matter of Flacke v Freshwater Wetlands Appeals Bd. </em>(53 NY2d 537, 540). In my judgment, however, the rules of standing set forth in <em>Matter of Dairylea Coop. v Walkley </em>(38 NY2d 6) are inapplicable to intra-governmental disputes <em>(Matter of Pooler v Public Serv. Comm., </em>58 AD2d 940, affd 43 NY2d 750). Insofar as <em>Matter of Bradford Cent. School Dist. v Ambach </em>(56 NY2d 158) holds otherwise, that case involved a dispute between a local school board and a State agency, not two units within the same department of local government.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b505-7\">Chief Judge Cooke</author>\n<p id=\"Ap_\">(dissenting). I agree that the petitioner does have standing to challenge the determination of the commissioner. However, because the majority weighs the value of the service rendered by respondent police officers, I respectfully dissent and vote to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">The majority opinion would deny veterans\u2019 preference credits to these respondents because their brief period of service provides \u201cno justification\u201d for such an award. Veterans\u2019 preference cannot be rationally denied to a soldier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>who served in the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, Coast Guard, or National Guard on \u201cfull-time active duty\u201d during \u201ctime of war\u201d solely on the ground that he or she served less than one day (NY Const, art V, \u00a7 6; General Construction Law, \u00a7 13-a; Civil Service Law, \u00a7 85, subd 1, par [c], cl [4]). Neither the State Constitution nor any statute provides for qualitative evaluations to be made of the relative contributions and disruptions to civilian life of soldiers serving in various historical contexts (see <em>Matter of Lore v Forbes, </em>173 Misc 1066, affd 259 App Div 806, mot for lv to app den 283 NY 778; see, also, <em>Matter of Silberglitt v McNamara, </em>300 NY 465, affg without opn 275 App Div 801; <em>Matter of Donohue v Huie, </em>285 NY 557; <em>Hornstein v Laird, </em>327 F Supp 993 [SDNY, 1971]). Nor can such value judgments regarding what constitutes a \u201cfull-scale sacrifice\u201d rationally be made. The yardstick of the Constitution and statutes is definite and not subject to varying or discretionary application. The majority\u2019s approach does not provide a workable means of making such evaluations of what constitutes significant interference \u201cwith the applicant\u2019s normal employment and way of life.\u201d The insertion of a discretionary element could lead to instances of abuse by the officials charged with granting these veterans\u2019 preference credits. Thus, there is good reason not to disregard or effectively overrule <em>Matter of Silberglitt v McNamara, </em>(300 NY 465, <em>supra), </em>because it serves the salutary and helpful purpose of recognizing and maintaining the nondiscretionary application of preference credits, which is required by the constitutional and statutory provisions in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">The two cases relied upon by the majority are distinguishable. The police officers in <em>Matter of Rahill v Bronstein </em>(32 NY2d 417), were reservists who served in time of war but their \u201cactive duty\u201d was only \u201cactive duty for training\u201d, which is expressly excluded by the terms of section 13-a of the General Construction Law. In <em>Matter of Rubin v Conway </em>(273 App Div 559, affd 298 NY 711), the physician was denied preference credit because he only served as a reservist on a part-time basis, four days a month, which constituted service on a \u201ctemporary, intermittent * * * basis\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>Here, respondents were called to \u201cfull-time active duty\u201d pursuant to an order of the President of the United States, during a \u201ctime of war.\u201d They fulfilled the constitutional and statutory requirements for a veterans\u2019 preference credit. When they reported for duty, respondents submitted themselves to the control of their superior officers for an indeterminate period of time for whatever duties would be required. As was aptly stated by a court which granted veterans\u2019 preference credits to a soldier who served less than one day before dismissal, \u201c[q]uite true, the petitioner did not risk his life or render \u2018meritorious service.\u2019 * * * The <em>value </em>of the service is not to be weighed or measured. No line is drawn between those * * * who did desk service * * * [and] those who saw service abroad * * * It was not the petitioner\u2019s fault that his service was of brief and inconsequential duration. He did all he was commanded to do, which is all any soldier can do\u201d <em>(Matter of Lore v Forbes, </em>173 Misc 1066, 1068, affd 259 App Div 806, mot for lv to app den 283 NY 778, <em>supra </em>[emphasis in original]).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Judges Jasen, Jones, Wachtler and Meyer concur with Judge Kaye; Judge Simons concurs in result in a memorandum; Chief Judge Cooke dissents and votes to affirm in a separate opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">In each case: Order reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
