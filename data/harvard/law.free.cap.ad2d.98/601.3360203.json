There is substantial evidence in the record to support the State Liquor Authority\u2019s determination that petitioner\u2019s establishment was no longer being operated as a \u201cgrocery store\u201d. (Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, \u00a7 3, subd 13; <em>Matter of Best v New York State Liq. Auth., </em>59 NY2d 906, revg 89 AD2d 893; <em>Matter ofProcida v State Liq. Auth., </em>79 AD2d 607.) Thus, we find that the cancellation of petitioner\u2019s beer license was not shockingly disproportionate to the offense. <em>(Matter of Pell v Board of Educ., </em>34 NY2d 222, 233.) However, the additional penalty of a $1,000 bond forfeiture is shocking to this court\u2019s sense of fairness because the petitioner\u2019s record was unblemished prior to the offense. We find that there should be no bond forfeiture in this proceeding since this additional penalty is overly severe. Accordingly the matter is remanded to the agency for the imposition of an appropriate penalty in accordance with this memorandum. <em>(Rob Tess Rest. Corp. v New York State Liq. Auth., </em>49 NY2d 874.) Concur \u2014 Murphy, P. J.., Ross, Carro, Fein and Kassal, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
