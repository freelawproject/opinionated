Tea Co., </em>207 AD2d 340; <em>Pendola v M. &amp; S. Cafeteria, </em>206 Misc 595). Leave to amend the complaint was properly denied on the same ground, namely, that plaintiff would not be able to prove that his symptoms were caused by his ingestion of contaminated lobster, such being an essential element to both proposed causes of action.
