The information also charged appellant with having been convicted of the crimes of grand theft and burglary, felonies, for which he served terms of imprisonment in the state prison.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-6\">\"Upon arraignment, appellant moved to set aside the information. After a hearing, the motion was denied and appellant entered his plea of \u2018Not Guilty.\u2019 and denied the prior convictions alleged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-7\">\"Before the matter came to trial another information was filed by the District Attorney for the County of Los Angeles, charging appellant with violation of Vehicle Code Section 239.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-8\">\"Appellant moved to set aside that information but his motion was denied and a plea of \u2018Not Guilty\u2019 was entered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-9\">\"Subsequently, on motion of the People, both informations were consolidated, the charge of violation of Vehicle Code Section 239 being designated Count IV. Appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss Count IV on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, was denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-10\">\"After trial by jury appellant was found guilty on each of the four counts. Appellant\u2019s motion for new trial was set for hearing and a probation report was ordered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-11\">\"Appellant\u2019s motion for new trial and to strike the Probation Officer\u2019s report was denied. Probation was denied and on December 9, 1955, appellant was sentenced to imprisonment in the state prison for the term prescribed by law on each count, the sentences as to Counts I,- II and III to run concurrently with each other and the sentence as to Count IV to run consecutively to that imposed on Counts I, II and III.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-12\">\"On November 5, 1956, appellant filed his \u2018Motion of Defendant to Vacate and Set Aside the Judgment of Conviction. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-13\">\"The appellant stated the following grounds for his motion to vacate:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-14\">\u201c \u2018I The defendant was denied due process of law contrary to Art. I, section 3, and 13 of the California Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>\u201c \u2018II That the conviction was against the law and evidence and that the verdict was against the law and evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-6\">\u201c \u2018III That the evidence as submitted was not sufficient to legally convict the defendant in that the corpus delicti of violation of section 470 P.C. and 487 P.C. was not established according to law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-7\">\u201c \u2018IV That the defendant was denied a fair and speedy trial in violation of section 686 P.C. and 1382 P.C. and Art. I, section 13 of the California Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-8\">\u201c \u2018V That the District Attorney and Court committed prejudicial error in the Trial.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-9\">\u201cOn November 14, 1956, appellant\u2019s motion was denied by the court on the ground that the matters complained of should have been raised on motion for new trial or on appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-10\">\u201cThis appeal is taken from the order of the court denying the motion to vacate and set aside the judgment of conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-11\">\u201cCases hold the nonstatutory motion to set aside the judgment is the equivalent of a petition for writ of error <em>coram nobis {People </em>v. <em>Larsen, </em>144 Cal.App.2d 504, 506 [301 P.2d 298]; <em>People </em>v. <em>McCoy, </em>115 Cal.App.2d 565, 567 [252 P.2d 371]) and appellant so treats his motion in his opening brief on appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-12\">As pointed out by respondent and supported by the record, \u201cThe petition does not allege specific facts relied upon but merely asserts conclusions.\u201d \u201cMere allegations of ultimate facts or conclusions are not sufficient.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-13\">\u201cIn the instant case the \u2018grounds\u2019 upon which appellant relies for relief are, essentially, insufficiency of the evidence to sustain the conviction, denial of a speedy trial, and prejudicial error of the District Attorney and the Court. It is manifest that if these errors did occur they would necessarily be known to appellant at the time of trial.  Yet his application for the writ was not filed until almost a year later, and it is devoid of any explanation for the delay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-14\">\u201cThis failure to show the exercise of diligence in seeking the relief requested warranted and required that the petition be denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-15\"><em>\u201cPeople </em>v. <em>Remling, supra, </em>146 Cal.App.2d 476, 480 [304 P.2d 97]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>121 Cal.App.2d 651, 655 [263 P.2d 850]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Malone, </em>96 Cal.App.2d 270, 272 [215 P.2d 109] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Krout, </em>90 Cal.App.2d 205, 209 [202 P.2d 635].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-16\">\u201cIn the Krout case, <em>supra, </em>the appellate court stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>\u201c \u2018Appellant's naive recital of what he did testify and of what he would testify upon a second trial concerning the events preceding and at the time of the trial discloses that he knew then everything that he knows now. ... If his current statements were true, he could have prevented a judgment. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mendez, </em>28 Cal.2d 686, 688 [171 P.2d 425].) But his tactless delay for eight months, under the circumstances, forecloses him of all right to relief under his petition (for writ of error <em>coram nobis). </em>(Citing cases.)'</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-5\">\u201cThus, the appellant\u2019s motion was properly denied because it stated only conclusions and not the facts relied upon; because it failed to state grounds within the scope of the writ-sought ; and because it failed to show diligence on the part of appellant in seeking the relief requested.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">It is clearly evident that respondent\u2019s argument is supported by the record and the law. A review of the record reveals no prejudicial errors. The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">White, P. J., and Fourt, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied September 25, 1957.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
