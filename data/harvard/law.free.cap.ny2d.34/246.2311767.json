The action of the Wyoming County Court sought to be enjoined was nonfinal and therefore nonappealable. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>19 N Y 2d 137; <em>Matter of Proskin </em>v. <em>County Ct. of Albany County, </em>30 N Y 2d 15; <em>People ex rel.

No. 2 </em>v. <em>New York State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, </em>27 A D 2d 265, 23 N Y 2d 213.) III. The Wyoming County Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain relator Pugach\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>writ of habeas corpus and exceeded its authority in ordering a hearing to take place in Bronx County. <em>(People ex rel.

Dadd </em>for Wyoming County Court, respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AcM\">I. The appeal is moot. II. The first sentence of. CPLR 7011 specifically provides for an appeal. III. The court\u2019s solution of applying the statute on <em>ad hoc </em>basis avoids both extremes and is eminently fair and practical.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b288-5\"><em>Richard T. Farrell </em>for Burton N. Pugach, respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ala\">Since the determination of the habeas corpus proceeding was final, appellant\u2019s sole relief from that judgment was through appeal. <em>(People ex rel. Prosser </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>306 N. Y. 710.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b288-6\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Adv\">Judgment, denominated an order, in an article 78 proceeding in the nature of prohibition affirmed, without costs, on the limited ground that it was improvident to entertain the proceeding to prohibit the exercise of jurisdiction by the habeas corpus court. The habeas corpus court had jurisdiction to entertain the writ (CPLR 7004) and power to order a hearing to be held by the sentencing court (see, e.g., <em>People ex rel. Prosser </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>306 N. Y. 710, 711-712). Hence, prohibition, which might be available to restrain a court from proceeding without jurisdiction or in excess of its powers, does not lie (see <em>Matter of Proskin </em>v. <em>County Ct. of Albany County, 30 N Y 2d </em>15, 18; <em>Matter of Lee </em>v. <em>County Ct. of Erie County, </em>27 N Y 2d 432, 436-437; <em>Matter of Hogan </em>v. <em>Culkin, </em>18 N Y 2d 330, 336; cf. <em>Matter of Marx </em>v. <em>Holloran, </em>236 App. Div. 680). Moreover, it would appear to be unseemly to invoke a summary proceeding to restrain proceedings under the constitutional writ (N. Y. Const., art. I, \u00a7 4). The evident unseemliness is further aggravated by the availability of an appeal, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>CPLR 7011, from a judgment of habeas corpus (see <em>Matter of Lee </em>v. <em>County Ct., supra, </em>p. 437). Nor was the judgment any less final, for purposes of appeal, because it, in effect, directed a further hearing in the criminal action by the sentencing court (cf. <em>People ex rel. Prosser </em>v. <em>Martin, supra). </em>Prohibition does not ordinarily lie if there be an adequate remedy by way of appeal <em>(Matter of Lee </em>v. <em>County Ct., supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">In light of this disposition, the court does not consider the several grounds adopted by the Appellate Division in its opinion dismissing the petition. It is noted, also, that the controversy has been mooted: the Supreme Court in Bronx County conducted the postconviction hearing directed by the habeas corpus court, and found that the prisoner, Pugach, had been competent to stand trial in 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Chief Judge Breitel and Judges Jasen, Jones, Wachtler, Rabin and Stevens concur in <em>Per Curiam </em>opinion; Judge Gabbielli taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Judgment affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
