S. Stat. 3014, 3018], plaintiffs may recover any damages for psychic trauma suffered on board a hijacked aircraft. The preliminary question, in the context of plaintiffs\u2019 motions for summary judgment, is whether any triable issue of fact has been presented as to the meaning of critical terms of article 17, the official text of which is in French. For reasons which follow, we conclude that the precise meaning of article 17 is not a disputed issue of fact requiring trial in this case and that summary judgment should be granted to plaintiffs on the issue of liability, to the following extent. At trial, plaintiffs should be allowed to prove damages for palpable, objective bodily injuries suffered, whether caused by psychic trauma or by the physical conditions on the aircraft, irresp\u00e9ctive of impact, but not for psychic trauma alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">On September 6, 1970, while en route from Tel Aviv, Israel, to New York City, defendant\u2019s aircraft was hijacked by self-proclaimed members of the so-called Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, diverted to the Middle East and forced to land in the desert near Amman, Jordan. For the next six days, the passengers and crew members were held captive on or near the aircraft by Arab guerillas armed with rifles and hand grenades. On September 12, 1970, the passengers were directed onto buses and immediately thereafter forced to watch the aircraft destroyed by explosives. They were then taken to a hotel and the following day released and returned to New York. Plaintiff Edith Rosman and her two young children, Hannah and Leah, and plaintiff Miriam Herman, then age 17, were among the passengers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> They claim to have suffered severe psychic trauma during the ordeal, fearing for their lives and personal safety at the hands of the terrorists. While none of them alleges to have been shot, struck or personally assaulted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>by any of the hijackers, the plaintiffs, all Jewish, naturally feared that their lives were in grave danger. In addition to this emotional stress, plaintiffs allege to have been damaged by the physical circumstances of their imprisonment aboard the aircraft. They claim to have been confined almost exclusively to their seats, subjected to great temperature extremes of the desert, and deprived of adequate food and water.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-3\">The Rosman and Herman actions, consolidated for the purposes of this appeal, are before us in the context of plaintiff\u2019s motions for summary judgment on the issue of liability. Defendant Trans World Airlines, Inc. (T.W.A.) is claimed to be absolutely liable for plaintiffs\u2019 physical and psychic injuries from the hijacking under the Warsaw Convention and subsequent Montreal Agreement. (Special Term directed summary judgment for plaintiffs in both cases and the Appellate Divisions, First and Second Departments, reversed and denied summary judgment finding that triable issues of fact were presented.)</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">Specifically, plaintiff Edith Rosman. claims in her affidavit that as a result of the forced immobility, she developed a backache, swollen feet and a large discoloration of her upper legs and back. Because of inadequate sanitary facilities, she claims that her children developed boils and skin irritation. Scarcity of food and water allegedly caused her and the children substantial weight loss and dehydration. In addition, Mrs. Rosman claims that \u2018 \u2018 [a] s a result of the hijacking, I have become highly nervous, tense, anxious and extremely depressed. I have become irritable to my husband and children. I have difficulty sleeping at night. I have been compelled, on my physician\u2019s prescription, to take tranquilizers, among other things. My daughters have also become nervous and restless and to this day have nightmares associated with the hijacking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Plaintiff Miriam Herman claims in her affidavit that she <em>\u201c </em>lost much weight, slept very little, became extremely frightened and developed a skin rash. As a result of the hijacking, I have become highly nervous, tense and anxious, and I have * * * sustained other injuries. I have been and am currently under a physician\u2019s care. I have been compelled to take, on his prescription, tranquilizers, among other things.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>\n<em>Background: The Warsaw Convention</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">There is no dispute that defendant\u2019s liability, if any, is governed by the provisions of an international treaty commonly called the Warsaw Convention, as supplemented by a contractual arrangement known as the Montreal Agreement. The Convention, formally entitled Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Transportation by Air, was concluded at Warsaw, Poland, on October 12, 1929, and adhered to by the United States on June 27, 1934 by Presidential proclamation. It is drawn up in French<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and printed in French in the United States Statutes at Large (49 U. S. Stat. 3000-3009) together with an English translation (49 U. S. Stat. 3014-3023). It is a major multilateral agreement governing the rights and responsibilities of passengers, shippers and carriers in certain aspects of international air transportation among its more than one hundred contracting Nations.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The primary objectives of the Convention are to establish uniform rules of documentation in air transportation (tickets, baggage checks and waybills) and to limit the liability of the air carriers in case of accident <em>(Block </em>v. <em>Campagnie Nationale Air France, </em>386 F. 2d 323, 327, cert. den. 392 U. S. 905). The liability of air carriers for damage to passengers \u2014 the determination of which is the center of this controversy \u2014 is provided in article 17 in English translation as follows:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201c The carrier shall be liable for damage sustained in the event of the <em>death or wounding </em>of a passenger <em>or any other bodily injury </em>suffered by a passenger, if the accident<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which caused the damage so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>sustained took place on board the aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking. \u2019 \u2019 (49 U. S. Stat. 3018.) (Emphasis added; footnote added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">The Convention then prescribes certain defenses available to the carrier and sets maximum liability per passenger at 125,000 Poincar\u00e9 francs ($8,291.87). The United States\u2019 dissatisfaction with this low liability limit led it on November 15, 1965 to give formal six-month notice of denunciation of the Convention. This notice, in turn, prompted a conference in Montreal, attended by delegates from 59 Nations and representatives of airline industry groups. An interim arrangement known as the Montreal Agreement (Agreement C.A.B. 18900, Civil Aeronautics Board Order Approving Agreement, May 13, 1966, 31 Federal Register 7302) emerged from this conference by which the majority of international air carriers, including the defendant, agreed to increase their liability limit per passenger to $75,000 inclusive of legal fees and to waive any defense under subdivision (1) of article 20 of the Convention.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> By the waiver, the participating carriers agreed to accept the liability imposed upon them by article 17 of the Warsaw Convention without fault. Thus, as the parties agree, the Montreal Agreement modifies the effect of the Warsaw Convention only to the extent of providing for absolute liability up to $75,000; it does not change the substance of that liability \u2014 i.e., the character of the compensable injuries \u2014 as it is provided in article 17 of the Convention.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Defendant claims that the liability scheme of Warsaw and Montreal does not allow recovery for the injuries plaintiffs allege because (1) injury resulting from psychic trauma alone, with or without palpable physical manifestation, is not \u201c bodily injury \u201d within the meaning of article 17, and (2) the physical injuries claimed did not result from any impact and in any case are so slight as not to amount to compensable \u201c bodily injury \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">The dispositions below of plaintiffs\u2019 motions for summary judgment give rise to the preliminary question posed on these appeals \u2014 whether a material issue of fact requiring trial has been presented. In both the Eosman and Herman actions, Special Term concluded that no triable issue was presented, granted summary judgment to plaintiffs on the issue of liability for both physical injuries and psychic trauma and directed trial on the issue of damages. The Appellate Divisions, First Department (in the Eosman action) and Second Department (Herman action), reversed and denied summary judgment, finding that they could not take judicial notice of the meaning of a foreign language and that triable issues of fact were presented as to the \u201c precise meaning \u201d of the French text of article 17. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">At issue in these cases is the proper meaning to be ascribed to the liability provisions of the Warsaw Convention, a treaty of the United States. While the treaty is written in French, it is nevertheless a domestic, not a foreign law. It is the supreme law of the land (U. S. Const., art. VI, cl. 2) of which New York courts are required' to take judicial notice (CPLR 4511, subd. [a]). The \u2018 \u2018 precise meaning \u2019 \u2019 of the terms of the Convention, therefore, is to be determined by the court as a question of law (CPLR 4511, subd. [c]) and cannot be treated as a triable issue of fact so as to defeat consideration of a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Defendant argues that if the meaning of the terms of the Convention is a question of law for the court, then a hearing under CPLR 4511 (subd. [d] )<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> should be held and expert testimony received as to the French legal meaning of the terms, and an attempt made to probe the. intent of the Warsaw drafters as to the scope of the terms \u201c l\u00e9sion corporelle \u201d <em>(\u201c </em>bodily injury \u201d). We are aware that where the text of a treaty is drawn up in only one language, that language is controlling <em>(Todok </em>v. <em>Union State Bank, </em>281 U. S. 449,454). And, of course, there may be cases where the meaning of the foreign text of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>a treaty is in such dispute that a CPLR 4511 hearing is appropriate to enable a court to arrive at an accurate translation. But in this case there is absolutely no dispute over the proper translation of the liability provisions of the Convention, i.e., that the French phrase \u201c mort, de blessure, ou de toutes autres lesion corporelle \u201d in article 17 means \u201c death or wounding * * * or any other bodily injury \u201d in English. Although they would attach different connotations to these terms, the parties agree that \u201c lesion corporelle \u201d means \u201c bodily injury \u201d. Both sides urge one and the same translation of the Convention\u2019s liability provisions \u2014 that contained in the United States Statutes at Large (49 U. S. Stat. 3018). Where a translation which fairly comprehends the meaning and scope of the foreign terms is agreed upon, the court\u2019s inquiry should proceed toward determining the ordinary meaning of those terms and arriving at a reasonable interpretation which will effectuate the treaty\u2019s purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">However, in arriving at an interpretation of a treaty whose sole official language is French, are we bound to apply French law? If we are, then a CPLR 4511 hearing might be appropriate in order to determine what that law is. We think this question and the underlying choice of law issue warrant some discussion. The parties in their briefs, and the First Department in its opinion, rely upon the statement of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit that \u201c [t]he binding meaning of the terms [of the Warsaw Convention] is the <em>French legal meaning.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> (Block </em>v. <em>Compagnie Nationale Air </em>France, 386 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>F. 2d 323, 330, cert. den. 392 U. S. 905, <em>supra </em>[emphasis added]; see, also, <em>Husserl </em>v. <em>Swiss Air Transp. Co., </em>351 F. Supp. 702, 708, affd. 485 F. 2d 1240.) In the context of the court\u2019s opinion, we do not think this statement can be regarded as a conclusion that internal French law is to be \u201c applied \u201d, in the choice of law sense, to determine the meaning and scope of the Convention\u2019s terms. Of course, French legal usage must be considered in arriving at an accurate English translation of the French. But when an accurate English translation is made, and agreed upon, as here, the inquiry into meaning does not then revert to a quest for past or present French law to be \u201c applied \u201d, for revelation of the proper scope of the terms. It does not follow from the fact that the treaty is written in French that in interpreting it we are forever chained to French law, either as it existed when the treaty was written or in its present state of development. There is no suggestion in the treaty that French law was intended to govern the meaning of Warsaw\u2019s terms, nor have we found any indication to this effect in its legislative history or from our study of its application and interpretation by other courts. Indeed, analysis of the cases indicates that the courts, in interpreting and applying the Warsaw Convention, have not considered themselves bound to apply French law simply because the Convention is written in French.* *******<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>We are not persuaded that the treaty\u2019s language controls the particular national law, if any, to be applied in determining the meaning of its terms, and thus conclude that a CPLR 4511 hearing is not required to determine French law.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">Nor do we see any useful purpose to be served by such a hearing to search out the intent of the drafters of Warsaw. Our study of the minutes of the Convention indicates that the drafters did not define or discuss what was meant by the phrase \u201c death or wounding * * * or any other bodily injury \u201d in article 17<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (see, e.g., Lowenfeld, Hijacking, Warsaw, and the Problem of Psychic Trauma, 1 Syracuse J. of Int. Law and Commerce 346, 347-348). In addition, the question of whether psychic injury is a \u201c bodily injury \u201d \u201c was never talked about at Montreal \u201d (p. 347).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">We are of the opinion that informed consideration of the legal questions presented would not be aided by additional testimonial and documentary evidence on the French language, French law or the legislative history of the Convention. The only issue is the legal significance of the terms used and further inquiry into their \u201c precise meaning \u201d is unnecessary. Accordingly, we would not remand for a CPLR 4511 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">We proceed, therefore, to consider the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 contention that psychic trauma is fully compensable under the Warsaw Convention. In doing so, we look to the purposes of the Convention and the ordinary meaning of its terms and seek to apply the \u201c fundamental principle \u201d that a treaty should receive a liberal interpretation to give effect to its apparent purposes <em>(Todok </em>v. <em>Union State Bank, </em>281 U. S. 449, supra; <em>Geofroy </em>v. <em>Riggs, </em>133 U. S. 258, 271-272; <em>Matter of Zalewski, </em>292 N. Y. 332, 336).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>The apparent purpose of the entire Convention is uniformity among its diverse adherent Nations \u2014 the achievement, so far as possible, of a uniform body of law as to the various subject matters which are covered. The particular provisions limiting liability were designed to assure that only a regulated burden be borne by the air carriers <em>(Eck </em>v. <em>United Arab Airlines, </em>15 N Y 2d 53, 59, <em>supra), </em>and to afford a more definite basis for passenger recovery (see letter of Secretary of State Cordell Hull dated March 31,1934, Senate Comm, on Foreign Relations, message from the President of the United States Transmitting a Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules, Sen. Exec. Doc. No. G, 73d Cong., 2d Sess. 3-4 [1934]). These liability provisions should, we believe, be interpreted to promote uniformity both of the substance and application of the Convention.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Looking to the language of the Convention\u2019s liability provisions, we are cognizant that, in interpretation of an international agreement, the object is \u201cto ascertain the meaning intended by the parties for the terms in which the agreement is expressed, having regard to the context in which they occur and the circumstances under which the agreement was made.\u201d (Restatement, 2d, Foreign Relations Law of the United States, \u00a7 146.) The language is to be taken according to its ordinary and natural meaning <em>(Geofroy </em>v. <em>Riggs, supra; Hamilton </em>v. <em>Erie R. R. Co., </em>219 N. Y. 343, 353, writ of error dsmd. <em>sub nom. Erie R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>248 U. S. 369).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">The parties agree that the translation of article 17 contained at 49 U. S. Stat. 3018 is accurate and we will refer therefore to the English terms. From study of the meaning and usage of the French terms, however, we believe that our conclusions follow as well from the \u201c ordinary meaning \u201d of the French as the English. The critical language is \u201c death or wounding of a passenger or any other bodily injury suffered by a passenger The inclusion of the term \u201c bodily \u201d to modify \u201c injury \u201d cannot be ignored, and in its ordinary usage, the term \u201c bodily \u201d suggests opposition to \u201c mental \u201d. This traditional dualism may or may not reflect the actual physiological structure of the human organism; it may be that fright and emotional distress are as much \u201c bodily \u201d, in the sense of \u201c physiological \u201d, as a broken leg. But the relationship between \u201c mind \u201d and \u201c body \u201d\u2014 a stubborn problem in human <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>thought \u2014 is not the question before us nor one we would presume to decide. Rather, in seeking to apply the treaty\u2019s terms to the facts before us, we ask whether the treaty\u2019s use of the word \u201c bodily \u201d, in its ordinary meaning, can fairly be said to include \u201c mental \u201d. We deal with the term as used in an international agreement written almost 50 years ago, a term which even today would have little significance in the treaty as an adjective modifying \u201c injury \u201d except to import a distinction from \u201c mental \u201d. In our view, therefore, the ordinary, natural meaning of \u201c bodily injury \u201d as used in article 17 connotes palpable, conspicuous physical injury,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and excludes mental injury with no observable \u201c bodily \u201d, as distinguished from \u201c behavioral \u201d, manifestations.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">This reading of \u201c bodily injury \u201d defeats as well plaintiff\u2019s suggested interpretation of \u201cwounding\u201d (\u201c blessure \u201d) as comprehending \u201c hurt \u201d, emotional or physical. Read in context, as it must be, \u201c wounding \u201d is limited by the subsequent phrase \u201c or any other bodily injury \u201d and in its ordinary meaning does not, we believe, connote more than solely physical wounds. Only by abandoning the ordinary and natural meaning of the language of article 17, could we arrive at a reading of the terms \u201c wounding \u201d or \u201c bodily injury \u201d which might comprehend purely mental suffering without physical manifestations. Such an abandonment would little serve the interests of promoting uniformity in the treaty\u2019s interpretation and application \u2014 interests which we must observe and further.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Plaintiffs suggested on oral argument, however, that the Warsaw Convention does not impose uniformity as to the meaning of \u201c wounding \u201d or \u201c bodily injury \u201d but rather leaves the meaning and coverage of these terms to local decision. It was argued that New York law, specifically the prin- ' ciples of <em>Battalla </em>v. <em>State of New York </em>(10 N Y 2d 237) should be applied in this hijacking situation and recovery for provable damages from psychic trauma be allowed. (See Lowenfeld, Hijacking, Warsaw, and the Problem of Psychic Trauma, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>1 Syracuse J. of Int. Law and Commerce 345.) It is true that not all matters covered by Warsaw are governed by uniform rule. Indeed, the treaty itself specifies that the law of the court to which the case is submitted is to be applied to determine a passenger\u2019s contributory negligence (art. 21), questions of procedure (art. 28, subd. [2]) and the method of calculating the two-year limitation period for bringing an action (art. 29, subd. [2]). Determination of the degree of default considered equivalent to willful misconduct (\u201c dol \u201d) is left by article 25 (subd. [1]) to the law of the forum. We are also aware that it has generally been held in the United States that Warsaw does not create an independent right of action for personal injuries or death but depends upon the existence of some other basic law at the place of the accident or elsewhere to grant the right of action.

The construction of the terms \u201c wounding \u201d and <em>\u201c </em>bodily injury \u201d which plaintiffs suggest, not only strains their ordinary meaning in context but would alter the nature of the carrier\u2019s liability under the Convention. The application of local law would impress an artificial sense upon the terms which finds no warrant in the treaty and such a course would surely be a deviation from the principles of treaty construction <em>(Santovincenzo </em>v. <em>Egan, </em>284 U. S. 30, 40; <em>Geofroy </em>v. <em>Riggs, </em>133 U. S. 258, 271, <em>supra). </em>Particularly are the vagaries of local law application and attendant conflicts of law problems to be avoided in the case of this Convention which aims at uniformity of application among its national parties. That the Convention may fall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>short of this aim does not reduce' our obligation under the Constitution to observe its terms and attempt to effectuate its purpose rather than impose upon it our own particular State policies. (Cf. <em>Kolovrat </em>v. <em>Oregon, </em>366 U. S. 187, 198.) \u201c Public policy which frowns on contractual limitations of liability of a common carrier * * * is subordinate to the provisions of the Convention insofar as they are operative.\u201d <em>(Garcia </em>v. <em>Pan Amer. Airways, </em>269 App. Div. 287, affd. 295 N. Y. 852, cert. den. 329 U. S. 741; see, also, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pink, </em>315 U. S. 203, 231-233.)</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">A faithful reading of the terms of the Convention leads, we believe, to the following conclusions. A claim for damages under article 17 arises \u201c in the event of * * * bodily injury \u201d. The claim must therefore be predicated upon some objective identifiable injury to the body. In addition, there must be some causal connection between the bodily injury and the \u201c accident \u201d. In our view, this connection can be established whether the bodily injury was caused by physical impact, by the physical circumstances of the confinement or by psychic trauma. If the accident \u2014 the hijacking \u2014 caused severe fright, which in turn manifested itself in some objective <em>\u201c </em>bodily injury \u201d, then we would conclude that the Convention\u2019s requirement of the causal connection is satisfied. For example, if plaintiff Herman\u2019s skin rash was caused or aggravated by the fright she experienced on board the aircraft, then she should be compensated for the rash and for the damages flowing from the rash. It follows that, if proved at trial, she should be compensated for her mental anguish, <em>suffered as a result </em>of the rash, since this anguish would have flowed from the <em>\u201c </em>bodily injury \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Thus, as we read article 17, the compensable injuries must be \u201c bodily \u201d but there may be an intermediate causal link which is \u2018 \u2018 mental \u2019 \u2019 between the cause \u2014 the \u2018 \u2018 accident \u2019 \u2019\u2014 and thq effect \u2014 the \u201c bodily injury \u201d. And once that predicate of liability \u2014 the <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2018 bodily injury \u2019 \u2019\u2014 is established, then the damages sustained as a result of the \u201c bodily injury \u201d are compensable, including mental suffering.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> At least to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>extent, the treaty may be afforded a liberal interpretation which tends to support the rights which plaintiffs claim under it. <em>(Asakura </em>v. <em>Seattle, </em>265 U. S. 332, 342.) However, only the damages flowing from' the \u201c bodily injury \u201d, whatever the causal link, are compensable. We are drawn to these conclusions by the clear import of the terms of article 17. Those terms, in their ordinary meaning, will not support plaintiffs\u2019 claim that psychic trauma alone, or even the psychic trauma which caused the bodily injury, is compensable under the Warsaw Convention. <em>(Cf. Husserl </em>v. <em>Swiss Air Transp. Co., </em>351 F. Supp. 702, 708 [dicta], affd. 485 F. 2d 1240, <em>supra; Burnett </em>v. <em>Trans World Airlines, </em>368, F. Supp. 1152, <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">We hold, therefore, that defendant is liable for plaintiff\u2019s palpable, objective bodily injuries, including those caused by the psychic trauma of the hijacking, and for the damages flowing from those bodily injuries, but not for the trauma as such or for the nonbodily or behavioral manifestations of that trauma.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Accordingly, in each case, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, the order of Special Term granting summary judgment to plaintiffs on the issue of liability reinstated and the case remitted for trial on the issue of damages in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b428-7\">.

In the court\u2019s opinion, this statement occurs in the following context: \u201c The Statutes at large for 1934 indicate that it was the French text to which the United States adhered in the instrument the United States deposited in the archives of the Ministry of Poland, 49 Stat. 3013 (1934).8 **********19 [Footnote 19 states: \u201cHowever, on June 15, 1934, the text that was read to the Senate, and to which the resolution of ratification was directed, was a text in English originally published in a Treaty Information Bulletin of the Department of State in March, 1934, 78 Cong. Rec. #115 77-82 (1934).\u201d] The binding meaning of the terms is the French legal meaning. <em>\u2018 </em>The principle of the primacy of the French legal system thus means a harmonizing construction of the Convention.\u2019 This principle should not be carried to extremes, but \u2018 [u]niformity may be maintained without many futile disputes as to whether, why and when resort to the teachings in Paries [i.e., the minutes of the proceedings leading to the final text of the Convention] should be made.\u2019 \u201d [The quotation is from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>Sundberg, Air Charter: A Study in Legal Development, pp. 242-249 (Stockholm, 1961).] (386 F. 2d 323, 330.) The issue in <em>Bloch </em>was whether international <em>\u201c </em>voyage \u201d charter flights are covered by the Warsaw Convention. The court\u2019s task was to determine Warsaw\u2019s concept of a contract of carriage, and it necessarily took into account the importance to the drafters, the majority of whom were from civil law countries, of the civil law notion of contract. In finding these charters covered by Warsaw, the court did not, however, \u201c apply \u201d internal French law, but rather expressly based its holding upon the facts of the ease and the text and legislative history of Warsaw (386 F. 2d, at p. 353).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b434-13\">.

(Mental anguish and emotional distress directly resulting from physical injuries suffered in hijacking were compensable in an action under article 17; see, generally, Calkins, The Cause of Action Under the Warsaw Convention, Part II, 26 J. of Air Law and Commerce 323, 339-340.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b440-7\">Stevens, J.

Since both actions involve the same fundamental question they are treated together.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">In each action plaintiffs seek recovery for psychic injuries resulting from the hijacking of a plane in which they, or those they represent, were passengers. The plane in question was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>on a flight from Tel Aviv to New York when it was diverted to an area near Amman, Jordan, where it remained with its passengers for several days. Undoubtedly, it was a harrowing ordeal and plaintiffs seek to recover for the emotional and physical suffering experienced.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-3\">Recovery is sought under the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Transportation by Air (49 U. S. Stat. 3000) (the Warsaw Convention), and the Montreal Agreement (Agreement C.A.B. 18900, 31 Federal Register 7302).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">The question is whether absolute liability is imposed upon the defendant under the Warsaw Convention and Montreal Agreement for emotional disturbances or injuries not resulting from impact. In my view it is not. Resolution of the issue requires some examination of the background of the Warsaw Convention and the Montreal Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">The first draft of the Warsaw Convention (Convention) was about 1926. By 1929 the Convention as we know it was formulated in French. The United States became a signatory in 1934. Several articles, or portions thereof, are of significance in consideration of the present issue. Chief among these is article 17. The language with which we are chiefly concerned follows: <em>\u201c </em>The carrier shall be liable for damages sustained in the event of the death or wounding of a passenger <em>or any other bodily injury </em>suffered by a passenger, if the <em>accident </em>which caused the damage so sustained took place on board the aircraft \u201d. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The phrase <footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>death, wounding or any other bodily injury \u201d appeared in the 1928 draft (then art. 22, subd. [c]) of the French text as \u201c en cas de mort, de blessure ou de toute autre l\u00e9sion corporelle.\u201d (Lowenfeld, Hijacking, Warsaw, and the Problem of Psychic Trauma, 1 Syracuse J. of Int. Law and Commerce, 345, 348.) Professor Lowenfeld notes that the translation \u201c death, wounding or bodily injury \u201d is \u201c as good as any translation can be.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">Article 20 (subd. [1]) of the Convention reads: <em>\u201c </em>[t]he carrier shall not be liable if he proves that he and his agents have taken all necessary measures to avoid the damage or that it was impossible for him or them to take such measures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>Article 21 states \u201c [i]f the carrier finds that the damage was caused by or contributed to by the negligence of the injured person the court may, in accordance with the provisions of its own law, exonerate the carrier or party from his liability. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Thus, we see in the Convention a limitation on the amount of liability, a permissible defense of due care, and a possible defense of contributory negligence available to the carrier. This is consistent with the purposes underlying the Convention\u2019s adoption. \u201c The over-all principle of the Convention was one of allowing only a regulated burden to be the responsibility of the then struggling carriers. The purposes were to <em>provide uniform rules of limitation concerning the liability </em>of international air carriers to their passengers and to <em>provide a uniform remedy for these passengers </em>to the extent that this remedy would not burden the carrier more than the Convention provisions allowed.\u201d <em>(Eck </em>v. <em>United Arab Airlines, </em>15 N Y 2d 53, 59.)</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">On November 15, 1965, the United States deposited a notice of termination of the Convention effective May 15, 1966. The reason for such action was attributed to dissatisfaction with the low limit of recovery provided for by the Hague Protocol of 1955 as it affected United States citizens. The Hague Protocol which amended the Convention, was never ratified by the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Following this action, steps were taken to avoid the denunciation and retain United States membership in the Convention. (See, generally, Lowenfeld, Hijacking, Warsaw, and the Problem of Psychic Trauma, 1 Syracuse J. of Int. Law and Commerce 345.) The result of such efforts is embodied in the Montreal Agreement (Agreement) of May, 1966. The chief results were two-fold: The limit of liability per passenger was raised to $75,000 except in cases where legal fees were awarded separately in which case it was $58,000, and the defense of due care was eliminated. Thus, absolute liability for \u201c death, wounding or any bodily injury \u201d was imposed upon the air carriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">Professor Lowenfeld notes that the meaning of \u201c bodily injury \u201d was never talked about at Montreal. Thus, we must' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>of necessity look at the Convention itself and consider as well the time at which it was drafted. \u201cIt is a familiar rule that the obligations of treaties should be liberally construed so as to give effect to the apparent intention of the parties.\u201d <em>(Valentine </em>v. <em>United States ex rel. Neidecker, </em>299 U. S. 5, 10.) Recognizing the rule, and recognizing as well that any expression in terms may not be absolute when a question arises as to the construction of language and the area intended to be covered, we look to those areas generally cognizable at the time of the writing to determine a basis for relief or recovery. Certainly, psychic trauma was not an area generally embraced within the term \u201c bodily injury \u201d at the time or times of the drafting and writing of the Convention. In fact in even so progressive a State as New York, it is not too long ago that the doctrine of <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Rochester Ry Co. </em>(151 N. Y. 107, no recovery for injuries resulting from fright without impact) was repudiated, and one was permitted to maintain an action to recover for emotional and neurological disturbances negligently caused (see <em>Battalla </em>v. <em>State of New York, </em>10 N Y 2d 237).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">The term \u201c death \u201d in article 17 of the Convention refers to a state usually readily identified. The term \u201c wounding \u201d imparts a condition caused by some external force, intentional or otherwise. \u201c Bodily injury \u201d when used in conjunction with the words \u201c accident which caused the damage \u201d seems to envision impact or contact. The factual background to the writing of the Convention, and the recognized purpose of the Convention belie the view that it intended to include an area where the damages, even if real, could not be ascertained with some degree of precision. If feigned, the then struggling airlines could easily have been bankrupted. In my view, the term \u201c bodily injury \u201d is a limitation on wounding.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">To apply the law of the forum in determining what constitutes actionable damage is either to disregard the language of the Convention and the Agreement, or to extend their terms to a cause of action not considered by them. Psychic harm or mental anguish as a separate and independent cause of .action was not within the contemplation of the draftsmen of the Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>vention. Nor, without impact, should it be considered a compensable element.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">Even as victims of crime are compensated by local governments, Nations could, and perhaps should, create and contribute to a fund to compensate victims of hijacking. Again, the Convention or Agreement could be modified to make explicit provision for such compensation. In my opinion there is no liability here on the defendant under the Convention or the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Judgment should have been granted to defendant below (see <em>Lanza </em>v. <em>Wagner, </em>11 N Y 2d 317, 334) and the complaint dismissed since the plaintiffs rely upon article 17 of the Convention for the fixation of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Chief Judge Breitel and Judges Jasen, Gabrielli, Jones and Wachtler concur with Judge Rabin ; Judge Stevens dissents in part and votes to modify in a separate opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">In <em>Rosman </em>v. <em>Trans World Airlines, </em>Inc.: Order reversed, without costs, the order of Supreme Court, New York County, reinstated and case remitted to that court for trial in accordance with opinion herein.
