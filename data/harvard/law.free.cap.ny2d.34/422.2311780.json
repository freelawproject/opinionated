There was substantial evidence to support the findings of the trial court that, by accepting rent from plaintiff, defendants had waived any alleged default resulting from a purported failure to strictly perform certain covenants of the lease relating to burning, when the same was necessitated in order to comply with a different covenant of the lease which was for the exclusive benefit of defendants. <em>(Collins </em>v. <em>Hasbrouck, </em>56 N. Y. 157; <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Harway, </em>56 N. Y. 337; <em>Riggs </em>v. <em>Pursell, </em>66 N. Y. 193; <em>Conger </em>v. <em>Duryee, </em>90 N.

The trial court correctly found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>that defendants failed to notify plaintiff of any alleged default on plaintiff\u2019s part and provide plaintiff with an opportunity to effect a cure within a reasonable time in accordance with paragraph \u201c Fourteen \u201d of the lease in the absence of any evidence to the contrary. <em>(Lowe </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>240 App. Div. 484, 265 N.

It was an error in reversing the trial court\u2019s finding that the proper standard for measuring plaintiff\u2019s performance of its lease with respect to burning was that of \u201c substantial performance \u201d rather than \u201c full compliance \u201d. <em>(Ogden </em>v. <em>Hamer, </em>268 App. Div. 751; <em>Vanguard Diversified </em>v. <em>Review Co., </em>35 A D 2d 102; <em>People\u2019s Bank of City of N.

Given the proper standard for measuring plaintiff\u2019s performance of its obligations with respect to burning to be one of <em>\u201c </em>substantial performance \u201d, it was an error in reversing the trial court\u2019s finding that this standard had been satisfied. <em>(Amend </em>v. <em>Hurley, </em>293 N.

Where the right to renew a lease is made dependent upon compliance with certain conditions, lessee must prove full compliance with these conditions in order to exercise the option to renew. <em>(Farrell Lines </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>30 N Y 2d 76; <em>Isbrandtsen Co. </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>33 A D 2d 1018; <em>People\u2019s Bank of City of N.

The lessor may accept rent during the term of the lease without waiving its right to refuse acceptance of an attempted exercise of the option to renew for breaches committed during the tenancy. M.

The quality and quantity of proof submitted by the lessor sustains. its assertion that the lessee failed to fully and faithfully comply with its covenants under the lease. V. The lessor\u2019s insistence that Atkin\u2019s accept junk cars as agreed to in the lease does not constitute a waiver of its right to compel compliance with other conditions of the lease relating to the disposal of any junk cars delivered.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b465-4\">Stevens, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0Lm\">Atkin\u2019s Waste Materials, Inc. has conducted scrap processing operations at the same premises in the City of Rochester since 1942. In 1964, it obtained a lease which contained a condition that plaintiff obtain a variance to conduct its scrap processing operation. Plaintiff did obtain such a variance for the duration of the lease which, by its terms, incorporated by reference the provisions of the 1964 lease. Prior to the execution of the 1967 lease, which was a renewal of the 1964 lease, plaintiff\u2019s attorney received a letter from the City Manager of the City of Rochester, dated March 16, 1967, which advised the plaintiff that \u201c if the torch burning is done in accordance with present or future City Code provisions,\u201d minor and intermittent torch burning in gondola cars, such as was then taking place, might continue. Plaintiff was informed, however, \u201cif * * * such * * * burning violates the Code or produces a nuisance,\u201d the city would give notice of the violation and plaintiff would be compelled to cease such burning until it could comply with the code\u2019s restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Paragraph 14 of the lease provided that if a default occurred in the performance of any of its terms, due notice would be given plaintiff and a reasonable time afforded to correct the default. Paragraph 16 bound the plaintiff to accept delivery of automobile hulks and all kinds of metallic and/or ferrous scrap materials from the City of Rochester without charge. Under paragraph 24 plaintiff had an option to renew the lease <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>for an additional five-year period which would expire at midnight, November 30, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">On July 20, 1967, in the only notice of its kind, plaintiff was notified by letter that there were large open burnings which seemed to be a violation. At least some of that burning, according to plaintiff, was made necessary as a result of the condition of the scrap materials delivered to the plaintiff by the city. An order of the Department of Health, dated October 3, 1967, directed plaintiff to cease the open burning of the refuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">An inspection report by the Department of Buildings and Property Conservation, dated November 24, 1970, and mailed to plaintiff in a covering letter, dated December 29, 1970, found plaintiff\u2019s operation in \u201c substantial compliance \u201d. On December 30, 1970, plaintiff, by letter, elected to exercise its option to renew the lease. Plaintiff\u2019s junkyard operator\u2019s license was renewed August 10, 1971, to expire November 30, 1971, and a fire department inspection during the week of June 14, 1971, found the yard in \u201c good condition \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">The notice of renewal was rejected by the city by the passage of an ordinance, No. 71-212, on April 27, 1971. Defendant, by letter of April 30, 1971, notified plaintiff that its election to exercise the option was rejected because of \u201c failure to fully and faithfully perform each and every term, covenant and condition of the lease as is required in order for you to be entitled to a renewal.\u201d This letter did not particularize in what respect there was noncompliance and it could hardly be considered adequate notice so as to permit the plaintiff to correct the conditions complained of. If plaintiff were found in default, then, under paragraph 14 of the lease, he was entitled to reasonable notice of the conditions and a reasonable opportunity to cure the default. On November 5, 1971, plaintiff received the notice and order that the temporary variance granted January 16,1964 had expired, and any operations based on the 1964 variance would be illegal and must be terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">The trial court found that plaintiff timely exercised its option to renew. The exercise of an option by a tenant to extend a lease accomplishes not a new lease, but simply a prolongation of the original agreement, so that, in effect, the original lease became one for the entire term. <em>(Matter of Harvey Holding Corp. [Satter], </em>297 N. Y. 113, 118; <em>Gulf Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>Buram </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number><em>Realty Co., </em>11 N Y 2d 223, 226.) This would include the variance as one of the provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">Defendant continued to accept the rent which Avas paid monthly through November, 1971 Avith knowledge of the defaults, if such there were. When rent is accepted with knowledge of particular conduct which is claimed to be a default, the acceptance of such rent constitutes a waiver by the landlord of the default. <em>(Woollard </em>v. <em>Schaffer Stores Co., </em>272 N. Y. 304, 312; <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Harway, </em>56 N. Y. 337.) The acceptance of the rent is in effect an election by the landlord to continue the relationship of landlord and tenant. In its role as landlord here, the defendant city is acting in a proprietary and not in a governmental capacity. The lease is to be given a reasonable construction in light of that which the parties intended and that Avhich was sought to be achieved by the parties. (See <em>Farrell Lines </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>30 N Y 2d 76, 82.)</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Where the city, with knowledge that the condition of the scrap delivered to plaintiff by it accounted in some measure for the burning of which it complains, continued to deliver and to require plaintiff to accept such delivery in accordance with the terms of the lease, it may fairly be concluded that substantial compliance Avith the lease terms is what is required. The obligation to cure defaults upon reasonable notice given, remains an obligation of the tenancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Accordingly, the order appealed from should be reversed upon the judgment for plaintiff at Trial Term and such judgment reinstated Avith costs to appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b467-7\">Jasen, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"AjV\">I must dissent from the court\u2019s holding in this case. The lease between plaintiff and the city pro-Added that plaintiff would have the option to renew the lease for an additional five years, conditional upon the full and faithful performance of every term, covenant and condition of the lease. One condition of the lease was that plaintiff only engage in torch burning or burning in an incinerator. Yet, as the Appellate Division noted, there was substantial evidence that plaintiff regularly had open fires on his premises, usually in open gondola cars which had been purposely drenched Avith an inflammable liquid and set afire. This constituted a failure to comply with a specific condition of the lease and where <em>\u201c </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>right to renew a lease depends on the performance of definite conditions or covenants, the right cannot be exercised unless there is full compliance \u201d. <em>(Vanguard Diversified </em>v. <em>Review Co., </em>35 A D 2d 102, 104, citing <em>People\u2019s Bank of City of N. Y. </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>73 N. Y. 406, and <em>McIntosh </em>v. <em>Rector, Churchwardens &amp; Vestrymen of St. Philip\u2019s Church, </em>120 N. Y. 7.)</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">In my opinion, the issue of prior notice of default raised by the majority overlooks the difference between two distinct and separate provisions of the lease. Paragraph 14 of the lease gave the city the right to terminate the lease <em>at any time </em>upon default in performance by the plaintiff, provided the city first gave plaintiff notice of the default and opportunity to cure. However, paragraph 24 of the lease extended the right of option to the plaintiff to renew the lease for an additional term, conditioned on full compliance with the conditions and covenants of the lease. Paragraph 24 contains no notice provision, as does paragraph 14. Thus, compliance with the terms of the lease was the sole condition precedent to plaintiff\u2019s right to exercise the option and renew and since plaintiff did not satisfy that condition precedent, its right to renew the lease never came into being. (See <em>Farrell Lines </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>30 N Y 2d 76, 82.) It is true, as the majority points out, that in construing a contract the whole instrument should be considered to determine the intent of the parties. However, no court is warranted under the guise of interpretation to make a new contract for the parties so as to make it express the real intention of the parties if to do so would contradict the express language of the parties. <em>(Rodolitz </em>v. <em>Neptune Paper Prods., </em>22 N Y 2d 383; <em>Royce Furs </em>v. <em>Home Ins. Co., </em>30 A D 2d 238.) This court simply has no power to add a notice provision to paragraph 24 of the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">Nor did the city waive its right to reject plaintiff\u2019s attempted exercise of its option to renew by accepting rent during the term of the lease. The city accepted rent only until November, 1971, the month that the lease, without renewal, was due to expire, and thereafter refused all rent. \"While it is true that such an acceptance of rent, with knowledge of the default, constituted a waiver by the city of its right to terminate the lease prior to the expiration of the lease, it does not follow that the contractual condition \u2014 that plaintiff refrain from having open <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>fires on the premises \u2014 was rendered nugatory. All that was waived by the acceptance of rent with knowledge of the default was the right of the city to terminate the lease during the term of the lease. <em>(Woollard </em>v. <em>Schaffer Stores Co., </em>272 N. Y. 304, 313.)</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">In sum, the acceptance of rent with knowledge of the default during the term of the lease did not eliminate the need for compliance by the plaintiff with the conditions set forth in paragraph 24 of the lease in order to entitle the plaintiff to exercise the option to renew the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Accordingly, I would affirm the order appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Chief Judge Breitel and Judges Gabrielli, Jones, Wachtler and Rabin concur with Judge Stevens; Judge Jasen dissents and votes to affirm in a separate opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Order reversed, with costs, and judgment of Supreme Court, Monroe County, reinstated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
