In it, Harris challenges his conviction in the District of Minnesota for conspiracy to distribute 500 grams or more of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">He contends that (1) the district court had jurisdiction over his petition because both he and his custodian, the warden of his prison facility, are within the Northern District of Texas; (2) the requirements of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act violate the Suspension Clause and the Tenth Amendment and render the remedy under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 inadequate or ineffective; and (3) the Minnesota district court did not have jurisdiction to convict and sentence him because the Controlled Substances Act, as applied to his case, violates the Tenth Amendment and the Commerce Clause. We review the district court\u2019s dismissal of a \u00a7 2241 petition de novo. <em>Kinder v. Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 212 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\">A \u00a7 2241 petition and a \u00a7 2255 motion \u201care distinct mechanisms for seeking post-conviction relief.\u201d <em>Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 451 (5th Cir.2000). Section 2255 is the primary mechanism for collaterally attacking a federal sentence, and a \u00a7 2255 motion must be filed in the sentencing court. <em>Id. </em>Section 2241 is the proper procedural vehicle for challenging the manner in which a sentence is executed, and a \u00a7 2241 petition must be filed in the district of incarceration. <em>Id. \u201cA </em>section 2241 petition that seeks to challenge the validity of a federal sentence must either be dismissed or construed as a section 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 452.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-14\">Because the claims raised by Harris in his \u00a7 2241 petition attacked the validity of his Minnesota conviction and sentence, the district court did not err in its determination that the claims would be properly brought in a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Pack, </em>218 F.3d at 451. As Harris was sentenced in Minnesota, the district court correctly determined that it lacked jurisdiction to consider his petition as a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Ojo v. INS, </em>106 F.3d 680, 683 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-15\">A prisoner can attack the validity of his conviction in a \u00a7 2241 petition only if he can meet the requirements of the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e). <em>Kinder, </em>222 F.3d at 212. It is the petitioner\u2019s burden to show that the remedy under \u00a7 2255 would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d \u00a7 2255(e); <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 901 (5th Cir.2001). The petitioner must establish that his claim (1) \u201cis based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense\u201d and (2) \u201cwas foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904. Harris has failed to make the required showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-16\">To the extent that Harris argues that the dismissal of his \u00a7 2241 petition imper-missibly suspends the writ of habeas cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>pus, his contention lacks merit. We have held that the restrictions on obtaining relief pursuant to \u00a7 2241 and the savings clause of \u00a7 2255 do not violate the Suspension Clause. <em>See Wesson v. United States Penitentiary Beaumont, TX, </em>305 F.3d 343, 347 (5th Cir.2002); <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 901 n. 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b927-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
