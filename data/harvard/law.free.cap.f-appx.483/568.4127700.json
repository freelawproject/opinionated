(\u201cCountrywide\u201d), on all of Silver\u2019s claims. Silver also appeals the district court\u2019s (1) denial of Silver\u2019s motion for sanctions and inference of spoliation of evidence, (2) denial of Silver\u2019s motion to amend the complaint and the motion for relief from the denial, (3) grant of Countrywide\u2019s motion to strike Silver\u2019s demand for a jury trial, and (4) denial of Silver\u2019s motion for the district court to recuse itself. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>the grant of summary judgment, taking all justifiable inferences in Silver\u2019s favor. <em>Bozeman v. Orum, </em>422 F.3d 1265, 1267 (11th Cir.2005). The district court granted summary judgment to Countrywide on the following issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-11\">a. <em>Fraud</em></p>\n<p id=\"b590-12\">Silver argues that there is a genuine dispute of material fact on her claim for fraud because Countrywide steered her into a riskier mortgage and did not inform her of the mortgage\u2019s provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-15\">\u201cA party normally is bound by a contract that the party signs unless the party can demonstrate that he or she was prevented from reading it or induced by the other party to refrain from reading it.\u201d <em>Consol. Res. Healthcare Fund I, Ltd. v. Fenelus, </em>853 So.2d 500, 504 (Fla.Dist.Ct. App.2003). It is undisputed that Silver signed all of the agreements that disclosed the terms of her mortgage, even though she was told not to sign any document that she did not understand. Additionally, she could not reasonably be deceived by any oral statements that were at variance with written terms to which she agreed. <em>Hill-crest Pac. Corp. v. Yamamura, </em>727 So.2d 1053, 1056 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1999) (\u201cA party cannot recover in fraud for alleged oral misrepresentations that are adequately covered or expressly contradicted in a later written contract.\u201d). We therefore agree with the district court that Silver\u2019s fraud claim fails as a matter of law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-16\">b. <em>Breach of Contract/Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b590-17\">Silver seems to contend that Countrywide breached the Forbearance Agreement by not upholding its promise to help her refinance her mortgage and by improperly imposing late penalties and reporting her to credit bureaus.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-18\">A breach of the covenant of good faith must be based upon the failed performance of an express term of the contract. <em>Snow v. Ruden, McClosky, Smith, Schuster &amp; Russell, P.A., </em>896 So.2d 787, 792 (Fla.Dist. Ct.App.2005) (\u201cThere can be no cause of action for a breach of the implied covenant absent an allegation that an express term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>of the contract has been breached.\u201d) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">In this case, there is no provision in the mortgage agreement \u2014 nor any other agreement that Silver has produced \u2014 requiring Countrywide to help refinance Silver\u2019s mortgage. The Forbearance Agreement states that Countrywide will have \u201csole and absolute discretion\u201d either to (1) require Silver to recommence regular payments, (2) reinstate the loan in full, or (3) modify the loan or offer other loan assistance. It is undisputed that on March 4, 2009, Countrywide informed her that the modification had been denied. There is no provision requiring that Countrywide seek financial information from Silver before making that decision. Silver has not shown that Countrywide failed to act in good faith with respect to any express term of any contract, and thus this portion of her argument fails as a matter of law. Id<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">With respect to Silver\u2019s argument that Countrywide breached the Forbearance Agreement by imposing a late penalty and reporting her to credit bureaus, she did not provide this Court \u2014 or the district court \u2014 with citations to the record to support these factual assertions, nor is it clear that her complaint properly raised these issues. <em>See Nat\u2019l Alliance for the Mentally Ill v. Bd. of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs, </em>376 F.3d 1292, 1295-96 (11th Cir.2004) (holding that, in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(a)(9)(A), failure to include \u201ccitations to the ... parts of the record on which the appellant relies\u201d may result in waiver). Accordingly, we affirm the district court on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">c. <em>FDUTPA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b591-11\">Silver claims that Countrywide\u2019s behavior implicates the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act, which declares that \u201cunfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce\u201d are unlawful. Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 501.204(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-12\">Deception occurs \u201cif there is a representation, omission, or practice that is likely to mislead the consumer acting reasonably in the circumstances, to the consumer\u2019s detriment. This standard requires a showing of probable, not possible, deception that is likely to cause injury to a reasonable relying consumer.\u201d <em>Zlotnick v. Premier Sales Grp., Inc., </em>480 F.3d 1281, 1284 (11th Cir.2007) (citation and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-13\">With respect to the initial mortgage agreements, Silver conceded that she was told not to sign any documents that she did not understand. With respect to the failure to refinance her mortgage, the Forbearance Agreement of December 2, 2008, explicitly said that Countrywide possessed \u201csole and absolute discretion\u201d to \u201cdetermine whether additional payment assistance can be offered.\u201d Countrywide always had the right to refuse to refinance the loan. We agree with the district court that this conduct does not run afoul of the FDUTPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-14\">d. <em>Other Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b591-15\">In her initial brief, Silver failed to properly raise an argument on her claims of breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, and violation of the Florida RICO statute. These issues are waived. <em>United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1284 n. 8 (11th Cir.2003) (\u201c[A] party seeking to raise a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>claim or issue on appeal must plainly and prominently so indicate. Otherwise, the issue \u2014 even if properly preserved at trial \u2014 -will be considered abandoned.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The following issues are reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Eli Lilly &amp; Co. v. Air Express Int\u2019l USA Inc., </em>615 F.3d 1305, 1313 (11th Cir.2010) (sanctions and spoliation); <em>Mann v. Taser Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>588 F.3d 1291, 1312 (11th Cir.2009) (motion to amend); <em>Murray v. Scott, </em>253 F.3d 1308, 1310 (11th Cir.2001) (recusal).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">a. <em>Sanctions &amp; Spoliation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">Silver contends that the district court abused its discretion by not imposing sanctions and by not finding an inference of spoliation against Countrywide for failing to turn over emails relevant to the case and for failing to have a proper litigation hold placed on Silver\u2019s file.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">\u201cIn the Eleventh Circuit, an adverse inference is drawn from a party\u2019s failure to preserve evidence only when the absence of that evidence is predicated on bad faith. While this circuit does not require a showing of malice in order to find bad faith, mere negligence in losing or destroying records is not sufficient to draw an adverse inference.\u201d <em>Mann, </em>588 F.3d at 1310 (citation and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">On September 23, 2010, Countrywide\u2019s counsel informed the magistrate that there had been a diligent search for all relevant emails and that none had been found because there was no formal retention policy. However, counsel also stated that she was currently working with Countrywide to ensure that there really was no possible way to recover any old emails. The magistrate ordered Countrywide to file an affidavit explaining what had been done to find the emails, what the company\u2019s retention policy was, and what notice had been sent to Countrywide employees regarding the retention of documents relevant to Silver\u2019s case. On October 11, 2010, Countrywide submitted the affidavit of Barbara Travis,. who is a litigation specialist at Countrywide Home Loans Servicing, stating that she had requested the office of the president, as well as the vice presidents of several departments, to search for relevant emails, but none had been uncovered. The vice president of the IT department was also in the process of searching for the emails but had informed Travis that Countrywide had a ninety-day email retention policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-11\">Travis was deposed on December 10, 2010. She testified that Countrywide actually had an email \u2018deletion policy,\u2019 which stated that employees could delete emails whenever they wanted, but all emails older than ninety days would be automatically deleted forever. However, Travis had recently been informed by the IT department that certain \u201cjournaled\u201d employees had their old emails automatically archived on a third party\u2019s back-up servers. No employee knew whether he or she was a \u201cjournaled\u201d employee. Travis testified that, after the magistrate\u2019s September 23 order, the IT department began searching these back-up servers for \u201cjournaled\u201d employees\u2019 old emails. At the time of Travis\u2019s deposition, the search was still ongoing but had already uncovered several emails relevant to Silver\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-12\">Travis also testified that in May 2009, a litigation hold was placed on Silver\u2019s file. Travis\u2019s testimony on this subject consisted mostly of her indicating that she was not involved in deciding whether to put a litigation hold on a file nor whether any actions should be taken in terms of pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>serving documents that might be relevant to the file.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">We find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s decision not to impose sanctions and not to find an inference of spoliation. With respect to the emails on back-up servers, Silver makes much of the fact that Travis\u2019s affidavit conflicts with her later deposition testimony. However, her initial lack of knowledge about the pseudo-secret archival of \u201cjournaled\u201d employees\u2019 emails is properly characterized as carelessness at most. <em>See Mann, </em>588 F.3d at 1310 (holding that \u201can adverse inference is drawn from a party\u2019s failure to preserve evidence only when the absence of that evidence is predicated on bad faith\u201d). Also, Travis\u2019s testimony indicated that there were actually more emails than originally believed and that Countrywide was working to continue searching the back-up servers. If Countrywide were acting in bad faith, it seems unlikely that it would reveal that its search of back-up servers had uncovered relevant emails.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">As for the litigation hold policy, Silver\u2019s argument of bad faith relies exclusively upon Travis\u2019s testimony. Silver claims that Travis\u2019s testimony shows that Countrywide had no real litigation hold process. However, Travis testified that a special notation was placed on files that are put on litigation hold. The remainder of Travis\u2019s pertinent testimony is to the effect that she was not personally involved in the decision to place a file on litigation hold, nor was she involved in any decisions to preserve relevant documents. This evidence is insufficient to show that the district court abused its discretion by failing to impose sanctions or find an inference of spoliation. Accordingly, we find no error in the district court\u2019s decision on these issues. <em>See Eli Lilly, </em>615 F.3d at 1313.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">b. <em>Motion to Amend and Motion for Relief</em></p>\n<p id=\"b593-11\">Silver argues that the district court abused its discretion by denying Silver\u2019s motion to amend the complaint and for denying her motion for relief. Silver sought to add new factual details and two new claims against Countrywide. This motion to amend was filed fourteen months after the case was initially removed to the district court. The factual changes that she sought to make to the complaint were mostly minor and certainly not critical to her case, and her new claims against Countrywide would have required the district court to completely abandon its case management plan. Under these facts, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s decision to deny the motion to amend and the motion for relief. <em>See Hearn v. McKay, </em>603 F.3d 897, 899 n. 1 (11th Cir.2010) (\u201cWe cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion in declining to allow Plaintiffs to amend the complaint after the pretrial order\u2019s deadline for amendment had passed.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-12\">c. <em>Motion to Recuse</em></p>\n<p id=\"b593-13\">Silver argues that the district court should have recused itself because the court\u2019s spouse is a partner at a law firm that represents another law firm that represents Bank of America, which owns Countrywide. We do not believe that these facts raise a doubt about the district judge\u2019s impartiality, and accordingly we find no error. <em>See Christo v. Padgett, </em>223 F.3d 1324, 1333 (11th Cir.2000).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b590-13\">. For these same reasons, Silver's conspiracy to defraud claim also fails.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b591-7\">. To the extent that Silver argues that Countrywide breached its duty of good faith with respect to her initial mortgage contract, she has failed to identify any express provision from that contract that Countrywide failed to perform in good faith, and thus we find the argument without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b593-7\">. Because we conclude that the district court properly granted summary judgment to Countrywide on all claims, Silver\u2019s argument that the district court erred by striking her demand for a jury trial is rendered moot, and therefore we do not address it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b594-4\">. Silver\u2019s request for oral argument is DENIED.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
