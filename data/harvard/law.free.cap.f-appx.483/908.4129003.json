Binford sued Kathryn Marteeny, the attorney who represented Binford\u2019s ex-wife during their divorce proceeding, alleging that a letter Marteeny wrote to the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles (the Board) contained false accusations about him and caused the Board to deny his release on parole. The district court dismissed Binford\u2019s action as frivolous, citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l), because Mar-teeny was a private actor not liable under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>A prisoner\u2019s civil rights complaint is subject to dismissal if it is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. \u00a7 1915A(b)(1). We review the dismissal of a complaint under \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) de novo. <em>See Green v. Atkinson, </em>623 F.3d 278, 279 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">Binford argues that Marteeny acted under color of state law by proxy. He contends that she sent the letter so that the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) and the Board would subject Bin-ford to cruel and unusual punishment, including the denial of release on parole. Binford\u2019s conclusory and speculative allegations regarding Marteeny\u2019s sending of the letter, the letter itself, and the letter\u2019s impact on either the TDCJ or the Board are insufficient to establish that Marteeny\u2019s conduct \u2014 sending the letter \u2014 is fairly attributable to the State under any of the Supreme Court\u2019s tests. <em>See Priester v. Lowndes County, </em>354 F.3d 414, 420 (5th Cir.2004); <em>Cornish v. Corr. Servs. Corp., </em>402 F.3d 545, 549-51 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, the district court did not err when it dismissed as frivolous Binford\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint against Marteeny.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">Binford\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Binford is cautioned that the dismissal of his \u00a7 1983 complaint by the district court pursuant to \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) and our dismissal of this appeal as frivolous pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 42.2 both count as strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir. 1996). Binford is also cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b928-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
