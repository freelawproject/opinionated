The recent decision in Ehlert v. United States, 402 U.S. 99, 91 S.Ct. 1319, 28 L.Ed.2d 625 (1971) is dispositive of this claim. There the Supreme Court held under current interpretation of the applicable statutes and regulations a registrant\u2019s local board is not required to consider 1-0 reclassification after the mailing of the induction order to him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">We see no merit in Bush\u2019s constitutional assertions that the Regulation (32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.2) discriminates against or denies equal protection to him. We discern no convincing reason why the timeliness rule for the presentation of claims to exemption from service is unreasonable or irrational or works any deprivation of statutory rights or that he was subjected to combatant training or service until his claim was acted on. See <em>Ehlert, </em>supra, at pages 101, 102, and 103, 91 S.Ct. 1319.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-16\">Bush urges that the local board did not make the sort of fact-finding statement as required in post induction cases. United States v. Broyles, 423 F.2d 1299 (4th Cir. 1970). The board might have specifically stated that his claim was filed after the mailing of the induction order and, thus, that it was foreclosed by 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.2(b) in-, stead of the eonclusory paraphrase of the statute that, \u201cWe did not find that there has been a change in your status resulting from circumstances over which you had no control.\u201d Nevertheless, the lateness of the claim provided a basis in fact for the board\u2019s denial of a reopening, and since no one could have been misled, the general language suffices.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-17\">We find no substance in Bush\u2019s assertions that (1) the local board misled him in giving him the SSS Form 150, and (2) his conviction may have rested upon the trial court\u2019s presumption that he lied. The facts are unassailable. Bush filed his request for reclassification after the induction order had been issued. Guided by <em>Ehlert, </em>supra, we held in United States v. Collins, 445 F.2d 653 (4th Cir.,..1971) that \u201cThe failure of the defendant's local board to reopen his classification after he was ordered to report, therefore, is unavailable as a defense to a prosecution for refusing induction.\u201d See also Grosfeld v. Morris, 448 F.2d 1004 (4th Cir., 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-18\">Dispensing with oral argument, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b365-10\">. Section 1625.2 of the Selective Service Regulations, 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.2 (1971) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-13\">\u201c * * * [T]he classification of a registrant shall not be reopened after the local board has mailed to such registrant an Order for Induction * * * unless the local board specifically finds there lias been a change in the registrant\u2019s status resulting from circumstances over which the registrant had no control.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
