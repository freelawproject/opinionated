The central point in issue is the manner in which the value of the land\u2019s cotton allotment was determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-15\">Pursuant to Congressional action authorizing construction of the Painted Rock Dam and Reservoir, (See, Pub.L. 81-516, 64 Stat. 163), a flood control project in the Citrus Valley of the Gila River Basin in Maricopa County, Arizona, the United States, in 1959, brought a condemnation action to acquire the land of appellee Wesson. The said land contained 1285.20 acres, including 295.6 acres which had been allotted for growing cotton. The balance of the good farmland was used for growing grain and cover crops, e. g., barley, silage, Bermuda grass and Sudan grass, for the feeding of cattle. At the time of the condemnation suit there were 700 to 800 head of cattle on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-16\">The formula used to calculate Wesson\u2019s condemnation awarded was the one previously approved by this court in United States v. Citrus Valley Farms, Inc., 350 F.2d 683 (9th Cir. 1965); First, the land was valued with the cotton allotment included. From this was deducted the value, if any, of Wesson\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>right under 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1378(a) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to transfer his cotton allotment to other land owned by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">At the trial there was the usual spread between the testimony of the government\u2019s expert witness and that of the landowner and his witnesses with respect to the value of the land as enhanced by the cotton allotment. Appel-lee Wesson estimated the value of his property with the cotton allotment to be $730,968. A neighboring cotton farmer placed the value at $700,000. A real estate appraiser valued Wesson\u2019s land at $616,900. The government appraisers believed that the land with the allotment was worth, respectively, $425,000 and $440,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">With regard to the right under Section 1378 to remove the allotment of 295.6 acres, a government appraiser expressed the view that such a right was worth $90,000 to $94,000. The real estate appraiser called by the appellee estimated the right\u2019s value to be $31,000. Wesson\u2019s cotton farming neighbor was unimpressed with the argument that the right <em>did </em>have value. In his view, the Section 1378 right was worth \u201cvery, very little money.\u201d Wesson and James Carter, a research coordinator for the Arizona Cotton Growers Association and formerly a Maricopa County Agricultural agent for the University of Arizona, agreed with this assessment, stating that the allotment was intrinsically without value.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">The triers of fact sided with appellee Wesson: the jury valued the 1285.20 acres at $620,000 and the allotment right under 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1378(a) to be $1.-00. Pursuant to the <em>Citrus Valley </em>formula, appellee Wesson was awarded a special verdict of $619,999.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">In 1961 Wesson purchased 800 acres of land near the Wellton-Mohawk Irrigation Project; the following year he purchased an additional 80 acres. Wesson\u2019s decision to purchase said lands was principally due to the water supply which was comparable in price and quality to that of his condemned farm. It was on these lands that Wesson exercised his right under Section 1378 and transferred his cotton allotment.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-11\">From 1961 to 1963, Wesson leased the Wellton-Mohawk property to one Pew. During this period, Pew raised Delta Pine cotton on Wesson's land. (Wesson had raised Acala cotton on his condemned farm.) Although Pew was able to increase his yield from 1.5 bales per acre in 1961 to 2.4 bales per acre in 1963, he was still unable to show a profit as a cotton farmer. Pew\u2019s inability to make a profit was attributable to rising production costs and to dropping price supports for cotton.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-12\">At the trial, the government sought to introduce evidence showing that Wesson had purchased the Wellton-Mohawk property for $431,773 and had sold it in 1965 for $950,000. The trial court thwarted the government\u2019s effort, noting \u201cthat the period is too remote from the date of taking to determine the value of the cotton allotment at that time, and there are too many variables with re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>spect to the value of the property in 1965 * * * to allow that evidence to come in to show the value of the cotton allotment that was transferred.\u201d On appeal the government maintains that the trial court\u2019s ruling deprived it \u201cof the best and most logical evidence of the value of the \u00a7 1378(a) right. In short, the government asserts that Wesson was the recipient of a windfall because by \u201cignoring the actual subsequent transaction involving this allotment\u201d it was \u201cimpossible to arrive at a realistic just compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">In support of its position, the government has placed primary reliance upon United States v. Brooklyn Union Gas Co., 168 F.2d 391 (2d Cir. 1948). There, the government condemned certain facilities of two public utility companies. At the hearing to determine the amount of compensation to be paid the companies, the district court refused (on the ground of \u201cirrelevancy\u201d) to consider evidence offered by the United States that the utilities had, in fact, incurred no loss as a result of the government\u2019s taking. On appeal, the Second Circuit deemed, in effect, the trial court\u2019s refusal a misguided avoidance of reality:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFIh\"><em>\u201c * </em>* * the value at the time of taking must be developed, in default of a sale price, largely from a consideration of past earnings and such showing of prospective earning power as can be made. * * * It would seem an eerie conclusion that a court must resort to guess, closing its eyes to reality, when its decision must ae-tually be formulated after the true facts have become available. We think the evidence admissible not as a standard of value in itself, but for its bearing upon the prospective values at the time of taking. After all, the nature of the improvement was not shrouded in mystery. There were clear grounds for expecting some development of the kind that actually happened, and evidence of such actual happening is useful to support or check the assumed prospects.\u201d 168 F.2d at 397.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-11\">The situation present in United States v. Brooklyn Union Gas Co., supra, is hardly analogous to the matter now in controversy. In the former case, the government\u2019s assertion that the utility companies suffered no ill economic effects from the acts of condemnation was supported by an offer of proof laden with specific factual allegations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> By contrast, in the instant case, the government\u2019s offer of proof was limited to showing that Wesson had sold his Well-ton-Mohawk property at a considerable profit. It is noteworthy that the government did not then, nor does so now, specifically attribute this considerable profit to Wesson\u2019s cotton allotment right under 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1378(a). The government\u2019s reluctance to credit Wesson\u2019s cotton allotment right with being the factor responsible for the sizeable profit made by Wesson is understandable given the evidence which <em>was </em>introduced at trial: it is clear from the record that cotton farming in the sixties had ceased to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>the profitable enterprise it had been in the fifties. No doubt indicative of this economic decline is the unexplained absence in the government\u2019s offer of proof of a comparison in value of cotton-land to non-cotton-land in the Wellton-Mo-hawk area. In short, here, unlike in United States v. Brooklyn Union Gas Co., supra, the government failed to make known to the court \u201cthe true facts (which had) become available.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Because of the incomplete nature of the government\u2019s offer of proof, it is clear that the trial court did not err when it rejected its introduction into evidence. California Gas Producers Association v. Federal Power Commission, 383 F.2d 645 (9th Cir. 1967) ; Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity v. Bank of Commerce, 170 F.2d 94 (5th Cir. 1948); St. Joe Paper Co. v. United States, 155 F.2d 93 (5th Cir. 1946). Indeed, the rationale employed by the trial court has been invoked by another district judge in a somewhat analogous situation. In duPont v. United States, 293 F.Supp. 1325 (D.Del.1968), plaintiffs, whose ocean front property had sustained considerable damage as a result of a storm in 1962, sought to recover income taxes paid upon disallowance of a casualty loss deduction. It was estimated that the pre and post storm values of said property was $305,000 and $210,000, respectively. In 1965 plaintiffs had contracted to sell said property for $375,000. Before this sale, plaintiffs\u2019 property and that of other landowners in the vicinity had experienced a steady increase in value. The court ruled as inadmissible the sale price of plaintiffs\u2019 1965 agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-5\">\u201cA number of the factors which gave rise to this increase in land values probably could not have been foreseen by a knowledgeable seller or buyer immediately after the storm in 1962.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-6\">\u2022x- * * The remoteness of the date of sale from the date of the storm, coupled with the intervening change in land values because of reasons which a knowledgeable seller and a knowledgeable buyer could not probably have foreseen, makes the 1965 sale irrelevant.\u201d 293 F.Supp. at 1328.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">Here, the increase in value of appellant\u2019s Wellton-Mohawk property is in large part attributable to the extensive \u201cworking of the land\u201d program instituted during Wesson\u2019s term of ownership. Although Wesson was able to transform desert land into fertile soil, his lessee was unable to overcome the ill state of cotton farming and make tilling <em>this </em>crop a successful enterprise. Nevertheless, it is clear that because of its newly developed fertility this land had considerable value to a produce farmer or cattle rancher. In short, the record adduced at trial strongly suggests that the increased value of Wesson\u2019s Well-ton-Mohawk property was in no way owed to the allotment right held under Section 1378(a). Accordingly, it cannot be said that the trial court erred in not permitting the government to support the offer of proof now in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">Finally, the evidence established at trial demonstrates the wisdom of the condemnation formula adopted by this court in United States v. Citrus Valley Farms, Inc., supra. The instant record sets forth the monumental task (from both agricultural and economic standpoints) of transmuting raw desert land into a <em>productive </em>cotton farm. Indeed, the difficulties encountered by Wesson and his lessee, the most notable being leaching, underscores the validity of our holding in <em>Citrus Valley </em>that the right under Section 1378(a) does not, ipso facto, augment the value of land:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-10\">\u201cA cotton allotment severed from the farm which has earned it no longer represents proven productive merit and the ability to produce profitably. When attached to new land it does not automatically enhance that land to the extent of the value of the cotton-land characteristics of the land from which it was severed. Attached to new land it represents only its license-to-produce aspect. It proves nothing as to the productive ability of the land, for the new land did not create the history <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>upon which the allotment was founded.\u201d 350 F.2d at 686.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b334-7\">. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1378(a) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-8\">\u201c(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the allotment determined for any commodity for any land from which the owner is displaced because of acquisition of the land for any purpose, other than for the continued production of allotted crops, by any Federal, State, or other agency having the right of eminent domain shall be placed in an allotment pool and shall be available only for use in providing allotments for other farms owned by the owner so displaced. Upon application to the county committee, within three years after the date of such displacement, or three years after the enactment of this section, whichever period is longer, any owner so displaced shall be entitled to have established for other farms owned by him allotments which are comparable with allotments determined for other farms in the same area which are similar except for the past acreage of the commodity, taking into consideration the land, labor, and equipment available for the production of the commodity, crop-rotation practices, and the soil and other physical factors affecting the production of the commodity: * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b335-7\">. In United States v. Brooklyn Union <em>Gas </em>Co., supra, the government made the following offer of proof:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-8\">\u201c \u2018These claimants are not entitled to any compensation for the taking of these properties, because the land which was condemned, some 70 acres or more, was added to the Navy Yard; upon that addition new buildings were erected, and new subsurface pipes, conduits and connections were laid by the Government to effect' exterior connection with the mains of the Gas Company near the boundaries of the enlarged Yard, and similar connections were made to sources of electric energy owned and operated by the Edison Company; more gas and electricity were consumed in the new buildings and structures during the years 1942-1946 than had been sold to private consumers under the conditions existing at the respective dates of taking (April 1, 1941, and September 19, 1941). That beneficial result, it is argued, more than compensates the claimants for any loss sustained through the takings in question, and hence no award to either is legally possible.\u2019 \u201d 168 F.2d at 397, quoting from the District Court\u2019s opinion cited as United States v. 25.4 Acres of Band, 71 F.Supp. 248, 250 (E.D.N.Y.1947).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b337-6\">CHAMBERS, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Agr\">(concurring) :</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">To me, the evidence about the cost and sale of Wesson\u2019s new land was properly-excluded.
