Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., 5 Cir. 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b377-33\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b377-34\">Trosper appeals from a judgment entered upon a jury conviction for receiving property knowing it to have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>stolen from the Veterans Administration Hospital, Lake City, Florida, in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 641. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Only several of the numerous errors urged on appeal require comment. Defendant initially argues that the trial judge erroneously denied his motion for acquittal based on insufficiency of the evidence. Taking the view most favorable to the Government, Glasser v. United States, 1942, 315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680, we find that substantial evidence exists to support the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty. United States v. Hill, 5 Cir. 1971, 442 F.2d 259; United States v. Reid, 5 Cir. 1971, 441 F.2d 1089; United States v. Warner, 5 Cir. 1971, 441 F.2d 821; United States v. Andrews, 5 Cir. 1970, 431 F.2d 952.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">During trial the following colloquy occurred between the prosecutor and Government witness Patterson, a detective with the Jacksonville Sheriff\u2019s Office:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-6\">Q. All right, sir. What, if anything, did [defendant] state, regarding the [property] \u2014 when did the conversation take place?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-7\">A. It was several months after October the 24th, 1969.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-8\">Q. And where did the conversation take place?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-9\">A. Inside the Duval County Jail, where he was at.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-10\">Q. Did you initiate the conversation, or did he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-11\">A. No, sir; he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-12\">Q. What did he tell you, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-13\">A. He had sent for me on several occasions-\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-15\">Your Honor, I object to that as being irrelevant, immaterial and improper foundation for that particular question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-16\">THE COURT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-17\">Objection overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-18\">BY [PROSECUTOR]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-19\">Q. You may answer, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-20\">A. He had asked to see me on several occasions; and on these particular occasions, I had not been able to get over to see Mr. Trosper. So on one occasion, I happened to be inside the jail and ran into Mr. Trosper, who was on the main floor of the jail; and he asked me, would I talk to Judge Grain-ger about getting his sentence cut, <em>so that he could go ahead and get his Federal time over with, </em>and get all straightened up. (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJT\">At this point defense counsel made an objection to the italicized portion of the witness\u2019 answer, which was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-21\">It is clear that the witness\u2019 answer was responsive to the last question asked by the prosecutor: \u201cWhat did he tell you, sir?\u201d Moreover, unlike the testimony in United States v. Poston, 6 Cir. 1970, 430 F.2d 706, the statement here related to the offense for which defendant was charged. Finally, it is well settled that an unsolicited remark by a defendant, not in response to any interrogation, does not fall within the rule of Miranda v. Arizona, 1966, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694. The trial court correctly ruled that the witness\u2019 statement was admissible in evidence. United States v. Powers, 5 Cir. 1971, 444 F.2d 260.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-22\">Defendant\u2019s next contention that the Government knowingly used perjured testimony gives us little pause. There is not a shred of evidence to support this argument. Jackson v. United States, 5 Cir. 1967, 384 F.2d 375.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-23\">Finally, we have carefully considered the attack upon the trial court\u2019s supplemental charge and find the charge to be without error. Trosper\u2019s other points on appeal are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-24\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
