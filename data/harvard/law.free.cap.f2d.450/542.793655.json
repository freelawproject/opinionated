In addition, the parties have locked horns over a number of subsidiary issues relating to the procedure followed in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">Charles Kinnard Brown, known throughout these proceedings as Charles Kinnard (or simply \u201cKinnard\u201d), worked for a number of years at a service station near Utica, Mississippi, owned by Hubbard Butane Company. Hubbard Butane was, in turn, owned by Charles Hubbard; the service station and Hubbard Butane itself were run by Charles Hubbard and his son-in-law, Richard Partridge. Hubbard Butane allowed Kinnard to. use company vehicles for the purpose of travelling to and from his place of employment to his home. There was evidence, not seriously controverted, that Hubbard and Partridge had instructed Kinnard and other employees given similar privileges that they were not to use company vehicles for any purpose other than travelling to and from work.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">The record shows that on the evening of June 16, 1967, a Friday, at about 6:00 p. m., Partridge reminded Kinnard as he was leaving work in a company station wagon to use that vehicle only to travel home and not for any other purpose. Kinnard, however, drove instead to a girl friend\u2019s home in Hickstown, a nearby community. Kinnard spent the night in Hickstown, and the following morning, Saturday, June 17, 1967, while en route to his home, Kinnard was in an automobile accident with Willie Martin and Mrs. Alma Martin. Both the Martins sustained serious injuries in the crash. Mr. and Mrs. Martin sued Kin-nard in the Mississippi state court, and received judgments in their favor for $100,000 and $75,000 respectively. The Mississippi Supreme Court affirmed these judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-11\">Prior to June 17, 1967, The Travelers Indemnity Company (\u201cTravelers\u201d) had issued to Hubbard Butane Company a comprehensive general liability policy, including automobile liability insurance, which was in effect on the day of Kin-nard\u2019s accident. This policy provided limits of $50,000 for a single claim and $100,000 for multiple claims. It was a standard policy containing an \u201comnibus clause,\u201d providing that in addition to the named insured the policy also insured \u201cany other person while using an automobile * * * with the permission of the insured provided his actual operation thereof is within the scope of such permission. * * * \u201d The policy also contained the standard provision requiring that any insured cooperate with the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-13\">Travelers hired an attorney to represent Kinnard in the state court proceedings, but it did so under a non-waiver agreement reserving the insurer\u2019s right to deny that Kinnard was covered by the omnibus clause of the Hubbard policy. When the Martins, as judgment creditors, filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi demanding payment of the state court judgments by Travelers under the Hubbard liability insurance policy, Travelers did deny that Kinnard was its insured. After all the evidence was in, the district court turned down Travelers\u2019 motion for a directed verdict and allowed the jury to decide whether, under the applicable Mississippi law, Kinnard was Travelers\u2019 insured. The jury returned a verdict favorable to the Martins, finding coverage, and Travelers moved for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>judgment n. o. v. That motion was denied, and on this appeal Travelers now asks us to rule that the jury verdict should not have been allowed to stand, since there was insufficient evidence to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">I. <em>Kinnard\u2019s Coverage.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">A. We turn to the central issue in the case: Did the district court err in allowing the jury to decide whether Kin-nard operated the Hubbard vehicle \u201cwithin the scope of the permission\u201d granted him by Hubbard? If the issue was properly submitted to the jury, then its finding that Kinnard may claim the protection of Hubbard\u2019s automobile insurance must stand. If, however, the trial judge erred in allowing the jury to determine the scope of Hubbard\u2019s permission to Kinnard, then Travelers\u2019 appeal must be sustained and Kinnard must satisfy the state court judgment against him as best he can.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">In this Circuit, at least, it is proper to grant motions for a directed verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict only \u201c[i] f the facts and inferences point so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of one party that the Court believes that reasonable men could not arrive at a contrary verdict.\u201d Boeing Co. v. Shipman, 5 Cir. 1969, 411 F.2d 365, 374. In <em>Boeing </em>we noted that \u201cit is the function of the jury as the traditional finder of the facts, and not the Court, to weigh conflicting evidence and inferences, and determine the credibility of witnesses.\u201d 411 F.2d at 375.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">With this federal rule of judge and jury in the background, our role in this diversity appeal is a limited one. We must ascertain as best we can the present law of Mississippi, and then decide whether that law was applied correctly below. Mindful of that role, we affirm the submission to the jury of the issue of Kinnard\u2019s coverage under the Travelers policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-12\">Only three years ago, the Supreme Court of Mississippi considered at some length the test it would apply to determine whether an automobile was driven within the scope of the permission of the named insured, so as to entitle the driver to claim the protection of the \u201comnibus\u201d clause of the named insured\u2019s policy. Travelers Indemnity Company v. Watkins, 209 So.2d 630 (1968). The court rejected \u201cstrict\u201d construction of the omnibus clause, requiring affirmative proof that the use at the time when the claim arose was specifically within the scope of the named insured\u2019s permission. At the same time the court refused to adopt the \u201cliberal\u201d approach under which the original loan by the owner is held to permit all uses by the borrowing driver. Instead, the Mississippi Supreme Court embraced the intermediate or \u201cminor deviation\u201d rule, which provides protection for the borrowing driver unless his operation of the vehicle at the time and place of the accident is either specifically prohibited<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or amounts to a gross deviation from the time, place, and nature of use expressed in the owner\u2019s permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-13\">Our first inquiry, then, is whether reasonable men might have decided that Kinnard was not specifically prohibited from operating the Hubbard vehicle as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>he did at the time of the accident. Unfortunately, the <em>Watkins </em>decision fails to make clear exactly what the Mississippi Supreme Court meant by \u201cspecifically prohibited.\u201d In order to evaluate Travelers\u2019 contention, we must therefore determine the meaning of \u201cspecifically prohibited\u201d from the facts of the <em>Watkins </em>case itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">In <em>Watkins, </em>an employee was granted use of his employer\u2019s truck for a personal errand on Saturday afternoon. When the employee asked his supervisor if he should return the truck to the employer when he had completed his personal business, the supervisor replied, \u201cNo, leave it at home, leave it in the yard there and bring it back Monday morning.\u201d The accident occurred when the employee used the truck to pick up his wife on Sunday at a neighbor\u2019s house. On these facts the Mississippi Supreme Court concluded that there was no \u201cpositive, express prohibition against using the truck on Sunday.\u201d Travelers argues that here, unlike <em>Watkins, </em>Kinnard was specifically prohibited from using the borrowed vehicle as he did at the time of the accident. The company points to Hubbard\u2019s instructions that Kinnard use the vehicle only for travel to and from work, not for \u201crunning all around the countryside.\u201d In other words, here the lender did tell Kinnard <em>not </em>to use the station wagon except to go to and from work. In Travelers\u2019 view, Hubbard\u2019s negative imperative converted his instructions to Kinnard into the \u201cpositive, express prohibition\u201d found wanting in <em>Watkins.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">We think not. In <em>Watkins, </em>the lender gave the borrower specific instructions to leave the car in his yard over the weekend. The obvious implication of this instruction was the negative command <em>not </em>to use the borrowed vehicle during the same span of time \u2014 from Friday to Monday morning. We find it difficult to believe that the Mississippi Supreme Court intended to have the <em>Watkins </em>case turn on the distinction between ordering the borrower affirmatively to dispose of the borrowed vehicle (by leaving it in the yard) and an alternative phraseology in the negative \u2014 for example, \u201cDo not do any thing with the car besides parking it in your yard.\u201d When the Mississippi court concluded that \u201cthere was no positive, express prohibition against using the truck on Sunday,\u201d we think that the court intended to emphasize the failure of the lender to forbid the precise use which led to the accident \u2014\u201cusing the truck <em>on Sunday\u201d </em>\u2014 rather than the lender\u2019s failure to phrase his instructions in the negative imperative. We therefore reject Travelers\u2019 invitation to distinguish the present case from <em>Watkins </em>simply on account of Hubbard\u2019s fortuitous order to Kinnard <em>not </em>to use the loaned vehicle except for transportation to and from work.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\"> Instead, we apply the <em>Watkins </em>test for a specific prohibition by assessing the precision of the lender\u2019s instructions for use of the borrowed vehicle. Applying that standard to the present set of facts, we conclude a jury might well decide that Hubbard never prohibited Kinnard from taking the vehicle to Hickstown. There was evidence that Kinnard had been told not to go driving all over the country in the company\u2019s cars. But whether or not this command reached the degree of specificity required by the <em>Watkins </em>case was a question properly for the jury. We conclude, therefore, that the court did not err in allowing the jury to decide, as it did in responding to the first special interrogatory, that there was no \u201cexpress prohibition against actual use of the Hubbard vehicle by Charles Kinnard at the time and place the collision occurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">B. Having affirmed the jury determination that Kinnard\u2019s use of the vehicle was not specifically prohibited, we must next decide whether his use was so gross a deviation from his employer\u2019s permission that he was not within the scope of the employer\u2019s permission. The two tests are apparently different ways of evaluating the borrower\u2019s deviation in light of the precision of the lender\u2019s permission. The specific prohibition test focuses upon the breadth of the lender\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>mandate; the minor deviation test upon the actual use of the vehicle by the borrower. Like the specificity of a prohibition on use, the seriousness of a borrower\u2019s deviation is a question of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">We cannot say that the district judge erred in allowing the issue of Kinnard\u2019s deviation to be presented to the jury. There was evidence that Kinnard had been instructed to use the Hubbard vehicle only to travel between home and work. There was also testimony indicating that the instruction had been repeated shortly before the accident which gave rise to this litigation. But Hubbard\u2019s instruction to Kinnard to use the vehicle only for Kinnard\u2019s travel to and from work does not dispose of the possibility that some deviations from Hubbard\u2019s oral instructions were inevitable, that they were reasonably to be contemplated by the lender,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that they were therefore only minor deviations within the meaning of the Mississippi law. The jury may have thought occasional deviations by Kinnard understandable when the practice of lending the vehicle to him continued over a period of six years. On these facts, a jury might well find that even the most faithful borrower of his employer\u2019s vehicle might stray occasionally from the appointed route and that such deviations were only minor in the context of a long-standing permission to use the vehicle.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">II. <em>The Adequacy of Travelers\u2019 Representation of Kinnard.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">This case requires us to evaluate the insurer\u2019s duty to conduct litigation properly on behalf of its insured. The district court awarded judgment for Travelers, notwithstanding a jury verdict that Travelers had not properly represented Kinnard during settlement negotiations and that Travelers should therefore be liable for the entire amount of any judgments rendered against Kinnard, even in excess of its liability limits under the Hubbard policy. From this judgment the Martins and Kinnard appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-12\">A. The facts underlying this cross-appeal are not in serious dispute, although the parties do attach variant interpretations to the events in question. Travelers investigated the accident soon after its occurrence. It learned from Hubbard\u2019s general manager of the instructions given Kinnard restricting his use of company vehicles; and Kinnard himself acknowledged the instructions in a statement taken by a Travelers adjuster at Kinnard\u2019s hospital bedside. On investigation, it appeared questionable to Travelers that Kinnard was an omnibus insured, operating within the scope of the named insured\u2019s permission. The company therefore obtained from Kin-nard a non-waiver agreement, under which Travelers expressly reserved its right to contest Kinnard\u2019s coverage while nevertheless agreeing to undertake his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-13\">Travelers then hired an attorney, independent of its own counsel, to represent Kinnard. Both orally and in writing, Travelers explained to Kinnard that the company had reserved its rights to contest its liability for any part of any judgment which might be rendered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>against Kinnard. Travelers also made it clear that Kinnard\u2019s interests and those of Travelers might conflict and that Kinnard might hire his own lawyer if he wished.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">In time, Mississippi state court judgments were rendered against Kinnard in favor of Mr. and Mrs. Martin, for $100,000 and $75,000 respectively. Before and after these judgments were rendered, and while they were on appeal to the Mississippi Supreme Court, the Martins made offers of settlement within the range of the $100,000 policy limit. Travelers, however, steadfastly rejected these offers on advice of its lawyers that, even after the <em>Watkins </em>case was decided, Kinnard was not its insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">In the federal court action to enforce Travelers\u2019 obligation to insure Kinnard, the district judge expressed his doubts that there was a question of fact for the jury on the issue of Travelers\u2019 bad faith. Nevertheless, he submitted the question to the jury; and when the jury found Travelers guilty of bad faith, he granted Travelers\u2019 motion for judgment n. o. v. The trial court held that there was no substantial evidence of Travelers\u2019 bad faith to justify the jury\u2019s verdict. In its opinion, the trial court stated that it could not \u201cenvision much, if anything, more that the defendant Travelers could have done under the facts and circumstances of this case to show good faith toward * * * Kin-nard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">On this appeal, Kinnard and the Martins argue that the question of Travelers\u2019 bad faith was properly submitted to the jury. Specifically, cross-appellants point to Travelers\u2019 refusal to accept offers of settlement within its policy limits, in disregard of Kinnard\u2019s interests in accepting such offers and with unjustifiable reliance on opinion of counsel that Kinnard was not covered by the Hubbard policy; to Travelers\u2019 dismissal of a federal declaratory judgment action, allegedly in order to shift to Kin-nard and the Martins the burden of proving coverage; to the failure of Travelers\u2019 appointed counsel, Mr. Moss, to defend Kinnard in the state courts on the basis of a tire blow out; and to Travelers\u2019 failure to investigate Kin-nard\u2019s prior use of the Hubbard vehicles, as a result of which the company would not properly evaluate Kinnard's coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">Under Mississippi law, if the allegations in tort suit pleadings are such as would, if true, bring the claim within the coverage of an insurance policy, the insured is required to defend its putative insured. Southern Farm Casualty Ins. Co. v. Logan, 238 Miss. 580, 119 So.2d 268. If the insurer believes that the tort suit defendant is not in fact its insured, the insurer may refuse to provide him with a defense. However, such a course is fraught with risk for the insurer, since if the insurer\u2019s refusal to defend is ultimately found unjustifiable, the insurer is liable for damages resulting from its failure to defend. Southern Farm Bureau Casualty Co. v. Logan, <em>supra; </em>Ma-var Shrimp &amp; Oyster Co. v. U. S. F. &amp; G. Co., Miss., 187 So.2d 871. Ordinarily, damages will consist of the defendant insured\u2019s cost of defense. If the insured has settled the case the insurer will be liable for the amount of any settlement even if the applicable policy requires the insurer\u2019s consent to any settlement agreed to by the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">We conclude from this review of Mississippi law that Travelers acted under compulsion of its duty to defend Kin-nard when it undertook to provide his defense under a non-waiver agreement. It is true, of course, that its decision to defend Kinnard was in no sense eleemosynary, since Travelers risked adverse financial consequences if it unjustifiably refused to defend. Yet those adverse consequences are prescribed by Mississippi law; and Travelers\u2019 decision to defend Kinnard was therefore a decision imposed upon the company. It was not a decision which may fairly be described as a ploy to prevent Kinnard from conducting his defense in his own best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>Thus we see no reason to examine with unusual closeness Travelers\u2019 performance of its duty to act in good faith on Kinnard\u2019s behalf simply because the company undertook Kinnard\u2019s defense when it felt he was not covered. Instead, we rely upon the principles which traditionally underlie the insurer\u2019s duty to conduct litigation and settlement negotiations properly when acting on behalf of its insured. The insurer must consider the interests of the insured, as well as its own, at every step of the way. This duty is imposed since, by assuming the burden of the insured\u2019s defense, the insurer \u201cassume [s] exclusive control of the claim against the insured, and [takes] unto itself the power to determine for the insured all questions of liability, settlement, of defense and management before and during trial, and of appeal after final judgment.\u201d American Mut. Lib. Ins. Co. v. Cooper, 5 Cir. 1932, 61 F.2d 446.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">One of the most crucial of the insurer\u2019s obligations is its duty to evaluate any settlement offers from the joint perspective of its own interests and those of its insured. Many courts have defined the degree of consideration owed by the insurer to the insured\u2019s interests as one of \u201cgood faith.\u201d J. Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice \u00a7 4711 (Supp. 1971). Mississippi, however, still adheres to a far less stringent requirement, one laid down many years ago: an insurer cannot be found liable in excess of its policy limits for failing to settle an action unless its refusal to settle was so arbitrary and unreasonable as to constitute fraud. Farmers Gin Co. v. St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co., 186 Miss. 747, 191 So. 415 (1939). Ordinarily, application of the standard presents a question of fact, and the finder of fact must decide whether the insurer properly considered the interests of the insured in refusing an offer of settlement. For example, when the policy limit is $10,000 and the claimant, having sued for $100,000, offers to settle for $10,000, the insured would benefit handsomely by such a settlement. It would preclude a possible judgment against the insured in excess of policy limits. At the same time, the insurer would wish to reject the offer, since its defense might be successful at trial; and even if it failed at trial, the insurer would risk only the added cost of a litigated defense. See R. Keeton, Basic Text on Insurance Law \u00a7 7.8 (1971). If on these facts the insurance company refused settlement, the trier of fact would decide whether the possible gain to the insurance company was so unlikely and so insignificant relative to the magnitude and likelihood of detriment to the insured that the insurer was acting arbitrarily and unreasonably with regard to the insured\u2019s interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">In the present case, however, we must add a new ingredient to the mixture which the jury was called upon to sample: Travelers\u2019 denial of coverage. Had this denial been groundless or disingenuous, it would not be a proper consideration in evaluating Travelers' conduct of. the Kinnard litigation. But we agree with the district court that Travelers had good reason to assert that Kinnard was not its insured under the Hubbard policy. Part I of this opinion bears out Travelers\u2019 contention that a serious question of coverage remained unresolved, even if we have today finally decided the question adverse to Travelers. Given the seriousness of the coverage question, it is easy to see why Travelers would refuse <em>any </em>offer of settlement above minimal proportions. For Travelers to have accepted the Martins\u2019 offer, it would have been forced to swallow the bitter pill of assuming financial responsibility for one to whom it earnestly believed it owed no legal obligation whatever. Travelers\u2019 only recourse would have been to pay out a sum of money approaching $100,000 on Kinnard\u2019s behalf \u2014 with no hope of recovering the money should its claim that Kinnard was not its insured later be vindicated in federal court. Since Kinnard had no significant financial resources, there was no chance of employing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>technique mentioned in Milbank Mut. Ins. Co. v. Schmidt, 8 Cir. 1962, 304 F.2d 640, where the insurer offered to settle if the insured would premise to reimburse it in the event the insurer was ultimately held not liable under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">To allow a jury to consider the insurer\u2019s good faith in refusing settlement on these facts would, we think, be a giant step even in those jurisdictions which have imposed stiff obligations upon insurers to consider the interests of the insured. The Mississippi trial judge here, whose view of local law we have good reason to respect, Petersen v. Klos, 5 Cir. 1970, 433 F.2d 911, applied <em>Farmers Gin </em>and we shall follow his lead here.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">We hasten to point out that an insurer is not absolved of all responsibility to a possible insured whom it has undertaken to defend merely because the company is denying coverage. No court would allow an insurer to take control of the insured\u2019s defense and exercise gross negligence in handling that defense in reliance upon a defense of no coverage. But it is one thing to impose upon the insurer the obligation to prosecute the insured\u2019s defense with reasonable diligence, and quite another thing to require the insurer to settle a claim at a cost of many thousands of dollars before the insurer has had a full opportunity to litigate a serious question of coverage. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s entry of judgment for Travelers n. o. v. insofar as that judgment reflects the court\u2019s conclusion that no reasonable and fair minded juror could believe that Travelers\u2019 refusal to settle was \u201cso arbitrary and unreasonable as to constitute fraud.\u201d Farmers Gin Co.; <em>see </em>Boeing Co. v. Shipman.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">B. We also agree with the district court that none of the other grounds advanced by Kinnard and the Martins were sufficient to support a jury finding of bad faith. Travelers\u2019 decision to dismiss its federal declaratory judgment action to determine coverage is not one which a federal district court, or this Court, is omniscient enough to scrutinize for improper motives. Even if we assume that Travelers sought only to shift the burden of proving coverage to Kinnard and the Martins, they have adduced no support for their position that Travelers owed to Kinnard the duty of lightening Kinnard\u2019s burden of proving coverage, a legal issue with respect to which Travelers and Kinnard were from the outset adverse parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">We may dispose briefly of the two additional arguments which Kinnard and the Martins advance as sufficient to support a jury finding of bad faith. They argue, first, that counsel appointed by Travelers failed to raise a crucial affirmative defense on Kinnard\u2019s behalf during the state court trial of the Martins\u2019 suit for damages. Specifically, they point to Kinnard\u2019s statement to Travelers that his accident was caused by a blowout of a front tire on the Hubbard station wagon. Had this blowout been raised by way of affirmative defense, cross-appellants now argue, the outcome of the initial litigation might have been more favorable to Kinnard. But we think it far too late in the day to begin second-guessing the litigation strategy and preparation of counsel in a negligence action which proceeded to judgment several years ago. The lower court was well within its discretion in refusing to allow receipt of speculative testimony about the consequences of Travelers\u2019 appointed counsel\u2019s failure to raise the blowout issue in state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">The second prong of Kinnard\u2019s attack on Travelers\u2019 conduct of his defense centers on the insurer\u2019s alleged bad faith in failing to investigate properly evidence of Kinnard\u2019s unauthorized use of the Hubbard vehicle prior to the time of the accident. Apparently, Kinnard\u2019s position is that the company intentionally closed its eyes to evidence which would undercut its reliance on Kinnard\u2019s lack of coverage during any ensuing settlement negotiations. We find, though strong evidence that counsel for Travelers had interviewed a number of residents of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>Hickstown, and that none disclosed any prior use of Hubbard vehicles by Kin-nard for his own purposes. We cannot now find fault with Travelers\u2019 investigation simply because hindsight suggests that a different process of investigation might have revealed information more favorable to Kinnard\u2019s position on coverage. There is no evidence in the record that Travelers conducted its investigation with blinders on so as to shield itself from information that might undermine its belief in the strength of its no coverage defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">III. <em>Other Errors Alleged.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Travelers also asserts that, even if the issue of Kinnard\u2019s coverage was properly submitted to the jury, other errors so infected the proceedings below as to require us to remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">A. Travelers contends that the lower court should have allowed the jury to decide whether Kinnard had violated the duty of cooperation which he, as an omnibus insured owed to his insurer. Ordinarily, to demonstrate a breach of the insured\u2019s duty of cooperation, the insurer must show that the insured made false statements or conducted himself in some other fashion materially prejudicing the insurer\u2019s ability to defend the lawsuit on the insured\u2019s behalf. Here, even if we assume that Kinnard falsely denied any previous deviations from his employer\u2019s instructions, no prejudice to the insurer\u2019s defense of Kinnard resulted from this misstatement. Kinnard\u2019s previous visits to Hicks-town, if any there were, had no bearing on his liability to the Martins, but only upon the issue of his coverage under the Hubbard policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Cooperation clauses are intended to guarantee to insurers the right to prepare adequately their defenses on questions of substantive liability. We know of no case in which the insured\u2019s duty of assistance and cooperation has been used to force a putative insured to divulge to the insurer every jot and tittle of information \u25a0 which may aid the insurer in defeating his claim for coverage, but which in no way hinders the insurer\u2019s ability to provide the insured with a proper defense. We certainly cannot say that the district court committed fatal error when it declined to allow this novel legal position to pass to the jury for factual resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">B. Travelers also questions the lower court\u2019s decision to allow the Martins, as judgment creditors, to raise the issue of Travelers\u2019 bad faith. Pointing to our decision in Seguros Tepeyac, S.A., Com-pania Mexicana de Seguros Generales v. Bostrom, 5 Cir. 1965, 347 F.2d 168, rehearing denied 360 F.2d 154, and to a recent decision by the district court for the Northern District of Mississippi, Nichols v. U. S. F. &amp; G. Co. (N.D.Miss. 1970), 318 F.Supp. 334, Travelers contends that the duty of good faith settlement runs only from insurer to insured, and not to judgment creditors of the insured. Apparently, Travelers\u2019 position is that the judgment creditor should not have been allowed to adduce evidence of Travelers\u2019 bad faith since this evidence colored the jury\u2019s interpretation of the evidence on the issue of coverage. If we should decide to uphold presentation of the bad faith issue by the Martins, Travelers argues that the Martins\u2019 right to present this issue rendered the intervention by Kinnard extraneous in violation of Fed.R.Civ.P. 24. It is Travelers\u2019 contention that the Kinnard intervention was so prejudicial to Travelers\u2019 position that we should remand the case for a new trial below.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">Without deciding whether the duty of good faith could be enforced directly by a judgment creditor, we have decided that there is no reason to remand for a new trial based on Travelers\u2019 contentions of prejudice. The starting point in our analysis is to determine whether Kinnard\u2019s intervention would have been proper on the sole issue of his coverage under the Travelers policy, there being no doubt about the propriety of the Martins\u2019 suit to enforce their judgment within the applicable policy limits. Fed.R.Civ.P. 24 requires us <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>to consider three factors in assessing Kinnard\u2019s intervention: 1) whether Kinnard could claim an interest relating to the transaction which was the subject of the Martins\u2019 action; 2) whether the disposition of the Martins\u2019 action might as a practical matter have impaired or impeded Kinnard\u2019s ability to protect his interest; 3) whether Kinnard\u2019s interest was adequately represented by existing parties at the time of his intervention \u25a0 \u2014 -namely, the Martins.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Turning to the first factor, we think Kinnard\u2019s interest in intervening was apparent. He sought to do his part to avoid being saddled with a judgment which in all likelihood, he could never satisfy during the remainder of his lifetime. Consideration of the second factor in Rule 24 is more complicated. We must consider the alternative to allowing Kin-nard\u2019s intervention on the issue of cov7 erage: a second action by Kinnard against Travelers brought after the possible unfavorable outcome of the Martins\u2019 attempt to demonstrate Kinnard\u2019s coverage. We do not doubt that the disposition of the coverage issue in a hypothetical first lawsuit by the Martins alone would have substantial practical impact on Kinnard\u2019s efforts to prove coverage in a possible second suit of his own. Res judicata would not apply to bar Kinnard\u2019s suit. But stare decisis, which dictates respect for prior judicial determinations of identical points of law, would loom large in any attempt by Kin-nard to achieve a favorable resolution of the coverage issue on his own after the Martins had struck out.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">As for the third factor, we cannot say that Kinnard\u2019s interest was adequately represented by the Martins in their effort to determine coverage. Kinnard was the central figure in this drama. He may well have felt that information within his control required him to assume a position of participation in this litigation which, after all, was to determine whether Kinnard\u2019s weekly paycheck was to be shrunk by one-fourth for the rest of his life. In short, Kinnard could not be relegated to the sidelines on the issue of coverage, an issue which the parties agree is the central issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">This brings us to the question of Kin-nard\u2019s intervention on the issue of Travelers\u2019 good or bad faith in foregoing a number of settlement offers tendered it by the Martins. We shall assume, without necessarily so deciding, that the Martins could not properly raise the issue in an action alone by the Martins against Travelers. The question reduces then to whether Kinnard having been permitted to intervene on the issue of coverage alone could properly raise the bad faith issue at the same trial. We think that the answer to this question is clear. It would make little sense to require a separate jury trial on the issue of bad faith settlement. The issue was intimately connected with the question of coverage under the Travelers policy since the nucleus of the bad faith claim was the spirit of Travelers\u2019 reliance upon its defense of no coverage. Travelers\u2019 good faith could not really be determined unless the finder of fact could weigh the honesty of Travelers\u2019 reliance on its no coverage defense. A second, independent trial to determine Travelers\u2019 good faith would have required in substantial part a reprise of the trial of the coverage issue at the first trial. The considerations of judicial efficiency which underlie Rule 19 must also inspire our interpretations of Rule 24. Atlantis Development Corp. v. United States, 5 Cir. 1967, 379 F.2d 818. Our task is not to require an elaborate legal minuet in the courts below, but to support the efforts of those courts to insure that litigation moves sensibly and purposefully forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-10\">We think, then, that Kinnard\u2019s intervention on the issue of coverage was proper, and that Kinnard had the right to raise the bad faith issue as well once he had intervened. We cannot order a new trial because at the actual trial the Martins, and not Kinnard alone, were allowed to introduce evidence in support of the assertion that Travelers was guilty of bad faith. We see no indication that any prejudice resulting from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>this procedure was substantial enough to justify the grant of a new trial. Rule 61 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure commands the lower federal courts to disregard any error or defect in a proceeding which does not affect the substantial rights of the parties. And it has long been settled that this Court, too, must measure any supposed dereliction in the same light of substantial justice. Clegg v. Hardware Mut. Cas. Co., 5 Cir. 1959, 264 F.2d 152. We are convinced that no substantial prejudice was done to the defendants\u2019 case merely because counsel for the Martins was allowed to introduce evidence of Travelers\u2019 bad faith during the same trial in which that issue had been raised by Kinnard\u2019s counsel during his presentation of the Intervenor\u2019s case. Several times during his lengthy charge to the jury, the trial judge reminded the jury to distinguish the coverage issue from the bad faith issue.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Whatever minimal prejudice may have arisen from, the Martins\u2019 presentation of evidence on the question of bad faith was cured by these instructions. In sum, the lower court\u2019s handling of the Kinnard intervention and of the presentation of evidence by the respective parties plaintiff affords no basis for reversal or new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\"> C. Travelers also complains of the admission into evidence of the decision and record in the Watkins case, which we have already discussed in connection with the issue of Travelers\u2019 bad faith. Travelers does not deny that the <em>Watkins </em>evidence was <em>relevant </em>to the jury\u2019s disposition of the bad faith issue. Rather, the company apparently contends that the evidence was gravely prejudicial because the jury was allowed to consider judicial pronouncements and legal documentation on a matter similar to the present case. Arguably, the admission of these materials may have confused the jury into believing that its task was to apply the law of <em>Watkins </em>to the facts of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">We do not, however, see sufficient danger of prejudice to warrant reversal on the facts of this case. Relevant evidence is to be excluded when, in the discretion of the trial judge, its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, of confusion of the issues, or of misleading the jury. See Proposed Rules of Evidence for the United States Courts, Revised Draft, Rule 403. Assertions of evidentiary prejudice \u201ccall for balancing the probative value of and need for the evidence against the harm likely to result from its admission.\u201d Advisory Committee\u2019s Note to Proposed Rule 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">The trial judge observes first hand the proceedings below. His determinations must be given great weight when we who are removed from the actual trial review his conduct of this balancing process. In this case, it was essential to place before the jury some means of considering Travelers\u2019 refusal to settle in light of the decision of the Mississippi Supreme Court in the <em>Watkins </em>case. The trial judge, weighing probative value and prejudice, elected to admit the <em>Watkins </em>decision and record into evidence. We cannot say that the lower court\u2019s evaluation of the relative pros and cons of the evidence was manifestly wrong. We particularly note the thorough and clear instruction of the court that the jury consider the <em>Watkins </em>material only on the issue of bad faith. Moreover, the court instructed the jury not to consider <em>Watkins </em>determinative of even the issue of bad faith; it was rather to view the case only as an indication of Travelers\u2019 grounds for refusing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>to settle with the judgment creditors. There was no reversible error in admitting the <em>Watkins </em>materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">D. We have also considered Travelers\u2019 objections to the admission of a state motor vehicle safety report in which the company acknowledged that a policy was in effect on the vehicle driven by Kinnard. We assume for purposes of argument that the trial judge went beyond his discretion in admitting the report as a relevant piece of evidence. Any assumed error, however, was not of sufficient magnitude to justify reversal or a new trial. As Chief Judge Brown has stated for this Court, the task of review is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-5\">not the simple one of identifying the * * * incidents and then under microscopic examination ascertain whether in one way or another the rulings lack perfection. Under command of F.R.Civ.P. 61 and 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2111, ours is a more substantial function which epitomizes the very nature of adjudication. We must determine whether, assuming the action under review to have been erroneous, was it really harmful to the complaining party ?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">Tugwell v. A. F. Klaveness &amp; Co., 5 Cir. 1963, 320 F.2d 866 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">E. In a last ditch effort to obtain a new trial, Travelers\u2019 final series of objections focuses upon the closing argument of the Martins\u2019 attorney, Mr. Bowling. First, Travelers asserts that opposing counsel falsely attributed to Hubbard an \u201cadmission\u201d that \u201che had suspicions\u201d that Kinnard had previously violated company instructions in using Hubbard vehicles at night for social purposes. We do not agree, as Travelers suggests, that this characterization of Hubbard\u2019s testimony amounted to a substantial misstatement of the evidence. Although Hubbard initially denied having any \u201csuspicions\u201d of Kinnard\u2019s extracurricular use of borrowed vehicles, a few moments later Hubbard provided sufficient basis for Mr. Bowling\u2019s argument to the jury. When asked why he continued to instruct Kinnard as to the scope of his permission to use the Hubbard vehicles, if Hubbard did not suspect Kinnard of violating the initial limitations, Hubbard replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know whether you\u2019d call it a suspicion or not. I guess I wanted to refresh them once in a while about it.\u201d Since argument to the jury is just that, counsel Bowling\u2019s attribution of suspicion to Hubbard was a fair characterization of the testimony, although it was an interpretation favorable to the Martins\u2019 side of the case. Argument to the jury is argument, not impartial recapitulation. And Mr. Bowling\u2019s characterization of Hubbard\u2019s response was not an unfair distortion requiring us to provide a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-10\">F. Travelers also urges us to remand for a new trial because counsel for the Martins used the Watkins case as a taking off point to argue law to the jury. We note, however, that immediately following the argument now objected to the trial judge warned the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-11\">Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury, if this matter was referred to in the testimony, I will let you proceed, but I just want to tell you Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury once again that all of the law that you receive to apply to the facts of this case will come from the Court after counsel conclude their argument.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-12\">This reminder, and the thorough instructions on Watkins which followed, were more than ample to guard against possible jury misuse of counsel\u2019s references to the Watkins case.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-13\">G. Finally, we see no merit to Travelers\u2019 contention that counsel for the Martins misrepresented the contents of the first special interrogatory submitted to the jury. The only misrepresentation we perceive resulted from an innocent slip of the tongue. To recommence this long struggle on such slim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>provocation would not be consonant with our responsibility to do substantial justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">The original trial of this difficult case was proper and fair. For the reasons stated, the judgment of the district court must therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b605-14\">. The court, quoting from 7 Am.Jur.2d Automobile Insurance \u00a7 112 (1963), described a permitted act as \u201cone not specifically prohibited as contrasted to an act affirmatively and specifically authorized.\u201d 209 So.2d at 632-633. Apparently, if the act which gives rise to the accident is specifically prohibited, there is no need to decide the degree to which the borrower has deviated from the lender\u2019s permission. A possible rationale for this approach, implicit in the <em>Watkins </em>opinion, is that any deviation is gross when in violation of a specific prohibition on a particular kind of use. The question remains, of course, as to what constitutes a specific prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-16\">Though the Mississippi Supreme Court did use the phrase \u201cpositive, express prohibition\u201d interchangeably with \u201cspecific prohibition,\u201d for reasons which are stated in this opinion we find \u201cspecific prohibition\u201d a more precise formulation of the inquiry and shall continue to apply that formulation for the remainder of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b607-8\">. In <em>Watkins, </em>the Mississippi Supreme Court appears to have applied a test of foreseeability in determining whether a deviation was minor or gross. See 20!) So.2d at 635:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-9\">* * * [The borrower] did not leave his neighborhood, but used the truck to go to a neighbor\u2019s house to get his wife, <em>a use that could reasonably be contemplated by the lender. </em>[His] deviation was minor, <em>a thing to be expected by the lender </em>* * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">The trial court gave no specific instruction . to the jury about how it was to interpret the degree of a deviation from the lender\u2019s permission. Since the Mississippi Supreme Court gave no firm indication that it was adopting a foreseeability test for degree of deviation, we see no error in the trial court\u2019s decision not to amplify this test. It was entirely consistent with the <em>Watkins </em>decision to allow the jury to attach its own interpretation to the terms \u201cminor deviation\u201d and \u201cgross deviation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b607-15\">. Since we hold that there was no error in allowing the jury to decide that Kinnard\u2019s use did not constitute a gross deviation from Hubbard\u2019s permission, we need not decide whether through implied permission (or ratification) Hubbard had authorized the use by Kinnard which led to the accident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b613-6\">. See, for example, tlie trial com't\u2019s charge: \u201cYou are instructed that even if you should find from a preponderance of the evidence in this case that on the occasion in question that Charles Kinnard was an insured of the Defendant and covered by the policy issued by the Defendant to Hubbard Butane and Charles Hubbard, <em>still the Defendant Travelers may not he held liable </em>for any amount in excess of its policy limits <em>unless you farther find from a preponderance of the evidence </em>that Defendant Company acted in bad faitli in failing to settle the Martins\u2019 claims within its policy limits\u201d (emphasis supplied.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
