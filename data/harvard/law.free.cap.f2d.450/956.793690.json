Though such an omission can result in proper judicial refusal to permit the expert to testify, in all of the circumstances of this case we have concluded that it was not reversible error to admit the doctor\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-10\">It is also argued that the evidence and the charge concerning the present worth of any loss of future earnings were so deficient as to make any award for this element of damage sheer conjecture. Our examination of the evidence, including actuarial testimony, and the court\u2019s instructions satisfies us that the jury was sufficiently informed and guided on this aspect of its responsibility to provide a basis for a reasoned and acceptable determination of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-11\">The judgment will.be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
