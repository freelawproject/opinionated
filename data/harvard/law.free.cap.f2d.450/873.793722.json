Defendant told the agent at the time of the sale that the two unsealed bottles contained a total of approximately 293 tablets of dilaudid,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that each of the sealed bottles contained 100 morphine tablets.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Subsequent chemical analysis revealed that the unsealed bottles were filled with both morphine sulphate and dilaudid pills and that the sealed bottles contained only dilaudid. Defendant\u2019s sole defense was that, despite his representations to the agent, he thought all the bottles contained only dilaudid, which he did not know was a narcotic drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-22\">Defendant raises two contentions on appeal. The first is a fanciful argument that evidence of the morphine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>sulphate tablets went beyond the scope of the government\u2019s bill of particulars. The bill of particulars incorporated a one-page chemical analysis report to describe the form and amount of morphine involved in the sale. Under the heading of \u201calleged drugs\u201d the report listed the drugs as defendant had represented them to the agent: exhibit #1, the unsealed bottles, was described as dilaudid; and exhibit #2, the sealed bottles, as morphine. The laboratory results reported on the same page indicated that in fact exhibit #1 contained both morphine sulphate and dilaudid tablets and exhibit #2 contained only dilaudid. Defendant argues, by what he calls a \u201cchain of reference,\u201d that since the indictment charged him with the sale of \u201cmorphine,\u201d and in the bill of particulars only exhibit #2 was initially described as \u201cmorphine,\u201d then the true chemical identity of only exhibit #2 (dilaudid) can be introduced against him. The bill of particulars clearly included both dilaudid and morphine sulphate; the evidence of morphine sulphate did not go beyond the confines of the bill. Adoption of the \u201cchain of reference\u201d argument would allow a defendant\u2019s false representations to control the admissibility of evidence and would hallmark a return to the strict common law rules of fatal variance, firmly repudiated in modern judicial practice. <em>See, e. g., </em>Rules 7(f), 36, 52(a), Fed.R.Crim.P.; Rules 15, 21, Fed.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-11\">Defendant\u2019s second contention is that the judge failed to instruct the jury adequately on his defense of lack of knowledge. Specifically, he claims that the judge should have mentioned the dilaudid tablets in his charge, on the theory that defendant thought all the pills were dilaudid and did not know dilaudid was a narcotic. Defendant argues that the fact that most of the tablets were dilaudid supports this theory, thus making the mention of \u201cdilaudid\u201d an essential element of the knowledge instruction. The record reveals adequate instructions regarding the requirement of knowledge,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and defendant\u2019s specific objection to the omission of \u201cdilaudid\u201d as part of this charge comes too late under Rule 30, Fed.R.Crim.P.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s only request and objection with respect to dilaudid was the judge\u2019s refusal to leave to the jury the question of whether morphine sulphate and dilaudid were narcotic drugs.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>now claims his objection referred to the omission of \u201cdilaudid\u201d generally, his objection at trial did not meet the qualitative requirements of Rule 30. In light of the court\u2019s full instructions of knowledge, it was not error to limit the charge to morphine sulphate.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b931-23\">. Now repealed. Pub.L. 91-513, \u00a7 1101 (b) (3) (A), October 27, 1970, 84 Stat. 1292.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b931-26\">. According to unquestioned expert testimony, dilaudid is a narcotic drug derived from morphine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"Ao91\">.

It seems to be understood from the argument made by counsel for the defendant here that the defendant did not know\u2019 what he was selling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-12\">\u201cGoldman admitted he sold this material to Costanzo, but liis position, the defendant\u2019s position, is that lie didn\u2019t know it was morphine, members of the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-13\">&lt;&lt; * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-14\">\u201cOf course if Goldman had no knowledge it was a narcotic drug that he was selling at the time, you would have to find Goldman not guilty.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b932-15\">. \u201cNo party may assign as error any portion of the charge or omission therefrom unless he objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict stating distinctly the matter to which he objects and the grounds of his objection.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b932-16\">. Defendant\u2019s requests for instructions Nos. 2, 3, and 4 were as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-18\">\u201c2. You must acquit the defendant unless you find beyond reasonable doubt that dilaudid is Morphine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-19\">\u201c3. You must acquit the defendant unless you find beyond reasonable doubt that morphine sulphate is Morphine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-13\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>\u201c4. You must acquit the defendant unless you find beyond reasonable doubt that morphine sulphate or dilaudid is Morphine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-14\">These requests were properly denied. Whether morphine sulphate falls within the statute is not a question for the jury, and the jury could convict even if dilaudid was not morphine because the other tablets were. Defendant\u2019s objection <em>to the </em>omission of \u201cdilaudid\u201d from the charge related solely to the failure to give these instructions.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
