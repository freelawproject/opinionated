United States, 395 U.S. 6, 17, 89 S.Ct. 1532, 23 L.Ed.2d 57 (1969). See note 19 cited to the text, at 18. See, <em>e. g., </em>35 P. S. \u00a7\u00a7 780-2(g), 780-4(q), and Bannister v. United States, 446 F.2d 1250 (3rd Cir. 1971). But the jury found Hooks guilty on each of the seven counts and he received substantial concurrent sentences on each. The judgments of conviction were affirmed by this court, 359 F.2d 584 (3 Cir. 1966). Hooks then brought this proceeding based on 28 U. S.C. \u00a7 2255, alleging that the judgments of conviction on Counts II and VIII, the marihuana counts, were void because the statutes on which they were based are \u201cunconstitutional\u201d and praying that the case be remanded to the district court with directions to grant him a new trial on the remaining five heroin or cocaine counts, <em>viz., </em>Counts I, III, IV, V and VI. Hooks takes the position that these five remaining counts are \u201cinseparable\u201d from Counts II and VIII and therefore are, so to speak, tainted by his allegedly illegal convictions on Counts I and VIII. Cf. note 2, <em>supra. </em>We do not perceive the force of this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">There are four statutes involved here, the constitutionality of which cannot now be successfully attacked. They are, in the order of the indictment, Sections 4742(a), 4704(a), 4705(a) and 4744(a) (2), 26 U.S.C. The application of one of these sections, 4704(a), was before this court in United States v. Clark, 425 F.2d 827, 829-830 (1970), and was held constitutional, as was Section 4705(a) in respect to heroin by Minor v. United States, 396 U.S. 87, 90 S.Ct. 284, 24 L.Ed.2d 283 (1969). Section 4744(a) (2) prohibits the transfer or sale of marihuana without payment of the tax and provides that possession, combined with failure to produce the order form required by Section 4742(a) (2), is presumptive evidence of guilt. For the reasons stated in the opinion of the present writer in Bannister v. United States, <em>supra, </em>446 F.2d at 1250, we hold that <em>Leary </em>is applicable to the conviction of Hooks on Counts II and VIII. In view of the testimony of Hooks that he was acting as a <em>de facto </em>United States narcotics agent, we remand the case to the district court to determine whether he waived knowingly his right to assert his complete defense to prosecution based on his privilege against self-incrimination, see Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>1461 (1938) ; Fay v. Noia, 372 U.S. 391, 439, 83 S.Ct. 822, 9 L.Ed.2d 837 (1963); <em>cf. </em>Sanders v. United States, 373 U.S. 1, 18, 83 S.Ct. 1068, 10 L.Ed.2d 148 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Other points raised by Hooks do not require discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">The judgments of conviction on Counts I, III, IV, V, and VI will be affirmed, and the case will be remanded to the district court for further proceedings as to Counts II and VIII in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">We thank our court-appointed counsel for his vigorous prosecution of his client\u2019s claims.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b464-9\">. There were eight counts. Count VII was duplicitous and was dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b464-10\">.

See Trial Transcript, 162-170. See particularly 162-163, Hooks testifying on direct examination in his own defense, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-11\">\u201cQ. [W]hat did you [Hooks] do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-12\">\u201cA. [H]e [Emrich] asked me about different narcotic sellers, and I told him that I knew them through my wife, but I hadn\u2019t dealt with them, but maybe I could. And so, he and I, we discussed a plan to get me to get different drug pushers to meet him and sell him drugs. And, I told him that I would do this.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-14\">To give further specific instances of Hooks\u2019 position would extend this opinion to too great a length. It is unquestionable that this record demonstrates that Hooks testified that he was acting in substance as a government agent and that this was his asserted defense. See the second paragraph of this opinion.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
