Two actually entered the bank and confronted the personnel while the third man remained outside as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>lookout. The Government contended at appellant\u2019s trial that he was the third participant. It offered in support of its position: (1) the in-court identification of an alleged eyewitness to the robbers\u2019 getaway; and (2) a written police report of appellant\u2019s purported in-custodial oral statement to federal agents while being held under state charges. Appellant\u2019s substantial contentions on appeal involve the admissibility of this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">We find no merit in appellant\u2019s contention that the in-court identification should have been excluded on the basis of reasoning analogous to that undertaken in Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U.S. 1, 90 S.Ct. 1999, 26 L.Ed.2d 387 (1970) and Simmons v. United States, 390 U.S. 377, 88 S.Ct. 967, 19 L.Ed.2d 1247 (1968). As the <em>Coleman </em>court itself concluded, we feel here that the in-court identification resulted from the witness\u2019 observations at the time of the robbery, independent of the prior line-up or photograph presentation. <em>See </em>399 U.S. at 5-6, 90 S.Ct. 1999; United States v. Black, 412 F.2d 687, 689 (6th Cir.), cert, denied, 396 U.S. 1018, 90 S.Ct. 583, 24 L.Ed.2d 509 (1969). <em>See also </em>United States v. Barber, 442 F.2d 517, 526-527 (3d Cir.1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Concerning admissibility of the oral confession, it is evident that the court employed the procedures mandated by Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 12 L.Ed.2d 908 (1964). Viewed in connection with this court\u2019s decision in United States v. Ruth, 394 F.2d 134, 137 (3d Cir.), cert, denied, 393 U.S. 888, 89 S.Ct. 206, 21 L.Ed.2d 166 (1968), we find no reversible error. <em>See also </em>Government of Virgin Islands v. Lovell, 378 F.2d 799, 804-805 (3d Cir. 1967) (statement to federal officers not inadmissible because given while detained under local charges).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\" orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b402-25\">. <em>See </em>NLRB v. Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, 5th Cir. 1970, 430 F.2d 966.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
