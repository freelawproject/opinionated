Assuming that the judge did not fully elaborate the pertinent evidence, the fact is that the judge emphasized repeatedly to the jury at the time that its recollection of the evidence controlled. We might add that after a jury has'commenced its deliberations, we think it undesirable for a trial judge to engage in discussions with individual jurors about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>particular evidence even though the discussions result from a request by the jury to speak to the court. As to the court\u2019s supplemental legal instructions, we think they were gratuitous and essentially harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">We have reviewed the record in the light of the appellant\u2019s other assignments of error and find none.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
