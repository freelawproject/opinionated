The Board asks us to enforce the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-11\">We deny enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-12\">Sears opened a store in Livonia, Michigan, in the fall of 1964. By 1968 it employed some 1200 people, 35 of whom made up the shipping and receiving department. On December 31, 1968, a Local of the Teamsters Union sent a telegram to the manager of the Livonia store, Arthur Cone, demanding recognition of the Teamsters as the bargaining representative for the 35 employees in the mentioned department. On January 13, 1969, it filed a petition for a representation election. On April 1, 1969, a Decision and Direction of Election announced that the shipping and receiving department was not an appropriate unit for a representation election. Thus, the matter now before us would not likely have had a beginning except for its sua sponte initiation by the Regional Director.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-18\">Moreover, and except that one employee testified that he had signed a union card, the Regional Director authorized this proceeding without reference to any disclosed desire of the involved employees of Sears\u2019 Livonia store to be represented by the Teamsters or any other union. The Teamsters\u2019 wire was dated December 31, 1968, and the Decision and Direction of Election declaring the unit inappropriate as a bargaining unit was issued April 1, 1969. Between those dates no charge of an unfair labor practice involving Sears\u2019 Livonia store was filed by any representative of the Teamsters, by any employee of the involved Sears unit, or by anyone else.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-19\">On April 3, 1969, however, a form of Charge Against Employer was prepared for, and signed by, one Robert S. Sherman, an employee of Sears shipping and receiving department. He was described in the Trial Examiner\u2019s Decision as a \u201cquick tempered, disgruntled employee, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>eager to impugn the Company\u2019s motives.\u201d The charge made by Sherman was foreign to the matter now involved. No Complaint was issued on it, and the Trial Examiner concluded that General Counsel abandoned Sherman\u2019s charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">Nevertheless, on May 27, 1969, and without any additional charge being made, the Regional Director at Detroit, Michigan, issued a Complaint and Notice of Hearing against Sears. Although it begins with the averment that \u201cIt having been charged by Robert S. Sherman,\u201d nothing is mentioned as to the above quoted charge of Sherman. In five of the fifteen numbered paragraphs, the Complaint details various actions by Sears\u2019 representatives which it is claimed interfered with rights of the employees protected by Section 7 of the Act. None of these charges were detailed in Sherman\u2019s charge, nor in any other charge filed by anyone against Sears. We assume, therefore, that they were the product of the Regional Director\u2019s own investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">A hearing was conducted at Detroit on dates between June 23 and July 1, 1969, and the Trial Examiner\u2019s Decision was issued on October 21, 1969. On May 17, 1970, the Board affirmed the Trial Examiner\u2019s Decision and adopted as its own his Recommended Order. The Recommended Order commands Sears to post at its Livonia store a Notice to Employees. This notice amounts to a public confession of misconduct. It reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-6\">\u201cNOTICE TO EMPLOYEES.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-7\">Posted by Order of the National Labor Relations Board An Agency of the United States Government</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-8\">\u201cWe Will Not question or solicit you as to complaints and grievances regarding working conditions, nor shall we correct working conditions complained about, in order to interfere with your choice of bargaining representative, or so as to induce you to reject and refrain from activities in support of Local 299, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America, Ind., or any other labor organization. However, this will not affect benefits or corrected working conditions heretofore put into effect. \u201cWe Will Not in any like or related manner interfere with, restrain, or coerce you in the exercise of the rights guaranteed you in Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJqi\">All of these proceedings have produced a 404 page appendix. The alleged misconduct of Sears which precipitated this now extensive proceeding consisted primarily of Sears\u2019 attempt, after receiving a wire from the Teamsters Union, to find out whether it was indicative of a decline in the morale of its employees and, if so, the cause thereof. What was done by Sears was but a continuance \u2014 -more aggressively pursued, perhaps \u2014 of what had long been its policy of seeking and maintaining good relationships with its employees. Admittedly, the union\u2019s demand enhanced the company\u2019s relevant activity, and the conduct which seemed most to impress the Trial Examiner was the bringing from Chicago of a Sears assistant employee relations man \u2014 one Allen \u2014 and a personnel staff assistant \u2014 one Bennett. While these men had not visited the recently established Livonia store, their activities there were of the same kind as they had conducted at various other stores. The Trial Examiner\u2019s own generalized description of the basis of his finding recites :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-10\">\u201cOn December 31, 1968, the Union sent a telegram to Store Manager Cone, demanding recognition as exclusive bargaining representative for certain employees, including the shipping and receiving employees directly involved here. After Respondent declined recognition, the Union on January 13 filed a petition for an election with the Board\u2019s Regional Director.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-11\">\u201cCone testified that \u2018within the hour after receiving the Union\u2019s telegram\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>for recognition he telephoned Respondent\u2019s main personnel (Midwestern Territory) office in Chicago to discuss the Union\u2019s demand. Cone spoke to the head of that department (Robinson), the assistant employee relations manager (Allen), and the personnel staff assistant (Bennett). According to Cone, \u2018My major concern was with the morale, and the request for the recognition at best gave indications that there might be problems there \u2014 morale problems \u2014 that I needed to evaluate.\u2019 Allen, whom Cone described as especially equipped \u2018in matters of taking a reading on the morale,\u2019 testified that he agreed \u2018to come into the store to assist him [Cone] in communicating with the employees * * * and to advise him of matters related to personnel,\u2019 indicating that he, too, was \u2018concerned with employee morale\u2019 since \u2018a demand for recognition can mean morale problems in some cases.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-7\">\u201cAllen arrived at the store on January 6 and \u2018talked a great deal with Mr. Cone\u2019 and the supervisory staff in his first 5-day visit. He told them that \u2018there were certain actions, as supervisors, that they should guard against,\u2019 including threats and promises to employees; and he promised to \u2018try to keep the supervisors informed as to what was taking place, and * * * would also communicate what was taking place to the employees in the store.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-10\">\u201cAllen returned to the store the following week (January 13-15), as well as on January 29-31, February 4-7, March 5 or 6, and April 3. Admittedly, he never previously visited the store, explaining, T was never informed of any morale problem\u2019 or other problems. Allen testified that he would circulate among employees in the shipping and receiving department, introducing himself as \u2018Greg Allen out of the Personnel Department from Chicago,\u2019 inform them of the Union\u2019s recognition demand, and ask \u2018how things were going, how they were getting along, or what their job was, what they were doing.\u2019 According to Allen, \u2018whenever the employee had finished with whatever he wanted to talk about [he] just thanked him and walked away,\u2019 in each case volunteering that he \u2018was not interested in their feelings about the union * * * one way or another.\u2019 These conversations, confined to the shipping and receiving employees \u2018amongst\u2019 whom the Union claimed recognition, took place at or around the employees\u2019 work area, close to other working employees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-13\">\u201cAllen further testified that as a result of these conversations he became aware of \u2018a lot of various complaints\u2019 since the employees told him \u2018of many problems.\u2019 According to Allen, he never informed any employee \u2018that I was there to rectify complaints,\u2019 nor that he was going to report the grievances. However, he in fact reported these complaints to Cone or Operating Superintendent Sheer, and \u2018in some cases\u2019 Cone told him what, if anything, he had done regarding them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-14\">\u201cPersonnel Staff Assistant Bennett of the Midwestern (Chicago) Personnel Department also visited the Livonia store during the weeks of January 4 and 13. He, like Allen, had never previously visited that store. Bennett testified that his supervisor in Chicago (Robinson) \u2018indicated to me he felt there were some morale problems in the Livonia store, and he asked me to visit the store to evaluate if there were morale problems.\u2019 Like Allen, Bennett expressed the view that \u2018an employee\u2019s concern and interest\u2019 in unionism \u2018could be\u2019 a \u2018reflection of a morale problem\u2019; and he \u2018specifically did not visit the Livonia store in the past because [he] felt there were no serious morale problems.\u2019 Bennett reported to Robinson his finding \u2018that some of our employees had indicated to me dissatisfaction with some parts of their work.\u2019 He testified that he probably also made a report to Store Manager Cone.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>There was evidence that supervisory-people were in the habit of making frequent inquiries of employees as to how things were going, alert to discover justified dissatisfaction. Each new employee of Sears was given a booklet called \u201cGetting Acquainted With Sears.\u201d Under a paragraph entitled \u201cOpportunity to Express Yourself,\u201d employees were invited to take up their problems with supervision. They were told:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-4\">\u201cThere may be times when you want advice on a problem or an answer to a question. Usually, your immediate supervisor will be able to help you. If not, feel free to take your problem to somebody else \u2014 the personnel department, for example. In some locations, there may not be a designated personnel department, but the store manager, assistant manager, or supervisor will help you in every way possible. Any matters you wish to discuss will be considered confidential and will be handled impartially.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">One employee, upon inquiry by the Chicago man as to how things were going, complained that he had not had a promotion in five years. This was reported to the Livonia supervision, and after an investigation, the employee was given a job in selling which was more to his liking. There is no evidence that this employee had ever complained to a supervisor or requested a change of job. Other alleged misconduct by Sears consisted in improving working conditions such as better lighting, providing a lift hoist, better heating, more protective clothing and adding one man to the work force on the loading dock. The evidence showed that some of the corrections and changes had already been scheduled, some were seasonal, and others were the product of fresh suggestions from employees. The trial examiner observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-6\">\u201cRespondent adduced evidence purporting to show that maintenance of equipment throughout the store was a continuing practice. Store Manager Cone testified that equipment installed when the store opened (Fall 1964) was being replaced or repaired \u2018with increasing frequency\u2019 and new equipment was being added \u2018because of the rapid growth of business.\u2019 Cone\u2019s testimony is supported by Company records, including budgets for capital and maintenance expenditures. \u201cCone testified on various improvements made before advent of the Union as a result of suggestions and complaints by employees as well as managerial officials. Thus, as a result of \u2018a congested, cramped operation causing complaints of the employees,\u2019 he had \u2018doubled the size\u2019 of the receiving office in 1965 and he enlarged it again in 1968. Similar complaints regarding \u2018overcrowded conditions\u2019 and \u2018inability to move merchandise\u2019 from the dock to stockroom led him in 1968 to a decision to enlarge that facility. Facilities other than the shipping and receiving department here directly involved were remodeled, revamped, or refurnished in early 1969 \u2014 including retail division 4265 (plumbing, heating, and kitchen-planning), men\u2019s store, women\u2019s and children\u2019s shoes, girls\u2019 department, male employees\u2019 lounge, and major appliances \u2014 some prompted by \u2018expressed dissatisfaction\u2019 of employees, others by business growth, and still others by \u2018development of new ways for presenting merchandise.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-8\">\u201cCone testified that in the past he learned of employee \u2018problems\u2019 through his operating superintendent (Sheer) and other supervisors in daily contact with employees, as well as from employees directly while walking through the store. Employee Pike testified that \u2018You could just go upstairs and ask to see Mr. Sheer or Mr. Cone and tell them your complaints,\u2019 but Pike later qualified this by stating that he \u2018just assumed this.\u2019 Employee Smith indicated that in the 5 years he had been with the Company no management representative or supervisor ever approached him \u2018to solicit\u2019 complaints, prior to Allen\u2019s ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>tioning following the advent of the Union. Sherman, who had worked for the Company for about 5 years and Graczyk a total of about 3 years, testified to the same effect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">There was no evidence that the complaints and suggestions made to the Chicago personnel people had ever been made to a supervisor at Livonia. Most of the complaints to the Chicago people were not acted on; no changes in wages were made. The trial examiner said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARJ\">\u201cAllen testified that many of the employee complaints and problems raised in his conversations were not acted upon by management. Among these were alleged low wages and method of handling merit wage increases; Saturday overtime; fully paid hospitalization and maternity benefits; insufficient help in the supply room, customer pickup desk, and on trucks; onerous or unsavory duties such as unloading tires and portering; and condition of facilities, such as slippery dock surface and no lock on a marking ticket cabinet.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">The record before us does not disclose that Sears had any history of anti-unionism. Upon review of the record we find that only one employee had signed a union card and out of the remaining employees in the involved department only Sherman appears to have been interested in the Teamsters Union. Further there is no evidence that any of the persons who made complaints which were satisfied by supervision were union protagonists or that the action taken by Sears was anything other than designed to promote good relations with its people or was unprecedented.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">The trial examiner\u2019s conclusion was that the company sought to \u201cpersuade employees to <em>abandon support for the Union.\u201d </em>The record does not indicate that there was any \u201csupport for the Union\u201d in the department involved. The examiner goes on to say that what Sears \u201ccould and did reasonably lead <em>dissatisfied </em>employees to conclude that but for the Union drive complaints would have remained unalleviated.\u201d This is gratuitous and without evidentiary support. The examiner further said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-9\">\u201cFor like reasons I do not regard as decisive the circumstance that General Counsel\u2019s evidence on the unlawful conduct is confined to the shipping and receiving employees and does not extend to the automotive and maintenance departments in which the Union also sought representation. <em>The fact is that the shipping and receiving department was the object of the Union\u2019s organizational drive. </em>For aught that appears, the Union supporters were concentrated in that department, the conditions there lent themselves to correction more readily than in other departments, and Respondent was more concerned about organization of the shipping and receiving employees than of others.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">Except for a telegram and petition asking for an election and bargaining rights there is no evidence of any \u201corganizational drive.\u201d The words \u201c[f]or aught that appears\u201d seems to imply that the company had to negative facts that <em>might, but did not, appear </em>in the evidence. The General Counsel has the initial burden of proving the charges made. N. L. R. B. v. Murray Ohio Co., 6 Cir., 326 F.2d 509. We there said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-11\">\u201cThe burden was on the general counsel to prove its case against defendant by a preponderance of the evidence. N. L. R. B. v. Cleveland Trust Co., 214 F.2d 95, 99 (CA 6, 1954); Lawson Milk Co. v. N. L. R. B., 317 F.2d 756, 760 (CA 6, 1963). This burden, of course, may be met by drawing legitimate inferences from established facts and it is the Board\u2019s exclusive province to make such legitimate inferences. N. L. R. B. v. Wiltse, 188 F.2d 917, 925 (CA 6, 1951); N. L. R. B. v. Ford, 170 F.2d 735, 739 (CA 6, 1948) ; N. L. R. B. v. Link-Belt Co., 311 U.S. 584, 596-597, 61 S.Ct. 358, 85 L.Ed. 368, 378; N. L. R. B. v. Nevada Consolidated Copper Corp., 316 U.S. 105, 107, 62 S.Ct. 690, 86 L.Ed. 1305, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>1307. But the Board\u2019s power to draw inferences is not beyond all judicial control, and upon the courts is cast the responsibility of determining whether a Board finding of fact, based on inference or otherwise, is supported by substantial evidence, when viewed on the record as a whole. Universal Camera Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456.\u201d 326 F.2d at 513.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">There can, of course, be situations where proof of certain facts east the burden upon the employer of going forward with opposing evidence. N. L. R. B. v. Brown, 380 U.S. 278, 85 S.Ct. 980, 13 L.Ed.2d 839 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">This is not such a case, and the Supreme Court there concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-6\">\u201cBut where, as here, the tendency to discourage union membership is comparatively slight, and the employers\u2019 conduct is reasonably adapted to achieve legitimate business ends or to deal with business exigencies, we enter into an area <em>where the improper motivation of the employers must be established by independent evidence. </em>When so established, antiunion motivation will convert an otherwise ordinary business act into an unfair labor practice. National Labor Relations Board v. Erie Resistor Corp., <em>supra, </em>373 U.S. [221] at 227, 83 S.Ct. 1139 [10 L.Ed.2d 308], and cases there cited.\u201d 380 U.S. at 287-288, 85 S.Ct. at 986. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">A telegram from the Teamsters, or other union, demanding bargaining rights, would indeed suggest to an employer the possible impairment of its own good relations with its employees. We are not persuaded that from that moment on the employer must desist from any effort to find out whether there is a morale problem. The management did nothing to suggest to its employees that a union would be unwelcome, and its representatives made clear that joining a union was their own affair. There is no evidence from which a legitimate inference could be drawn that reprisals would be visited upon anyone for union activity. It would be intolerable if an employer, from the moment of a union demand for bargaining rights, would be required to desist from making, corrections needed to be made. There is no evidence to support an inference that but for the union\u2019s telegram the employer Sears would have left un-correeted anything that needed correction. It Yrauld be grossly violative of the rule of <em>Universal Camera </em>to allow the General Counsel to hypothesize a case without evidentiary support and then ask an employer to overcome the unsupported hypothesis. The Board\u2019s findings are not supported by substan-cial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">Enforcement is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
