He asserted district court jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343 and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Attached to his complaint was a motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-24\">The record does not indicate that the district court acted upon the motion to proceed in forma pauperis, nor was process issued and served. Instead, the district court, proceeding <em>sua sponte, </em>entered an order dismissing the action, ap-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>paren tly with prejudice, on the ground that \u201cthe complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action or upon which the court can grant any relief. * * *\u201d Plaintiff, who is a California state prisoner, was not given notice that dismissal of the action was in contemplation and had no opportunity to file a memorandum in opposition to such action. The district court did not state reasons why the complaint fails to state a claim, and dismissal of the action precluded plaintiff from filing an amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">In all of these respects, plaintiff was not accorded the procedural rights to which he was entitled. <em>See </em>Potter v. McCall, 433 F.2d 1087 (9th Cir. 1970), and cases there cited. A sense of \u201cfair play\u201d and considerations of judicial economy dictate that the procedures outlined in <em>Potter </em>be followed. Had plaintiff been told why his complaint was deficient perhaps he would not have appealed, and had process been issued and served, the appeal we have would not have been <em>ex parte. </em>There is no answering brief and, so far as we know, defendant Veterans Administration knows nothing about this lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
