At oral argument counsel for appellant withdrew the appeal as to claim 4. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-21\">\n<em>The Subject Matter Claimed</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b964-22\">So far as is relevant here, claim 14 recites a laminate \u201ccomprising at least one metal foil barrier layer and a stiffening layer of thermodegradable material\u201d with a weakening line \u201cin\u201d the stiffening layer \u201cin the form of a line of thermal degradation.\u201d Similarly, claim 15 recites a laminate \u201ccomprising two spaced metal foil layers and an intermediate stiffening layer of thermodegradable material * * * having a line of thermal degradation\u201d along a predetermined tear line.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-23\">\n<em>The Rejection</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b964-24\">Claims 14 and 15 have been rejected as obvious in view of Barnes et al., U. S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>patent No. 2,830,001, issued April 8, 1958, which discloses three-ply, laminated packaging material having tear strips embossed therein. The outer plies are of metal foil, bonded together by \u201ca thin, flexible, non-tacky layer of an adhesive material.\u201d Barnes et al. indicate that their intermediate adhesive layer may be composed of either a thermoset-ting resin adhesive or a thermoplastic resin adhesive and that it may \u201chave some resilience\u201d but \u201cshould not be hard or brittle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">The examiner reasoned that appellant\u2019s characterization of one layer of his laminate as a \u201cstiffening layer\u201d did not distinguish it from the reference disclosure because the intermediate layer therein \u201cin the absence of any difference structurally must inherently function as disclosed and claimed, namely [,] as a stiffening layer to some degree.\u201d The board agreed, adding that \u201cit is obvious from the description of the adhesive by patentees * * * [as having \u201csome resilence\u201d in some embodiments] that a stiffening effect is present.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b965-7\">As to the recitation in each claim on appeal that the weakening lines bounding the tear strip were formed by \u201cthermal degradation,\u201d the board held that appellant\u2019s language \u201cexpresses * * * [no] difference over the lines of the patent\u201d because it \u201cmerely means that the layer has been made thinner at the tear lines while in a softened or molten state * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b965-9\">Appellant argues that \u201cthe word \u2018stiffening\u2019 was clearly presented to distinguish over the \u2018thin, flexible, non-tacky layer of an adhesive\u2019 forming the [intermediate] layer 12 of the Barnes et al laminate.\u201d Basically, he argues that the intermediate layer in the reference imparted \u201cno stiffening\u201d to the prior-art laminate and that therefore the inclusion of the word \u201cstiffening,\u201d with no further particularization, was sufficient to avoid the reference. However, as the solicitor points out, \u201cthe metal foil contemplated by the patent is a very thin and extremely flexible material * * jn the two examples given, the foil is soft aluminum 0.0005 inches thick \u2014 which is the same order of magnitude contemplated by appellant. Since, by definition, a \u201cstiffening layer\u201d may be one that merely <em>increases </em>stiffness,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> the flexible, possibly resilient, but not hard or brittle resin adhesive employed by Barnes et al. would inherently \u201cstiffen\u201d the metal foil layers to a substantial degree. Furthermore, although appellant\u2019s claims do not recite thickness for the various layers of his laminates, we note that the adhesive layers shown in the drawings of the reference are approximately as thick relative to the layers of foil as the intermediate layers shown in appellant's own drawings. In sum, we agree with the examiner that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-12\">If the thickness of the stiffening layer is a critical aspect in the laminated structure claimed[,] appellant has failed both to disclose such thickness or to claim any thickness different from that shown by Barnes et al.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b965-13\">Accordingly, we hold the inclusion of the word \u201cstiffening\u201d to be insufficient to distinguish the subject matter claimed by appellant from the prior art.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-14\">Concerning the recitation that the weakening lines have been formed by \u201cthermal degradation,\u201d appellant argues that the Board of Appeals \u201cerred grossly\u201d in affirming the rejection because it did so on the \u201cspeculative assumption\u201d that the controverted language \u201cmerely means that the [thermodegradable] lay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>er has been made thinner at the tear lines while in a softened or molten state * * On the contrary, appellant argues, the phrase \u201cthermal degradation\u201d means that the stiffening layer has been \u201cheat weakened\u201d along the desired line, although he concedes that \u201cthinning of the stiffening layer * * * occurs\u201d as the tear line is thermoformed.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-8\">The solicitor argues for the Patent Office that the controverted phrase is a \u25a0 process limitation and that it is \u201cwell settled that the presence of process limitations in product claims, which product does not otherwise patentably distinguish over the prior art, cannot impart patentability to that product,\u201d which language he quotes from In re Stephens, 345 F.2d 1020, 1023, 52 CCPA 1409, 1412 (1965). True enough, but the question in such a case is always whether the product so formed <em>does </em>otherwise patentably distinguish over the prior art. Here appellant asserts that it does, and no doubt it does distinguish in the sense that weakening lines such as he discloses and claims are not <em>identically </em>disclosed in the prior art. <em>Embossing </em>tear lines onto a given laminate at ambient temperature would not have the effect of heat weakening a layer consisting of thermodegradable material, whereas the method taught by appellant would. However, the rejection is not under section 102 but under section 103, and the weakening lines in the prior art laminates appear to be structurally very similar to appellant\u2019s weakening lines. Under the circumstances, we conclude that the Patent Office has made out a prima facie case of obviousness and that it thereupon became incumbent upon appellant to rebut it, if he could, by objective evidence of non-obviousness. In re Antle, 58 CCPA 1383, 444 F.2d 1168, 1172 (1971). This he has not done. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the board as to claims 14 and 15. As to claim 4, the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b965-15\"> According to The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (1969), the verb \u201cstiffen,\u201d when used transitively, means \u201cTo make stiff <em>or stiffer.\" </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
