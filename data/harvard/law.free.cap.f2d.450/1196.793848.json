They directly own and operate a hotel, the Cockatoo Inn. The Locoeos\u2019 home is located on property adjoining the hotel and restaurant complex.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-5\">In December 1968, a federal grand jury was convened in Los Angeles to investigate interstate wagering, bookmaking, loan sharking, bribery, and sporting contests. On April 11 and June 19, 1969, two grand jury witnesses implicated Lococo in bookmaking. Prior to Lo-coco\u2019s appearance, the grand jury was informed that Mirr had been involved in interstate gambling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-6\">On June 26, 1969, Lococo appeared before the grand jury. He was initially informed that the grand jury was investigating \u201cpossible violations of the Federal laws relating to interstate wagering activity, interstate transportation and aid of racketeering, bribery and sporting contests, and possible other Federal offenses.\u201d After Lococo recited his name, address, and occupation, the grand jury explained that it was \u201cconcerned with a series of fixed horse races that were run in the State of California during the past year.\u201d Lococo denied any knowledge of or profit from the races. Lococo was later asked if he knew several different people. He admitted friendship with Ray Mirr whom he had known since his childhood in Milwaukee, but he said that he had not spoken to Mirr within the past year.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-17\">After completing his testimony, Loco-co examined his restaurant\u2019s telephone bills and discovered a large number of calls to Milwaukee where Mirr lived and worked. Lococo tried unsuccessfully to contact his brother Nick Lococo (\u201cNick\u201d). Nick spent most of his time in and around the Cockatoo. The following day Lococo flew to Milwaukee where he met Mirr. The substance of their conversations, reiterated by Mirr to the grand jury in July 1969, was that Mirr reminded Lococo that Lococo had called him a few times in 1968 and that Mirr told him that Nick had called him many times. Over Lococo\u2019s objection based on an assertion of his Fifth Amendment privilege, the grand jury ordered him to turn over the Cockatoo\u2019s telephone and travel records.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-18\">In August 1969, Lococo\u2019s lawyers discussed his testimony with the United States Attorney who offered to let Lococo reappear before the grand jury, but who also admonished Locoeo\u2019s counsel that correction of any errors in the testimony would not benefit Lococo.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Counsel then advised Lococo not to reappear. Lococo\u2019s indictment for perjury followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-19\">Lococo's conviction cannot be sustained unless his false testimony was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1199\">*1199</page-number>material to the grand jury\u2019s investigation. (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621; United States v. Edmondson (5th Cir. 1969) 410 F.2d 670, 672-673, cert, denied 396 U.S. 966, 90 S.Ct. 444, 24 L.Ed.2d 430; United States v. McFarland (2d Cir. 1966) 371 F.2d 701, 703, cert, denied (1967) 387 U.S. 906, 87 S.Ct. 1689, 18 L.Ed.2d 624.) He contends that the grand jury was investigating fixed horse races in California and related wagering and that his testimony was immaterial to that investigation because the Government did not offer evidence connecting his calls to that subject matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-5\">Lococo\u2019s emphasis on the Government's failure to show a nexus between his calls to Mirr and the California races is misplaced. The Government was not obliged to prove the connection in order to establish materiality. <em>(See </em>United States v. Dippolito (9th Cir. 1970) 433 F.2d 1049, 1050, cert, denied (1971) 401 U.S. 940, 91 S.Ct. 939, 28 L.Ed.2d 220 (1971).) False testimony before a grand jury is material if it \u201chas a natural tendency to influence the Grand Jury in its investigation\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 1050); the Government need not prove that the perjured testimony actually impeded the investigation (Vitello v. United States (9th Cir. 1970) 425 F.2d 416, 424, cert, denied (1970) 400 U.S. 822, 91 S.Ct. 43, 27 L.Ed.2d 50). Moreover, false testimony that tends to influence the grand jury need not be directed to the primary subject of the investigation; it is material if it is relevant to any subsidiary issue under consideration by the tribunal. (Barnes v. United States (5th Cir. 1967) 378 F.2d 646, 649, cert, denied (1969) 390 U.S. 972, 88 S.Ct. 1056, 19 L.Ed.2d 1184; <em>see </em>United States v. Stone (2d Cir. 1970) 429 F.2d 138, 140; Blackmon v. United States (5th Cir. 1940) 108 F.2d 572, 573-574.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-6\">Prior to Lococo\u2019s appearance, the grand jury had been told that Lococo was engaged in bookmaking and that Mirr was a gambler. Had Lococo admitted that he had telephoned Mirr, his testimony, considered with the other information before the grand jury, might have supplied a link between Mirr and an alleged California gambler bearing on the interstate gambling activities that the grand jury was probing. Loeoco\u2019s false statements curbed the flow of information to the grand jury. <em>We </em>cannot say that his diversion did not tend to influence the investigation. His testimony was material.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1257-7\">We turn to Lococo\u2019s claims of error in the admission of evidence. His first contention requires little comment. He argues that the Fifth Amendment privilege should be extended to the records of a corporation when the corporation is wholly owned by the witness asserting the privilege and his wife. We have rejected that argument in Fineberg v. United States (9th Cir. 1968) 393 F.2d 417; Wild v. Brewer (9th Cir. 1964) 329 F.2d 924, cert, denied (1964) 379 U.S. 914, 85 S.Ct. 262, 13 L.Ed.2d 185, to which decisions we adhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-8\">Next he contends that there was prejudicial error in admitting records of 83 out of the 90 calls listed to Mirr\u2019s telephone numbers billed to the Cockatoo\u2019s number. Lococo admitted that he made 7 of the 90 calls.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He argues that the records of all the calls, except those 7, were inadmissible because the Government failed to lay the necessary foundation for their admission against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-9\">The records of the calls were inadmissible in absence of proof that Lococo made the calls or caused them to be made. There was no direct proof that Lococo made more than the 7 identified calls. Of course, circumstantial evidence may be used to identify a de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1200\">*1200</page-number>fendant as the caller. (United States v. Roselli (9th Cir. 1970) 432 F.2d 879, cert, denied (1971) (401 U.S. 924; Car-bo v. United States (9th Cir 1963) 314 F.2d 718, cert, denied Palermo v. United States, (1964) 377 U.S. 953, 84 S.Ct. 1625, 12 L.Ed.2d 498.) For example, there may be evidence of conduct by a defendant or by others so tied to the telephone calls that a discernible pattern emerges by which the identity of the caller is revealed, as in <em>Roselli, </em>or there may be travel records that tend to identify the caller, as is true of two of the admitted calls in this case,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or access to the particular phone may be so limited that there is high probability that one person placed the calls. The overwhelming majority of the listed calls were not connected to Loeoco by anything other than the telephone numbers themselves. Access to the Cockatoo number was not limited to Lococo. Indeed, the uncontra-dicted evidence was that Nick had the use of that telephone and that Nick called Mirr at least once a week and sometimes daily. There was no evidence that Nick was acting under Lococo\u2019s direction in placing those calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-4\">Was the error in admitting the bulk of the records prejudicial? Under the circumstances of this case, we think that that is an issue the district court should first consider. The critical issue was whether or not Lococo deliberately lied when he told the grand jury that he had not talked to Mirr during the prior year.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-5\">Had Lococo made 90 calls to Mirr during that time, rather than 7, it is inconceivable that he could have been honestly mistaken in his testimony before the grand jury. The quantity of calls was considered by the district court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1258-6\">Aside from the volume of calls, the circumstantial evidence upon the intent issue was delicately balanced. Lococo points to evidence that he made many long-distance calls every day in the course of his business, to support an inference that he forgot about the few admitted calls. He also refers to his abortive efforts to correct his testimony, to the somewhat confusing line of interrogation that preceded his false statements, and to the testimony of several prominent character witnesses who testified on his behalf. The Government draws contrary inferences from Lococo\u2019s other conduct. We think the district court should determine whether it finds the admission of the records of a large number of \u201cunidentified\u201d phone calls was or was not a crucial element in his weighing the evidence against Lococo. In other words, was there <em>other </em>evidence sufficient to convict, beyond a reasonable doubt?</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-11\">The cause is remanded temporarily to the district court judge to permit him to place his findings and conclusions in writing, certify them to this court, and return the record, so augmented, to this court. On this remand the entire record shall be returned to the trial court. Upon the receipt of the clerk of this court of the entire augmented record, the appeal will again be forthwith submitted to this same panel, without further argument, unless later ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-12\">Order</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-13\">This court has reviewed the district court\u2019s findings and conclusions made upon limited remand of the cause. Upon the basis of those findings, this court concludes that error in the admission. of the telephone records was not prejudicial and that the admissible evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction. The judgment is ordered affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1255-17\">. Lococo was indicted for giving the following testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1255-34\">\u201cQ.

If Lococo intentionally lied to the grand jury, his later recantation would not erase the perjury (United States v. Norris (1937) 300 U.S. 564, 57 S.Ct. 432, 81 L.Ed. 859), but willingness to correct a misstatement is relevant to the issue of intent (Beckanstin v. United States (5th Cir. 1956) 232 F.2d 1; United States v. Geller (S.D.N.Y.1957) 154 F.Supp. 727).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1257-10\">. Materiality is tested as of the time the investigation is being made. Later proof that a truthful statement would not have helped the grand jury does not render the false testimony immaterial. United States v. Stone (2d Cir. 1970) 429 F.2d 138; United States v. McFarland, <em>supra, </em>371 F.2d at 703-704; United States v.

There was evidence that several of the calls were about football games; at least one of them concerned a requested $500 loan to Mirr; two calls were made about hotel accommodations for Mirr\u2019s relatives.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1258-7\">. Travel records suggested at least a possibility that 3 other calls might be attributed to Loeoco.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1258-8\">. The case was tried by the court without a jury. While considering the evidence, the court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1258-9\">\u201cThe defendant is guilty, it would seem to me, without looking at all the other calls made although if they tend to prove anything, and I am not saying how strongly they do, they do tend to show that numerous, numerous, numerous calls were made from Mr. Lococo\u2019s number. That not all of those, as the witness Mirr has said, even as the defendant himself will admit, came from Nick. And there wouldn\u2019t have been anybody else we know of that could have or would have called Mr. Mirr.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
