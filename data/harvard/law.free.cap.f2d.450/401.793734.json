Puddu, and his licensee, Puddu &amp; Martinelli, Inc., a New York corporation of which he is the sole stockholder, appeal from an order of the District Court for the Southern District of New York dismissing two complaints wherein they sought relief with respect to the defendant\u2019s alleged infringement of 12 copyrights owned by Puddu relating to statuettes of elves carrying drums, mandolins, flutes, violins and harps. Four of these copyrights concerned a line marketed by plaintiffs in 1964; the others concerned a line marketed in 1965.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Judge Tyler dismissed the complaints on two independent grounds. He considered that the copyrighted statuettes were not sufficiently different from a 1963 uncopy-righted line as to possess the originality required for a copyright. Alternatively he held that the statuettes did not carry notices of copyright adequate to comply with 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">Although \u201c[t]he Copyright Act nowhere expressly invokes the requirement of originality,\u201d courts have uniformly inferred this from the constitutional and statutory condition of authorship. Nimmer, Copyright, \u00a7 10 at 32 (1971 ed.). However, originality has been considered to mean \u201conly that the work owes its origin to the author, i. e., is independently created and not copied from other works.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 11 at 33 (footnote omitted). Plaintiffs\u2019 employee, Metcalf testified without contradiction that he had sculpted all the copyrighted statuettes \u201cfrom scratch.\u201d While there is a strong family resemblance between the copyrighted and the uncopyright'ed models, the differences suffice to satisfy the modest requirement of originality laid down by the Supreme Court in Bleistein v. Donaldson Lithographing Co., 188 U.S. 239, 250, 252, 23 S.Ct. 298, 47 L.Ed. 460 (1903) and by this court in Alfred Bell &amp; Co. v. Catalda Fine Arts, Inc., 191 F.2d 99 (2 Cir. 1951), and Mill worth Converting Corp. v. Slifka, 276 F.2d 443, 444-445 (2 Cir. 1960). While the district court made much of the fact that ..defendant\u2019s statuettes differ from the copyrighted models in minor respects, that does not carry the day for the defendant unless the differences are sufficient to negate infringement. The tests for eligibility for copyright and avoidance of infringement are not the same. Originality sufficient for copyright protection exists if the \u201cauthor\u201d has introduced any element of novelty as contrasted with the material previously known to him. Introduction of a similar element by the copier of a copyrighted design will not avoid liability for infringement if \u201cthe ordinary observer, unless he set out to detect the disparities, would be disposed to overlook them, and regard their aesthetic appeal as the same.\u201d Peter Pan Fabrics, Inc. v. Martin Weiner Corp., 274 F.2d 487, 489 (2 Cir. 1960). While in the <em>Millworth </em>case we found the differences in the accused product sufficient to negate infringement, we do not read the district court\u2019s opinion as making that finding here, and since none of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>statuettes in suit have been exhibited to us, see <em>infra, </em>we cannot find this on our own.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">While we thus cannot hold that the plaintiff\u2019s statuettes lacked that modicum of originality necessary for copyright protection, we sustain the district court\u2019s decision on the alternate ground there advanced. Section 10 of the Copyright Act provides that any person entitled thereto \u201cmay secure copyright for his work by publication thereof with the notice of copyright required by this title; and such notice shall be affixed to each copy thereof published or offered for sale in the United States by authority of the copyright proprietor. * * * \u201d Section 19 of the Copyright Act, as amended in 1954, provides in pertinent part: <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-8\">The notice of copyright required by section 10 of this title shall consist either of the word \u201cCopyright\u201d, the abbreviation \u201cCopr.\u201d, or the symbol <em>\u201c\u00a9\u201d, </em>accompanied by the name of the copyrighted proprietor, and if the work be a printed literary, musical, or dramatic work, the notice shall include also the year in which the copyright was secured by publication. In the case, however, of copies of works specified in subsections (f) to (k), inclusive, of section 5 of this title, the notice may consist of the letter C enclosed within a circle, thus \u00a9, accompanied by the initials, monogram, mark, or symbol of the copyright proprietor: <em>Provided, </em>that on some accessible portion of such copies or of the margin, back, permanent base, or pedestal, or of the substance on which such copies shall be mounted, his name shall appear. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0r\">In Herbert Rosenthal Jewelry Corp. v. Grossbardt, 436 F.2d 315, 317-319 (2 Cir. 1970), our latest discussion of questions like those raised here, which was not cited in the briefs of either side, we pointed out that the 1954 amendment of the first sentence of \u00a7 19, made for another purpose, had the unintended effect of enabling copyright holders to argue that trademarks or initials could qualify under the first sentence, although the clear antinomy in the second sentence made it apparent that, in order to satisfy that, the full name must somewhere appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">The district court found that plaintiffs endeavored to comply with \u00a7 19 in their 1964 line by placing on the base of each statuette \u201cARP\u201d and a \u00a9 and embossing on the back of each elf additional markings, \u201cpresumably purporting to be the name, Angelo R. Puddu, but which I cannot decipher, even with the aid of a powerful reading glass.\u201d On April 2, 1964, Puddu had filed with the New York County Clerk a certificate of doing business under the name of \u201cARP.\u201d In the case of the 1965 line, plaintiffs simply embossed on the back of each elf \u201cARP\u201d with a \u201c\u00a9\u201d. The judge found that this was legible only as a result of what he had learned and seen in four days of trial, and also that, in the case of both lines, the material embossed on the back \u201ccannot be observed until the clothing is partially removed, no easy task for a male of the species who is unsophisticated in the fine arts of pinning brocade and other fabrics.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">Subject to the point discussed at the end of this opinion, these findings dispose of the claims with respect to the 1965 line unless they are clearly erroneous. See Nimmer, Copyright \u00a7 88.2 and cases cited in notes 180 and 181. Although one would have supposed that, on an appeal such as this, counsel would have had the copyrighted and the accused statuettes in court, they did not. When we asked to see the copyrighted statuettes that had been received in evidence, appellant\u2019s counsel undertook to produce them. He later advised us that they had been lost but that he would furnish others; appellee objected to our considering these. Even if we were to consider the example of the 1965 line so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>produced, we could not fault the findings of the district judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">This leaves the 1964 line, with respect to which the court seems to have found the ARP marking on the base to be legible, although the supposed name on the back was not.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We noted in Herbert Rosenthal Jewelry Corp. v. Grossbardt, <em>supra, </em>436 F.2d at 318, that \u201cSince the 1954 amendment, there have been numerous holdings that the use of a well-advertised or widely known trademark or trade name on the copyrighted article itself will suffice even though no attempt is made to include the proprietor\u2019s true name on the base, pedestal, etc.\u201d In support of this we cited the cases mainly relied upon by the appellants. But these cases are clearly inapplicable here, since there was no proof that ARP was \u201ca well-advertised or widely known trademark or trade name.\u201d Turning to the issue here presented, \u201cwhether mere initials can constitute an acceptable substitute for the proprietor\u2019s name, thus satisfying the first sentence of \u00a7 19,\u201d we found that \u201cthe decisions are not so clear.\u201d We noted that Uneeda Doll Co. v. Goldfarb Novelty Co., 373 F.2d 851 (2 Cir.), cert, dismissed, 389 U.S. 801, 88 S.Ct. 9, 19 L.Ed.2d 56 (1967), rested on the ground that the <em>second </em>sentence of \u00a7 19 had been complied with by printing the full name of the copyright holder on the box and that the court had refrained from deciding whether imprinting \u201cU.D.Co.\u201d on the sole of a doll\u2019s foot would alone constitute sufficient compliance. We also noted that the decision in Tennessee Fabricating Co. v. Moultrie Mfg. Co., 421 F.2d 279 (5 Cir.), cert, denied, 398 U.S. 928, 90 S.Ct. 1819, 26 L.Ed.2d 91 (1970), upholding the sufficiency of \u201cTFC Co.\u201d rested on the facts that the copyright had been registered in the name of the plaintiff \u201cd/b/a TFC Co.\u201d and that all the advertising put in evidence by the plaintiff bore that trademark \u2014 factors also not present here. Our own decision relied primarily on Rosenthal\u2019s having been a long established and well-known jewelry house which had used \u201cHR\u201d as a trade name or mark for nearly 20 years before the infringement, and had applied for trademark registration before and had received it only shortly after sale of the accused products had begun. There is no corresponding proof with respect to \u201cARP\u201d.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A brochure with respect to the 1964 line handed to us at the argument gave the name of the manufacturer as Puddu &amp; Martinelli and used \u201cARP\u201d only after the words \u201c\u00a9\u201d 1964 and this on a page containing pictures of statuettes wholly different from those here in suit. The filing of a certificate permitting Puddu to do business under the assumed name of \u201cARP\u201d is a long way from the proof held sufficient in these prior cases. We thus cannot say that, even as to the 1964 line, the appellant has complied, \u201cin substance\u201d with the requirements of \u00a7 19. National Comics Publications, Inc. v. Fawcett Publications, Inc., 191 F.2d 594, 602-603 (2 Cir. 1951); Herbert Rosenthal Jewelry Corp. v. Grossbardt, <em>supra, </em>436 F.2d at 319.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">Appellants argue finally that full compliance with \u00a7 19 is unnecessary since, as a result of an earlier unsuccessful unfair competition suit by them in the state courts, defendant had become aware of the identity of \u201cARP\u201d before it allegedly copied the copyrighted statuettes. In Herbert Rosenthal Jewelry Corp. v. Grossbardt, <em>supra, </em>436 F.2d at 319, we indicated skepticism with respect to the broad dictum in the per curiam opinion in Dan Kasoff, Inc. v. Novelty Jewelry Co., 309 F.2d 745, 746 (2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>Cir. 1962), that defendants who are \u201cwholly aware of the existence of copyright\u201d can never \u201cassert insufficiency of copyright notice.\u201d That and similar statements in district court opinions fail to take adequate account of the plain language of \u00a7 10 and also of Thompson v. Hubbard, 131 U.S. 123, 9 S.Ct. 710, 33 L.Ed. 76 (1889). The Supreme Court there held that, under the Copyright Act of 1874, failure to state the name of the copyright holder was fatal even in the extreme case of an infringement action against a previous owner of the copyright which had transferred it to the plaintiff. The Court said, \u201cThis right of action, as well as the copyright itself, is wholly statutory, and the means of securing any right of action in Hubbard [the plaintiff] are only those prescribed by congress.\u201d 131 U.S. at 151, 9 S.Ct. at 720 (citations omitted). Although the Act of 1874 made the notice a condition of bringing an action for infringement rather than of copyright, we cannot perceive that to be a material distinction; indeed the Court in <em>Hubbard </em>cited earlier copyright acts where, as in the present statute, notice was made a condition on the copyright itself.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>Al-though Professor Nimmer states that even illegible notices may be good \u201cas against infringers who managed to decipher them or who should have been put on inquiry by the illegible printing, or who had actual notice of the plaintiff\u2019s copyright,\u201d Nimmer, Copyright \u00a7 90.4, only three of the seven decisions cited,\u00ae can be said to support this proposition. Whatever may be the precise scope of the principle on which the appellants rely, it does not go so far as to confer copyright protection when the \u201cname\u201d of the copyright holder is so illegible and the initials are so far from constituting a name, as the district court permissibly found here.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b460-10\">. The complaints also contained claims of unfair competition. Plaintiffs do not dispute that even if the copyright claims were sufficiently \u201csubstantial\u201d to afford a basis for pendent jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338, the unfair competition claims must fail under Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Stiffel Co., 376 U.S. 225, 84 S.Ct. 784, 11 L.Ed.2d 661 (1964) and Compeo Corp. v. Day-Brite Lighting Co., Inc., 376 U.S. 234, 84 S.Ct. 779, 11 L.Ed.2d 669 (1964), since the plaintiffs did not press a claim based on confusing label-ling but only one based on copying.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b461-12\">. The statutettes fall under \u00a7 5 (g) which includes \u201cWorks of art,\u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b462-5\">. The \u201c1964\u201d statuette submitted to us is obviously different from the one offered in evidence, since it has on the base \u201c1964\u201d preceded by a \u201c\u00a9\u201d and, underneath, \u201cAngelo R. Puddu.\u201d The latter words are certainly legible. However, we cannot predicate decision on an unauthenticated exhibit so plainly differing from the one that was before the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b462-10\">. If other requirements were satisfied, we should not suppose it to be fatal that here the initials were on the base since this was an integral part of the statuette.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b463-5\">. Contrast the less rigid provision with respect to patents, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 287.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b463-6\">. All these are by district courts: Trifari, Krussman &amp; Fisliel v. B. Steinberg-Kalso Co., 144 F.Supp. 577, 581-582 (S.D.N.Y. 1956) ; Prestige Floral, Societe Anonyme v. California Artificial Flower Co., 201 F.Supp. 287, 291 (S.D.N.Y.1962) ; Florence Art Co. v. Quartite Creative Corp., 158 U.S.P.Q. 382 (N.D.Ill.1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b463-7\">. Appellant\u2019s reliance on such eases as National Comics Publications, Inc. v. Fawcett Publications, Inc., 191 F.2d 594 (2 Cir. 1951) and Schellberg v. Empringham, 36 F.2d 991 (S.D.N.Y.1929) is entirely misplaced. Those cases, addressing themselves to what is now \u00a7 21 of the Act, turned on accidental or mistaken omissions from particular copies. Where, as in this case, nothing in the record or the district court opinion indicates that the plaintiff\u2019s notices are not uniformly inadequate, \u00a7 21 has no application. A mistake of law is not within the purview of \u00a7 21. Wildman v. New York Times Co., 42 F.Supp. 412, 417 (S.D.N.Y.1941). Deliberate use of a notice which does not meet the requirements of the Act will not be saved by \u00a7 21. Advertisers Exchange Inc. v. Anderson, 144 F.2d 907, 909 (8 Cir. 1944).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
