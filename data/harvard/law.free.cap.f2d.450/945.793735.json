He seeks review of the district court\u2019s denial of his motion, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, that his guilty plea was accepted in violation of Rule 11, F.R.Cr.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-30\">Rule 4(a), F.R.A.P., provides that notice of appeal of civil actions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>must be filed within thirty days of the entry of the judgment or order appealed from, or, if the United States is a party, within sixty days of such entry. A motion under \u00a7 2255, like a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, is an independent civil suit. Heflin v. United States, 358 U.S. 415, 418, n. 7, 79 S.Ct. 451, 3 L.Ed.2d 407 (1959). The district court\u2019s order denying appellant\u2019s motion was entered on April 2, 1970. Because notice of appeal was not filed until September 2, 1970, this court is without jurisdiction to hear this appeal. F.R.A.P. 4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">The appeal will be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
