Since then he has filed six motions under \u00a7 2255 attacking this conviction and numerous other motions attacking related convictions under which he is serving concurrent and consecutive sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-4\">Twice before White has had his cause determined by this court: White v. United States, 443 F.2d 26 (9th Cir. 1971), and White v. United States, 354 F.2d 22 (9th Cir. 1965). Both times he was denied relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">We have once again carefully reviewed White\u2019s ease and once again conclude that he has been treated fairly. His many petitions have received painstaking consideration. Relief was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
