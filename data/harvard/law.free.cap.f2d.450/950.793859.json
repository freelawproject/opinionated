Furthermore, we do not here unduly minimize the dereliction of counsel for the appellants. However, we do not think that his actions were so beyond the pale as to warrant the consequences<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> here visited on the parties he represented. While he did not appear he did attempt to contact the court and did send an attorney at the appointed time although the attorney was not in a position to participate in a pre-trial conference. We have examined the other derelictions of counsel and, while not condoning them, find them insufficient, at least in the first instance, to call for the extreme measures here invoked.</p>\n<p id=\"AlZi\">We do think that the actions of plaintiffs\u2019 counsel dictate that he personally bear the costs and reasonable counsel fees of appellees in connection with the abortive pre-trial conference as well as this appeal. The amounts shall be determined by the district court unless counsel can agree.</p>\n<p id=\"A7f\">The judgment of the district court will be reversed and the cases remanded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>for proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1009-21\">. The statute of limitations would prevent the reassertion of these claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1010-4\">HASTIE, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"APaq\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">Had I been the trial judge in these cases, I might well have imposed some sanction less severe than dismissing the actions because of the failure of counsel to comply with lawful requirements of the court. But I am not persuaded that the dismissal of the actions was an inappropriate or intolerably harsh response to the derelictions of counsel, constituting a reversible abuse of discretion. I would affirm the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
