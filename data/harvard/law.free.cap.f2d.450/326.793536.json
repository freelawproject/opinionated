Plaintiff Kirsch was a crewman on the vessel. In 1968 plaintiff was injured on board when he was struck by one Hutchison, a Third Assistant Engineer. This suit for damages was then instituted. The District Court found for plaintiff on the theory that Hutchison\u2019s presence on the ship rendered it unseaworthy. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">Having reviewed the evidence, we conclude that it does not support the finding of unseaworthiness. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">The general warranty of seaworthiness is that the vessel is \u201creasonably fit.\u201d The Silvia, 171 U.S. 462, 464, 19 S.Ct. 7, 43 L.Ed. 241 (1898). As applied to a seaman\u2019s temperament and ability, the warranty \u201cis \u2018that he is equal in disposition and seamanship to the ordinary men in the calling.\u2019 \u201d Stechcon v. United States, 439 F.2d 792, 793 (9th Cir. 1971), citing Keen v. Overseas Tankship Corp., 194 F.2d 515, 518 (2d Cir.), cert, denied, 343 U.S. 966, 72 S.Ct. 1061, 96 L.Ed. 1363 (1952). The questions are whether the behavior was \u201cwithin the usual and customary standards of the calling,\u201d or whether it was \u201ca case of a seaman with a wicked disposition, a propensity to evil conduct, a savage and vicious nature.\u201d Boudoin v. Lykes Bros. S. S. Co., 348 U.S. 336, 340, 75 S.Ct. 382, 385, 99 L.Ed. 354 (1955). If his temperament is the latter, then the ship becomes a \u201cperilous place.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It is always an issue of degree. A seaman\u2019s shipboard conduct is not measured by the same standard as the conduct of ordinary men ashore. See Boorus v. West Coast Trans-Oceanic S. S. Line, 299 F.2d 893 (9th Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">The altercation in this case arose when Kirsch, who was the chief steward, allegedly failed to have Hutchison\u2019s bed made up. Kirsch and Hutchison had a meeting regarding the matter. Hutchi-son lost his temper during the meeting and struck Kirsch twice with his fists. Kirsch fell over the raised threshold of the entranceway into the meeting room. The fight was pursued no further, and Kirsch was able to work the rest of the voyage. At no time during the argument did Kirsch try to strike Hutchison. The District Court found Hutchison\u2019s action was without cause or justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">The record shows that Hutchison had been in three previous fist fights during his thirty year career, but all three had occurred approximately ten years before the Kirsch incident. He was involved in one further fight subsequent to the Kirsch altercation. The evidence is that none of the fights involved more than the use of hands. Each was short lived. There is no evidence of brutality or viciousness. The District Court, having listened to all the evidence, concluded \u201cthere is no question in my mind but that Bill Hutchinson [sic] is a good man. He is a good person; he is a good engineer; he has good character.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">We are unable to concur with the District Court that the circumstances of the five fights in Hutchison\u2019s career, in light of all the evidence, indicate a \u201csavage\u201d or \u201cvicious\u201d nature or make the ship he is aboard a \u201cperilous place.\u201d Boudoin v. Lykes Bros. S. S. Co., <em>supra,. </em>The conclusion that Hutchison\u2019s actions made the vessel Occidental Victory unseaworthy must be and is hereby reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-12\">Upon remand, the District Court will enter its judgment in favor of the defendant, the appellant here. Reversed and remanded, with directions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
