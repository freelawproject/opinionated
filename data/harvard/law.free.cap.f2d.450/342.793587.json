Petitioner alleges that he needs the statement because he wishes to sue in the courts of New York for the libel, and in order to state a cause of action for libel under New York law a complaint must set forth verbatim the allegedly libelous statement. The Commission denied petitioner\u2019s request for a copy of the document on the ground that the material fell within two exceptions to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b) (4) and (7) (1970). Petitioner seeks review of the Commission\u2019s denial of his request, citing Section 9 of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77i (1970) as giving this court jurisdiction to review such an \u201corder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-21\">We grant the Commission\u2019s motion to dismiss the petition. The Commission\u2019s action was not an order subject to review under Section 9. The Commission\u2019s staff has informally reviewed petitioner\u2019s registration statement, and this petition is in no way related to that administrative action. The refusal of petitioner\u2019s request was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>connected with any investigation .or proceeding of the Commission and was not the type of order issued by the Commission in the usual course of its activities. If refusal was wrongful it was because of failure to comply with the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a) (1970). That statute specifically provides that a refusal to disclose information such as petitioner claims is involved here is reviewable in a district court, not in a court of appeals. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a) (3) (1970). The motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
