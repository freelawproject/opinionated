(Marin), an unsecured creditor of the bankrupt corporation William Rakes-traw Co., Inc., (bankrupt), appeals from a District Court order denying its petition for review of, and approving and confirming certain orders of the Referee in Bankruptcy, which were issued during the administration of the bankrupt\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-13\">By Agreement of Sale, dated February 11, 1965, Marin agreed to sell Gary\u2019s Market in Marin County, California, to William Rakestraw, (Rakestraw), the Agreement expressly providing that it would bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their heirs, successors, and assigns. On the same date, the parties also executed two sets of escrow instructions and a Management Contract, under which Rakestraw was to manage Marin\u2019s liquor business in the market for a percentage of the profits. By a Supplement to the Agreement, also dated February 11, 1965, Rakestraw agreed to assume Marin\u2019s secured obligations to several specifically designated creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-19\">It was the understanding of the parties that Rakestraw would form a corporation which would assume his obligations and liabilities arising from the transaction. The corporation, William Rakestraw Co., Inc., was formed and supplanted Rakestraw as purchaser of the market. The corporation was adjudicated a bankrupt in November 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-20\">Marin\u2019s proof of claim filed in the bankruptcy proceeding totaled $88,337.-97, $14,013.11 of which the Referee allowed. The parties do not contest this allowance. However, Marin\u2019s claim also included $60,000 in unsecured debts which Marin alleged.Rakestraw, concurrently with the execution of the written contracts, orally agreed to pay as an additional and integral consideration for the sale of the market. The Referee denied this portion of Marin\u2019s claim on the grounds that (1) the parol evidence rule barred proof of the alleged oral agreement; (2) Marin had not paid the disputed obligations before making its claim; and (3) liquidation or estimation of Marin\u2019s oral claim would unduly delay the administration of the bankrupt estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-21\">Among the other claims the Referee did allow was a claim of $224,033.29 by Allied Grocers of California, Ltd., (Allied), for groceries sold on open account to the bankrupt. The bankrupt acknowledged this debt as due and owing, and it was listed on the creditors\u2019 schedule. Marin contends that Allied\u2019s claim was just as \u201cunliquidated\u201d as its own disallowed claim; and therefore, it too should have been disallowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-22\">The issues presented for decision are the correctness of the Referee\u2019s decisions (1) allowing Allied\u2019s claim, and (2) disallowing Marin\u2019s $60,000 claim for the three reasons given above.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>1. Allied\u2019s Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">We find no merit in Marin\u2019s argument that the Referee erred in allowing Allied\u2019s claim against the bankrupt. There is a great difference between Allied\u2019s claim for goods sold and received, which the bankrupt acknowledged on its schedule of creditors, and Marin\u2019s claim for breach of contract. While Marin\u2019s claims are disputed, Allied\u2019s was not. We affirm the Referee\u2019s allowance of Allied\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">2. Parol Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">In denying Marin\u2019s claim based on the alleged oral agreement with Rake-straw to assume the unsecured debts of the market the Referee relied primarily on the parol evidence rule, which dictates that testimony of a prior or contemporaneous oral agreement is inadmissible to vary the terms of an integrated written contract. 4 Williston on Contracts, sec. 631 (3rd ed. 1961); Masterson v. Sine, 68 Cal.2d 222, 225, 65 Cal. Rptr. 545, 436 P.2d 561 (1968); Cornwell Quality Tools Co. v. C.T.S. Co., Inc., 446 F.2d 825 (9th Cir., 1971). On the other hand, oral evidence is admissible to explain an ambiguous term, Continental Baking Co. v. Katz, 68 Cal.2d 512, 67 Cal.Rptr. 761, 439 P.2d 889 (1968), or to add a not inconsistent term to a partially integrated document, Mangini v. Wolfschmidt, 165 Cal.App.2d 192, 331 P.2d 728 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">However, under California law, before the parol evidence rule may be applied, a preliminary determination must be made as to the integration of the contract, based on the parties\u2019 intent. The face of the document is of some help, but it is not conclusive. <em>Masterson, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d at 225-227, 65 Cal. Rptr. 545, 436 P.2d 561. A \u201crational interpretation requires at least a preliminary consideration of all credible evidence offered to prove that intention of the parties.\u201d Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. v. G. W. Thomas Drayage &amp; Rigging Co., 69 Cal.2d 33, 39-40, 69 Cal.Rptr. 561, 565, 442 P.2d 641 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-11\">There is no indication whatsoever in the record that the Referee received any evidence on the parties\u2019 intentions. On the evidence before him, based solely on the written documents, he could not determine whether or not the parties intended the written contracts to be integrated. Indeed, the evidence which does appear on the record strongly intimates that the parties did not intend that the written documents would be the sole measure of their bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-12\">There is no merger clause in these agreements which by its terms limits the contract to the written documents. Nor is there any specific mention of unsecured creditors. The Referee\u2019s reliance on the escrow agreements and their mention of \u201cbona fide creditors\u201d appears unwarranted. \u201cBona fide creditors\u201d is at best an ambiguous term. Did the parties mean to include all creditors, secured creditors only, solely those secured creditors mentioned in the Supplemental Agreement? The face of the escrow agreements does not indicate an answer. It is possible that the escrow agreements are nothing more than a precaution taken under Article VI of the Uniform Commercial Code, California Commercial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Code, see. 6101 et seq., which governs such bulk transfers.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">In short, while the claim based on Marin\u2019s oral agreement may very well be barred by the parol evidence rule, the Referee could <em>not </em>competently rule on this issue until he had taken more evidence. We remand this case to him so that he will do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">3. Prepayment; Undue Delay</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\"> We find error in the Referee\u2019s conclusion that allowance of Marin\u2019s claim should be barred because Marin had not paid any of the unsecured creditors allegedly covered by the oral agreement. The Referee felt that Marin had sustained no damage. If, as Marin seeks to prove, Rakestraw and his successors, including the bankrupt corporation, did promise to pay Marin\u2019s unsecured creditors, failure to do so entitles Marin to recover whatever damages it sustains as a result on this breach of contract. Marin has been damaged whether it has already paid the creditors or must yet pay them. Meyer v. Parsons, 129 Cal. 653, 655, 62 P. 216 (1900) ; 2 Williston, <em>supra, </em>secs. 392, 393. Marin is obligated to pay its creditors if the bankrupt does not unless there is a novation or assent by the creditors to the substitution of the bankrupt as the obligor. The promisee in a third party creditor beneficiary contract may enforce it when the promisor proves recalcitrant. 11 Williston, <em>supra, </em>sec. 1421.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">Nor is the Referee\u2019s ground valid that settlement of Marin\u2019s claim will unduly prolong the administration of the estate. While it is acknowledged that the majority of creditors should not be made to await the settlement of a single claim, Marin\u2019s claim comprises nearly 20% of the scheduled claims against the bankrupt and is the second single largest claim against the estate. The Referee\u2019s discretion in this matter should be exercised \u201cin a generous and liberal way, with due regard, however, to the rights of other creditors.\u201d 3 Collier on Bankruptcy, par. 57.15(4) (14th ed. 1971). Marin\u2019s claim is not so insignificant that the Referee may ignore it on the expediency of winding up the bankrupt\u2019s affairs. <em>Compare </em>In re Hot Springs Broadcasting, Inc., 210 F.Supp. 533 (W.D., Ark., 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-14\">Accordingly, we affirm the Referee\u2019s allowance of Allied\u2019s claim. However, we reverse his refusal to countenance Marin\u2019s oral claim based on the parol evidence rule, no prior payment by Marin, and undue prolongation of the estate\u2019s administration, and remand the matter to the Referee for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b65-23\">. As a further complication, both Marin and Allied had filed actions in the California Superior Court seeking damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>against Rakestraw personally and against the bankrupt corporation for breach of contract. The Referee denied Marin\u2019s motion to stay these state court proceedings and to assume jurisdiction and determine all issues involved. Marin also appealed this ruling to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">None of these actions had been adjudicated when the briefs were filed in this appeal. However, Marin\u2019s counsel represented, at oral argument and in a subsequent written summary submitted to the Court, that the lawsuits had resulted in judgments for Marin and Allied, but only against Rakestraw personally and not against the bankrupt. Marin still desires to prosecute this appeal, preferring a judgment against the bankrupt to pursuit of Rakestraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-14\">Since the state court actions have reached final judgment, we see no reason to rule upon the Referee\u2019s refusal to stay them.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
