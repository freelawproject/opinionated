Several months before trial, after some disagreement with his retained counsel, appellant advised that counsel in writing that he no longer wanted him to represent him. Three months before trial appellant wrote a letter to the Chief Judge of the District Court stating that he was no longer represented by counsel and respectfully requesting appointment of Legal Aid counsel to represent him. No reply to this letter was received. Two months before trial appellant received a letter from his retained counsel indicating that his case had been set for trial on December 22, 1969, that he had advised the trial judge that appellant no longer wanted him to represent him, and that the court had instructed him to advise appellant that if he wished to change lawyers it would be necessary to have the new lawyer enter his appearance no less than ten days <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1356\">*1356</page-number>before trial. Thereafter appellant personally but unsuccessfully sought the aid of the Legal Aid Agency. Finally, on December 1, 1969 appellant filed a <em>pro se </em>motion, with affidavit of poverty attached, asking that the services of his retained counsel be terminated. Apparently no action was taken by the court on this motion, at least not until the day of trial when appellant was required to proceed with his retained counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-4\">On December 22, 1969, when appellant\u2019s case was called for trial, appellant moved for a continuance \u201cdue to the fact that I have had ineffective representation over the past months of my incarceration pending trial.\u201d He also told the court: \u201cI asked the Court would they please appoint me a Legal Aid Attorney,\u201d but the court had simply referred his letter to his retained counsel \u201cfor any disposition he wishes to make,\u201d and he had received \u201cno word whatsoever\u201d as to the status of his representation. He also stated that he had not seen his retained counsel since June. The trial court denied the motion for a continuance, and the trial proceeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-5\">Many years ago this court held: \u201cIt is settled law that a client, with an order of court, has the right to discharge an attorney, with or without cause.\u201d Evans v. Ockershausen, 69 App.D.C. 285, 299, 100 F.2d 695, 709 (1938). More recently the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, in McKoy v. United States, 263 A.2d 645, 648 (1970), stated: \u201cWhen faced with a request for a change of counsel, either retained or appointed, the court must consider the merits of the defendant\u2019s complaints, the delay between the cause of the dissatisfaction and the request, the nearness to trial or completion thereof, and the general dictates of fairness and justice both for the defendant and the Government.\u201d <em>Compare </em>Lee v. United States, 98 U.S. App.D.C. 272, 235 F.2d 219 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-7\">The documents in this case, which were before the trial court, show that the trial court was aware of appellant\u2019s long term dissatisfaction with his retained counsel, that he had sought to discharge him, that, according to appellant, he had not seen him in six months, that he had asked the Chief Judge of the District Court for counsel from the Legal Aid Agency, and that appellant was a pauper seeking court appointed counsel. Yet the record does not reflect specifically what action was taken by the court on appellant\u2019s requests and motions. Under the circumstances, we have decided to remand the record in this ease to the District Court to determine (1) what action, if any, was taken by the District Court on appellant\u2019s motion to discharge his counsel of record and his request for appointed counsel; (2) whether the court\u2019s action, or lack thereof, under the principles quoted in the preceding paragraph of this opinion, prejudicially affected his right to counsel; and (3) whether the relationship between appellant and his retained counsel prejudicially affected counsel\u2019s preparation of appellant\u2019s case for trial. In this connection the court will determine the accuracy of appellant\u2019s statement that he had not seen his counsel for six months prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-8\">Remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
