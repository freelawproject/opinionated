Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., 5th Cir. 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b927-21\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b927-22\">Appellant Holt was convicted in the court below of escaping from prison in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4082(d) and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 751(a). He did not contest the fact that while in trusty status he departed his place of confinement. His defense rested solely on the contention that he was insane at the time of his escape and therefore lacked the requisite intent required to commit the crimes charged. In this appeal, appellant raises only one point. He urges that the trial court erred in ruling as a matter of law that he had not produced sufficient evidence of insanity for the jury to be permitted to consider his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-23\">The last word in this Circuit on the defense of insanity is Blake v. United States, 5th Cir. 1969, 407 F.2d 908 (en banc). Applying <em>Blake, </em>we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-24\">The law presumes sanity. To overcome this presumption the accused must provide \u201csome\u201d evidence of insanity. Blake v. United States, <em>supra, </em>at 911. If he does, the jury is then permitted to consider the defense of insanity along with all other evidence in the ease to determine whether the prosecution has proved its ease beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Blake </em>makes clear, however, that \u201cthe question of sufficiency of the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>dence necessary to make an issue for the jury on the defense of insanity * * * is for the court.\u201d Blake v. United States, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">In <em>Blake </em>this Court adopted the ALI Model Penal Code test for determining criminal responsibility:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-5\">(1) A person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such conduct as a result of mental disease or defect he lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-6\">(2) As used in this Article, the terms \u201cmental disease or defect\u201d do not include an abnormality manifested only by repeated criminal or otherwise antisocial conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">Blake v. United States, <em>supra, </em>at 913, 915.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-8\">It was incumbent upon Holt to provide \u201csome\u201d evidence to the district court that he met the ALI <em>-Blake </em>standard. This he failed to do. Holt called four witnesses, one a court-appointed psychiatrist, on the issue of his sanity. The psychiatrist described Holt as suffering from \u201cimpaired judgment,\u201d \u201ca mental disorder,\u201d \u201cpoor judgment,\u201d \u201cimpulsivity,\u201d and as being \u201cdissocial.\u201d When asked to explain \u201cmental disorder,\u201d he defined it as any deviation from the normal personality. Despite vigorous interrogation by Holt\u2019s counsel, the doctor refused to describe Holt\u2019s condition as a mental disease or defect as required by the <em>Blake </em>test. Moreover, when asked if Holt\u2019s condition could prevent his knowing the wrongfulness of his act, the witness answered, \u201cno.\u201d He also answered \u201cno\u201d when asked if Holt was substantially incapable of conforming his conduct to the requirements of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-9\">Holt thus failed to meet either part of the two-step <em>Blake </em>test. He produced adequate evidence of his abnormal personality but not even \u201csome\u201d evidence that he suffered from a mental disease or defect <em>or </em>that as a result of his abnormality he could not \u201cappreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or * * * conform his conduct to the requirements of law.\u201d The record shows that Holt\u2019s counsel questioned the psychiatrist at length, trying to elicit from him one of the magic words, \u201cdisease\u201d or \u201cdefect.\u201d He failed. He succeeded instead in drawing from the witness a fairly clear picture of appellant as a person contemplated by paragraph (2) of the <em>Blake </em>test. Such persons are not entitled to the defense of insanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-12\">Since Holt failed to provide the court below with \u201csome\u201d evidence that he was not legally responsible for his criminal conduct, the court was correct in not permitting the jury to consider the insanity defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
