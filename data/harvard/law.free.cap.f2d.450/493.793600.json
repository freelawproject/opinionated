Lindberg, Senior United States District Judge, Western District of Washington, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b551-19\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b551-20\">Standard Oil of California is the owner of an undivided half interest in five federal oil and gas leases issued by the Bureau of Land Management of the United States Department of the Interi- or in 1958. The issue in controversy in the present action is the interpretation to be accorded the rental provisions of these leases. The rental rate provisions in dispute are identical in each lease:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYv\">\u201c(b) If the lands are wholly or partly within the known geologic structure of a producing oil or gas field:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-21\">(i) Beginning with the first lease year after 30 days notice that all or part of the land is included in such a structure and for each year thereafter, prior to a discovery of oil or gas on the lands leased, $1 per acre or fraction thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-22\">(ii) If this lease is committed to an approved cooperative or unit plan which includes a well capable of pro-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>dueing oil or gas and contains a general provision for allocation of production, the rental prescribed for the respective lease years in subparagraph (a) [i. e., 500 per acre] shall apply to the acreage not within a participating area * * *\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">A year after the five leases were originally issued, they were pledged to an approved unit development called the Soldotna Creek Unit Area. Unit development of an oil and gas field is common practice. Its purpose is to avoid economic waste and the haphazard development of the land\u2019s natural resources. A unit is made up of both \u201cparticipating\u201d and \u201cnonparticipating\u201d lands. The former areas share in the actual development activities and expenses dictated by the unit agreement, and they participate in the benefits produced. No rent is paid on participating acreage; instead the government collects payments on a royalty basis. A \u201cnonpartieipating\u201d area is still in the unit, but for purposes of the overall unit plan it is not developed for purposes of production. Rent is paid on nonparticipating acreage as agreed upon in the underlying lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-19\">On January 2, 1967 part of the nonparticipating acreage covered by each of the five leases in dispute was eliminated by contraction from the Soldotna Creek Unit area. Several months thereafter the Chief Minerals Adjudicator of the Anchorage Land Office issued a decision raising the rent on the eliminated acreage from 50 cents per acre to $1.00 per acre. The view of the Adjudicator was that once the acreage was contracted out of the cooperative unit it no longer qualified for the rent basis set out in paragraph (ii) above, but was subject to the rent provision of paragraph (i). This view was affirmed by the Secretary when Standard Oil pursued an ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>ministrative appeal. Standard then timely filed this action in the District Court for a review of the Secretary\u2019s decision. Both parties moved for summary judgment. The District Court found in favor of Standard Oil and reversed the determination of the Secretary of the Interior. Standard Oil Company of California v. Hickel et al., 317 F.Supp. 1192 (D.Alaska, 1970). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Had the entire acreage under each of these leases been contracted out of the cooperative unit, it is clear that the $1.-00 per acre rental would be applicable. The district judge concluded, however, that the draftsman of the federal lease had not made provision for the possibility that only part of the acreage under a lease would be affected by contraction while the lease itself would remain pledged to the approved unit development. He charged the Secretary as draftsman of the lease with the confusion resulting from this oversight and ambiguity. Under the general rules of contract construction, he construed the leases against the draftsman and his agents. Reading Steel Casting Co. v. United States, 268 U.S. 186, 188, 45 S.Ct. 469, 69 L.Ed. 907 (1925); Reconstruction Finance Corp. v. Sullivan Mining Co., 230 F.2d 247, 250 (9th Cir. 1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">We have considered the entire record in this case, and we affirm the District Court for those reasons set out in Judge Plummer\u2019s well considered opinion, Standard Oil Company of California v. Hickel et al., 317 F.Supp. 1192. Granting that great deference is due the Secretary\u2019s interpretations of the regulatory scheme under the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, Udall v. Tallman, 380 U.S. 1, 85 S.Ct. 792, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965) we still agree with the district court that the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of the leases in point is unsupported.\u00ae This is especially true, in light of past administrative practice and prior regulatory language, with respect to his effort to interpret the word \u201cleases\u201d to mean \u201clands\u201d in paragraph (ii) of the rental provisions. See T. Jack Foster, 75 I.D. 81 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">The decision of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b552-5\">.
