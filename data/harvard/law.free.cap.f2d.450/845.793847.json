Lemelson appeals from an order of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, dismissing his complaint for patent infringement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Topper Corporation<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> cross-appeals from that part of the court\u2019s order adjudging Lemelson\u2019s patent valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-20\">Lemelson was issued a patent on a toy gun containing a mechanism which simulates the sound of a ricocheting bullet through the use of a reed-like noisemaker which is activated by the sudden expansion of a spring-loaded bellows.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Sometime after the issuance of the patent, defendant Topper Corporation (Topper) began manufacturing and marketing toy guns called the \u201cJungle Jack\u201d and the \u201cJohnny Eagle Red River\u201d which allegedly infringe appellant\u2019s patent. Co-defendant The Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Comany sells the \u201cJungle Jack.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b904-21\">After trial without a jury, the district court concluded that Lemelson\u2019s patent was valid but not infringed by the \u201cJungle Jack\u201d or \u201cJohnny Eagle Red River\u201d guns. While we affirm the court\u2019s dismissal of plaintiff\u2019s complaint, we do so for a different reason: we find that plantiff\u2019s patent is invalid for obviousness.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b904-22\">The patent law confers on patentees the exclusive right to exploit their inventions in recognition of the fact that but for legal subsidization the quantity of technical innovation forthcoming would be less than optimal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The problem that has continually faced the Congress and the courts is how to develop legal standards that define the characteristics of those inventions and only those inventions that would not be forthcoming but for the inducement of a legal monopoly.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The standards currently used are that to be patentable an invention must be useful, novel, and nonob-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>vious.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In Graham v. John Deere Co.,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the Court set the guidelines to be used in applying the nonobvious standard of section 103:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-5\">Under \u00a7 103, the scope and content of the prior art are to be determined; differences between the prior art and the claims at issue are to be ascertained ; and the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art resolved. Against this background, the obviousness or nonobviousness of the subject matter is determined.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">\n<em>Lemelson\u2019s Invention</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">Lemelson\u2019s invention consists of a mechanism whereby a ricochet sound is emitted upon the firing of a toy gun.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The essential constituents of this mechanism are (1) a bellows, (2) a spring-loaded device for compressing and holding compressed such bellows, (3) a mechanism connected to the trigger that causes the bellows to suddenly expand upon firing, and (4) a noise-making device consisting primarily of a reed. When the gun is cocked, an actuator compresses the bellows. Upon firing, the bellows rapidly expands, sucking in air that flows over the tubular reed type noisemaker. The end result is that the bellows upon expansion emits a sound that simulates the whine of a bullet ricocheting in flight.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-24\">\n<em>The Prior Art</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b905-25\">The district court considered fourteen patents as constituting the prior art.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In making our finding of obviousness we rely on three of these: The Bocchino, Lawson, and Everett patents.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Bocchino patent consists of a toy bellows with an expansion spring, intended to be used in connection with wind operated reeds in the production of sound.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Lawson patent is a jack-in-the-box containing a spring actuated bellows with a reed that produces a sound upon expansion of the bellows when the top of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>box is released.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Everett patent is a toy smoking gun, containing a bellows which is expanded upon the cocking of the hammer and collapses upon firing. The contraction of the bellows forces a small amount of powder to escape, thereby creating the illusion of a smoking weapon.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Lawson patent was cited by the Patent Office as exemplifying the prior art; the Bocchino and Everett patents were not cited by the Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">\n<em>The Obviousness of the Lemelson Invention</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">Mindful of the corrosive effect that time has on the nonobviousness of an invention, we nevertheless conclude that \u201cthe differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art * *.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In short, a person skilled in the mechanical arts and who desired to produce a gun which would emit a ricocheting sound could have found in the prior art ways, means, or suggestions as to how to do it. The use of a spring actuated, expanding bellows in conjunction with wind operated reeds to create sound was disclosed by the Bocchino and Lawson patents. The use of a trigger mechanism to actuate a bellows was suggested by the Everett patent. Lemelson\u2019s contribution was to devise a mechanism whereby a bellows is first contracted and then rapidly expanded to create the rush of air that, flowing over the tubular reed-type noisemaker, produced the ricochet sound. Even disregarding the stricter standard of nonobviousness applicable to combination patents,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> we conclude that the invention of such a mechanism would have been obvious to someone having ordinary skill in the art of making toys.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-22\"> The question of patent validity is a question of law;<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> district court determinations of validity are not entitled to the weight on appeal accorded district court findings of fact.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Our disagreement with the court below on the issue of validity stems from our conclusion that that court did not apply the rather rigorous standard of nonobviousness mandated by section 103, Graham,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and <em>Great Atlantic &amp; </em>Pacific.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> There may have been novelty in the creation of Lemelson\u2019s gun, but novelty is not to be equated with nonobviousness.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The fact that the elements of various segments of the prior art had not been previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>combined to produce a ricocheting sound does not mean that a person skilled in the toy-making art created a patentable invention by his combination.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-4\"> We recognize that there is a presumption, which is rebuttable, in favor of the Lemelson patent, and that the burden of establishing the invalidity of the patent is on Topper.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> However, it has long been recognized that \u201cthe most that can be said of the presumption is that it requires that reasonable doubt on the question of validity be resolved in favor of the patent holder.\u201d <footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Such a doubt we do not have. Moreover, the volume of patent' applications processed by the Patent Office, and the <em>ex parte </em>nature of their proceedings undermine the weight of the statutory presumption.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Finally, the failure of the Patent Office to actually cite patents that comprise, in part, the prior art further undercuts the weight of the presumption.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b907-12\">As a further ground for upholding the validity of Lemelson\u2019s patent, the district court relied on United States v. Adams<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> in finding that the Lemelson invention overcame disadvantages in the prior art that discouraged the search for the ricochet sound mechanism.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> We believe this reliance was misplaced. The Christopher patent simulates the sound of a ricocheting bullet either by a sound-amplifier mounted near a recording disc and needle or by a lug on a revolving disc which strikes a sound-making comb and then a tuning fork.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> There is no indication whatsoever as to how this patent established factors known to those skilled in the art that would deter the conception of the invention at issue here. In <em>Adams </em>such deterring factors were substantial and were well known to those skilled in the art.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> In the absence of such evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>dence, reliance on the <em>Adams </em>path through the nonobvious test must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">Judgment dismissing the complaint is affirmed; the finding of patent validity is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b904-13\">.

It is true that there is testimony in the instant case that the Patent Office must have considered the Everett and Bocehino patents since these patents were in the classes that the examiner did search.
