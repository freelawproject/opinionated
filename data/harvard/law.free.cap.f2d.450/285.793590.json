Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., <em>5 </em>Cir. 1970,431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b344-12\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b344-13\">Appellant, consignee Secrest Machine Corporation, sued appellees, carrier William Wilhelmsen, doing business as The Swedish Atlantic-Wilhelmsen Line, and stevedore Strachan Shipping Company, for damages to appellant\u2019s cargo. While discharging the cargo at Savannah, stevedore negligently permitted a box containing a steel press to fall with consequent damage to the press in the amount of $17,000. The bill of lading provided <em>inter </em>alia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-17\">All defenses as aforesaid shall inure also to the benefit of the Carrier\u2019s agents, servants and employees and of any independent contractor performing any of the Carrier\u2019s obligations under the contract of carriage or acting as bailee of the goods, whether sued in contract or in tort.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-18\">For the purpose of this clause all such persons, firms or legal entities as alluded to above shall be deemed to be parties to the contract evidenced by this B/L.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-19\">The District Court, 324 F.Supp. 671, found both stevedore and carrier negligent and granted judgment in favor of appellant for \u201ca single recovery against both defendants for $500,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-20\">The parties agree that carrier is entitled to a $500 limitation of liability under the \u201csingle-package\u201d provision of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1304.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant argues on appeal, however, that the $500 limitation does not apply to stevedore or, if it does, appellant is entitled to a separate recovery of $500 from each of the defendants, or a total of $1,000. We find both of these positions untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-21\">While it is true that the $500-per-package limitation of the Act does not advert to stevedores, Robert C. Herd &amp; Co., Inc. v. Krawill Machinery Corp., 1959, 359 U.S. 297, 79 S.Ct. 766, 3 L.Ed.2d 820, a carrier is free to contract with the owner or consignee of cargo to limit the liability of the carrier\u2019s agents, such as stevedores. Carle &amp; Montanari, Inc. v. American Export Isbrandtsen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>Lines, Inc., S.D.N.Y. 1967, 275 F.Supp. 76, aff d 2 Cir.1967, 386 F.2d 839, cert, denied, 1968, 390 U.S. 1013, 88 S.Ct. 1263, 20 L.Ed.2d 162. The bill of lading executed between appellant and carrier here expressly provided that all defenses available to carrier \u201cshall inure also to the benefit of the Carrier\u2019s agents, servants and employees and of any independent contractor performing any of the Carrier\u2019s obligations under the contract of carriage or acting as bailee of the goods, whether sued in contract or in tort.\u201d It is clear that the term \u201cindependent contractor\u201d includes stevedores, and therefore the limitation defense is available to Strachan. Bernard Screen Printing Corp. v. Meyer Line, S.D.N.Y. 1971, 328 F.Supp. 288; see Carle &amp; Montanari, Inc. v. American Export Is-brandtsen Lines, Inc., <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">In our view, appellant\u2019s multiple recovery argument lacks merit. We agree with the court below that, \u201cIt would seem a strange interpretation of the bill [of lading] that the shipowner contemplated that there might be a double * * * recovery of the $500 limitation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b344-14\">. The carrier was found liable under the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1300-1315, for negligently discharging the duty to \u201cproperly and carefully load, handle, stow, carry, keep, care for, and discharge the goods carried.\u201d 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1303(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b344-22\">. 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1304(5) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-23\">Neither the carrier nor the ship shall in any event be or become liable for any loss or damage to or in connection with the transportation of goods in an amount exceeding $500 per package * * *.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
