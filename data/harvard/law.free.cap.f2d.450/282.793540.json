However, the record sets forth the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-5\">MR. MICHAELS [Counsel for the United States]: At this time, your Honor, on behalf of the United States Government, I offer, with Mr. Franklin, defense counsel, to enter into a trial by the Court alone of this matter, and the Government does wish to waive jury in the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-6\">MR. FRANKLIN [Counsel for the defendant]: That\u2019s agreeable to both myself and to Mr. McCurdy, as I understand it, your Honor, that there can be a jury waiver on behalf of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-7\">THE COURT: All right. Mr. Mc-Curdy, would you stand please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-8\">Mr. McCurdy, you understand that you have a right to have this case tried by a jury composed of twelve people, and if I understand correctly from what your counsel said, you are willing to waive that right to a jury and have the Court, sitting alone, determine whether you are guilty or not guilty of the offense charged; is that correct ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-9\">THE DEFENDANT: That\u2019s correct, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-10\">THE COURT: All right. You understand that you have a right, but you wish to waive it and have the Court try the matter ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-11\">THE DEFENDANT: That\u2019s true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-12\">THE COURT: All right. The Court having observed Mr. McCurdy and determined that he has voluntarily waived jury, and with the concurrence of his counsel and the counsel for the Government, the Court will enter an order that the jury is voluntarily waived, and the matter will be tried by the Court. (I Reporter\u2019s Transcript, pp. 6-7.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-15\">In United States v. Guerrero-Peralta, 446 F.2d 876 (9th Cir., 1971), this court recently considered the requirements for a valid waiver of jury trial under Rule 23. There we held that a twelve-member jury could not be waived by a stipulation of counsel, the defendant being present but silent. Rule 23(b). We noted that the purpose of a writing under Rule 23 is to provide \u201cthe best record evidence of the <em>express </em>consent of a defendant.\u201d (Emphasis in the original.) We then stated: \u201cExpress consent given orally by the defendant personally and appearing on the record may be equally good evidence, but that much, as a minimum, must appear.\u201d P. 877.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-17\">\u2022 Ideally, counsel in the present case would have called to the attention of the trial judge the provisions of Rule 23, and McCurdy\u2019s signature on the appropriate form would have been obtained. However, there was an intelligent, knowing, and express waiver by the defendant in open court, with the consent of both counsel, and with the approval of the trial judge given after appropriate questioning of the defendant. Where such a waiver is spread upon the record we hold that there has been compliance with Rule 23(a). Bayless v. United States, 381 F.2d 67, 74-75 (9th Cir. 1967); Rogers v. United States, 319 F.2d 5 (7th Cir. 1963). Cf. Patton v. United States, 281 U.S. 276, 312, 50 S.Ct. 253, 74 L.Ed. 854 (1930).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
