Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., 5 Cir. 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b383-11\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b383-12\">This is an appeal from a judgment of conviction on a jury verdict finding So-kolow guilty of the unlawful receipt and possession of stolen property in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 659. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-13\">A police officer, acting upon reliable information that cigarettes had been stolen, followed a suspect\u2019s automobile which eventually backed up to Sokolow\u2019s garage. While arresting the suspect, the officer saw a number of air conditioning units stacked in the garage. The officer questioned Sokolow concerning the ownership of the equipment. In the course of this investigation, the officer entered the garage and took serial numbers from the units without a search warrant. This information established that the air conditioners were stolen property, and Sokolow was arrested. Prior to trial, Sokolow moved to suppress the evidence pertaining to the serial numbers and all evidence obtained as a result of that seizure as the fruit of a warrantless search in violation of his rights under the Fourth Amendment. The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-15\">A search conducted outside the judicial process, i. e., without a warrant, is <em>per se </em>unreasonable in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Katz v. United States, 1967, 389 U.S. 347, 357, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576. While this rule is subject to limited and well-defined exceptions that may justify a warrantless search and seizure, \u201c[t]he exceptions are \u2018jealously and carefully drawn,\u2019 and there must be \u2018a showing by those who seek exemption * * * that the exigencies of the situation made that course imperative.\u2019 \u201d Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 1971, 403 U.S. 443, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 29 L.Ed.2d 564 [June 22, 1971],</p>\n<p id=\"b383-17\">The Government first contends that the search and seizure of the serial numbers was valid based upon probable cause. Manifestly, a showing of probable cause is required for the granting of a warrant, but \u201c * * * no amount of probable cause can justify a warrantless search and seizure absent \u2018exigent circumstances\u2019 \u201d. Coolidge v. New Hampshire, <em>supra, </em>403 U.S. at 468, 91 S.Ct. at 2039. Here there were simply no exigent circumstances. The nature of the stolen property was not such that it could be easily disposed of and other agents were maintaining surv\u00e9illance on the garage. Under these circumstances, a warrant should have been sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-18\">Secondly, the Government in a rather oblique argument in which it cou-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>pies the plain view doctrine with probable cause attempts to justify the war-rantless seizure of the serial numbers. The appearance of the air conditioners gave no indication that they were contraband nor were they evidence of an ascertained crime. Except for suspicion, there was no justification for the officer to enter the garage. He had no legitimate ' reason to do so apart from the search directed at Sokolow. \u201cWhat the \u2018plain view\u2019 cases have in common is that the police officer in each of them had a prior justification for an intrusion in the course of which he came inadvertently across a piece of evidence incriminating the accused.\u201d Coolidge v. New Hampshire, <em>supra, </em>403 U.S. at 466, 91 S.Ct. at 2038. It is thus evident that this is not a plain view case and it cannot be made so by coupling the doctrine with probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">We conclude that the serial numbers and the evidence flowing from the seizure were obtained in a warrantless search in violation of the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
