He was sentenced to serve a term of eighteen months under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208 (a) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-21\"> On appeal McKinney contends that the refusal of the trial court to make the presentenee report of the probation officer available to his counsel prior to sentencing was a denial of due process. The answer to this contention is found in the en banc decision of this court upholding the discretionary authority of the trial judge under Rule 32(c) (2) of the Fed.R.Crim.P. to deny the request of the defendant for inspection of the presentence report prior to sentencing. United States v. Knupp, 448 F.2d 412 (4 Cir., 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-22\">We find no merit in other assignments of error and the judgment of conviction and sentence will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
