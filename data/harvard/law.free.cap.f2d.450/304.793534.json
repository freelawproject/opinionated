In 1967 petitioner was convicted in Texas of possession of marijuana and heroin and sentenced to fifteen years in prison. On November 9, 1970 he applied for habeas corpus relief to the federal district court, asserting various infirmities in his state conviction. The order to show cause issued and counsel was appointed. On December 9 the State answered and moved to dismiss. On December 14, approximately a week before petitioner\u2019s responsive pleading was due, he moved that his appointed counsel be replaced on the ground that counsel was a civil practitioner not experienced in criminal law. This motion was denied. Subsequently the case was transferred to a different district judge in the same district. On May 27, 1971 the district court denied all relief, adopting, without a hearing, the Findings, Conclusions and Recommendations of a United States Magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-16\">As a result of the change of judges, the motion to replace counsel, appointed counsel\u2019s unfamiliarity with criminal law, and probably other factors, petitioner\u2019s counsel did not actively participate in this case until he filed a brief with this Court on September 7, 1971. Petitioner was thus completely denied assistance of counsel in the court below. His case was decided solely on his hand written pleadings without, as far as we can tell from the record, reference by the Magistrate to the state court record or the state court\u2019s findings in the state habeas corpus proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-17\">We realize six months elapsed between appointment of counsel and the district court\u2019s order. It thus could be inferred that petitioner\u2019s counsel did not participate in this case as vigorously as he should have. On the other hand, the request for replacement of counsel, the change of courts, and counsel\u2019s apparent belief that a hearing would be held before the court ruled may provide an explanation for his inaction. We believe justice will be best served by remanding to the district court for further proceedings. Counsel for petitioner should be allowed to file pleadings presenting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>contentions made to this Court to the district court for whatever action the district judge deems appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Since the case must be remanded for further proceedings, we call to the district court\u2019s attention a decision of this Court rendered after action on the case below which relates to the grant of the certificate of probable cause by the Magistrate\u2019s action alone. <em>See </em>Stewart v. Beto, 5th Cir. 1971 [No. 71-2099, slip opinion dated October 1, 1971].</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Remanded with directions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
