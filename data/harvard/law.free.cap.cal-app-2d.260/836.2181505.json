J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAj\">\u2014Defendant was accused of violating section 11530 of the Health and Safety Code (possession of marijuana). In a nonjury trial, he was found guilty of violating section 11556 of the Health and Safety Code (unlawfully being in place where narcotics are used), a lesser and included offense in the offense charged. He appeals from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-12\">Appellant contends that there was no reasonable cause for his arrest and a search incident thereto; that the evidence does not support the judgment; and that the provisions of section 11556 of the Health and Safety Code are unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-13\">It was stipulated that the People\u2019s case might be submitted on the transcript of the preliminary examination, and that exhibits received at that examination might be received in evidence at the trial. Officers Johnson and Kemples testified at the examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-14\">On November 9, 1966, about 3 :30 p.m., while Officers Johnson and Kemples were in a police car traveling easterly on Wilshire Boulevard near June Street, they saw a convertible automobile, without a front license plate, traveling westerly on Wilshire. They pursued the automobile and stopped it on June Street. Two men were in the automobile\u2014the defendant was on the right-hand side of the front seat. As Officer John<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>son approached and \u201cleaned over\u201d the automobile in order to question the driver about the missing license plate, he smelled a fresh \u201codor of marijuana smoking.\u201d Officer Johnson had had special training and experience in narcotics cases. He asked the defendant and the driver to get out of the automobile. Defendant, who was wearing sunglasses, removed them at the request of the officer. Defendant\u2019s eyes were bloodshot and watery, his pupils were dilated, his speech was thick and slurred, and he appeared to be under the influence of something. There was no odor of alcohol on his breath. The officers arrested defendant and searched the automobile. They found a partly burned marijuana cigarette on the front seat. Under a small cloth on the front floor on the right-hand side of the automobile, near the place where defendant\u2019s feet had been, they found another partly burned marijuana cigarette, which was concealed by the cloth. The officers also searched the defendant and found several packages of Zig-Zag cigarette papers of the type which commonly are used to roll marijuana cigarettes.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">The cigarettes and Zig-Zag papers were received in evidence (at preliminary examination) over defendant\u2019s objection. At the trial the arrest report and a property report were also received in evidence as the People\u2019s exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">Defendant did not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">Defendant\u2019s mother, called as a witness by defendant, testified in substance that the automobile in which defendant had been riding when he was arrested had been parked in the driveway of her house for approximately 8 months prior to November 9, 1966 (date of arrest), during which time it had not been used; the defendant, who was 20 years of age, did not have a driver\u2019s license; and once a week a group of teenage boys played musical instruments in her garage, and on those occasions they moved the automobile in and out of the garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">Mr. 0 \u2019Grady, a retired police officer, called as a witness by defendant, testified in substance that he had ten years\u2019 experience in narcotics cases and had testified many times in court as an expert in the use of narcotics; a supposition on his part would be that the odor of smoke of a burnt marijuana cigarette, in an open convertible automobile, would persist a \u201cfew minutes,\u201d-\u2014depending on whether the butt or roach was in an ash tray; the immediate reaction to the use of marijuana is dilation of the pupils of the eyes; if there is extended use of marijuana, the eyes will become bloodshot; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>marijuana odor will stay on the breath at least an hour after smoking marijuana; the effect of marijuana on speech \u201cvaries on the human factor,\u201d and slurred speech is not necessarily a symptom of the use of marijuana; and if he, as a police officer, had stopped a person who had watery and bloodshot eyes, no odor of marijuana on his breath, and slurred speech, he would form an opinion that the person possibly was under the influence of alcohol and was not \u201cunder the influence of a drug, per se narcotics. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">Appellant contends that there was no reasonable cause for his arrest and the search of the automobile. He argues that the \u201carrest report examined in the light of the testimony of the expert witness 0 \u2019Grady clearly showed that there was no reasonable or probable cause for the arrest and, therefore, the incident search was unlawful.\u201d The facts regarding the arrest, as shown in the arrest report, are substantially the same as the facts hereinabove set forth, except that there is no statement therein that the pupils of defendant\u2019s eyes were dilated or that his speech was slurred. Questions as to the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence were for the determination of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">When the officers saw the automobile being driven on the public highway without a front license plate, they had reasonable cause to stop the automobile (Veh. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 5200-5202, 40000; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Sanson, </em>156 Cal.App.2d 250, 253 [319 P.2d 422].) As one of the officers approached the automobile in order to ask the driver about the missing license plate, he detected a fresh odor of marijuana smoke emanating from the automobile. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Layne, </em>235 Cal.App.2d 188, 190, 193 [45 Cal.Rptr. 110]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Tisby, </em>180 Cal. App.2d 574, 576 [5 Cal.Rptr. 614]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Clifton, </em>169 Cal.App.2d 617, 619 [337 P.2d 871]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Barcenas, </em>251 Cal.App.2d 405, 407 [59 Cal.Rptr. 419].) When the defendant had alighted from the automobile and had removed his sunglasses, the officer noticed that the pupils of defendant\u2019s eyes were dilated (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Clifton, supra, </em>p. 619) and that his speech was slurred (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Layne, supra, </em>p. 190). After having made those observations, the officers arrested the defendant. There was reasonable cause for the arrest, and the search was incident to the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">Appellant further contends that the evidence does not support the judgment. He argues that there is no evidence that defendant had knowledge that narcotics were being unlawfully smoked or used; and that there is no evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>defendant was in a \u201cplace\u201d where narcotics were being smoked or used\u2014that an \u00e1utomobile is not a \u201cplace\u201d within the meaning of section 11556 of the Health and Safety Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">Said section 11556 provides: \u201cIt is unlawful to visit or to be in any room or place where any narcotics are being unlawfully smoked or used with knowledge that such activity is occurring.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">There was ample evidence from which it could be inferred that defendant knew that marijuana was in the automobile and that marijuana was being smoked therein. A fresh odor of marijuana smoke was emanating from the automobile when it stopped; two partially burned marijuana cigarettes were in the automobile; one of the cigarettes was under a cloth on the floor near the place where defendant\u2019s feet had been; and defendant exhibited symptoms of being under the influence of marijuana. Knowledge of the presence of the marijuana could properly be established by circumstantial evidence. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Finn, </em>232 Cal.App.2d 422,426 [42 Cal.Rptr. 704].)</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">Appellant also argues, as above indicated, that he was not in a \u201cplace\u201d where narcotics were unlawfully smoked\u2014he asserts that an automobile is not a \u201croom or place\u201d within the meaning of section 11556; and that since the general word \u201cplace\u201d follows the more specific word \u201croom\u201d in section 11556, then, under the rule of <em>ejusdem generis, </em>the general word (place) should be limited to spaces similar to the specific word (room).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">In <em>Kansas City Breweries Co. </em>v. <em>Kansas City, </em>96 Kan. 731 ,[153 P. 523], a statute provided that it was unlawful for any person to maintain any place where intoxicating liquors are manufactured, sold, bartered, or given away. The court held that a vehicle moving from one place to another ivhile engaged in selling intoxicating liquors is a \u201cplace,\u201d and said (153 P. at p. 524): \u201cWhat is a \u2018place\u2019 as named in the liquor nuisance statute ... f It is any place or thing in or out of which intoxicating liquors may be sold. It may be a railway train, moving across the state. It may be a barrel in an alley. [Citation.] It may be a wagon or any other vehicle, moved from one part of the city to another. It is not necessary that the place be a building or in any particular kind of structure. [Citation.]\u201d (See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rogle, </em>100 Kan. 590 [164 P. 1165].)</p>\n<p id=\"b862-9\">In <em>Steward </em>v. <em>State, </em>75 Nev. 498 [346 P.2d 1083], a statute provided that the jury might view the place in which the offense is alleged to have been committed. The trial court per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>mitted the jury to view a truck which was identical with the truck in which the murder bad been committed. The appellate court held that the view was proper and said: \u201cThe fact that the \u2018place\u2019 consists of a vehicle would not circumvent the statute. [Citations.] \u2018. . . the process of view need not be applicable merely where land is to be observed. . . .\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fancy </em>(1965) 349 Mass. 196, 203-204 [207 N.E.2d 276], where officers searched defendants\u2019 automobile pursuant to a warrant issued under a statute which authorized warrants for searching a \u201cparticular house or place,\u201d the court held that the word \u201cplace\u201d included an automobile, and said: \u201cIt is hardly likely that a legislative policy permitting searches of homes, the citadels of privacy, would not also embrace the search of automobiles. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">With reference to the doctrine of <em>ejusdem generis, </em>it is said in <em>People </em>v. <em>Silver, </em>16 Cal.2d 714, 721 [ 108 P.2d 4]:  \u201cIt is to be remembered that \u2018the doctrine of <em>ejusdem generis </em>is but a rule of construction to aid in ascertaining the meaning of the Legislature, and may be used to carry out, but not to defeat the legislative intent.\u2019 \u201d (See 1 Witkin, Cal. Crimes (1963) Introduction, \u00a715, p. 17.) The \u201cmajor consideration in interpreting a criminal statute is the legislative purpose,\u201d and the court \u201cwill usually inquire into the evils which prompted its enactment and the method of elimination or control which the Legislature chose.\u201d (1 Witkin, Cal. Crimes, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 11, p. 13.)  It is apparent that said section 11556 was enacted as an aid in eliminating or controlling traffic in narcotics, and that the word \u201cplace,\u201d as used in the section, was intended to designate a location or space other than that which is ordinarily referred to as a room in a building or structure. If the word \u201cplace,\u201d as used therein, were to be interpreted, under the doctrine of <em>ejusdem generis, </em>as meaning a room in a building, it is apparent that such an interpretation would tend to defeat the legislative purpose of eliminating or controlling traffic in narcotics. Appellant\u2019s asserted interpretation of the word \u201cplace,\u201d as used in the section, is not sustainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-9\">Appellant also contends that section 11556 is unconstitutional in that there is no provision regarding criminal intent. Prior to the 1957 amendment of section 11556, the section was declared unconstitutional because, under the section as then worded, it was unlawful for a person to be in a room or place where narcotics are smoked or used irrespective of whether the person had knowledge that such unlawful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>activity was occurring therein. <em>(Bonwell </em>v. <em>Justice </em>Court, 148 Cal.App.2d 906, 907-908 [307 P.2d 716]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Drake, </em>151 Cal.App.2d 28, 49-50 [310 P.2d 997].) In 1957 the Legislature, in order to overcome the objections regarding unconstitutionality, amended the section by adding the words \u201cwith knowledge that such activity is occurring.\u201d (See West's Annotated Codes, Health and Safety Code, \u00a7 11556 Historical Note, p. 312 [Deering\u2019s Health &amp; Saf. Code Ann., \u00a7 1156, Legislative History No. 5, p. 751].) As amended, the section is not unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">Fourt, J., and Lillie, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
