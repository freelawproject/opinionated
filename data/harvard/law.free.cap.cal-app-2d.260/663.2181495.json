J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXJ\">\u2014The appeal is by the State of California, plaintiff in a proceeding in eminent domain. The property condemned consisted of fractional lots improved by two old apartment houses located on \u201cO\u201d Street between 14th and 15th Streets in Sacramento. Condemnation was for use in connection with the Capitol Master Plan. The case was tried to a jury which awarded the condemnees $120,000. The state\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>motion for a new trial was denied. It appeals from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">The sole contention on appeal is that the eondemnees\u2019 two appraisers who appraised the property jointly fixed values contrary to law, speculatively and as of a date 3 years subsequent to the date of trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">As is not unusual the two experts produced by the state appraised the value of the property at approximately one-half of the value placed upon it by the two eondemnees\u2019 experts. One of the former fixed its value at $57,000, the other at $63,000. Condemnees\u2019 appraisers jointly reached the same sum: $120,000. Indicative of the fact that the science of real estate appraisal is not now an exact science is that both sides presented experts who used the same basic methods of appraisal, reaching widely disparate results.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">Both the state\u2019s and eondemnees\u2019 experts started with the fundamental and venerable rule, the early expression of which by our Supreme Court was: \u201c [T]he rule is of universal acceptance that the measure of . . . damage is the market value; that is to say, the highest price estimated in terms of money which the land would bring if exposed for sale in the open market, with reasonable time allowed in which to find a purchaser, buying with knowledge of all of the uses and purposes to which it was adapted and for which it was capable. \u2019 \u2019 <em>(Sacramento etc. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Heilbron </em>(1909) 156 Cal. 408, 409 [104 P. 979].) It has been adopted by Evidence Code section 814 with additional explication as that price \u201cwhich a willing purchaser and a willing seller, dealing with each other in the open market and with a full knowledge of all the uses and purposes for which the property is reasonably adaptable and available, would take into consideration in determining the price at which to purchase and sell the property. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">Both sides\u2019 appraisers also considered what has been referred to as the appraisal \u201ctrinity.\u201d This combines three methods or \u201capproaches\u201d by appraisers to reach the market value of real estate: (1) the current cost of reproducing the property less depreciation from all sources; (2) the \u201cmarket data\u201d approach or value indicated by recent sales of comparable properties in the market, and (3) the \u201cincome <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>approach,\u2019\u2019 or the value which the property\u2019s net earning power will support based upon the capitalization of -net income. This three-approach means of reaching market value is usually combined. It is stated in American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers, \u201cThe Appraisal of Real Estate\u201d (3d ed.) at page 66: <em>. </em>. In the majority of his assignments, the</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">appraiser utilizes all three approaches. On occasion he niay believe the value indication from one approach will be more significant than from the other two, yet he will use-all three as a check against each and to test his own judgment.\u201d All three methods have been judicially approved. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Eden Memorial Parle Assn. </em>(9th Cir. 1965) 350 F.2d 933, 935.) In the \u201cincome approach\u201d various techniques are employed. The technique selected will depend upon the belief of the appraiser making the appraisal as to the highest and best use of the subject property. One technique is known as the \u201cbuilding residual\u201d or \u201cgross multiplier\u201d approach. Another is called the \u201cproperty reversion\u201d or \u201cproperty residual\u201d approach. The state\u2019s appraisers adopted the former approach; the condemnees\u2019 appraisers adopted the latter. The state\u2019s position is that use of the \u201cproperty reversion\u201d technique resulted in evaluation of the property three years after the date of trial rather than as of the date of trial. Two statements, one by each of condemnees \u2019 appraisers, ;are taken out of context to support the contention. Since \u25a0 the statements of the two appraisers are substantially the .same, use of one of them will suffice. We set it forth in a footnote.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">The appraisers\u2019 statements only seem like a future evaluation. The fallacy of the state\u2019s argument may best be illustrated by an elaboration of the facts.  The -existing improvements on the subject property consist of two old houses remodeled into one bedroom apartments and the owner\u2019s living quarters. The state\u2019s appraisers envisaged the highest and best use of the property being condemned ( con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>ceded to be the basis for consideration in the appraisal of market <em>value\u2014Hayward Union High School Dist. </em>v. <em>Lemos </em>(1960) 187 Cal.App.2d 348, 351 [9 Cal.Rptr. 750]) to be the continued use of the present buildings for the rest of the life thereof, deemed to be 20 years. Condemnees\u2019 appraisers, on the other hand, saw a present value for a higher and better use. It had been stipulated that the area would probably be rezoned from R-5 to C-2. Such rezoning would permit high rise apartment buildings or hotel-motel complexes. Condemnees\u2019 experts deemed that to be the highest and best use of the property. In an appropriate \u201ctransitional\u201d neighborhood presentation of market values based upon such uses was proper. <em>(People </em>ex rel. <em>Dept. of Public Works </em>v. <em>Donovan </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 346, 352-353 [19 Cal.Rptr. 473, 369 P.2d 1].) The state in fact does not on appeal quarrel with the highest and best use adopted by condemnees\u2019 appraisers. Nor does it contend here that the \u201ccomparable sales\u201d used by those appraisers were improper. Actually, it is the differences between the beliefs of the appraisers of the opposing parties regarding such uses and sales which explain the higher market value fixed by condemnees\u2019 appraisers and not their differences as to methods of calculation. We will explain this.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Implicit in the use of \u201ccomparable sales,\u201d of course, is that the sales compared shall have similarity to the subject property. A factor involved is similarity of location. The subject property is a block from the south boundary of Capitol Park. Close by are the state cap\u00edtol and several state buildings; also a large modern church and the city\u2019s newest hotel. Several blocks away is a freeway in the process of building, part of a system which, when completed, will surround Sacramento. The section directly involved will be completed this year. Benefits to through traffic are not its only purpose. It will also \u201ctie together\u201d the various sections of the city. Fifteenth and Sixteenth Streets (less than one and two blocks respectively east of the subject property) will be principal avenues of approach and departure to and from the freeway. Across the street from the property and to its north, under the <em>present </em>Capitol Master Plan, is the proposed governor\u2019s mansion. (Since this action the question of relocation may, as appellant\u2019s opening brief suggests, have become a stormy controversy.) The improvements on the subject property comprise two old buildings dating back to the era when inadequate levees protecting the city prompted home builders to construct dwellings with stairways to what normally would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>the second story. These buildings are so constructed. The not-too-recent modernization of the exterior facade has consisted of the application of a white-cake-frosting of stucco. The interior apartments are said to be modern and in excellent condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">It has been held that it is proper for appraisers in proceedings in eminent domain to take into consideration as <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>comparable sales\u201d property \u201cadjacent to a rapidly expanding county and city government center.\u201d <em>(People </em>ex rel. <em>Dept. of Public Works </em>v. <em>Donovan, supra, </em>57 Cal.2d 346, 352.)</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Condemnees \u2019 appraisers selected as the comparable sal\u00e9 upon which they placed greatest reliance, one involving property adjacent to Capitol Park near its northeast corner. Others were used for comparison purposes in the vicinity of the civic betterment projects we have mentioned. We deem this selection to have been one which was properly placed before the jury. Indeed, as stated, we do not understand the state to contend otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">\u201cComparable sales\u201d are factors in each of the \u201ctrinity\u201d of methods of real property appraisal. Our vital concern is with the \u201cincome approach,\u201d and particularly that technique known as the \u201cproperty reversion\u201d or \u201cproperty-residual\u201d method. That method was accomplished here through the following steps: the appraisers (1) determined the present value of the raw land as if presently put to the-highest and best use; then (2) determined the date when the-present use should be terminated; then (3) determined the value of the raw land as of the date described- in step (2) above) (4) that value discounted for the period from the present until the date found under step (2) was determined to be the present value of the raw land; they then (5) added thereto the net income flowing from the present use capitalized over the transition period. Using that technique and basing their computations upon the comparable sales selected, the value of the raw land for its highest and best use was determined to be $17 per square foot. That value was fixed both as of the then present time and as of the termination-of-present-use date. That date was fixed at 3 years hence. The appraisers did not believe there would be any material change in the market during that period. Three years was selected because they were of the opinion that would be the period of time it would take the buyer to \u201cput the deal together,\u201d i.e., arrange for financing, obtain prospective tenants, etc. The present value of the raw land was obtained by discounting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>$17 per square foot over 3 years (utilizing a-compound interest factor of 10 percent). That was done by using Table VIII, Present Worth of One Dollar, Compound Interest Valuation Premise Por Computing the Value of a Reversion, in The Appraisal Process by George L. Schmutz.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Part VIII, Tables.) The factor given in that table is .7513. Seventeen dollars multiplied by .7513 is $12.77, which the appraisers rounded off to $12.75, which multiplied by the number of square feet involved totaled $112,200 as the value of the land. To determine the value to be added for the income from the improvements, the appraisers took the annual net income of $4,300 per year, used an interest rate of 10 percent, thus obtaining a factor of 2.487, which multiplied by $4,300, and again \u201crounded out,\u201d gave them an improvement value of $10,000. The added land and improvement values were $122,200, the market value computed by the \u201cincome approach. \u2019\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Condemnees\u2019 appraisers did not, as the state contends, value the property as of a date 3 years after the trial. What they did was to compute the value of the land (based on past comparable sales) at the end of the estimated feasible life of its present improvements and used this value as- a factor in determining present value through the \u201cincome approach.\u201d Without going into detail appraisal authorities cite and even recommend the \u201cproperty-- reversion\u201d\" Or \u201cproperty residual\u201d techniques as a proper \u201ctool\u201d for use by appraisers .\u2018.\u2018where economic life [of the subject property] is nearing its end.\u201d (American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers, The Appraisal of Real Estate (3d ed.) p. 312; see also Crouch, <em>A Perspective Look at Highest and Best Use, </em>The Appraisal Journal (Apr. 1966) p. 172.) The Assessors\u2019 Handbook (California State Board of Equalization) states at page AH 501-81: \u201c. . . Appraisers have not made much use of the property reversion technique. This is unfortunate because it is one of the simplest and most logical ways of capitalizing income.\u201d The same handbook states (p. AH 501-81) : \u201c [I]f a good estimate of value of property at some future date can be made, the property reversion technique should be used. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">By use of the market data approach and the cost of reproduction less depreciation approach for comparison purposes condemnees' appraisers obtained figures of $110,000 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>$135,000 respectively as market value. Those figures tend to confirm the $120,000 obtained by the \u201cproperly reversion\u201d technique under the income approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">If the joint opinion reached by condemnees \u2019 appraisers may be termed \u201cbullish,\u201d the opinions of the state appraisers, which envisaged a continued use of this already three-quarters of a century old building for another 20 years, could be said to be \u201cbearish\u201d\u2014at least the jury must have thought so, and we cannot say its determination was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">The cases cited by appellant to support its theory that the value fixed by condemnees\u2019 appraisers was based upon conjecture <em>(Central Pacific R.R. Co. </em>v. <em>Pearson </em>(1868) 35 Cal. 247, 262-263; <em>Sacramento etc. Drainage Dist. </em>ex rel. <em>State Reclamation Board </em>v. <em>Reed </em>(1963) 215 Cal.App.2d 60, 64 [29 Cal.Rptr. 847]; <em>Arnerick </em>v. <em>Almaden Vineyards Corp. </em>(1942) 52 Cal.App.2d 265 [126 P.2d 121]; <em>Coast Counties Gas &amp; Electric Co. </em>v. <em>Miller &amp; Lux Inc. </em>(1931) 118 Cal.App. 140, 144 [5 P.2d 34]) are so dissimilar on their facts that they need not be reviewed.
