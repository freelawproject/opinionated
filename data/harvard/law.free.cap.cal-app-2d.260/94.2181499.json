It was further separately alleged in each count that defendants were at the time of the commission of the respective offenses armed with deadly weapons, namely a pistol and a rifle. It was further alleged that Henderson had previously been convicted of robbery in Los Angeles in February 1964. Henderson admitted the previous conviction and pleaded not guilty. In a jury trial Henderson was found guilty as charged and was sentenced to the state prison. A timely notice of appeal was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">A r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of some of the facts is as follows: Reid on August 8, 1966, had $1,560 in cash in his possession and went to Dee\u2019s Cafe in the evening where he exhibited the money to Blassinghame and Bright. Reid invited Blassinghame and Bright to come by his home in San Fernando and they apparently accepted the invitation for they were at Reid\u2019s home at about 8:80 p.m. Reid and his two friends were in Reid\u2019s living room having a drink when there was a knock on the door. Reid went to answer the knock at the door and when he arrived at the front door preparatory to opening it the door was suddenly opened and two men wearing nylon stockings over their heads and down to the area between their lips and chins entered the room. Reid could see the faces of the men well enough to know who they were. The men, one of whom was Henderson, stated: \u201cThis is a stiekup. We want what you\u2019ve got.\u201d Reid replied in effect that no one there had anything of value whereupon Henderson came up to Reid and hit Reid across the head with the butt of the rifle or shotgun thereby causing Reid to fall to the floor. Henderson then kicked Reid in the stomach. Davis was armed with a pistol. At about this time the two robbers told Blassinghame and Bright to \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>Turn your backs to us. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">The television was in operation in an adjoining room and Henderson told Davis to see who was in the adjoining room. Davis complied and returned to the room with Reid\u2019s stepdaughter, Jean Lee. Henderson attempted to loosen the belt of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>Reid\u2019s' trousers and Reid thereupon took off his pants. Henderson told Davis, who was standing by Blassinghame and Bright, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d and then stated to the victims, \u201cWe don\u2019t want nobody to move for five or ten minutes,\u201d and then said, \u201cThis is just to let you know I\u2019m not kidding\u201d and Henderson fired a shot into the living room. The robbers then left. Reid recognized Henderson\u2019s voice during the robbery and while hospitalized he identified Henderson\u2019s photograph. Reid required surgery and stayed in the hospital for a week or 10 days and then was transferred to a Veterans Hospital where he stayed for a month or so. Reid had seen both of the robbers prior to the robbery at Dee\u2019s Cafe, at another bar and at a house which was next door to a former friend of Reid\u2019s. Reid had talked with each of the men previously and had seen Henderson in an old gray automobile. During the week following Reid\u2019s release from the hospital, he saw the two men in a yellow 1966 Pontiac GTO automobile parked near Dee\u2019s Cafe.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Bright testified that his wallet containing $40 or more was taken from him at the time, of the robbery of Reid at Reid\u2019s house, that a gun was pointed at him. Further, that while he had his face on the floor he heard Reid call out, \u201cOuch\u201d and later saw blood on Reid\u2019s head. Bright did not think that Henderson was one of the robbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Blassinghame stated that the door was kicked open and someone said, \u201cAll of you hit the floor.\u201d that he saw a rifle and put his head on a couch and someone took his wallet from his pocket. He further said there was a \u201ccrack\u201d kind of a sound and Reid then said \u201cUgh.\u201d Blassinghame could not identify the robbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">A witness testified that in the afternoon of September 3, 1966, he saw Henderson driving a gray 1959 Plymouth automobile (depicted in Exhibits 3 and 4). An automobile salesman stated that on August 9, 1966, he sold to Davis a yellow 1966 GTO LeMans automobile upon which Davis had made a cash down-payment of $480.25.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">A witness who lived across the street from Reid stated that he saw two tall Negro men, between 8:30 and 9 p.m. on August 8, 1966, walk in front of the gray Plymouth car depicted in Exhibits 3 and 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">Appellant now asserts that the judge erred in failing to have all of the identification evidence of Reid read back to the jury, that the evidence of sudden wealth was inadmissible, that the jury was improperly instructed and that the prose<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>eutor was guilty of misconduct in his argument to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">The record discloses that after several hours of deliberation the jury apparently requested that Reid\u2019s testimony with reference to the identification of the robbers \u201cat the time of the commission of the offense\u201d be read back to them. The court reporter was directed to find such portions of the testimony and upon direction of the court read back to the jury Reid\u2019s testimony \u201cconcerning the identification of the perpetrators at the time of the commission of the offense.\u201d This consists of about 12 pages of the reporter\u2019s transcript. The jury was then directed to continue with its deliberation. Out of the presence of the jury the prosecutor suggested to the court that the reporter had omitted some testimony of Reid to the effect that one of the defendants had a goatee or beard. Counsel for appellant stated \u201cYes, I think Mr. Reid did mention that\u2014\u201d The judge expressed confidence in the reporter and the prosecutor indicated that his notes showed a reference to a goatee or a beard and counsel for appellant replied, \u201cThere was mention of the beard and the photographs in the hospital and also in the lineup.\u201d The judge then said, \u201c. . . that\u2019s my point, but that is not what was asked for. They asked for the identification given at the time of the crime.\u201d Neither of defense counsel made any objection to the testimony read nor did either of them request the reading of additional testimony. Appellant presently makes no reference to any other certain testimony which the court should have read to the jury. Clearly the jury got what it asked for and that is all that we are concerned with under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The evidence with reference to Davis\u2019 purchasing an automobile on the day following the robbery did not concern Henderson. There was no evidence that Henderson had exhibited any sudden wealth. The evidence in question had to do with Davis and not Henderson and could not have prejudiced Henderson.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">In the prosecutor\u2019s argument to the jury, he said: \u201cNow, the question in my mind is on whose side is Mr. Bright? What is Mr. Bright\u2019s real interest in the case? Mr. Bright was in the pool hall and he saw the money. The bartender was there and he saw the money. The question which comes up in my mind, and it may come up in yours, as to why Mr. Reid was robbed. Now. it is possible that Mr. Bright saw that money <em>at </em>Dee\u2019s and told his friend. Mr. Henderson about it.\u201d Counsel for Henderson objected to the statement by the prosecutor upon the theory that he was attempting to impeach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>Ms own witness. Out of the presence of the jury counsel for Henderson argued, \u201cI think if you want to impeach him you have to do it deliberately with malice aforethought, by putting somebody on, and he can\u2019t impeach him this way.\u201d The judge responded by stating in effect that the prosecutor had the right to point out certain possibilities, to make comments and draw inferences from the testimony, that it was shown in the evidence that the witness and Henderson were quite friendly. Appellant now urges that the judge erred in failing to instruct the jury that Henderson was not guilty of robbing Bright if the taking of Bright\u2019s property was not by force or fear, <em>i.e., </em>but rather by collusion. No such instruction was requested. Pull instructions on robbery were given and the implied finding of the jury is that there was no collusion. Had Henderson wanted such an instruction he should have presented it. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>180 Cal.App.2d 745, 752 [4 Cal.Rptr. 679].)</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">In the closing argument the prosecutor in answering the arguments of counsel for the defendants said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-7\">\u201cMr. Charig also pointed out the fact that no stockings were found on either of the defendants when they were arrested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-8\">\u201cI think that is ridiculous that they\u2019re going to carry around something like that for a month. Hardly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-9\">\u201cAlso he doubts the fact that you could see the goatee and yet Mr. Reid stated that the stocking mask didn\u2019t come below the chin, and Mir. Reid was on the floor and he was testifying to what he saw on the underside of their faces. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">Admittedly Reid did not testify that either of the robbers wore a goatee or a beard. This statement however, taken as it must as a part of all that was said in court, could not possibly have been prejudicial. Reid positively identified Henderson as one of the robbers. If it was error it was harmless. (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 13.)</p>\n<p id=\"b121-11\">We have considered the matters raised by appellant and find no merit to any of his contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-12\">The attempted appeal from the order denying a motion for a new trial is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-13\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-14\">Wood, P. J., and Lillie, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-15\">A petition for a rehearing was denied April 8, 1968, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied May 9,1968.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
