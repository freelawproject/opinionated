In the same handwriting as the letter, the envelope\u2019s face reads:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-9\">\u201cMr. Herman Wolfe R. 1. Box 22 Gardon Tex \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-10\">On the reverse side of the envelope, also in the same handwriting, there is written:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-11\">\u201815 days return to R. 1.

Respondent acted\u2014 and still acts\u2014on behalf of an adult child of Herman, who is now deceased. Appellant, one of several collateral heirs of Ernest, appeared below in opposition to the petition for probate. Her opposition was based upon the contentions, among others, that the letter was not a will because it did not reflect testamentary intent on Ernest\u2019s part and that it failed to meet the formal requirements of a holographic will. (Prob. Code, \u00a7 53.)</p>\n<p id=\"b613-14\">The appeal is from the probate court\u2019s order admitting the letter (with the envelope) to probate as Ernest\u2019s will. Appellant does not challenge the court\u2019s finding that the instrument was, in form, a valid holographic will. The sole/ question on the appeal is, as appellant states, \u201cWhether the letter . . . meets the requirement of testamentary intent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-15\">Where a trial court\u2019s interpretation of a written instrument turns upon the credibility of conflicting extrinsic evidence admitted in aid thereof, we are bound by the interpretation reached. <em>(Parsons v. Bristol Dev. Co. </em>(1965) 62 Cal. 2d 861, 865 [44 Cal.Rptr. 767, 402 P.2d 839].) We are free to make our own interpretation, however, if the trial court (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>admitted no extrinsic evidence, (2) made its determination upon incompetent evidence, or (3) acted upon evidence which was not in conflict. <em>(Parsons </em>v. <em>Bristol Dev. Co., supra, </em>at pp. 865-866; <em>Estate of Darms </em>(1966) 247 Cal.App.2d 254, 257 [55 Cal.Rptr. 463].) Appellant states that \u201cNo evidence, either oral or documentary, was presented to the [probate] Court\u201d when the petition for probate was heard. While this may be literally true, it is apparent that the court considered certain extrinsic facts in interpreting the letter to be Ernest Wolfe\u2019s will.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Some of the extrinsic facts reached the probate court in the form of uneontroverted allegations in the parties\u2019 pleadings and briefs below: others had been adjudicated in a previous probate proceeding. None of the facts is disputed, and the evidence of none is in conflict. We are therefore free to make our own interpretation of the letter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>(Parsons </em>v. <em>Bristol Dev. Co., supra, </em>62 Cal.2d 861 at pp. 865-866; <em>Estate of Darms, supra, </em>247 Cal.App.2d 254 at p. 257.) So doing, however, we must consider the extrinsic facts agreed upon below, because of their obvious relevance to the issue of Ernest\u2019s testamentary intent. Including them, the facts shown are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">On and before July 29, 1927, Ernest Wolfe was a resident of San Mateo County. He owned real property in Menlo Park. He was single and had no children, never having married. Herman Wolfe was Ernest\u2019s brother. Herman was alive on July 29, 1927, but has since died. On that date, Ernest wrote and mailed the above quoted letter to Herman. The letter was entirely written, dated and signed in Ernest\u2019s handwriting. On or about July 29, 1927, Ernest left his last place of residence, disappeared, and has not been seen or heard of since. In 1965, he was adjudicated to be a missing person within the meaning of chapter 2 of division 2a of the Probate Code (commencing with section 280).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>Our interpretation of the letter is guided by the following- principles: an instrument may be admitted to probate as a will if it appears from the instrument\u2019s terms, viewed in the light of the' circumstances of its execution, that it was executed with testamentary intent. <em>(Estate of Sargavak </em>(1950) 35 Cal.2d 93, 95-96 [216 P.2d 850, 21 A.L.R.2d 307]; <em>Estate of French </em>(1964) 225 Cal.App.2d 9, 15-16 [36 Cal.Rptr. 908]; 1 Page, Wills (3d ed.) \u00a75.6, p. 172.)  The burden of proving the necessary element of testamentary intent rests upon the proponent of the alleged will. <em>(Estate of Beebee </em>(1953) 118 Cal.App.2d 851. 861 [258 P.2d 1101].)</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">The basic test of testamentary intent is not the testator\u2019s realization that he was making a will, but whether he intended by the document in question to create a revocable disposition of his property to take effect only upon his death. <em>(Estate of Button </em>(1930) 209 Cal. 325, 331 [287 P. 964]; <em>Estate of Sargavak, supra, </em>35 Cal.2d at p. 95; <em>Estate of Crick </em>(1964) 230 Cal.App.2d 513, 516 [41 Cal.Rptr. 120].) Thus, a document written in the form of a letter, and which meets formal holographic requirements (as the letter before us does), will be admitted to probate if the requisite testamentary intent appears. <em>(Estate of Button, supra, </em>at pp. 332-333; <em>Estate of Crick, supra; </em>1 Page, supra,\u00a7 6.21, p. 276; Atkinson, Wills (2d ed.) \u00a747, p. 207; Annotation, \u201cLetter as a will or codicil,\u201d 40 A.L.R.2d 698.)</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">If testamentary intent adequately appears, a document\u2019s testamentary character is not affected by the fact that it includes nontestamentary matters <em>(Estate of Button, supra, </em>209 Cal. at pp. 330-331; <em>Estate of Sargavak, supra, </em>35 Cal.2d at p. 101; <em>Estate of Schultz </em>(1960) 54 Cal.2d 513, 516 (fn. 2) [6 Cal.Rptr. 281, 353 P.2d 921, 81 A.L.R.2d 1106.].)  No particular words are necessary to show testamentary intent. <em>(Estate of Button, supra, </em>at p. 331; <em>Estate of French, supra, </em>225 Cal.App.2d at p. 15.)  When an instrument shows on its face\u2014as in the case of the letter before us\u2014that it was written by an inexperienced or illiterate person, it may be construed more liberally than if it had been drawn by an expert. <em>(Estate of Lampkin </em>(1962) 203 Cal.App.2d 374, 376 [21 Cal.Rptr. 513] [citing 1 Page, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 6.2. p. 228].)</p>\n<p id=\"b615-12\">Under the foregoing rules and the known eircum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>stances in which Ernest Wolfe wrote the letter of July 29, 1927, we interpret it as his will. He wrote \u201c [I] am leaveing my Place in Menlo Park for you[.]\u201d The words \u201cfor you\u201d sufficiently qualify \u201cam leaveing\u201d to demonstrate that Ernest intended the verb to effect a disposition of the \u201cPlace,\u201d and not to refer to his departure from it. Use of the word \u201cleave\u201d in a dispositive sense, although not conclusive <em>(Brandt </em>v. <em>Brandt </em>(1927) 85 Cal.App. 720, 729 [260 P. 342]), has been recognized as sufficient evidence of testamentary intent. <em>(Mitchell </em>v. <em>Donohue </em>(1893) 100 Cal. 202, 208-209 [34 P. 614, 38 Am.St.Rep. 279]; <em>Estate of Silva </em>(1915) 169 Cal. 116, 119 [145 P. 1015]. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (4th ed. 1951) p. 1036, \u201cLeave\u201d [4th par.]; Webster's New International Dictionary (3d ed. 1967) p. 1287, \u201cLeave\u201d (1a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Ernest also wrote \u201c [I]f I never call for it . . . the place is yours[.]\u201d Had he made a \u201ccall for it\u201d in later years, his previous testamentary disposition of the place would have been revoked. The question here is not whether a \u201ccall\u201d for the property would have actually effected a revocation of the disposition made in 1927, but whether Ernest intended that result. The word \u201cnever\u201d encompassed the reach of eternity, which included the inevitable event of Ernest\u2019s death. The passage quoted therefore imparted both (1) revoeability and (2) posthumous effect as requisite elements of Ernest's testamentary intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Ernest made the disposition in favor of his brother, with whom the letter itself showed him to have been on close and affectionate terms (\u201cLots of love to Brother Herman . . .\u201d). It does not appear that anyone else occupied a position superior to Herman as an object of Ernest\u2019s testamentary bounty, or that anyone would have held such position in the event of his intestacy. (Cf. <em>Estate of Golder </em>(1948) 31 Cal.2d 848, 852 [193 P.2d 465] [son\u2019s letter to his mother not interpreted as his will in her favor where such interpretation would have disinherited his spouse and child].)</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">We also note that Ernest, sending the letter by registered mail and admonishing Herman relative to its safekeeping (\u201c [I]f I were you I would keep this letter\u201d), thereby indicated his awareness of the letter\u2019s importance and character. Such perception, appearing from a similar admonition, has been recognized as evidence of testamentary intent in a written instrument. <em>(Estate of Dexter </em>(1918) 179 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>Cal. 247, 248 [176 P. 168] [letter of transmittal stating \u2018 \u2018 Keep all this enclosed \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Appellant argues that the letter does not show testamentary intent on the writer\u2019s part because, telling Herman that \u201cthis leaves me OK,\u201d it indicates that Ernest was not <em>in extremis. </em> Where a document or the circumstances of its execution have showed that its author was <em>in </em>extremis\u25a0\u2014-in the sense of anticipating imminent death\u2014the fact has been considered significant in the interpretation of the document as his will. (See cases reviewed, <em>Estate of Spencer </em>(1948) 87 Cal.App.2d 591, 595-597 [197 P.2d 351].) The absence of the same fact has contributed to an opposite conclusion <em>(In re Richardson </em>(1892) 94 Cal. 63, 65 [29 P. 484, 15 L.R.A. 635]; <em>Estate of Kelleher </em>(1927) 202 Cal. 124, 128 [259 P. 437, 54 A.L.R. 913]; <em>Estate of Spencer, supra, </em>at p. 597): but its absence is not decisive where the document in question shows testamentary intent apart from considerations of the testator\u2019s health. (See <em>Estate of Crick, supra, </em>230 Cal.App.2d at p. 519.)</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Moreover, the term <em>\u201cin </em>extremis\u201d is not exclusively applicable to an actor\u2019s anticipation of imminent death. It characterizes any situation in which the actor is \u201cin extremity\u201d (Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, <em>supra, </em>at p. 894) or in \u201cextreme circumstances.\u201d (Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, <em>supra, </em>at p. 1157.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n                   Ernest\u2019s letter stated that \u201cI am flat broke except my place I . . . have not got no job here yet so I am . . . leaveing to hunt work . . . not so good here for me ...\u201d The situation depicted appears to have been one of \u201cextreme circumstances\u201d which found Ernest <em>in extremis </em>in an economic sense, although not anticipating imminent death. Other language in the letter (\u201cI dont know where I am going ... do not write ... do not know when I will write again ... I never come back untell I get an nother Start\u201d) indicates sufficient uncertainty of the future to have motivated Ernest to make a testamentary disposition of his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">Appellant further contends that Ernest, by the letter, intended only to convey to Herman a \u201ccurrent interest,\u201d or a \u201cdefeasible estate,\u201d in his property. The argument is based upon several passages in the letter, each of which\u2014read <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>by itself\u2014suggests that Ernest intended to vest in Herman only the right to collect rent (\u201c[The place] ... is rented now $22.50 per month the rent is due on the 5th of each month but you might hafto give Elsie part to Colect it\u201d); or to occupy the property (\u201c [I]f you ever take a notion to come to Calif you will have a place to live in\u201d); or to sell it (\u201cPS if you want to sell the place in Menlo Park go . . . head and sel it . . . [etc.] \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">But Ernest\u2019s dire economic straits, narrated in the letter as cited above, suggest that he was not in a position\u2014and therefore did not intend\u2014to make a present conveyance of everything of value that he owned (\u201cI am flat broke except my place\u201d). Each of the isolated passages quoted appears to have been advisory rather than dispositive, and the advice given in each instance (relative to Herman\u2019s collecting rent, occupying the property, or selling it) was entirely consistent with Herman\u2019s ownership of the property as its devisee. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s contention of each such passage must yield to our overriding interpretation of the letter\u2014reached from its full context and heretofore discussed\u2014that Ernest intended to make a testamentary disposition, effective upon his death and not as of the letter\u2019s date.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">The order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">Devine, P. J., and Christian, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b614-7\"> Our interpretation of the letter includes the verbatim text quoted above which, due to the illegibility of the original, differs slightly from the typewritten version reproduced in the clerk\u2019s transcript on appeal. We obtained the original letter from the probate court and augmented the record on appeal to include it. (Rule 12(a), Cal. Rules of Court.) The differences mentioned do not affect our substantive interpretation of the letter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b614-8\"> This occurred in the previous probate proceeding heretofore mentioned. That proceeding was commenced by appellant, who alleged Ernest\u2019s intestacy and was appointed administratrix of the estate of Ernest Wolfe, a missing person. The other proceeding was called to the probate court\u2019s attention in this one, appellant having explicitly pleaded it in her opposition to respondent\u2019s petition for probate. The probate court\u2019s file in the other proceeding also established Ernest\u2019s residence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>and his ownership of real property in Menlo Park, on and before the date of the letter and his disappearance. We judicially notice the contents of the file in the other proceeding. <em>(Flores </em>v. <em>Arroyo </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 492, 496 [15 Cal.Rptr, 87, 364 P.2d 263].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b617-9\"> Defining <em>\u201cin extremis,\u2019\u2019 </em>Black\u2019s, <em>supra, </em>notes that \u201cIn extremis does not always mean in articulo mortis.
