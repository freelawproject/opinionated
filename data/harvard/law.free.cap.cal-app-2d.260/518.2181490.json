J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ah7\">\u2014The Union Central Life Insurance Company (\u201cUnion\u201d) interpleaded the sum of $50,000, payable by it on the death of Raymond V. Pepe. The contesting claimants are Mavis C. Janssen, the former wife of the decedent, and Karla G. Pepe, his widow. After discharging Union from any further obligation under its policy upon deposit of the proceeds in court, the superior court granted Karla\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Mavis appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">Several declarations were filed in support of and opposition to Karla\u2019s motion. The facts disclosed- therein are not in conflict. .;</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">The chronology of events is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-11\"><em>April 15, 1953. </em>James B. Lansing Sound,' Inc. (\u201cLansing\u201d) entered into a group life insurance contract with Occidental Life Insurance Company of California \u2018 (\u201cOccidental\u201d) by the terms of which policy the lives of Lansing\u2019s executives were insured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-12\"><em>September 1,1955. </em>The deceased was classified as an executive of Lansing and became eligible to participate in the group life insurance program provided by the Occidental policy. ' \u2022 \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-13\"><em>April 25, 1956. </em>The deceased signed an \u201cenrollment card for group insurance.\u201d On this card, which we shall call the Occidental enrollment card, he designated Mavis as his beneficiary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-14\"><em>May 9, 1956. </em>Just two weeks after the deceased had designated Mavis as his beneficiary, a final California judgment of divorce was entered dissolving their marriage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-15\"><em>January 7, 1961. </em>The deceased married Karla.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-16\"><em>July 19, 1961. </em>Preceding that date Lansing had started negotiations with Union which led to the replacement of the Occidental policy by the one issued by Union. The Occidental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>policy was canceled effective July 19,1961. In connection with the changeover the Occidental enrollment cards, including the one signed by the deceased, were sent to Union which retained them in its files. The deceased never signed a new enrollment card for Union.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A certificate of insurance under the Union policy was issued to the deceased, effective June 23, 1961. When thus issued the designated beneficiary was \u201cMavis C. Pepe, wife.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-3\"><em>August 15,1964. </em>Deceased died.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-4\"><em>August 16,1964. </em>William H. Thomas, the president of Lansing, his secretary, John Edwards, the treasurer of Lansing, and the parents of Karla met in the decedent\u2019s office. His desk was locked. No one had a key. It was opened with tools. The Union certificate No. 64 was found. Mavis\u2019 name and most of the designation \u201cwife\u201d were erased and the words \u201cKarla G-. Pepe, wife\u201d were typed in the space for the designation of the beneficiary. There is no evidence when this was done, nor, for that matter, who did it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">\n<em>Discussion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">The Union policy contains the following provision with respect to the designation of the beneficiary: \u201cThe insured has the right on his sole signature to designate a beneficiary and to direct that the death benefits be paid under a settlement option (Section F) and to change the beneficiary or method of settlement at any time and from time to time by written notice in form acceptable to the Company. Such sums <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>as may be .payable.on the insured\u2019s death.will be paid to the beneficiary, designated by him subject to ,th.e following limitations. (a), If no beneficiary was . designated \u2022 \u2022 . the amount \u2022-due will.be paid to the deceased\u2019s spouse if living. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">. Karla\u2019s argument is predicated on the assumption i. .-that the. \u2022 deceased never designated a beneficiary \u2018 \u2018 on his sole signature.\u201d We .cannot agree that there is no triable issue on .. .that point. The quoted, policy provision speaks of a \u201cform of . designation acceptable to the Company.-\u201d.The recital of facts &gt; suggests very strongly that the .practical interpretation by the parties involved was that Union recognized the written designation on the Occidental enrollment card as the designation of beneficiary required by the terms of its policy. <em>(Crestview Cemetery Assn. </em>v. <em>Dieden, </em>54 Cal.2d 744, 752-754 [8 Cal.Rptr. 427, 356 P.2d 171].)</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Although, as we said 'at the' outset, the facts disclosed by the various declarations are not in conflict, they are not the ultimate facts which will decide this controversy. One of these ultimate /facts surely ,is whether or not the deceased designated Mavis,as the beneficiary \u201con &lt;his sole signature.\u201d Conflicting inferences with respect to that fact can be drawn from /.Union\u2019s use of, the:,Occidental 'enrollment card in connection ' with.- the : issuance of - its \u25a0 certificate, of -insurance to the deceased. We do not mean, to suggest that the inference that Union treated the Occidental enrollment card as the signed designation of beneficiary under its policy is compelling, but it is one which a trier of facts,may.draw from this record. It may well be, as Karla suggests in) her pleadings, that the delivery of the Occidental enrollment cards, to Union was nothing more than the furnishing of a mailing list so that Union, would know where to send ne.w enrollment cards to be signed by the Lansing executives. .This , only .means, however, that there is an issue to be tried, an,,issue that cannot be resolved by the procedural'shortcut sought by Karla. <em>(Stationer's Corp. </em>v. <em>Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Inc., </em>62 Cal.2d 412, 417 [42 Cal.Rptr. 449, 398 P.2d 785]; cf. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co. v. McIntosh, </em>112 Cal.App.2d 177, 181-182 [245 P.2d 1065].)</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Karla do.es not even suggest that the typewritten change on the certificate necessarily effected a change of beneficiary in her favor. In any event, it is obvious that it cannot be so considered-at this stage: While -there, is a :strong \u25a0 inference from the facts recited above that the change was made either by the deceased himself or with his authority, there is no evidence one way or another concerning the time when it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>was made. A little detective work before the trial might give the court somewhat more information on that point. The time when the change was made is vital because under the authorities\u2014see for example <em>Pimentel </em>v. <em>Conselho Supremo, etc. Portugueza, </em>6 Cal.2d 182, 188 [57 P.2d 131]\u2014one of the exceptions to strict compliance with policy provisions regarding a change of beneficiary is that \u201cIf the insured has pursued the course pointed out by the laws of the association, and has done all in his power to change the beneficiary, but before the new certificate is actually issued he dies, a court of equity will treat such certificate as having been made.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>p. 188.)</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">Stephens, J., and Aiso, J. pro tem.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b544-13\"> Assigned by the Chairman of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
