(a).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">Two prior felony convictions were charged in the information, one a 1960 Texas felony, the other a 1963 Mississippi conviction. The Texas felony was found to be true. There was no finding with respect to the Mississippi conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-11\">The matter was submitted to the trial court on the transcript of the preliminary hearing at which hearing defendant had been represented by the public defender. The facts disclosed at that hearing, briefly summarized, are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b545-12\">On February 27, 1966, defendant and Mrs. Oppegard, with whom he shared an upstairs apartment at the Brookmore Hotel in Pasadena, had some kind of argument. She called the police and met several officers downstairs. It is not very clear whether she wanted defendant arrested or merely desired the officers to help her get her clothing out of the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-13\">One officer called defendant on the telephone and asked him whether he had a shotgun. Defendant dared him to \u201ccome up and find out,\u201d threatening to kill anyone that came near the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-14\">The officers went upstairs. Defendant was asked to open the door to the apartment. His response was another threat. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>door was then kicked open hy an officer. Defendant;stood in the room holding a shotgun which was pointed towar d \u00a1'.the .. door. Its hammer was 'cocked'.\"' He made' another' threat and came,closer to the door. Finally, Officer. Sh.ell, who was. also armed with a shotgun, shot\u2018at defendant, wounding him .-and., badly shattering one area of defendant\u2019s gun forward of the trigger. Only .one shot was.heur^,^immediately after Shell\u2019s shot the hammer on defendant\u2019s shotgun..was- still cocked. Shell received a slight buckshot wound in or near his left eye. It was never determined^.whether..it.was caused by the.,phot from his own gun. The only-evidence-that defendant fired-his, - gun is\" testimony by,.one officer that -the; gun. contained one \u2022 spent shell which smelled as if it had been recently fired.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Defendant was -bound over 7,011 a charge -of assaiilt with intent to commit murder. (Pen. Code,\u00a7 217.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">In the superior court defendant was represented by private - counsel..\"On June 20, 1966, defendant,'in-'persbnyAraived his right to-\u2019a jury trial. Counsel jdined in the waiver. The prosecutor-and defense counsel then entered a \"stipulation to -submit' \u2022 the matter on the transcript o\u00a3: the preliminary\" hearing, subject to the right of both sides to call-additional 'witnesses. Defendant did not personally participate \u00fa\u00f1' the\u2019stipul'atioh or\" affirmatively indicate his assent thereto.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>It is noted that iff view of the reserved right to call additional witnesses, defendant.had\u2014hs1 far as 'the record shows\u2014\u25a0 no reason to anticipate that he would not get an opportunity to testify in his own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The case came on for trial on June 30, 1966. The following is a complete copy of the transcript of the proceedings: \u201cThe Court : People versus Wheeler. Let the record show that the Court has read the entire transcript of the preliminary hearing in this case and has examined the \u2022 exhibits. Mr. Lewis : The People rest. The Clerk : Was there a submission here ? The Court: Yes. ['Defense Counsel] : The defense rests, \" 'your Honor. The Court: Do you want to argue it? Mr. \u2022 \"Lewis : The People will submit the matter. \u25a0 [Defense Coun- \" sel] : The defense submits the matter,' your Honor. The Court: I find the defendant guilty of assault with a deadly :Weapon, \"a lesser and necessarily included off\u00e9nse than that charged in the Information, assault'with a deadly weapon with intent to.commit murder. ThE Defendant: <em>Whatl </em>[Defense , Counsel] : Your-Honor, the]'defendant waives time for sentience and requests leave of Court to.file a written application \" fo'r.pf\u00f3bati\u00f3h. The Court : The\u2018matter wi! be referred to the</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">\u2022 Probation Department, it will be set for hearing on probation '\u2022 'and s\u00e9nt\u00e9nce on July 21st at 9 :30. The defendant is remanded J tp the custody of [the Sheriff pending further hearing. The Defendant <em>;.You mean I have been tried? \u25a0 </em>The Court : Certainly. You just'got tried and were found guilty. [Defense Counsel]: A.D.W. -The Defendant: <em>Wait a minute. I \u25a0haven\u2019t-said a word.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> * </em>The Court: Take him out. of here. ' \"'The Defendant: <em>What is this? </em>The Court: Wait a minute. . Come here. This case was submitted on the transcript by your \u25a0counsel. At the last \u25a0\" hearing it was -submitted'on the transcript of the testimqny taken \u00e1t the preliminary hearing and I have read the transcript, and on the basis of the testimony llu there I found you guilty, so you \u2018have had a trial. What are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>you complaining about? The Defendant: <em>1 haven\u2019t said a word. </em>The Court: You don\u2019t have to say a word. Your counsel didn\u2019t put you on. You don\u2019t have to say anything. The Defendant: <em>What did 1 pay him, forf </em>The Court: I don\u2019t know.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Take him out. [Defense Counsel] : Thank you.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">We think this case is indistinguishable from <em>Brookhart </em>v. <em>Janis, </em>384 U.S. 1 [16 L.Ed.2d 314, 86 S.Ct. 1245.] In <em>Brookhart </em>the Supreme Court reversed when defense counsel agreed to proceed under a procedure known as a \u201cprima facie ease.\u201d This meant that he would be unable to cross-examine witnesses. The trial court announced that by thus proceeding the defendant, though not technically or legally, 1 \u2018 in effect admits his guilt and wants the state to prove it.\u201d Defendant had then <em>said: \u201cI would like to point out in no way am I pleading </em>guilty <em>to this charge.\u201d </em>Nevertheless his counsel said: \u201cPrima facie, Your Honor, is all we are interested in.\u201d Reversing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>the Supreme Court said: \u201cOur question therefore narrows down to whether counsel has power to enter a plea which is inconsistent with his client\u2019s expressed desire and thereby waive his client\u2019s constitutional right to plead not guilty and have a trial in which he can confront and cross-examine the witnesses against him. We hold that the constitutional rights of a defendant cannot be waived by his counsel under such circumstances. It is true, as stated in <em>Henry </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>379 U.S. 443, 451 [13 L.Ed.2d 408, 415, 85 S.Ct. 564], that counsel may, under some conditions, where the circumstances are not \u2018exceptional, preclude the accused from asserting constitutional claims . . .\u2019 Nothing in <em>Henry, </em>however, can possibly support a contention that counsel for defendant can override his client\u2019s desire expressed in open court to plead not guilty . . . and enter in the name of his client another plea\u2014whatever the label\u2014which would shut off the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to confront and cross-examine the witnesses against him which he would have an opportunity to do under a plea of not guilty. ...\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>pp. 7-8 [16 L.Ed.2d p.319].)</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">If, in this quote, we substitute the words \u201coffer testimony\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> for \u201cconfront and cross-examine the witnesses against him, <em>\u201cBrookhart </em>becomes this case. We cannot, in conscience, distinguish <em>Brookhart </em>on the basis that there the defendant spoke up a little sooner. The record shows that he had more time.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">We recognize that defendant did not express his desire to testify until after the court had found him guilty. This opinion should not be construed to encourage outbursts by defendants after they have gambled and lost. Nor do we intimate that an attorney must comply with a client\u2019s desire to testify when his professional judgment tells him that he should not. (See dictum in <em>People </em>v. <em>Gutowsky, </em>219 Cal.App.2d 223, 227 [33 Cal.Rptr. 79]; cf. <em>In re Atchley, </em>48 Cal.2d 408, 418-419 [310 P.2d 15].)</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">The trouble with the record in this ease is that when it must have been apparent to the trial court that there may have been a serious breakdown of communications between defendant and his attorney and that defendant may have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>totally unaware that the ease would be submitted without his own testimony, an inquiry should have beeti instituted. If,' after such an inquiry, the trial' court had' found either expressly or impliedly that defendant\u2019s protests were nothing but an act or that counsel made \u00e1 tactical decision \u00bf\u00f3t to have' his client testify, we would be 'bound by the consequences of such a finding. Unfortunately nothing of the sort ^ooK place and we cannot asstime that the ruling would neees\u00e1\u00e1tiiy have been adverse to defendant. On paper, at least, his complaints, have the ring of truth and his counsel\u2019s conduct in other respects makes us doubt whether he gave' this case any thought except how to gefit over with quickly.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">We have given consideration to'remanding the ease to the superior court for the sole purpose of instituting a heating with these limited determinations in mind; however, in view' of the entire record, particularly'the ineffectiveness of counsel in other respects, we think that the proper course for us is to reverse the judgment in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Hufstedler, J., and Stephens, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">On April 23, 1968, the opinion' was modified to read as printed above.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b545-15\"> The alleged victim o\u00a3 the assault was a uniformed police officer engaged in the performance of his duties and it seems highly probable that if defendant was guilty at all, he was guilty of the more serious violation of section 245, subdivision (b) of the Penal Code. The trial court, however, when finding defendant guilty did not say anything about the identity or occupation of the victim. The original judgment simply recited that defendant had been found guilty of the \u201ccrime of assault with a deadly weapon (Sec. 245 PC) . . .\u2019\u2019 The clerk\u2019s clerical omission was corrected <em>nunc pro tunc </em>while this appeal was pending. Our record was appropriately augmented.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b546-7\"> Certain points .should be noted with\u2019 respect.to the recital o\u00a3 facts:. 1. There is no evidence tha| any.. of ..the officers at any time., informed. . defendant that it \"was their purpose t\u00f3 arreSt Mm. On appeal .defendant takes the position that the.police eoiild not legally arrest him. Tlie People counter by pointing to section 834-a- of the Penal Code which declares that a person who knows, or should know, that he is being arrested must not use force to resist. The statute has been interpreted to apply to lawful and unlawful- attempts .to arrest. <em>(In re Bacon, </em>240 Cal.App.2d 34, 52-53 [49 Cal.Rptr. 322].) In <em>People </em>v. <em>Coffey, </em>67 Cal.2d 204 [60 Cal.Rptr. 457, 430 P.2d 15], (see text accompanying fn. 19), however, it was held that section 834a only applies where the police, in fact, attempt an arrest, not just a detention for questioning. In view of -the holding in <em>Coffey </em>it seems particularly vital that peace officers comply with sections. 841 and 844 of the Penal Code whenever possible; 2. although,, technically, completion of the crime of which defendant was convicted did not require that he. actually fire his gun- <em>(People </em>v. <em>McCoy, </em>25 Cal.2d 177, 189-194 [153 P.2d 315]), the evidence that he did fire is rather slight. Although various photographs' were taken, the only one. which shows an area where \"buckshot hit was one identified by Officer Shell..\u00e1s.Ilavhig been taken-in the direction- in which\" Shtil himself 'fired. Shell \u2019s'jinjuiy does not pi-ove very-much since sd\u00edne'of th\u00e9-shpt from his guM\u00edpit\u00edjti-Mwe rico.-, cheted off defendant\u2019s gun.'

The record demonstrates that counsel\u2019s hand did nothing but guide defendant straight to prison. If we did not reverse for the reason stated in the opinion, the facts of this case would probably force us to conclude that defense counsel\u2019s performance reduced the trial to a \u201cfarce and a sham.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ibarra, </em>60 Cal.2d 460, 464-466 [34 Cal.Rptr. 863, 386 P.2d 487].) The probation report disclosed several possible defenses to the charge which might have been established by defendant's testimony and psychiatric evidence. Without any real faith in the matter, we assume that they were investigated and found not worth pursuing, Counsel\u2019s failure to make any argument with respect to the various legal problems apparent on the face of the preliminary transcript is harder to explain. Finally, his conduct at the time of sentence is beyond belief. The prior Texas felony was found to be true on the basis of the following record: \u201cThe Court: Is there any question about the first prior? [Defense Counsel] : The one in Texas, that is a good prior, isn\u2019t it? The Defendant: Yes. [Defense Counsel] : No objection. . . . The Court: . . . The Court finds the first prior charged, the Texas prior, to be true. ...\u201d To what did defense counsel have \u201cNo objection\u201d? Nothing had been offered. Can an attorney rely on the client\u2019s assurance that a prior conviction \u201cis a good prior\u201d? A lay client is probably the last to know whether his earlier conviction can be legally proved. The prosecution may run into problems of authentication <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cuevas, </em>250 Cal.App.2d 901, 908-910 [59 Cal.Rptr. 6]) or voidness for constitutional reasons <em>(People </em>v. <em>Coffey, </em>67 Cal.2d 204, 214-215 [60 Cal.Rptr. 457, 430 P.2d 15]; <em>In re Woods, </em>64 Cal.2d 3 [48 Cal.Rptr. 689, 409 P.2d 913]). Even when <em>Betts </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>316 U.S. 455 [86 L.Ed. 1595, 62 S.Ct. 1252] was thought to be good law, the United States Supreme Court held in <em>Chewning </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>368 U.S. 443 [7 L.Ed. 2d 442, 82 S.Ct. 498] that in a state recidivist proceeding \u201cthe labyrinth of the law is, or may be, too intricate for the layman to master.\u201d Here counsel treated the courtroom proceedings as an occasion to interview his client on a point on which the client was incompetent to assist him. He then stipulated away a wealth of possible objections of which he was quite uninformed. That is playing Russian roulette with just one empty chamber. (Cf. <em>Fay </em>v. <em>Noia, </em>372 U.S. 391, 440 [9 L.Ed.2d 837, 870, 83 S.Ct. 822].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b549-9\"> \u201cA person\u2019s right to reasonable notice o\u00ed a charge against him, and an opportunity to be heard in his defense\u2014a right to his day in court\u2014 are basic in our system o\u00ed jurisprudence; and these rights include, as a minimum, a right to examine the witnesses against him, to <em>offer testimony, </em>and to be represented by counsel.\u201d <em>(In re Oliver, </em>333 U.S. 257, 273 [92 L.Ed. 682, 694, 68 S.Ct. 499].)
