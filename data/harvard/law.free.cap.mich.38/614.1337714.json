Allen, </em>18 Mich., 194; there are no technical rules for framing an issue for the trial of an appeal from them, <em>Comstock v. Smith, </em>26 Mich., 306.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b651-4\"><em>Ed. E.

But we think this was no objection. Appeals from commissioners in probate cases are always at issue, and the making up of a new issue in the circuit court is a mere matter of form, and seldom necessary or important. A direction that such an issue be framed need not delay proceedings to a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Mandamus granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
