The circuit judge ruled that he would have in it no rights superior to those of the mortgagee.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">We cannot see how this conclusion can be questioned. It is only a new application of the rule laid down in <em>Ladue v. Detroit &amp; Milwaukee Ry. Co., </em>13 Mich., 380. It is true- it has been held in this State that if a mortgage is given to secure negotiable paper, the assignee of this paper and of the mortgage, if he becomes such in good faith for value and before maturity, may hold them discharged of pre-existing equities; <em>Reeves v. Scully, </em>Walk. Ch., 248; <em>Dutton v. Ives, 5 </em>Mich., 515: but where it does not secure negotiable paper, the rule is the other way. <em>Russell v. Waite, </em>Walk. Ch., 31; <em>Nichols v. Lee, </em>10 Mich., 526. There was no such paper in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">The judgment must be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b605-8\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
