The deputation endorsed on the summons was in the following words: \u201cBy request of plaintiff I hereby authorize Charles Harryman to serve the within process on the within defendant. Detroit, October 28, 1874. Frederick J. Barbier, Justice of the Peace.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">This deputation is claimed to be defective, because it does not recite that Harryman was a person of lawful age, and not interested in the suit. We do not think this a fatal defect. It is not usual to make such a recital,, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>and in the absence of any showing on the point, we cannot presume the justice selected an incompetent person.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">This is all there is of the case in this court. Judgment must be affirmed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
