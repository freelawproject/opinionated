John Yanderhorst purchased at that time the goods in question in this suit, agreeing to pay therefor one hundred and forty ($140.00) dollars, one Moses May at that time becoming surety for sixty ($60.00) dollars of this amount, which he afterwards paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-9\"><em>Fourth. </em>That after the expiration of the time of payment the Berkey &amp; Gay Furniture Company brought an action for the unpaid balance against said John Vanderhorst before E. J. Shinkman, Esq., a justice of the peace in the city of Grand Bapids, and obtained judgment on the 10th day of July, 1876, for balance unpaid and interest: damages, $81.63; costs, $3.31.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-10\"><em>Fifth. </em>Upon this judgment execution was issued and placed in the hands of defendant Bacon, who was at the time, and ever since has been, a constable of Kent county.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number><em>Sixth. </em>By virtue of this execution the defendant took control of the property involved in this case, it being the same property bought by Yanderhorst of the Berkey &amp; Gay Furniture Company, as above mentioned, but caused no appraisal of it to be made at that time or at any time afterwards; nor any removal of the property from Vanderhorst\u2019s house at that time because of facts hereinafter found.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-4\"><em>Seventh. </em>At the time Bacon so took possession of the property, Yanderhorst\u2019s wife said to the defendant that said Moses May was absent from home and that as soon as he returned he would pay the judgment. Defendant referred her to the Berkey &amp; Gay Furniture Company, and she and her husband went to the office of the company and Mrs. Yanderhorst then and there, in the presence of her husband and with his knowledge and without his objection, agreed that she would execute a regular receipt for the property, which she afterwards did, as stated in the next succeeding paragraph of this finding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-5\"><em>Eighth. </em>That thereupon defendant went back to the house and obtained a receipt of said plaintiff\u2019s wife. [This receipt was the usual receipt taken by officers for property levied upon, and in it the receiptor promised to deliver the property to the officer on the 15th day of August following, or to pay the judgment.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-6\"><em>Ninth. </em>Upon said May\u2019s return he refused to pay for said goods, and thereupon, to wit: on the 24th day of August, 1876, defendant went and asked for the\u00bb goods in question upon said execution, and Mrs. Yanderhorst pointed them all out to the defendant as agreed, and made no objection to defendant\u2019s taking them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-7\"><em>Tenth. </em>That this was in the afternoon, \u2022 and defendant took possession of said goods, loaded them upon a wagon and started with them to Berkey &amp; Gay\u2019s ware-rooms for safe keeping, but while moving them and when about 1 1-4 miles from plaintiff\u2019s house he was served with the writ in the cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-8\"><em>Eleventh. </em>No objection was made to defendant\u2019s taking said goods or had been at any time before the commencement of this action, and no demand of the. goods or for their return was made before the service of the writ, but Yanderhorst was not at his house at the time of removal of said goods.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-9\"><em>Twelfth. </em>Soon after these goods were purchased by Vanderhorst he quit keeping boarding house. The goods in question in this case were worth about the sum of one hundred and forty dollars, and constituted all the furniture owned by Yanderhorst at the time save one stove and other household furniture not exceeding in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>value the sum of twenty-five dollars. And that Yanderhorst was a householder at the time the levy was made and this suit commenced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-4\">I also further find as a matter of law: that plaintiff is entitled to recover all of the goods in question, together with six cents damages and the costs of both courts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">It is objected to this conclusion\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">1st. That the goods were purchased, not as household goods but to carry on a business of profit, and therefore are to be considered stock in trade, or the means of carrying on the party\u2019s occupation. 'If so, they are not, under the statute, exempt from an execution on a judgment for the purchase price. Comp. L., \u00a7\u00a7 6101, 6131. But we doubt if these articles could at any time have been considered any thing else than household furniture. A boarding house keeper must be entitled to the same exemption of household furniture with any other person; and the finding shows that at no time did the plaintiff have more than was exempt. And when the levy was made he was not engaged in the business for which the furniture was purchased.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">2d. It Is said the plaintiff did not claim the property as exempt when the levy was made upon it. But this was not necessary. The statute exempts to a householder his furniture to the value of $250, and it requires the officer, when he' makes a levy, to proceed to have it appraised and set out to the debtor. Comp L., \u00a7\u00a7 6102 <em>et seq. </em>The statute is all the notification the officer needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">3d. It is claimed that the acts of the plaintiff and his wife were equivalent to a waiver of the exemption and to a turning out of the property on the execution. We do not think so. The wife gave a receipt for the property to save its being taken away while she made an effort to pay the judgment; but failing in this, she yielded possession to the constable. But this was only yielding to a force which she could not resist: it was not a surrender of any right.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>4th. The further suggestion is made that the officer was entitled to a r\u00e9\u00e1sonable time to make an inventory and appraisal, and that he may have been taking the furniture to a suitable place for that purpose. The suitable place for that purpose was the house where the things were found; the circumstances must be very extraordinary that would justify an officer in stripping a debtors\u2019 house of his furniture and taking it to another part of the town, in order that he may ascertain a fact which is just as easily ascertained without removing it at all. If this may be done with beds and bedding, it may be done with carpets on the floors, and the house may for the time be made untenantable. &gt; Intolerable abuses would be certain to spring up if this were permitted; and the case in hand suggests no reason for the course which was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">We are constrained to think the conclusion of the circuit judge was correct, and that as the officer was abusing his authority, no demand was necessary before bringing suit. The judgment must be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b709-5\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
