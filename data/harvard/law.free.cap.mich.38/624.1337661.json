The evidence is that Tolan made no transfer of any of the wheat and never received any thing for it. He used part of it for seed and applied the rest to domestic uses. If Mrs. Hodgeboom owned it, he was liable for the value-in trespass or trover. He never promised her to pay for it. He based his interference upon his purchase from Richards. The court charged in substance that if the wheat belonged to Mrs. Hodgeboom, and being aware of her rights, Tolan either used or sowed the wheat, he was liable in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">I am unable to distinguish this ease from <em>Watson v. Stever, </em>25 Mich., 386, and we there held that assumpsit was not maintainable. That case contained no evidence that the defendant had sold the property, but there was evidence tending to show he had retained and used it, and the judge instructed the jury the plaintiff might recover in that form of action if his assignor owned the property and the defendant \u201cused\u201d it without his consent. In passing upon the point, the opinion of the court said : \u201c If one has taken possession of property, and sold or disposed of it, and received money or money\u2019s worth therefor, the owner is not compellable to treat him as a wrong-doer, but may affirm the sale as made on his behalf and demand in this form of action the benefit of the transaction. But we cannot safely say the law will go very much further than this in implying a promise, where the circumstances repel all implication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>of a promise in fact. Damages for a trespass are not in general recoverable in assumpsit; and in the case of the taking of personal property, it is generally held essential that a sale by the defendant should be shown.\u201d The other questions become immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">The judgment must be reversed with costs and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b662-5\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
