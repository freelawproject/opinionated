McCrea, </em>1 Wend., 228; <em>Coles v.

If plaintiffs had sold their demand, \u2014 whether before suit brought or afterwards \u2014 the purchaser was still entitled to pursue his remedy in the name of the original contracting party.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">The court did not err in holding the plaintiff entitled to recover on the common counts in assumpsit, for what had been done by him on the special contract as modified. The case is governed by <em>Allen v. McKibbin, </em>5 Mich., 449. Nor can we say the court erred, as matter of law, in being guided by the contract in determining the <em>quantum meruit. </em>The circumstances \u2014 upon which we cannot pass \u2014 might or might not render it proper to be governed by it. Nor do we think any error in the allowances made to the parties respectively is shown by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">The judgment must be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b603-9\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
