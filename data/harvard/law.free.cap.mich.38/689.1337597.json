The circuit judge found the facts relating to the giving and the acceptance of the draft, and then adds that \u201cProm the foregoing facts, and as an inference therefrom, without further proof I conclude that the plaintiff must be held to have received the draft in payment.\u201d Plaintiff regards this conclusion as one of law, and has brought the case before us for review upon the finding. But the question whether certain facts make out an understanding between parties that a certain transaction shall settle a demand, is obviously one of fact, and had the judge been sitting with a jury, it would have been error in him to take it away from them. There is consequently nothing for us to review, and the judgment must be affirmed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
