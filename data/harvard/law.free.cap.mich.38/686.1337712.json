On the first Wednesday after the third Monday in May, and on the two following days, the assessor must be in his office to review the assessment roll, and on showing Of sufficient cause shall add to it any names that had been omitted (\u00a7 5). If any person refuses to pay the tax so assessed before the fourth Friday in June (\u00a7 7), the county treasurer shall issue his warrant to the sheriff \u2018reciting therein the name of such person, etc.; the business carried on, the amount of such tax and date of the same,\u2019 and commanding him to levy the amount of the assessment with ten per cent interest from its date and four per cent collection fees by distress and sale of any of the goods of the person refusing to pay or of any goods found in his possession, and in default of goods, of his lands and tenements, and to pay over the amount collected, reserving his fees, within ten days, to the county treasurer (\u00a7 8).

This warrant was issued under and in accordance with the provisions of section 8 of Act No. 228 of the session laws of 1875. The warrant, if fair upon its face, would be a sufficient protection to the officer in an action like the present where he is proceeded against as a tort feasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">It was said that the warrant was not fair on its face in that it recited that the assessment was made on the 24th day of May \u2014 which was the second day of review,\u2014 and that it was an assessment for a full year\u2019s tax, and not a pro rata tax for the unexpired portion of a year. It was also said that it contained no recital of a legal assessment, or allegation that a warrant had been issued by the assessor to the county treasurer, or that opportunity had been afforded the plaintiff to pay <em>the tax. </em>Also that the return of the sheriff did not show that he had made demand for the tax before making a levy.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">None of these objections were well taken. The assessor had authority to add to the assessment roll, during the days fixed by law for a review thereof, the name of any person liable to be taxed under the provisions of the act, and it was not necessary that any notice should be given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>the person whose name was so added. Such an assessment would be made in accordance with the provisions of section five of the act and would be for a full year\u2019s tax. Nor is this warrant open to the objection that it does not contain the necessary recitals; it contains all the recitals required by section eight of the act under Which it was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">The officer need not in his return set forth the fact that he had made a demand for the tax before making his levy. If such a demand was an essential pre-requisite before making the levy, the fact thereof might be shown by parol, and in the absence of any showing to the contrary the presumption would be that the officer had performed his duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Judgment affirmed with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b725-6\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
