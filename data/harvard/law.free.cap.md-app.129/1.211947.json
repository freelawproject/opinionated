A jury convicted Purvey of first-degree murder on July 17, 1990, and he was sentenced by the court to life in prison on September 27,1990. Purvey appealed his conviction to this court on October 29, 1990, and we dismissed the appeal on January 30, 1991. He petitioned the circuit court for post-conviction relief on June 9, 1995, and the court granted a belated appeal to this Court. On August 9, 1996, we affirmed Purvey\u2019s conviction in an unreported opinion. <em>Purvey v. State, </em>No. 1788, September Term, 1995, 111 Md.App. 748 (filed August 9, <em>199Q)(\u201cPurvey </em>I\u201d). The Court of Appeals denied certiorari on December 12, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-9\">On December 4, 1997, Purvey filed a second petition in circuit court for post-conviction relief, and he supplemented it on June 23, 1998, alleging that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. After a hearing on June 30, 1998, the circuit court granted Purvey\u2019s petition on September 3, 1998, ordering a new trial and adopting the Petitioner\u2019s Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and his Memorandum of Law as part of the court\u2019s opinion. On October 2, 1998, the State appealed, and it presents the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-10\">Did the post-conviction court err in granting Purvey a new trial when it concluded that his trial counsel failed to provide effective assistance of counsel?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b27-13\">We answer \u201cyes\u201d to this question and reverse. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-14\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b27-15\">In <em>Purvey I, </em>this Court summarized the evidence produced at trial as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>Albert Young and Joseph Harris, the vietim in this case, worked as laborers unloading produce trucks. On June 18, 1989, Young and Harris were awaiting a call from a trucker whose produce they were to unload at a Giant Food Store. At approximately 2:00 a.m., Harris told Young that he was going to Palmer\u2019s Liquor Store, which was three or four blocks away, and that Young could reach him there when the trucker arrived.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-4\">From the record, we discern that the liquor store area was a well known drug area. Young located Harris behind the liquor store among a group of forty or fifty people. As Harris reached for his gym bag, several men ran through the area firing handguns. Everyone began running and Harris told Young that he had been shot. Young called for help, but Harris died, either at the scene or shortly thereafter, from a chest wound. The bullet exited his body and was not recovered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-5\">The sole evidence linking appellant to the crime came from a statement he is alleged to have made to Detective Roberto Hylton. Appellant was arrested on June 27, 1989, after Germaine \u201cFung\u201d Bolden implicated him in the shooting. Appellant\u2019s alleged oral statement to Hylton contained the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-6\">He said he did not shoot anyone. It was Frank and Fung who did the shooting. He said that Fung, which is a nick name, is scared of Frank because they\u2019ve been in Boys [sic] Village together for a long period of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-7\">He said I was at Palmer\u2019s Restaurant. Frank and Fung met me there. We saw a boy by the name, the initial E. He hangs with the Jamaicans on a hill on Bell Haven Drive. He shoots at the young dealers when we go up to sell drugs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-8\">Then he continued, so he said, let\u2019s bust Slim.[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] Frank, Fung and I said, I drove, I drove them, I drove them to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>where the guns were stashed in my aunt\u2019s white car. We came back to Palmer\u2019s. I don\u2019t know who had which gun the .380 or the .38. Left the car on Flagstaff Street, on Fung\u2019s Street. Fung is Germaine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-4\">Frank and Fung fired a couple of shots. It hit the man. We ran to the car. I drove them to hide the gun. We did, and we drove away. Frank took off his black T-shirt in the woods. The next day we drove to where the guns were. Frank got them. We went to Seabrook skating. I think they\u2019re at Frank\u2019s house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-5\">Appellant denied giving this statement to Detective Hylton. He testified that he was at Palmer\u2019s that evening selling drugs. He alleged that Fung was also there selling drugs. He was going toward the store to buy a soda when he heard gunshots. Along with everyone else, and because he had cocaine on his person, he ran to his car and left the area.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b29-6\"><em>Purvey I, </em>slip op. at 1-2 (some footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">Purvey produced two witnesses to testify at the post-conviction hearing held on June 30, 1998. Retired Police Detective Dennis Babcock had no recollection of Purvey\u2019s arrest or prosecution, but testified, \u201capparently I was basically providing a service for [Detective] Hylton which was to pick up Mr. Purvey and bring him back to our office.\u201d At the time he was questioned by Detective Hylton, Purvey was already in custody of the Prince George\u2019s County Detention Center on an unrelated auto theft charge for which he had not posted bond. Purvey\u2019s second witness was his trial counsel, Sean Cleary, who was questioned at length about representation he had provided eight years earlier. His specific testimony concerning Purvey\u2019s post-conviction claims, as well as additional facts, will be included in the discussion below.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b29-9\">The State, as appellant, makes a simple argument that Purvey is not entitled to a new trial because his representation was constitutionally adequate. Purvey alleges four separate grounds why his counsel failed to meet the constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>standard and he should get a new trial. Additionally, he claims that the State cannot make certain legal arguments on appeal because those arguments were not raised in the second post-conviction hearing. We find Purvey\u2019s arguments without merit and reverse the lower court\u2019s judgment on his second post-conviction petition. As a preliminary matter, we discuss the legal standard for a finding that assistance of counsel has been ineffective. We then turn to our second preliminary issue, whether the State can raise all its issues on appeal, before examining each of Purvey\u2019s allegations of ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">\n<em>Standard for Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">Purvey must clear a high bar to prevail on his claim that counsel failed to provide representation comporting with the requirements of the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution. The Supreme Court set forth the standard for assessing this question in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Maryland courts have expounded upon this standard extensively in cases arising in this State. <em>See, e.g., Wiggins v. State, </em>352 Md. 580, 602-03, 724 A.2d 1, 12 (1999); <em>Oken v. State, </em>343 Md. 256, 283-85, 681 A.2d 30, 43-44 (1996), <em>cert. denied, </em>519 U.S. 1079, 117 S.Ct. 742, 136 L.Ed.2d 681 (1997); <em>Gilliam v. State, </em>331 Md. 651, 629 A.2d 685 (1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>510 U.S. 1077, 114 S.Ct. 891, 127 L.Ed.2d 84 (1994); <em>State v. Thomas, </em>328 Md. 541, 555-58, 616 A.2d 365, 372-73 (1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>508 U.S. 917, 113 S.Ct. 2359, 124 L.Ed.2d 266 (1993); <em>State v. Colvin, </em>314 Md. 1, 5-7, 548 A.2d 506, 508-09 (1988); <em>State v. Calhoun, </em>306 Md. 692, 729-32, 511 A.2d 461, 479-81 (1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>480 U.S. 910, 107 S.Ct. 1339, 94 L.Ed.2d 528 (1987); <em>State v. Tichnell, </em>306 Md. 428, 440-44, 509 A.2d 1179, 1185-87, <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 995, 107 S.Ct. 598, 93 L.Ed.2d 598 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">Under <em>Strickland, </em>a convicted petitioner claiming that ineffective assistance of counsel renders his conviction or sentence invalid must demonstrate that i) \u201ccounsel\u2019s representation fell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>below an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. at 2064, <em>and </em>that ii) he was actually-prejudiced, <em>ie., </em>\u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">In evaluating whether counsel\u2019s representation was reasonable, the court must examine certain acts or omissions identified by the petitioner \u201cin light of all the circumstances\u201d to determine whether \u201cthe identified acts or omissions were outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 690, 104 S.Ct. at 2066. The court looks at the \u201creasonableness of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct on the facts of the particular case, viewed as of the time of counsel\u2019s conduct,\u201d <em>id., </em>making every effort \u201cto eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065. Review is highly deferential, for \u201c[i]t is all too tempting for a defendant to second-guess counsel\u2019s assistance after conviction or adverse sentence, and it is all too easy for a court, examining counsel\u2019s defense after it has proved unsuccessful, to conclude that a particular act or omission of counsel was unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065. Under the <em>Strickland </em>standard, courts recognize that no single set of norms for vigorous advocacy defines what it is to receive adequate representation that ensures a fair trial. \u201cThere are countless ways to provide effective assistance in any given case. Even the best criminal defense attorneys would not defend a particular client in the same way.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, \u201cthe defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action \u2018might be considered sound trial strategy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Michel v. Louisiana, </em>350 U.S. 91, 101, 76 S.Ct. 158, 164, 100 L.Ed. 83 (1955)).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">Even if the defendant can show that counsel committed a professionally unreasonable error, he must also show that there is a reasonable probability, <em>ie., </em>probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome, that \u201cbut for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068. Counsel\u2019s error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>must have \u201cdeprive[d] the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. Maryland cases paraphrase this standard: the defendant \u201cmust show that there is a substantial possibility that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Oken, </em>343 Md. at 284, 681 A.2d at 44. \u201cA proper analysis of prejudice ... should not focus solely on an outcome determination, but should consider \u201cwhether the result of the proceeding was fundamentally unfair or unreliable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Lockhart v. Fretwell, </em>506 U.S. 364, 369, 113 S.Ct. 838, 842, 122 L.Ed.2d 180 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Under <em>Strickland </em>and our precedents, however, we need not resolve both of these nettlesome issues when one of the required prongs is clearly absent, neither must we examine them in any particular sequence. \u201cThe object of an ineffectiveness claim is not to grade counsel\u2019s performance,\u201d thus \u201c[i]f it is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice, which we expect will often be so, that course should be followed.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S.Ct. at 2069. <em>Accord Oken, </em>343 Md. at 284-85, 681 A.2d at 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">Within the <em>Strickland </em>framework, we will evaluate anew the findings of the lower court as to the reasonableness of counsel\u2019s conduct and the prejudice suffered. Whether counsel\u2019s performance has been ineffective is a mixed question of fact and law. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 698, 104 S.Ct. at 2070. As a question of whether a constitutional right has been violated, we make our own independent evaluation by reviewing the law and applying it to the facts of the case. <em>See, e.g., Jones v. State, </em>343 Md. 448, 457, 682 A.2d 248, 253 (1996). We will not, however, disturb the findings of fact and credibility determinations of the post-conviction court, unless they are clearly erroneous. Md. Rule 8-131(c); <em>Oken, </em>343 Md. at 299, 681 A.2d at 51; <em>Tichnell, </em>306 Md. at 442-43, 509 A.2d at 1186. Instead, we \u201cre-weigh the facts as accepted in order to determine the ultimate mixed question of law and fact, namely, was there a violation of a constitutional right as claimed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>443, 509 A.2d at 1186 (quoting <em>Harris v. State, </em>303 Md. 685, 496 A.2d 1074 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">\n<em>The State\u2019s Preservation of Issues for Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">Purvey asserts that this Court should not consider on appeal some of the reasoning with which the State bolsters its arguments, because it failed to preserve these \u201cissues\u201d for appeal by arguing them at the post-conviction hearing. For example, at the post-conviction hearing, Purvey argued that his lawyer did not adequately argue the motion to suppress the fruits of his arrest, which he claims was based on a faulty warrant. On appeal, the State augments its original response to this claim, which was based on <em>Strickland, </em>with an assertion that the police possessed probable cause to arrest Purvey. Therefore, post-conviction relief was inappropriate and he was not prejudiced by counsel\u2019s perceived omission. Purvey\u2019s objections, such as this one, redirect attention from the primary issue faced by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">Under Md. Rule 8-131(a), the appellate court will not ordinarily decide any issue \u201cunless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court, but the Court may decide such an issue if necessary or desirable to guide the trial court or to avoid the expense and delay of another appeal.\u201d The primary purpose of this rule is \u201c \u2018to ensure fairness for all parties in a case and to promote the orderly administration of the law.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Bell, </em>334 Md. 178, 189, 638 A.2d 107, 114 (1994) (quoting <em>Brice v. State, </em>254 Md. 655, 661, 255 A.2d 28, 31 (1969)).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">Rule 8-131(a), however, anticipates exceptions and implies discretion. For example, \u201c[t]he use of the word \u2018ordinarily\u2019 clearly contemplates both those circumstances in which an appellate court will not review issues if they were not previously raised and those circumstances in which it will.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 188, 638 A.2d at 113. Our discretion is limited, however, to those times \u201cwhen it is clear that it will not work an unfair prejudice to the parties or to the court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 189, 638 A.2d at 113. \u201cA criminal defendant could suffer unfair prejudice if, for example, the defendant\u2019s response to a new argument posited by the State on appeal depends on evidence which was not offered in the trial court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 189-90, 638 A.2d at 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">The instant appeal, however, does not require us to cast about for an exception under which to consider the State\u2019s arguments, because we find that those arguments were presented in summary form during the post-conviction hearing. The State\u2019s \u201cnew\u201d arguments are merely a fleshing-out, usually with information from the record, of the skeletal theories raised at the hearing. As such, they are not new. In both the post-conviction hearing and the briefs, the State has argued that defense counsel\u2019s performance was not constitutionally deficient because, even had he advanced Purvey\u2019s current theory in the trial court, the facts would not present adequate grounds for suppression of his statement to the police. Although presenting more detailed arguments might have been desirable, the State addressed the ultimate issue of whether Purvey had suffered ineffective assistance of counsel, at least in the general sense, at the post-conviction hearing. If the State, for example, had argued in the post-conviction hearing that only one prong of <em>Strickland </em>applied here, it might have been limited on appeal to relying on that single prong. The State, however, based its theory on both prongs of <em>Strickland </em>and now bolsters its reasoning with more specific information.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">The instant appeal, moreover, is distinguishable from the cases cited by Purvey and numerous cases in which we and the Court of Appeals have declined to entertain issues brought by one side or the other for the first time on appeal. In distinguishable cases, such as <em>State v. Bell, </em>334 Md. 178, 638 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>A.2d 107, defendants have often argued successfully <em>on direct appeal </em>from conviction that the State brought during the appellate process new legal justifications for the potentially unconstitutional actions of police. <em>See id. </em>at 190, 638 A.2d at 113 (holding that the Court of Special Appeals did not err when it declined to address question raised by State for first time on appeal of whether probable cause existed for second warrantless search). In contrast, we are now one step removed from that original appellate process. The ultimate issue before the post-conviction court, and this Court, is the adequacy of Purvey\u2019s defense attorney\u2019s performance, <em>not </em>the constitutionality of his arrest. The same attorney that Purvey claims failed him argued vociferously at his suppression hearing that Purvey\u2019s statement to police lacked voluntariness and that the police violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. During the post-conviction hearing, that attorney recalled that his client did not, at the time of the trial, challenge the validity of his arrest, just \u201cthat he did not say what they claimed he had said.\u201d It appears, then, that Purvey is using the petition process and an allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel as a Trojan Horse to bear the additional constitutional issues he failed to raise during his trial and the first post-conviction petition and appeal. We scrutinize only the horse itself, and not the surprises it contains, and reach our decision based upon our independent evaluation of the findings of the lower court under <em>Strickland. Oken, </em>343 Md. at 299, 681 A.2d at 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">\n<em>Purvey\u2019s Specific Contentions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">During the post-conviction hearing, Purvey raised four grounds upon which the circuit court found that he was denied effective assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment. We find, on each of these grounds, that Purvey failed to clear the high bar set in <em>Strickland, </em>and we thus reverse the order of the lower court for post-conviction relief. We address each issue in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">Failure to Make Alternative Argument to Suppress Purvey\u2019s Statement</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">Police questioned Purvey in connection with the shooting after they removed him from the custody of sheriffs deputies in the Prince George\u2019s County Detention Center, where he was being held on an unrelated charge. The record shows that Detective Babcock, bearing a warrant for Purvey\u2019s arrest, transported him to the Prince George\u2019s County Criminal Investigations Department, so that Detective Hylton might question him. Police obtained the affidavit in support of the warrant based on the statements of Purvey\u2019s co-defendant, Jermaine \u201cFung\u201d Bolden.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">The record shows that Cleary filed a written motion to suppress prior to trial. He argued vigorously at a suppression hearing held on July 17, 1990, that Purvey\u2019s statement to police should be suppressed because it was involuntary. Moreover, he argued that police had violated Purvey\u2019s right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment. At the post-conviction hearing, Cleary recalled that at the time his client did not challenge <em>how </em>the statement was taken, but only maintained \u201cthat he did not say what they claimed he said.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">Purvey argued at the post-conviction hearing that counsel was ineffective for failing to move to suppress the statement because police lacked probable cause to arrest him. Purvey also argued that the action of removing him from the custody of the sheriff without his consent for the purpose of interroga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>tion violated the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Md.Code (1957, 1998 Repl.Vol.), Art. 87, \u00a7 45 (duties to sheriff to keep custody of county prisoners until such persons are \u201cdischarged by due course of law\u201d), and Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 46 (duties of the sheriff toward prisoners).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">From the evidence presented at the post-conviction hearing, we discern that Purvey\u2019s arrest warrant was valid. Purvey\u2019s post-conviction counsel argues, based on the testimony of Detectives Babcock and Hylton, that the sole probable cause possessed by the State concerning Purvey\u2019s culpability was \u201cFung\u201d Bolden\u2019s statement to police. Bolden was a co-defendant. Maryland cases show that a co-defendant\u2019s statement to authorities may provide sufficient probable cause for issuing an arrest warrant. <em>See Mefford v. State, </em>235 Md. 497, 201 A.2d 824 (1964), <em>cert. denied, </em>380 U.S. 937, 85 S.Ct. 944, 13 L.Ed.2d 825 (1965) (arrest of defendant was legal where co-defendant had already confessed and turned over murder weapon). <em>See also Hopkins v. State, </em>239 Md. 517, 211 A.2d 831 (1965); <em>Boone v. State, </em>2 Md.App. 80, 233 A.2d 476 (1967); <em>Cherrix v. Warden, </em>1 Md.App. 65, 227 A.2d 50 (1967). Probable cause in the context of a warrant for a person\u2019s arrest means \u201cprobable cause to believe that an offense has been committed and also probable cause to believe that the person to be arrested committed it.\u201d <em>Giordenello v. United States, </em>357 U.S. 480, 483-84, 78 S.Ct. 1245, 1249, 2 L.Ed.2d 1503 (1958) (quoting Fed. R.Crim. Pro. 5(c)). Of course, the testimony of a co-defendant or other third person must be reasonably trustworthy. <em>Hopkins, </em>239 Md. at 520, 211 A.2d at 833.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">Here, it was clear that an offense had been committed, and Purvey fails to show that Bolden\u2019s statement did not give police probable cause to believe that Purvey was a culpable party. Purvey\u2019s post-conviction counsel correctly points out that the statements of co-defendants are not always considered reliable at trial. <em>See Lilly v. Virginia, </em>527 U.S. 116, 119 S.Ct. 1887, 144 L.Ed.2d 117 (1999) (holding that admission at trial of non-testifying accomplice\u2019s statement against penal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>interest violates defendant\u2019s rights under the Confrontation Clause and noting that such statements are inherently unreliable); <em>Williamson v. United States, </em>512 U.S. 594, 599-600, 114 S.Ct. 2431, 2435, 129 L.Ed.2d 476 (1994) (interpreting Fed. R.Evid. 804(b)(3) on statements against interest and stating that \u201c[o]ne of the most effective ways to lie is to mix falsehood with truth, especially truth that seems particularly persuasive because of its self-inculpatory nature.\u201d); <em>Lee v. Illinois, </em>476 U.S. 530, 106 S.Ct. 2056, 90 L.Ed.2d 514 (1986) (holding that trial court\u2019s reliance on co-defendant\u2019s statement, given only after he had been told that defendant had implicated him, was presumptively unreliable). For one to be convicted of a criminal offense <em>at trial, </em>however, a co-defendant\u2019s statement must be sufficiently reliable to allow the trier of fact to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. In contrast, for police to obtain a warrant <em>for arrest, </em>a co-defendant\u2019s statement must only be so reliable as to provide probable cause, a weaker evidentiary standard. The cases are thus distinguishable from the instant case. Furthermore, at the post-conviction hearing, Purvey failed to show why Bolden\u2019s statement would have been so unreliable as to not support probable cause. He, not the State, bore the burden of proof on this point. <em>See Green v. Warden, </em>3 Md.App. 266, 238 A.2d 920 (1968) (holding where nothing in testimony of applicant for post-conviction relief indicated that his arrest was illegal and no such evidence was offered, petitioner was not entitled to relief on grounds that conviction was based on illegal search and seizure). Finally, the post-conviction court relied on <em>Dunaway v. New York, </em>442 U.S. 200, 99 S.Ct. 2248, 60 L.Ed.2d 824 (1979), which is inapposite to the facts at hand. In <em>Dunaway, </em>the Court held that Fourth Amendment probable cause attached during the involuntary restraint and questioning of a perpetrator who had not yet been arrested. In contrast, before they questioned Purvey, police had probable cause and obtained a warrant, thus meeting their obligation under <em>Dunaway </em>before questioning began.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Because his arrest did not offend the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, we need not even address the issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>of whether Detective Babcock needed Purvey\u2019s consent to take him into custody. Consent is simply unnecessary when police have obtained a valid arrest warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">In view of Purvey\u2019s facially valid arrest, Cleary was under no professional obligation to argue Fourth Amendment issues at the suppression hearing. Neither is it likely that doing so would have changed the outcome of the suppression hearing or the trial. Whether another attorney might have done so in good faith to cover all contingencies is immaterial under <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>rule. We thus find that Purvey did not suffer ineffective assistance of counsel because Cleary did not raise the validity of the warrant at the suppression hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">Failure to Object During the Testimony of Detective Hylton</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">The post-conviction court also granted relief because Cleary did not object to questions posed by the prosecutor during the testimony of Detective Hylton. Detective Hylton testified that, when he conducted the interview with Purvey at the police station, Purvey orally waived his Fifth Amendment right to silence, and gave an oral statement. Without objection, Detective Hylton also testified that Purvey had refused to sign a written waiver of rights or reduce his statement to writing, explaining that \u201chis grandmother had always told him not to write down anything which would get him in trouble.\u201d Purvey also testified to this sequence of events.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">At the post-conviction hearing, Purvey argued that the jury might have inferred from the fact that he refused to write a statement that he \u201cinvoked his right to remain silent to avoid an admission of guilt.\u201d He characterizes Detective Hylton\u2019s factual blow-by-blow description about how the statement was taken as prohibited commentary on his right to remain silent. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">Try as he might, however, Purvey cannot change, over eight years later, the fact that he orally waived his rights under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number><em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), and participated in the questioning. He cites a string of cases that show how courts prohibit prosecutors from editorializing on a defendant\u2019s invocation of the right to keep silent or suggesting that juries draw from silence an inference of guilt. <em>See Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976) (court erred when it allowed prosecutor to impeach defendant\u2019s exculpatory story, told for the first time at trial, by asking why defendant had not told story to police); <em>Younie v. State, </em>272 Md. 233, 322 A.2d 211 (1974) (court erred when it admitted evidence that defendant had selectively refused to answer certain questions during custodial interrogation); <em>Casey v. State, </em>124 Md.App. 331, 722 A.2d 385 (1999) (court erred when it admitted portions of tape recording of defendant\u2019s statement in which he requested counsel and in which police expressed opinion that he was not being truthful); <em>Zemo v. State, </em>101 Md.App. 303, 646 A.2d 1050 (1994) (court erred when it permitted detective to testify that he gave defendant <em>Miranda </em>warnings and defendant then chose to remain silent); <em>Hunter v. State, </em>82 Md.App. 679, 573 A.2d 85 (1990) (court erred when it allowed trooper to testify that defendant had immediately crossed street after causing fatal accident and called his attorney). <em>Hunter, </em>however, is completely inapposite here; it does not concern <em>post-Miranda </em>silence or actions. <em>Doyle, Younie, Casey </em>and <em>Zemo </em>pertain to the defendant\u2019s invocation of the right to remain silent <em>after Miranda </em>warnings have been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Here, Purvey never exercised the right to remain silent. He chose to give a statement, and a facially non-incriminating one at that, <em>after </em>hearing the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. As Purvey\u2019s post-conviction counsel points out, he could have stopped speaking at any time, and the fact of his silence would have been inadmissible. He did not do so. Even during the trial itself, Purvey did not disavow the fact that he had given police a statement after he had been <em>Mirandized. </em>He acknowledged that he had waived his rights and made a statement. His only concern was for accuracy, that \u201che did not say [in the statement] what they claimed he did.\u201d Purvey thus did not choose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>to remain silent; he only refused to reduce to writing his existing statement and waiver of rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">As have courts in other states when faced with similar facts, we now refuse to extend under <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Doyle </em>a refusal to write out one\u2019s statement into a full-fledged assertion of one\u2019s right to silence. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Boyce, </em>594 F.2d 1246 (9 th Cir.1979) (court did not err when it admitted comments made voluntarily by defendant, even though defendant refused to sign waiver form when initially presented to him); <em>Williams v. </em>State, 258 Ga. 281, 368 S.E.2d 742 (1988) (following defendant\u2019s oral waiver of rights, his refusal to sign written waiver did not invoke right to counsel); <em>State v. Moorehead, </em>811 S.W.2d 425 (Mo.Ct.App.1991) (court did not err when it admitted testimony on post-arrest silence when defendant had earlier waived <em>Miranda </em>rights and given an oral statement, but later refused to reduce statement to writing); <em>State v. Adams, </em>127 N.J. 438, 605 A.2d 1097 (1992) (defendant\u2019s invocation of right to silence for written statements only did not preclude admission of oral statements he made at interrogation). In <em>Moorehead, </em>the facts of which resemble the instant case, the court wrote, \u201cAppellant\u2019s refusal to make a written statement, without more, was not an invocation of his right to remain silent and, therefore, the admission of his silence in response to the Detective\u2019s subsequent observation was not error, plain or otherwise.\u201d <em>Moorehead, </em>811 S.W.2d at 430 (citations omitted) (citing <em>Connecticut v. Barrett, </em>479 U.S. 523, 107 S.Ct. 828, 93 L.Ed.2d 920 (1987)). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Just as hindsight cannot change Purvey\u2019s <em>post-Miranda, </em>statement to police, we cannot use it to second-guess Cleary\u2019s trial tactics. While some attorneys might have objected to Detective Hylton\u2019s account of Purvey\u2019s refusal to reduce his proper oral statement to writing, Purvey has not proven that Cleary\u2019s failure to do so was objectively unreasonable. The cases cited above show that Detective Hylton\u2019s testimony probably was permissible, and Purvey himself perceived, at the time of the trial, that his oral statement had been volun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>tary. Neither has Purvey proven that, but for Cleary\u2019s decision not to object when the State offered this testimony, the jury probably would have decided otherwise. We thus find that Purvey did not suffer ineffective assistance of counsel because Cleary failed to object to Detective Hylton\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Eliciting Evidence of Other Crimes</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">The third theory upon which the post-conviction court granted relief was that Cleary allowed prejudicial testimony that showed Purvey had sold illegal drugs. At the trial, Purvey testified that he was at the scene of the crime selling crack cocaine when the shooting occurred. When asked by the State\u2019s Attorney about the length of his \u201ccareer\u201d in distributing illicit substances, Purvey answered, without objection, that he had been selling crack for seven years. Purvey now maintains that Cleary \u201cfail[ed] to avoid having [him] testify that he was present at the scene of the crime selling crack cocaine,\u201d and that he also failed to object to the State\u2019s \u201cirrelevant and highly prejudicial cross-examination.\u201d We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">Once again, Purvey tries to rewrite what the moving finger has writ. At trial, he exercised his fundamental constitutional right to testify in his own defense. <em>See Rock v. Arkansas, </em>483 U.S. 44, 49-53, 107 S.Ct. 2704, 2708-10, 97 L.Ed.2d 37 (1987) (criminal defendant has right to take witness stand and testify on his own behalf under Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution); <em>Jordan v. State, </em>323 Md. 151, 155-56, 591 A.2d 875 (1991) (quoting <em>Rock, </em>483 U.S. at 49-50, 107 S.Ct. at 2708, and other cases). In fact, by offering him as a witness, Cleary simply accommodated Purvey\u2019s expressed desire to take the stand. Purvey wanted to \u201cadmit to selling the crack because that\u2019s what he did,\u201d in the hope that the jury would conclude that he was only a drug dealer and not a murderer. He chose to explain his presence at the scene, as well as his flight, by being forthright with the jury about his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>true line of work: \u201cI ran to my car \u2018cause I had ... drugs on me and I knew the police was coming.\u201d He also testified that i) he did not commit the shooting, ii) he did not know who did, and iii) he had never used a gun. On cross-examination, he admitted that he had been selling drugs for seven years and that, on the night of the shooting, he had planned to sell all of his supply of crack cocaine and then go home.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Clearly, Purvey\u2019s defense strategy boomeranged, but the post-conviction court erred when it determined that the strategy was objectively unreasonable, \u201cserved absolutely no purpose,\u201d and \u201ctarnished Petitioner\u2019s credibility in the eyes of the jury.\u201d The post-conviction court theorized that Purvey lost a credibility contest at trial that he might have easily won. We think the court was too willing to apply the imprimatur of unreasonableness simply because Purvey was convicted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cWe cannot know whether a different trial strategy would have led to a different result, but the fact that the selected strategy was ultimately unsuccessful does not mean that it was an unreasonable choice.\u201d <em>Cirincione v. State, </em>119 Md.App. 471, 493, 705 A.2d 96, 106, <em>cert. denied, </em>350 Md. 275, 711 A.2d 868 (1998). To be sure, Purvey\u2019s \u201clet it all hang out\u201d strategy is controversial, and not every criminal defense attorney would be willing to let a client so freely testify that he was not a model citizen. Yet, Cleary\u2019s advice to be \u201copen\u201d and \u201cstraightforward\u201d with the jury might have worked if circumstances, perhaps unknowable to Cleary, had been slightly different. As a matter of law, this strategy was but one valid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>option in \u201cthe wide range of reasonable professional assistance,\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065, and this Court must \u201cindulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct\u201d was reasonable under the circumstances at the time of the trial. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">In making his present argument, furthermore, Purvey misconstrues the meaning of Md. Rule 5-404 and <em>State v. Faulkner, </em>314 Md. 630, 552 A.2d 896 (1989). <em>Faulkner </em>expounds upon the proposition that the State may not introduce evidence of prior crimes to prove that the defendant is guilty of the offense for which he is on trial. Even under <em>Faulkner, </em>\u201cevidence of other crimes may be admitted ... if it is substantially relevant to some contested issue in the case and if it is not offered to prove the defendant\u2019s guilt based on propensity to commit crime or his character as a criminal.\u201d <em>Faulkner, </em>314 Md. at 634, 552 A.2d at 897-98 (citing <em>Ross v. State, </em>276 Md. 664, 669, 350 A.2d 680, 684 (1976)). The <em>Ross </em>exceptions cited in <em>Faulkner, </em>however, apply only when <em>the State </em>tries to use evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts to show criminal propensity. Rule 5-104 allows the accused to present \u201c[e]vidence of pertinent trait[s] of character\u201d in his own defense, Md. Rule 5-404(a)(1)(A), and Purvey\u2019s testimony fits squarely in this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Even if Cleary had embraced a more evasive strategy, as long as Purvey exercised his constitutional right to testify, he would have been vulnerable to the State\u2019s impeachment efforts, which might have included presenting evidence of prior convictions and other bad acts, had he presented character evidence. Additionally, the prosecutor might have evoked testimony about his drug-related activity for another purpose, such as \u201cproof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, common scheme or plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d Md. Rule 5-404(b). The prosecution, for example, may have elicited such testimony to show motive, <em>ie., </em>that the killing was part of a drag-related territorial dispute, as the State argued. By evoking testimony about Purvey\u2019s illegal line of work, Cleary did no more than assist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>him to put in the best light damaging evidence that would have almost inevitably surfaced. Cleary cannot be held responsible for the fact that the jury was not convinced, when it is unlikely that any other strategy would have yielded Purvey a happier result. We thus find that Purvey did not suffer ineffective assistance of counsel, because Cleary elicited evidence of Purvey\u2019s other criminal activities, and did not object when the State evoked such evidence on cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Error During Opening Statement and Closing Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">The final leg upon which the post-conviction court\u2019s decision rests is Cleary\u2019s perceived failure to deliver an adequate opening statement and to interrupt and properly object to \u201cimproper comments\u201d in the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s closing argument. The post-conviction court found that the effect of these oversights \u201ccumulatively denied Petitioner the right to the effective assistance of counsel.\u201d The post-conviction court is again wrong, and we will address each perceived omission in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">Purvey correctly notes that Cleary\u2019s opening statement was brief. After introducing himself and the defendant, Cleary pointed out that \u201cwhat I\u2019m going to say and what the Statefs] Attorney has said in our opening argument is not evidence.\u201d He noted that the State had little evidence of Purvey\u2019s involvement in the shooting and asked the jury to pay close attention to the information presented. At the post-conviction hearing, Cleary explained that, when the trial began, he was unsure as to whether Purvey would testify. As we show above, Purvey\u2019s testimony drove the trial strategy. Cleary believed, therefore, that making a brief opening statement was preferable to waiving a statement completely. Now Purvey argues that Cleary wasted an opportunity to outline his theory of the case and to remind the jury of the State\u2019s burden of proof and the constitutional presumption of innocence. Quoting an Illinois case, Purvey informs us that \u201c \u2018many commentators have stated that the opening statement is the single most important <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>portion of the trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>See People v. Lee, </em>185 Ill.App.3d 420, 133 Ill.Dec. 536, 541 N.E.2d 747, 761 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Purvey has not shown, however, that Cleary\u2019s decision to abbreviate the opening statement falls below the standard of representation compelled by the Constitution. In criminal matters, the State bears the burden of proof, and the defendant need not put on a single witness. He only needs to create reasonable doubt. He may even waive the opening statement if doing so achieves his objective, for the purpose of the opening statement is \u2018\u201cto apprise with reasonable succinctness the trier of fact of the questions involved and what the State or defense <em>expects to prove </em>so as to prepare the trier of fact for the evidence to be adduced____ An opening statement by counsel is not evidence and generally has no binding force or effect.\u2019 \u201d <em>Malekar v. State, </em>26 Md.App. 498, 501-02, 338 A.2d 328, 330, <em>cert. denied, </em>276 Md. 747 (1975) (quoting <em>Wilhelm v. State, </em>272 Md. 404, 411-12, 326 A.2d 707, 714 (1974)) (emphasis added). <em>See also Cirincione v. State, </em>119 Md.App. at 498, 705 A.2d at 108 (\u201cunder certain circumstances it is not ineffective assistance to decline to deliver any opening statement at all, even in a death penalty case\u201d). Although making a more extended opening statement is customary and other attorneys might have approached differently uncertainties on the first day of trial, Purvey does not show that Cleary\u2019s performance was objectively unreasonable in light of the circumstances. His opening statement,- although sparse, put the jury on notice to beware the State\u2019s arguments and evidence. \u201cThe length of the opening statement is not of itself dispositive of either prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test, and there is no constitutional rule that counsel must employ any particular rhetorical technique.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, Purvey does not show that a recitation about reasonable doubt or the burden of proof would have availed him anything. After all, the trial judge would have thoroughly covered those issues in jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">Purvey next challenges Cleary\u2019s failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cimproper\u201d comments made during closing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>arguments. At least three times, the State\u2019s Attorney asserted that Cleary was merely \u201cblowing smoke\u201d to \u201cdivert [the jury\u2019s] attention from the facts.\u201d At the post-conviction hearing, Cleary testified that he saw no reason to interrupt her: \u201cI felt that it was harmless and that it was just argument by the State[.]\u201d Purvey now argues that the State\u2019s comments prejudiced the defense. He maintains that they \u201chad nothing to do with the facts of the case,\u201d and they \u201ceffectively accused defense counsel of lying to the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">At its heart, however, Purvey\u2019s complaint lacks substance. He protests the prosecutor\u2019s use of a popular figure of speech, but the underlying substance of the State\u2019s argument was constitutionally permissible. The prosecutor\u2019s statements were an acceptable characterization of Purvey\u2019s efforts to undermine the credibility of the State\u2019s evidence. The law is clear that, in presenting closing arguments, the court concerns itself more with content than with rhetoric:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6\">[L]iberal freedom of speech should be allowed. There are not hard-and-fast limitations within which the argument of earnest counsel must be confined \u2014 no well-defined bounds beyond which the eloquence of an advocate shall not soar. He may discuss the facts proved or admitted in the pleadings, assess the conduct of the parties, and attack the credibility of witnesses. He may indulge in oratorical conceit or flourish and in illustrations and metaphorical allusions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-6\"><em>Wilhelm, </em>272 Md. at 413, 326 A.2d at 714. We limit counsel from \u201cstaffing] and commentfing] upon facts not in evidence or to state what he could have proven,\u201d <em>id, </em>and we can justify reversal where \u201cthe jury was misled or influenced to the prejudice of the accused,\u201d <em>e.g., </em>a remark that would appeal to racial or religious prejudices. <em>Campbell v. State, </em>65 Md.App. 498, 505, 501 A.2d 111, 114, <em>cert. denied, </em>305 Md. 599, 505 A.2d 856 (1985). <em>See also Darden v. Wainwright, All </em>U.S. 168, 181, 106 S.Ct. 2464, 2471, 91 L.Ed.2d 144 (1986). The State\u2019s Attorney did none of these things. All she did was strongly strive for rhetorical effect through the use of an extravagant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>and facetious figure of speech that the jury examine critically Cleary\u2019s efforts to deflate the credibility of the State\u2019s witnesses. This tactic is permissible in closing arguments, and that Cleary refrained from protest is objectively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Finally, Purvey claims that Cleary did not move to strike as improper one of the State\u2019s comments on punishment during the closing argument. The transcript shows that Cleary objected, and the trial court sustained the objection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AaS\">[PROSECUTOR]: Mr. Cleary said that Mr. Purvey\u2019s life is at stake. So was Joseph Harrises]. Fortunately, what happens to Mr. Purvey after the verdict is reached is not up to the jury. That is the judge\u2019s province. He can get probation, he can get a slap on the hand ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-6\">[MR. CLEARY]: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-7\">[THE COURT]: Yes. Let\u2019s not go into that bit. I sustain your objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">Purvey now asserts that Cleary was ineffective because he failed to follow up by moving to strike and asking for a curative instruction. At the post-conviction hearing, Cleary said he did not seek a curative instruction because he did not wish for the jury to hear the offending information again.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">Although the prosecutor\u2019s comment was improper, Purvey does not claim that her objectionable line of attack continued after Cleary\u2019s objection was sustained. That the State\u2019s Attorney made but a single unacceptable remark is significant.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AA\">[N]ot every ill-considered remark made by counsel ... is cause for challenge or mistrial.... \u201c[T]he fact that a remark made by the prosecutor in argument to the jury was improper does not necessarily compel that the conviction be set aside. The Maryland Rule is that unless it appears that the jury were actually misled or were likely to have been misled or influenced to the prejudice of the accused by the remarks of the State\u2019s Attorney, reversal of the conviction on this ground would not be justified.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-10\"><em>Wilhelm, </em>272 Md. at 415-16, 326 A.2d at 716 (quoting <em>Reidy v.

The recent Court of Appeals opinion in <em>Hill v. State, </em>355 Md. 206, 226, 734 A.2d 199, 209 (1999), is illustrative. In <em>Hill, </em>the State\u2019s Attorney persisted, over defense counsel\u2019s numerous sustained objections, in informing the jurors that they had a responsibility to keep their community safe from people like the defendant. The Court of Appeals found the State\u2019s \u201ctake back your community\u201d line of attack to be wholly improper. It charged this Court, on remand, \u201cto take account of the persistency of the prosecutor\u2019s conduct \u2014 continuing to make these remarks time and again despite the court\u2019s rulings that the remarks were improper.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 226, 734 A.2d at 210. <em>See also Wilhelm, </em>272 Md. at 436, 326 A.2d at 727 (affirming conviction and noting that because only one improper remark had been made, prejudice was unlikely). The facts in the instant appeal resemble <em>Wilhelm </em>more closely than they do <em>Hill. </em>Purvey identifies only one improper comment. Cleary objected to that comment with the effect of curtailing the State\u2019s line of argument. We find it unlikely, therefore, that the jury was prejudiced by this one remark. We note that Cleary\u2019s reason for not requesting a strike \u2014 that he sought not to reinforce the offending information in the minds of the jury \u2014 is an objectively reasonable trial tactic.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Because we find that Cleary handled in objectively reasonable fashion each of the three improprieties of which Purvey complains, we do not need to address the cumulative effects of these perceived omissions. Although other attorneys might have responded differently, Cleary\u2019s opening statement and responses to the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument fall within \u201cthe wide range of professionally competent assistance,\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690, 104 S.Ct. at 2066, as do his other actions addressed <em>supra. </em>We thus reverse the judgment of the post-conviction court.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">JUDGMENT REVERSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b28-9\">. Detective Hylton testified that in street parlance \"bust\u201d means to shoot someone, and that \u201cslim\u201d is used as a synonym for the pronoun \"him.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b33-9\">. In <em>Wieland v. State, </em>101 Md.App. 1, 33-34, 643 A.2d 446, 462 (1994), Judge Moylan expounds at length on the meaning of the \"ordinarily\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>exception, <em>i.e., </em>the alternative review provision of Rule 8-131(a) that an appellate court may use when it intends to remand a case to the trial court. The exception allows a higher court to instruct the lower one on legal issues that may arise on remand. Because we reverse the trial court here, we need not avail ourselves of this exception.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b36-9\">. We realize that citing the testimony of Purvey\u2019s attorney requires us to steer cautiously between Scylla and Charybdis. In its findings of fact, the post-conviction court questioned his credibility \"in certain respects,\u201d and the State does not argue in its brief that the court\u2019s finding was clearly erroneous. Although we recognize that Cleary\u2019s preparation for the post-conviction hearing underwhelmed the court and his memory might have been shadowy on some of the minor aspects of the trial, we think it is safe to assume that he remembered the major tactical decisions that have been called into question here. This assumption is especially valid here, because Purvey\u2019s testimony at trial was consistent with Cleary\u2019s assertions at the post-conviction hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b43-6\">. For license to dip below the surface in its consideration of unreasonableness, the post-conviction court relies on three cases from the federal Eleventh Circuit, especially <em>Huynh v. King, </em>95 F.3d 1052 (11 th Cir.1996). Yet <em>Huynh </em>is inapposite here. In that case, defense counsel declined to file a meritorious suppression motion at a state court trial in order to obtain later for the accused a more favorable federal habeas corpus review on grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel. The Court of Appeals found this action to be objectively unreasonable. Here, no evidence was adduced that would show that Cleary so cynically manipulated the judicial system. Cleary\u2019s strategy instead seems based on a good-faith attempt to respect Purvey\u2019s wishes and, perhaps, immunize the jury against expected attempts by the prosecutor to insinuate that he was a bad actor because he sold drugs.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
