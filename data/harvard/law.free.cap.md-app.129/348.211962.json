We hold that a claim comes within such an exclusion when legal liability for workers\u2019 compensation arises and payment is not required within thirty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">On February 7, 1996, Philip J. Lunz (\u201cLunz\u201d), an employee of Frederick Memorial Hospital, suffered an injury to his back while working at the hospital. On March 8, 1996, Lunz filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim with the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission. On March 19, 1996, the compensation carrier for Frederick Memorial Hospital, Group Benefit Services, Inc., filed issues contesting Lunz\u2019s claim. On April 2, 1996, Lunz visited Orthopedic Specialists of Frederick (\u201cOrthopedic Specialists\u201d), a specialist physicians\u2019 group. Unaware that the compensation claim was pending, Maryland Individual Practice Association, Inc. (\u201cMD-IPA\u201d), appellee, Lunz\u2019s health insurer, authorized treatment by Orthopedic Specialists, a group under contract with MD-IPA. On April 3, 1996, Orthopedic Specialists performed a lumbar laminectomy and discectomy on Lunz.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">After Lunz\u2019s surgery had been performed, MD-IPA learned that he had a pending workers\u2019 compensation claim. MD-IPA advised Orthopedic Specialists that it would delay payment until the issue of compensation was determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">On May 9, 1996, Orthopedic Specialists filed a complaint with the Maryland Insurance Administration (\u201cMIA\u201d), appellant, concerning MD-IPA\u2019s decision to delay payment. On December 4, 1996, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission awarded Lunz workers\u2019 compensation benefits and directed Lunz\u2019s employer to \u201cpay medical expenses in accordance with the medical fee guide of the Commission.\u201d On January 14, 1997, Orthopedic Specialists received payment from Lunz\u2019s employer for services rendered in accordance with the workers\u2019 compensation award.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">On August 26, 1997, Orthopedic Specialists filed a second complaint with MIA, regarding what was described as MD-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>IPA\u2019s general practice of refusing to pay claims because of pending workers\u2019 compensation claims. On March 31, 1998, MIA issued an order directing MD-IPA to \u201ccease and desist from its policy and practice of refusing to pay claims in which a determination needs to be made as to whether or not certain services are payable under Workers\u2019 Compensation.\u201d On July 8, 1998, MIA issued a final order upholding the cease and desist order and ordered MD-IPA to pay properly submitted claims within 30 days regardless of the pendency of a workers\u2019 compensation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">On July 10,1998, MD-IPA filed a petition for judicial review of MIA\u2019s decision in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. On February 22, 1999, the circuit court reversed MIA\u2019s order. The court construed the terms of the health plan provided by MD-IPA and concluded that claims payable by workers\u2019 compensation were not covered services and, thus, not subject to the thirty-day payment provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 19-710.1 and 19-712.1 of the Health-General II Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">On March 18,1999, MIA noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">MIA argues that the issue before us is one of statutory interpretation. It argues that, in accordance with Health-Gen. \u00a7\u00a7 19-710.1 and 19-712.1, MD-IPA is required to pay claims submitted by health care providers for all medically necessary services rendered within thirty days after receipt of the claim, regardless of whether responsibility for payment of the claim is at issue in a pending workers\u2019 compensation case. According to MIA, \u00a7\u00a7 19-710.1 and 19-712.1 are clear and unambiguous and contain no language expressly or impliedly creating any exclusion for workers\u2019 compensation claims. The Legislature could have and would have expressly provided such an exclusion, according to MIA, if the Legislature so desired.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">Further, MIA maintains that the term \u201cpayable,\u201d as used in an exclusion contained in MD-IPA\u2019s health plan which excludes the cost of services \u201cpayable by Workers\u2019 Compensa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>tion,\u201d applies only when there is an obligation to pay as determined by an award of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission. MIA notes that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission has exclusive jurisdiction to determine when a workplace injury is compensable. Finally, MIA contends that MD-IPA\u2019s dispute concerning the identity of the proper payor of a claim is not a good faith dispute concerning the legitimacy of the claim or the appropriate amount of reimbursement and, thus, does not fall within any of the exceptions to the prompt payment requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">MD-IPA argues that the circuit court made the proper decision, because the relevant statutes required payment of claims only for covered services. MD-IPA maintains that any services rendered to members that are payable by workers\u2019 compensation are specifically excluded from coverage and, consequently, not subject to the statutory thirty-day payment requirement. We agree with MD-IPA and affirm the circuit court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">A. <em>Standard of Review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Our standard of review of administrative decisions was set out at length in <em>White v. North, </em>121 Md.App. 196, 708 A.2d 1093, <em>cert. granted, </em>351 Md. 7, 715 A.2d 965 (1998):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AY_\">Our role in reviewing an administrative decision \u201cis precisely the same as that of the circuit court.\u201d This means we must review the administrative decision itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-7\">In its judicial review of an agency\u2019s action, a court may not uphold an agency decision unless it is sustainable on the agency\u2019s actual findings and for reasons advanced by the agency in support of its decision. In reviewing the decisions of administrative agencies, the court must accept the agency\u2019s findings of fact when such findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-8\">In assessing whether the Board\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence, we apply the rule that substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d In other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>words, the scope of review \u201cis limited \u2018to whether a reasoning mind could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-4\">We must review the agency\u2019s decision in a light most favorable to the agency, since \u201cdecisions of administrative agencies are <em>prima facie </em>correct.\u201d In applying the substantial evidence test, we do not substitute our judgment for the expertise of the agency, for the test is a deferential one, requiring \u201c \u2018restrained and disciplined judicial judgment so as not to interfere with the agency\u2019s factual conclusions\u2019.\u201d This deference applies not only to agency fact-finding, but to the drawing of inferences from the facts as well. \u201cWhere inconsistent inferences from the same evidence can be drawn, it is for the agency to draw the inferences.\u201d When the agency\u2019s decision is predicated solely on an error of law, however, no deference is appropriate and the reviewing court may substitute its judgment for that of the agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AyH\"><em>Id. </em>at 219-21, 708 A.2d 1093 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The issues before us are issues of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">B. <em>Statutory Interpretation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the Legislature. <em>Degren v. State, </em>352 Md. 400, 417, 722 A.2d 887 (1999); <em>Wesley Chapel v. Baltimore, </em>347 Md. 125, 137, 699 A.2d 434(1997). \u201cWhere the statutory language is plain and free from ambiguity, and expresses a definite and simple meaning, courts do not normally look beyond the words of the statute itself to determine legislative intent.\u201d <em>Degren, </em>352 Md. at 417, 722 A.2d 887. If \u201cthe words of the statute are susceptible to more than one meaning, it is necessary to consider their meaning and effect \u2018in light of the setting, the objectives and [the] purpose of the enactment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wesley Chapel, </em>347 Md. at 137, 699 A.2d 434 (quoting <em>Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>308 Md. 69, 75, 517 A.2d 730 (1986) (alteration in original)). Therefore, we construe the statute as a whole and interpret each of its provisions in the context of the entire statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number><em>Blondell v. Baltimore Police Dept., 341 </em>Md. 680, 691, 672 A.2d 639 (1996). The Court of Appeals has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-4\">If the language alone does not provide sufficient information on the Legislature\u2019s intent, then courts will look to other sources to discern the Legislature\u2019s purpose.... Because the meanings of even common words may be context-dependent, ... we often proceed to consider other external manifestations of legislative intent, such as the amendment history of the statute, its relationship to prior and subsequent law, and its structure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-5\"><em>Armstead v. State, </em>342 Md. 38, 56, 673 A.2d 221 (1996) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Finally, \u201c[cjommon sense must guide us in our interpretation of statutes, and \u2018we seek to avoid constructions that are illogical, unreasonable, or inconsistent with common sense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Marriott Employees Federal Credit Union v. Motor Vehicle Administration, </em>346 Md. 437, 445, 697 A.2d 455 (1997)(quoting <em>Frost v. State, </em>336 Md. 125, 137, 647 A.2d 106 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">C. <em>\u00a7\u00a7 19-710.1 and 19-712.1.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">We agree with MIA that the statutes are clear and susceptible of but one interpretation, but we do not reach the same conclusion as MIA. Sections 19-710.1 and 19-712.1 expressly require HMOs to pay health care providers for covered services within thirty days after receipt of a claim. Section 19-710.1(b) states in pertinent part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Akv\">for a covered service rendered to an enrollee or a health maintenance organization by a health care provider not under written contract with the health maintenance organization, the health maintenance organization or its agent: (i)[s]hall pay the health care provider within 30 days after receipt of a claim[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">\u00a7 19-710.1(a)(3) defines a \u201ccovered service\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQY\">a health care service included in the benefit package of the health maintenance organization and rendered to an enrollee of the health maintenance organization by a health care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>provider, including a physician or hospital not under -written contract with the health maintenance organization.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">With respect to health care providers under contract with an HMO, \u00a7 19-712.1 contains a similar provision, and provides that \u201c[f]or covered services rendered to its members, a health maintenance organization shall reimburse any provider within 30 days after receipt of a claim that is accompanied by all reasonable and necessary documentation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">The statutes require payment within thirty days only for \u201ccovered servicefs].\u201d As appellee notes, \u201cCovered service\u201d is defined statutorily as \u201ca health care service included in the benefit package of the [HMO] ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>MD-IPA\u2019s health plan provides that \u201c[t]he cost of any services rendered to members which are payable by Workers\u2019 Compensation\u201d are specifically excluded from coverage. Consequently, we conclude that services rendered for workplace injuries \u201cpayable by Workers\u2019 Compensation\u201d are not covered services.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">The dispositive question then becomes what is meant by \u201cpayable\u201d within the meaning of the health plan. We are guided by cases involving analogous Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation issues. First, we note that liability to make workers\u2019 compensation payments is fixed at the time of the accident. <em>Cooper v. Wicomico County Dept. of Public Works, </em>278 Md. 596, 600-01, 366 A.2d 55 (1976); <em>Cline v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>13 Md.App. 337, 343, 283 A.2d 188 (1971). Second, in <em>Sears, Roebuck v. Ralph, </em>340 Md. 304, 314-15, 666 A.2d 1239 (1995), the Court of Appeals held that \u201ccompensation payable\u201d as used in the non-abatement provision of Workers Compensation Act, Art. 101, \u00a7 36(4)(c) [now Labor &amp; Employment \u00a7 9-646], is not limited to an award but instead means legally payable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act due to the occurrence of a compensable injury. We believe that holding is applicable to the situation before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">Appellee relies on several cases from other jurisdictions. Most of the cases are neither on point nor particularly helpful, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>albeit not inconsistent with our conclusion. We do find two cases instructive and supportive of our conclusion. In <em>Bonney v. Citizens\u2019 Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., </em>333 Mich. 435, 53 N.W.2d 321 (1952), the Supreme Court of Michigan considered the language in an automobile insurance policy with medical payments coverage that excluded payments \u201cpayable under any Workmen\u2019s Compensation law.\u201d The court held that the term \u201cpayable\u201d was unambiguous and that an award by the compensation commission was not required for the exclusion to be applicable. <em>Id. </em>at 324. In <em>Wise v. American Casualty Company of Reading, Pa., </em>117 Ga.App. 575, 161 S.E.2d 393 (1968), the court had before it a policy providing hospitalization insurance benefits which contained an exclusion for loss \u201cpayable\u201d by worker\u2019s compensation. The court held that it did not require actual payment, only statutory liability for payment.'</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Based on the principle that payable means legally payable, and that such liability arises at the time of the accident, we conclude that the circuit court was correct in holding that the claims herein were payable by workers\u2019 compensation, prior to any award by the Commission. They were not covered services, and thus, not subject to the thirty-day payment provisions contained in \u00a7\u00a7 19-710.1 and 19-712.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">D. <em>Good Faith Exception.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">MD-IPA argues that the question whether the claim is payable by the HMO or through workers\u2019 compensation amounts to a good faith dispute that falls within the statutory exception to the payment requirement. The exception to the thirty day prompt payment requirement appears in Section 19-712.1, which states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-7\">(c) The provisions of this section do not apply to claims where:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-8\">(1) There is a good faith dispute regarding:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-9\">(i) The legitimacy of the claim; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-10\">(ii) The appropriate amount of reimbursement[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>MD-IPA argues that the General Assembly intended this section to apply to a dispute relating to the medical necessity of treatment rather than to disputes relating to which insurer is the proper payor. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">A statement of the legislative purpose of the statute, as articulated by its sponsor, was provided to us by the parties. It appears that the purpose was to require prompt payment when liability and amount were reasonably clear-not when there is a good faith dispute regarding either. Delegate Lawrence A. LaMotte, the sponsor of the legislation, House Bill 416, 1991 Md. Laws ch. 188, Health Maintenance Organizations \u2014 Prompt Payment of Claims, explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-7\">Maryland law provides for the prompt payment of claims \u201cwhenever liability and amount are reasonably clear\u201d within thirty days of the proper filing of a claim for non-profit health service plans, individual health service contracts and group health insurance contracts, but provides no specific provision requiring HMOs to pay their bills in a timely manner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">Delegate LaMotte further explained that the legislation would make HMOs subject to the prompt payment requirement but that the provision would not apply when a good faith dispute existed regarding the legitimacy of the claim or the appropriate amount of reimbursement. We see nothing in the statute or its history that causes us to interpret it as being limited to issues of medical necessity. To the contrary, the legislative history indicates that the exception applies whenever there is a good faith dispute regarding liability or amount of payment. We construe the statute in that manner, which would include a good faith dispute as to the identity of the proper payor.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">E. <em>Conclusion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">An HMO has the right to delay payment of a medical provider\u2019s claim based on a pending workers\u2019 compensation claim. If it is ultimately determined that the claim is covered by the health plan, however, an HMO will be in violation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>prompt payment provisions unless it demonstrates that it investigated the claim and came to a good faith conclusion that the claim was not covered.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
