Shabnam alleges several errors in the District Court\u2019s parenting determination. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">\u00b62 Shabnam and Douglas Woerner married in February 2005 and had one child, C.W., in September 2009. Both parties are physicians \u2014 Shabnam is a psychiatrist and Douglas is a family doctor. After their completion of medical school, they both obtained employment at Saint Vincent Healthcare in Billings, Montana. Shabnam was scheduled to start in late 2009. Due to staff changes within the hospital, she withdrew her acceptance of employment. Instead, she obtained employment at the Veteran\u2019s Hospital in Phoenix, Arizona.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">\u00b63 On December 11,2009, Douglas filed a petition for dissolution of marriage and a proposed interim parenting plan with the District Court. He moved the court to adopt the interim parenting plan ex parte. Douglas stated that while out of state with C.W., Shabnam informed him that she was moving to Arizona with C.W. and was seeking dissolution. Based on this information, the court granted Douglas\u2019s motion to adopt the interim parenting plan ex parte.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">\u00b64 This order was stayed while Shabnam sought jurisdiction in Arizona. After the Arizona court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction, the District Court set a hearing on the interim parenting plan for May 24, 2010. In advance of the hearing, Douglas brought C.W. back to Montana with him following a visit to Arizona in early May. On Shabnam\u2019s motion, the court ordered C.W. returned to her on May 4,2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-12\">\u00b65 At the interim parenting plan hearing, the court indicated that it wanted the parties to cooperate with each other. The court warned Shabnam that if she were to \u201cstonewall\u201d Douglas, that her behavior would be looked upon detrimentally at the final hearing. The court cautioned Douglas not to \u201cpush things too fast.\u201d The court stated, \u201cI\u2019m giving you people some opportunities to try to work things out with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>some rational basis and some reasonable accommodations. Essentially, you\u2019re on probation.\u201d Following the hearing, the District Court ordered an interim parenting plan. The plan called for all of Douglas\u2019s contact with C.W. to be in Arizona and the dates and duration of such parenting time to be worked out by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">\u00b66 On September 24, 2010, the court ordered a parenting plan investigation to be conducted by Tylene Merkel, a licensed clinical professional counselor. Merkel completed her report in July 2012. She recommended keeping C.W.\u2019s home in Arizona and designating Shabnam the primary residential parent, but allowing Douglas parenting time every other weekend in Arizona.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">\u00b67 The District Court held a two-day dissolution trial beginning on August 16,2012, shortly before C.W. turned three. In addition to the parties and C.W.\u2019s grandparents, the court heard evidence from Merkel; Dr. Michael Butz, a psychiatrist who had evaluated C.W.; Beth Henning, a speech and language therapist who had evaluated C.W.; and Lori Highberger, a psychiatrist co-worker of Shabnam who had observed C.W. Much of the controversy at trial centered on C.W.\u2019s developmental delays. Shabnam believed C.W.\u2019s delays to be severe. Douglas disagreed with her assessment. Dr. Butz and Henning attributed some of C.W.\u2019s delays to the fact that Shabnam\u2019s mother spoke Farsi in their home.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">\u00b68 Five months later, when the District Court had not yet entered findings or conclusions from the trial, it ordered the child re-evaluated by Dr. Laura Nicholson, a developmental pediatrician. The court cited \u201cthe voluminous expert testimony and parenting plan evaluation, much of which was at odds,\u201d and \u201cthe passage of time from the hearing in August 2012.\u201d It directed the parties to maintain their interim parenting arrangement pending the outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">\u00b69 Dr. Nicholson submitted a report on March 26, 2013. She evaluated C.W. and reviewed his records. She concluded that C.W. \u201cmade great progress in his developmental skills since his previous assessments 8-12 months ago. His speech now scores in the normal range, his social skills, fine motor skills and adaptive skills are very mildly delayed.\u201d Shabnam objected to Dr. Nicholson\u2019s report because Dr. Nicholson had utilized Douglas\u2019s expert from trial, Henning, to conduct a language evaluation of C.W.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">\u00b610 On May 21, 2013, the court issued its findings of fact and conclusions of law. The court concluded that there was no reason why the parents could not co-parent C.W. and that co-parenting would serve C.W.\u2019s best interests. Recognizingthat the plan would be in effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>only until the child reached school age, the court ordered a parenting plan in which C.W. would travel between Shabnam and Douglas\u2019s respective residences every six weeks. Shabnam appeals the court\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">\u00b611 We review a parenting plan order to determine if the court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous. <em>In re Marriage of Crowley, </em>2014 MT 42, \u00b6 44, 374 Mont. 48, 318 P.3d 1031. A finding of fact is clearly erroneous \u201cif it is not supported by substantial evidence, the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or our review of the record convinces us that the district court made a mistake.\u201d <em>Crowley, </em>\u00b6 24 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">\u00b612 Absent clearly erroneous findings, we will not disturb a district court\u2019s decision regarding parenting unless there is a clear abuse of discretion. <em>In re Marriage of Epperson, </em>2005 MT 46, \u00b6 17, 326 Mont. 142, 107 P.3d 1268. A district court does not abuse its discretion unless it acted arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. <em>Epperson, </em>\u00b6 17. \u201cTrial courts have broad discretion when considering the parenting of a child, and we must presume that the court carefully considered the evidence and made the correct decision.\u201d <em>Crowley, </em>\u00b6 44 (citing <em>In re Marriage of Tummarello , </em>2012 MT 18, \u00b6 34, 363 Mont. 387, 270 P.3d 28).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">\u00b613 In deciding parenting matters, a district court must \u201cdetermine the parenting plan in accordance with the best interest of the child.\u201d Section 40-4-212(1), MCA. The statute directs the district court to consider \u201call relevant parenting factors.\u201d Section 40-4-212(1), MCA. The statute\u2019s non-exhaustive list of factors includes, relevant to this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-10\">(a) the wishes of the child\u2019s parent or parents;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-11\">(c) the interaction and interrelationship of the child with the child\u2019s parent or parents and siblings and with any other person who significantly affects the child\u2019s best interest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-12\">(d) the child\u2019s adjustment to home, school, and community;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-13\">(e) the mental and physical health of all individuals involved;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-14\">(h) continuity and stability of care;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>(i) developmental needs of the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-4\">(k) whether a parent has knowingly failed to financially support a child that the parent is able to support, which is considered to be not in the child\u2019s best interests;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-5\">(l) whether the child has frequent and continuing contact with both parents, which is considered to be in the child\u2019s best interests</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Section 40-4-212(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">\u00b614 Shabnam argues that the court failed to consider the statutory factors or to state the reasons for its decisions. She also argues that the court erred by: punishing her for pre-trial conduct; utilizing the wrong standard; not considering the parenting plan investigation done by Merkel; ordering a parenting plan requiring travel between Billings and Phoenix; attributing C.W.\u2019s developmental delays to Shabnam\u2019s bilingualism; and ordering Dr. Nicholson to assess C.W. and advise the court following the close of trial. We consider her contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"AMt\">\n<em>a. Statutory factors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">\u00b615 Shabnam argues that the District Court erred by failing to consider all of the statutory factors or to state the reasons for its decisions on the record. We have encouraged district courts to make specific findings on each relevant statutory factor, but we repeatedly have stated that such findings are not required. <em>See In re Marriage of Keating, </em>212 Mont. 462, 467, 689 P.2d 249, 251 (1984); <em>In re Marriage of Converse, </em>252 Mont. 67, 71, 826 P.2d 937, 939 (1992). Rather, we require that the district court make findings sufficient for this court to determine whether the court considered the statutory factors and made its ruling on the basis of the child\u2019s best interests. <em>Jacobsen v. Thomas, </em>2006 MT 212, \u00b6 19, 333 Mont. 323, 142 P.3d 859. The court\u2019s findings should, at a minimum, \u201c \u2018express the essential and determining facts upon which it rests its conclusions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crowley, </em>\u00b6 45 (quoting <em>In re Marriage of Epperson , </em>2005 MT 46, \u00b6 30, 326 Mont. 142, 107 P.3d 1268).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">\u00b616 A review of the District Court\u2019s findings makes clear that it considered the statutory factors in its decision, although it did not specifically identify them. For instance, the court found that Douglas was current in his child support payments to Shabnam, which addresses \u00a7 40-4-212(l)(k), MCA, \u201cwhether a parent has knowingly failed to financially support a child that the parent is able to support, which is considered to be not in the child\u2019s best interests.\u201d The court also made numerous findings on the factors most in dispute: the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>\u201cdevelopmental needs of the child\u201d and \u201cthe child\u2019s adjustment to home, school, and community.\u201d Section 40-4-212(l)(d), (i), MCA. For example, the court recounted the evidence it heard from professionals who evaluated C.W. and found that testimony conflicting. Shabnam and the professionals in Arizona on whom she relied described C.W. as \u201chaving significant and long-term developmental delays.\u201d Douglas and the Billings professionals on whom he relied testified, in contrast, that C.W.\u2019s deficits would \u201cimprove within a year with greater exposure to the English language and age appropriate interactions.\u201d The court relied on Dr. Nicholson\u2019s assessment, completed after the other evaluations, which it determined \u201ccould shed more light on [C.W.\u2019s] development.\u201d The court detailed Dr. Nicholson\u2019s report in its findings, summarizing that C.W. \u201cmade great progress in his developmental skills since his previous assessments 8-12 months ago. His speech now scores in the normal range, his social skills, fine motor skills and adaptive skills are very mildly delayed.\u201d It also relied on evidence that a child is ready for co-parenting by the age of three or three-and-a-half.</p>\n<p id=\"A1B\">\u00b617 As discussed above, the court\u2019s findings indicate that it considered \u201cwhether the child has frequent and continuing contact with both parents, which is considered to be in the child\u2019s best interests ... .\u201d Section 40-4-212(1X1), MCA. Although conclusory, the court\u2019s statement that \u201c[c]o-parenting will serve [C.W.\u2019s] best interests[,]\u201d implies that both parents are fit and utilizes the statutory presumption that contact with both parents is in the child\u2019s best interests. Section 40-4-212(1X1), MCA. This is supported by the record; there was no argument that either party was unfit to parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">\u00b618  Shabnam argues that reversal is necessary because \u201cthere is not a single word regarding any statutory factor in the Court\u2019s Findings and Conclusions.\u201d She ignores the substance of the findings the court made and fails to present an argument about what specific applicable factors are missing from the court\u2019s findings. Although it would be helpful on review for district courts to explain how their findings apply to the statutory factors, we again hold that it is not required. The court\u2019s findings in this case certainly could have been more precise, but they do not leave us speculating as to the reasons for the court\u2019s decision. <em>Crowley, </em>\u00b6 24 (\u201cA court\u2019s findings must be complete enough that we need not \u2018succumb to speculation when assessingthe conscientiousness or reasonableness of the district court\u2019s judgment.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>In re Marriage of Bartsch, </em>2007 MT 136, \u00b6 33, 337 Mont. 386, 162 P.3d 72)). A review of the findings reveals that the court considered the relevant statutory factors. We therefore decline to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>reverse based upon the lack of findings.</p>\n<p id=\"Ave\">\n<em>b. Punishment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">\u00b619 Shabnam contends that the District Court impermissibly punished her and rewarded Douglas based on its perceptions of their pre-trial behavior. She relies on <em>Guffin v. Plaisted-Harmen, </em>2009 MT 169, 350 Mont. 489, 209 P.3d 225, for the proposition that a district court may not punish a parent when determining a parenting plan.</p>\n<p id=\"ArH\">\u00b620 In <em>Guffin, </em>we reversed a district court\u2019s order removing the mother as primary parent because of her decision to move from Terry, Montana, to Kalispell, Montana. <em>Guffin, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 12-13. We held that the district court failed to utilize the best interest of the child standard, and that it could not penalize the mother for exercising her constitutional right to travel. <em>Guffin, </em>\u00b612.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">\u00b621 In contrast to <em>Guffin, </em>we affirmed a district court\u2019s designation of the mother as primary residential parent based on the father\u2019s interference with her parenting time during the pendency of the proceedings. <em>In re Chamberlin, </em>2011 MT 253, \u00b6 24, 362 Mont. 226, 262 P.3d 1097. In <em>Chamberlin, </em>we concluded that the court\u2019s findings regarding the father\u2019s interference applied to the statutory factor of \u201cwhether the child has frequent and continuing contact with both parents....\u201d <em>In re Chamberlin, </em>\u00b6 23 (citing \u00a7 40-4-212(1)1), MCA). We upheld the district court\u2019s refusal to award the father primary residential custody based on its findings that he used obstructive tactics to keep the child away from the mother. <em>In re Chamberlin, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"AqV\">\u00b622 Shabnam emphasizes the District Court\u2019s statement that the parties were on \u201cprobation\u201d and that their future actions would have a significant impact on the ultimate parenting plan decision by the court. The court found that Douglas made \u201cincredible efforts\u201d to maintain contact with C.W. in Arizona and cited several instances in which Shabnam \u201cdelayed and obstructed\u201d Douglas\u2019s parenting time. The court found that Shabnam never included Douglas in any of C.W.\u2019s evaluations despite knowing of his schedule in Arizona. The court also was troubled by Shabnam\u2019s allowing Douglas to have C.W. for overnight visits on only three occasions between March 2010 and October 2011. It found that Douglas had never had multiple consecutive overnight visits with C.W. during Shabnam\u2019s trips to Montana. The court concluded that Shabnam\u2019s actions had \u201ccheated\u201d C.W. of more time with his father.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">\u00b623  The District Court\u2019s findings make clear that it was not punishing Shabnam for moving to Arizona. Rather, the court was pointing out how her purposeful obstruction interfered with Douglas\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>parenting. The court found that Shabnam\u2019s refusal to allow Douglas overnight stays inhibited his ability to spend quality time with C.W. The court found that this deprived C.W. of time with his father and that Shabnam\u2019s actions made C.W. a victim. These findings demonstrate the court\u2019s focus on C.W.\u2019s best interests. Like <em>Chamberlin, </em>these findings apply to the statutory factor of \u201cwhether the child has frequent and continuing contact with both parents ... .\u201d Section 40-4-212(1X1), MCA. There is no indication that the court awarded equal parenting time in order to punish Shabnam. Instead, the court found that co-parenting was in the best interests of the child. Like <em>Chamberlin, </em>the court\u2019s parenting plan appears, in part, to be aimed at preventing further interference with Douglas\u2019s parenting rights by not designating Shabnam as the sole custodial parent. Shabnam does not contend that any of the court\u2019s findings regarding her obstruction are clearly erroneous. We are not convinced that the court abused its discretion by considering such actions in its determination of a final parenting plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">c. <em>Applicable standard</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">\u00b624 Shabnam next argues that the District Court utilized an \u201cirreparable harm\u201d standard rather than the proper \u201cbest interest of the child\u201d test when determining the final parenting plan. The court\u2019s written order does not contain any such language. Shabnam cites one line from the trial transcript to support her contention. While discussing C.W. spending more time with Douglas, the court stated, \u201cI am not satisfied that there will be irreparable harm to him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">\u00b625 The court\u2019s written findings and conclusions determined that the final parenting plan would serve the best interests of C.W. We will not attribute its isolated remark from the bench to be the standard it utilized in crafting the final parenting plan. We conclude that the court correctly used the best interest of the child standard in its determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">\n<em>d. Merkel Report</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">\u00b626 Shabnam alleges that the District Court abused its discretion by failing to consider the Merkel report in its final parenting decision. We previously have ruled that it is an abuse of discretion for a trial court to not consider an investigative report that it ordered in reaching its final custody decisions. <em>In re Marriage of Abrahamson, </em>278 Mont. 336, 341, 924 P.2d 1334, 1337 (1996). A district court is not required, however, to adopt an investigative report. In <em>Abrahamson, </em>we concluded that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it referred to the custody report in its findings of fact and conclusions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>law, even though it ultimately rejected the report\u2019s recommendations. <em>In re Marriage of Abrahamson, </em>278 Mont. at 341, 924 P.2d at 1337.</p>\n<p id=\"AJ3\">\u00b627 The court ordered Merkel\u2019s report in September 2010. She completed her report in July 2012. Merkel testified at the trial. The court\u2019s findings of fact include reference to the court\u2019s order and Merkel\u2019s work. Further, the findings summarize Merkel\u2019s recommendations. Ultimately, the court chose to rely on the more current report from Dr. Nicholson to support C.W.\u2019s progress and ordered a parenting plan different from the one Merkel recommended. This choice is not an abuse of discretion. During her testimony at trial, Merkel even recommended Dr. Nicholson to evaluate C.W. She stated, \u201cIf Laura Nicholson said that [C.W. is ready for co-parenting,] I would believe it.\u201d The court\u2019s findings indicate that it considered Merkel\u2019s investigative report; it was not an abuse of discretion to deviate from her recommendations,</p>\n<p id=\"Ae\">e. <em>Joint parenting</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">\u00b628 Shabnam alleges that the District Court abused its discretion by ordering a final parenting plan that requires C.W. to change residences every six weeks. In light of C.W.\u2019s developmental delays, young age, and need for continuity in care, she argues that the court\u2019s plan is not in the best interests of the child. Shabnam does not allege that any of the court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous. Rather, because C.W. is young and had always resided with his mother, she posits that a shared parenting plan is not in his best interest. She cites the trial testimony of several professionals that traveling between Billings and Phoenix would not be good for C.W. She ignores, however, that there was competing testimony from other professionals.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">\u00b629  Whether we would have reached the same decision as the trial court is not the standard under which we review a court\u2019s order for an abuse of discretion. <em>In re Marriage of Lockhead, </em>2013 MT 368, \u00b6 12, 373 Mont. 120, 314 P.3d 915. We review whether substantial evidence in the record supports the court\u2019s findings regardless of whether the evidence could support a different outcome as well. <em>Brimstone </em>Mining, <em>Inc. v. Glaus, </em>2003 MT 236, \u00b6 20, 317 Mont. 236, 77 P.3d 175. None of the arguments raised by Shabnam demonstrate that the court acted arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. The District Court was tasked with creating a long-distance parenting solution in a contentious situation. After evaluating the evidence presented, much of which was contradictory, it determined that a plan for the parents to share equal parenting time was in the best interest of the child. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>There is substantial evidence in the record to support the court\u2019s conclusion. The evidence supported Douglas\u2019s parenting skills, indicated that C.W.\u2019s developmental delays were not so serious as to prevent a shared schedule, and suggested that children are ready for co-parenting by the age of three. On the record before us, we do not find an abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s decision and we refuse to disturb its plan on these grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">\n<em>f. Bilingualism</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">\u00b630 Shabnam next contends that the District Court erroneously determined that C.W.\u2019s delays were attributable to bilingualism. She argues that \u201cwith only the exception of Douglasfs] paid provider, Michael Butz, every single medical expert and caregiver unequivocally maintained that bilingualism does not cause speech delay.\u201d This overstates the evidentiary support. At trial, both Dr. Butz and Henning testified that C.W.\u2019s delays may be alleviated with more English immersion. Irrespective of the bilingualism in Shabnam\u2019s home, these experts also contradicted her assertion that C. W. was severely delayed. They believed that bilingualism may cause delay to be shown in traditional English speech evaluations even if a child is not actually speech delayed. The court\u2019s order makes clear that it did not award Douglas parenting time on the basis of bilingualism in Shabnam\u2019s home. Rather, the court relied on the testimony of Douglas\u2019s witnesses and Dr. Nicholson, rejecting Shabnam\u2019s assertion that C.W. was severely delayed. The court\u2019s decision to believe one witness\u2019s testimony over another does not amount to an abuse of discretion. <em>Tomlin Enters., Inc. v. Althoff, </em>2004 MT 383, \u00b6\u00b6 22-23, 325 Mont. 99, 103 P.3d 1069.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">\n<em>g. Dr. Nicholson\u2019s report</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">\u00b631 Shabnam finally argues that the District Court abused its discretion when it ordered a post-trial report from Dr. Nicholson. She contends that Dr. Nicholson\u2019s report was improper because it relied on Douglas\u2019s trial expert, Beth Henning. Henning completed a speech and language evaluation for Dr. Nicholson as part of the latter\u2019s evaluation. \u00b632 The District Court\u2019s reliance on the Nicholson report does not rise to an abuse of discretion simply because she relied on Henning\u2019s speech evaluation.
