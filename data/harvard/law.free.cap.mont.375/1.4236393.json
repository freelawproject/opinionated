We affirm the award of attorneys\u2019 fees but reverse the amount of the fee award and remand for recalculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">\u00b67 This case arises from a dispute between property owners in Canyon Ranches, a subdivision developed by the Houdens in Carbon County, Montana. Canyon Ranches consists of twenty-six lots. On June 4, 2002, prior to selling any of the lots, the Houdens recorded a \u201cDeclaration of Covenants, Conditions, Restrictions and Reciprocal Easements for Canyon Ranches Subdivision* (the Original Covenants). The Houdens incorporated \u201cCanyon Ranches Subdivision Homeowners\u2019 Association\u201d (HOA) on June 11, 2002, in part to enforce the Original Covenants on all properties within Canyon Ranches.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-9\">\u00b68 The Original Covenants prohibited further subdivision of lots \u201c[ejxcept for ... division of Lots containing twenty (20) or more acres ... .* This provision of the Original Covenants, referred to as the No Standing Provision, added, \u201c[njeither the Association, nor any Owner, shall have standing to oppose the further division of any Lot containing twenty (20) or more acres as of the effective date of this Declaration, provided such division is proposed in accordance with all then-applicable statutes, ordinances, regulations, rules and orders of governmental entities with applicable jurisdiction ....\u201d The Houdens sold twenty-four lots, including Lot One to Todd. Only Lot Twenty-Six \u2014 retained by the Houdens \u2014 exceeded twenty acres.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-10\">\u00b69 The Original Covenants allowed for amendment of the covenants when at least seventy-five percent of the lot owners voted for an amendment. In December 2007, twenty-three lot owners voted to record an amendment to the Original Covenants, referred to as the Second Amendment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Second Amendment prohibited division of lots in excess of twenty acres absent approval of seventy-five percent of the lot owners. It also reversed the No Standing Provision, granting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>the HOA or any owner the right to oppose further subdivision of any lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">\u00b610 On January 3,2008, the Houdens filed a complaint against the lot owners (collectively referred to as Defendants) who voted for the Second Amendment. The complaint alleged that the changes imposed by the Second Amendment were invalid and \u201cin contravention of the settled rights and expectations of the parties.\u201d The Houdens sought injunctive relief to declare the Second Amendment invalid. They also asked for attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to a provision in the Original Covenants. That provision allows a prevailing party to recover costs and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees in any action to \u201cenforce, enjoin any violation of, or to construe the provisions of [the Original Covenants].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aq\">\u00b611 An extensive litigation process ensued. Defendants removed the action to federal court. Because there was not complete diversity of citizenship, the federal court later remanded the action to the District Court. The Defendants brought counterclaims against the Houdens and both parties filed motions. At Todd\u2019s suggestion and by agreement of the parties, the District Court appointed a Special Master to review the pending motions and make recommendations to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">\u00b612 On August 9, 2009, the Special Master recommended that the District Court grant the Houdens\u2019 summary judgment motion and invalidate the Second Amendment. Observing that the issue was one of first impression in Montana, the master adopted the view of jurisdictions holding that an amendment \u2014 even one validly adopted \u2014 may not take away the settled rights and expectations of the parties under a contract. Because the Original Covenants gave the Houdens a reasonable expectation that they could subdivide their twenty-plus acre parcel, the Second Amendment could not be applied to deprive them of a settled right that existed as part of the expectation of their ownership of the property. The District Court adopted the master\u2019s findings and recommendations in whole on December 14, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">\u00b613 Unbeknownst to the court, before its adoption of the master\u2019s findings and recommendations, the lot owners passed another amendment (Third Amendment) to the Original Covenants. The Third Amendment purported to revoke the Second Amendment by reinstating the right of the Houdens to subdivide Lot Twenty-Six as allowed by the Original Covenants. It retained, however, the elimination of the No Standing Provision, allowing lot owners to oppose the division of Lot Twenty-Six in the subdivision review process.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">\u00b614 Following the court\u2019s adoption of the master\u2019s findings and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>recommendations, Defendants filed a motion requesting clarification of the court\u2019s order. Defendants argued that nothing in the order precluded the Third Amendment\u2019s elimination of the No Standing Provision. At the direction of the District Court, the Special Master addressed Defendants\u2019 motion. On April 30,2010, the Special Master concluded that the ehmination of the No Standing Provision was invalid whether it was a part of another amendment or a separately adopted amendment. The court adopted the master\u2019s recommendation on this issue in an order dated July 21,2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">\u00b615 In September 2010, the Houdens and all Defendants except Todd reached a settlement. Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, each of the settling parties agreed to pay the Houdens $7500 and to sign \u201cAmended and Restated Covenants\u201d (Restated Covenants). The Restated Covenants expressly prohibit amendment to deprive the Houdens of their right to subdivide Lot Twenty-Six. After the filing of the Restated Covenants on September 17, 2010, the Original Covenants, including the Second and Third Amendments, were superseded. The Settlement Agreement reserved the Houdens\u2019 right to litigate any claims against lot owners not party to the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">\u00b6 16 On February22,2011, the District Court entered partial judgment in favor of the Houdens and against Todd, declaring the Second and Third Amendments null, void and unenforceable. The court also ruled against Todd on his counterclaims.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">\u00b617 On August 24,2012, the District Court ordered that the Houdens were entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees under the Original Covenants as the prevailing party in the action. After holding a hearing, the Court awarded the Houdens attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in the amount of $371,513.03. In its twenty-eight page order, including fifty findings of fact and fifty-six conclusions of law, the court recounted the extensive collateral issues that Todd raised in the case; it faulted him for complicating the litigation with unsubstantiated counterclaims and an unreasonable removal to federal court. After consideration of these factors, the court concluded that the Houdens\u2019 requested attorneys\u2019 fees were reasonable. The amount awarded reflected a deduction of amounts already paid in the settlement and the attorneys\u2019 fee award by the U.S. District Court. It included fees for work on the fee award and fees that the federal court declined to award for the removal proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">\u00b618 Todd appeals: the final judgment entered on April 15,2013; the findings of fact, conclusions of law and order regarding the award of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>costs and attorneys\u2019 fees entered on April 10, 2013; and all orders resulting in the final judgment in favor of the Houdens and against Todd.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">\u00b619 We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Chipman v. N.W. Healthcare Corp., </em>2014 MT 15, \u00b6 11, 373 Mont. 360, 317 P.3d 182. Whether a party is entitled to recover attorneys\u2019 fees is a question of law. <em>Chase v. Bearpaw Ranch Assn., </em>2006 MT 67, \u00b6 14, 331 Mont. 421, 133 P.3d 190. \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law pertaining to the recovery of attorney fees to determine whether those conclusions are correct.\u201d <em>Chase, </em>\u00b6 14 (internal citation omitted). \u00b620 An award of attorneys\u2019 fees is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Chase, </em>\u00b6 15. \u201cA court abuses its discretion if it acts arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>Chase, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">\u00b621 <em>1. Whether the District Court erred in its entry of judgment in favor of the Houdens.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">\u00b622 Todd contends that the District Court erred in declaring the Second and Third Amendments null, void and unenforceable. He argues that their adoption was consistent with the broad amendment provisions of the Original Covenants. The Houdens respond that the adoption of the Restated Covenants renders Todd\u2019s arguments moot. Although Todd was not a party to the Settlement Agreement, the Restated Covenants run with the land and apply to Todd. Even if Todd\u2019s argument regarding the Second and Third Amendment is correct, the Houdens maintain the Amendments can no longer be enforced because the Restated Covenants have superseded them.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-9\">\u00b623 Todd does not dispute that the Restated Covenants have resolved the dispute regarding division of the Houdens\u2019 parcel of property. He maintains nonetheless that this issue must be addressed because, if the District Court had interpreted the Second and Third Amendments correctly, he would have been the prevailing party in the lawsuit instead of the Houdens. Accordingly, the Houdens would not have received an attorneys\u2019 fee award. Todd asserts that analysis of the issue is required in order for this Court to determine the Houdens\u2019 right to recover their fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-10\">\u00b624 Mootness is a threshold issue. <em>Havre Daily News, LLC v. City of Havre, </em>2006 MT 215, \u00b6 31, 333 Mont. 331, 142 P.3d 864. An issue is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>moot \u201cif the issue presented at the outset of the action has ceased to exist or is no longer live,\u2019 or if the court is unable due to an intervening event or change in circumstances to grant effective relief or restore the parties to their original position ... .\u201d <em>Greater Missoula Area Fedn. of Early Childhood Educators v. Child Start, </em>Inc., 2009 MT 362, \u00b6 23, 353 Mont. 201, 219 P.3d 881.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">\u00b625 This Court has not addressed whether it may analyze a moot issue in order to determine if attorneys\u2019 fees properly were awarded. We previously have looked to federal courts for guidance on justiciability. <em>Greater Missoula, </em>\u00b6 22. Article VII, Section 4 of the Montana Constitution confines our authority to justiciable controversies in the same way the case or controversy provision of the United States Constitution limits the federal courts. <em>Greater Missoula, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">\u00b626 The weight of federal authority suggests that review of an award of attorneys\u2019 fees does not revive an otherwise moot issue. <em>Lewis v. Contl. Bank Corp., </em>494 U.S. 472, 480, 110 S. Ct. 1249, 1255, 108 L.Ed.2d 400 (1990) (\u201cThis interest in attorney\u2019s fees is, of course, insufficient to create an Article III case or controversy where none exists on the merits of the underlying claim.\u201d); <em>Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Marina Pt. Dev. Co., </em>560 F.3d 903, 906 (9th Cir. 2009) (\u201cWhen a matter becomes moot on appeal, the court will not, and cannot, review the merits of the underlying dispute for the purpose of determining whether an award of attorney fees was proper. That is to say, although it can consider whether the plaintiff prevailed at all, it cannot ask whether the district court\u2019s underlying decision on the merits was erroneous.\u201d) (citing numerous additional cases); <em>see Diamond v. Charles , </em>476 U.S. 54, 70-71, 106 S. Ct. 1697, 1708, 90 L.Ed.2d 48 (1986) (\u201cThe fee award is wholly unrelated to the subject matter of the litigation.... It is true that, were the Court to resolve the case on the merits against appellees, appellees would no longer be \u2018prevailing parties\u2019 entitled to an award of fees .... But the mere fact that continued adjudication would provide a remedy for an injury that is only a byproduct of the suit itself does not mean that the injury is cognizable under Art. III.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">\u00b627  We find the federal authority persuasive. We do not address moot issues and we do not issue advisory opinions. <em>Serena Vista, LLC v. Mont. State Dept. of Natl. Resources &amp; Conserv., </em>2008 MT 65, \u00b6 14, 342 Mont. 73, 179 P.3d 510. Any analysis of the underlying substantive issues in this case would be merely advisory because we cannot grant Todd the relief he sought originally \u2014 the prohibition of the subdivision of Lot Twenty-Six. The Restated Covenants, which now apply to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>Canyon Ranches and which are not challenged, expressly prohibit amendment to prevent subdivision of the lot. Consistent with the \u201cwide agreement\u201d among other appellate courts, we will \u201cnot undertake to delve into the details of a district court\u2019s resolution of a controversy that has since become moot in order to decide the ancillary question of fees.\u201d <em>Ctr. for Biological Diversity, </em>560 F.3d at 907.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">\u00b628 <em>2. Whether the adoption of the Restated Covenants mooted the Houdens\u2019 claim for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">\u00b629 Todd contends that the District Court erred by refusing to dismiss the Houdens\u2019 contract claim for legal fees as moot. He states that upon the filing of the Restated Covenants, the language supporting the award of attorneys\u2019 fees in the Original Covenants was rescinded. He argues that the technical meaning of the word \u201crescind\u201d is to declare the Original Covenants \u201cvoid in [their] inception and to put an end to it as though it never were.\u201d The Houdens respond that the parties to the Settlement Agreement did not intend to use the word \u201crescind\u201d in its technical meaning and instead intended to preserve the Houdens\u2019 claims against Todd.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">\u00b630  While it is clear that the Restated Covenants have mooted the controversy regarding the Second and Third Amendments, \u201c[i]t is also plain that mootness alone does not preclude an award of attomeysf] fees.\u201d <em>Center for Biological Diversity, </em>560 F.3d at 906. Thus, \u201ca determination of mootness neither precludes nor is precluded by an award of attorneys\u2019 fees. The attorneys\u2019 fees question turns instead on a wholly independent consideration: whether plaintiff is a \u2018prevailing party.\u2019 \u201d <em>Doe v. Marshall, </em>622 F.2d 118, 120 (5th Cir. 1980); <em>Williams v. Alioto, </em>625 F.2d 845, 848 (9th Cir. 1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 1012, 101 S. Ct. 1723, 68 L.Ed.2d 213 (1981) (\u201cClaims for attorneys\u2019 fees ancillary to the case survive independently under the court\u2019s equitable jurisdiction, and may be heard even though the underlying case has become moot.\u201d). It is significant that the fees were incurred in obtaining two summary judgment awards and negotiating a settlement of the remaining substantive issues. The Houdens had obtained a judicial determination in their favor under the Original Covenants before the Restated Covenants superseded them.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">\u00b631 Todd argues that the Houdens\u2019 claim to fees depends exclusively on the contract between the parties and that the contract cannot serve as the basis for such an award because it no longer exists. Todd overlooks the relationship between the Restated Covenants and the Settlement Agreement under which they were adopted. \u201cSeveral contracts relating to the same matters, between the same parties, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>made as parts of substantially one transaction are to be taken together.\u201d Section 28-3-203, MCA. When the relationship between documents related to an agreement is close, they should be viewed as one in order to determine the true intent of the parties. <em>Rumph v. Dale Edwards, Inc., </em>183 Mont. 359, 367, 600 P.2d 163, 168 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">\u00b632 The lot owners\u2019 action to rescind the Original Covenants was by virtue of the Settlement Agreement, which expressly set apart and preserved the Houdens\u2019 claim for fees under the Original Covenants. These two documents relate to the same matter of ending the litigation by preserving the Houdens\u2019 right to subdivide Lot Twenty-Six. They also were between the same parties and were made as part of the same transaction. Because of the close relationship between the documents, they should be construed in conjunction with each other to determine the parties\u2019 intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">\u00b633 The Restated Covenants provide, \u201cUpon the recording of this Declaration, the [Original Covenants] shall become, and hereafter shall be, rescinded, null, void, and of no further force and effect.\u201d The Settlement Agreement states that \u201cthe parties do not release, but instead expressly preserve, and reserve their right to assert... [a]ny and all claims by or against any Non-Party Lot Owner.\u201d The rescission was effectuated by the Settlement Agreement to which Todd was not a party and which must be read together with the Restated Covenants.</p>\n<p id=\"AD\">\u00b634  It is clear that the parties\u2019 intent under the Settlement Agreement and the Restated Covenants was to preserve the Houdens\u2019 claims against Todd. The Houdens had prevailed in their substantive legal claims against Todd before the Restated Covenants mooted the controversy between the parties. Accordingly, we affirm the District Court\u2019s decision to allow a claim for attorneys\u2019 fees under the Original Covenants to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">\u00b635 <em>3. Whether the District Court abused its discretion in awarding the Houdens attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in the amount of $371,513.03.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">\u00b636 Because the Restated Covenants did not moot the Houdens\u2019 claim for fees, we address Todd\u2019s argument regarding the reasonableness of the $371,513.03 award. He contends that the District Court erred by: imposing fees against him despite his position as an HOA board member; including fees incurred by the Houdens in their efforts to recover fees; including fees determined to be excessive by the federal court; including fees for two different law firms; including fees for the drafting and filing of the Restated Covenants; and adopting several of Houdens\u2019 proposed findings of fact without evidentiary support. The Houdens, in turn, ask for fees on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>\u00b637 Though reviewed for abuse of discretion, an award of attorneys\u2019 fees must be reasonable. <em>Plath v. </em>Schonrock, 2003 MT 21, \u00b6 36, 314 Mont. 101, 64 P.3d 984. District courts should determine reasonableness under the facts of each case. <em>Plath, </em>\u00b6 36. Although not exclusive, we have articulated guidelines to be used by district courts when determining reasonableness. <em>Bitterroot River Protective Assn. v. Bitterroot Conserv. Dist., </em>2011 MT 51, \u00b6 45, 359 Mont. 393, 251 P.3d 131. These include \u201c(1) the amount and character of the services rendered; (2) the labor, time and trouble involved; (3) the character and importance of the litigation in which the services were rendered; (4) the amount of money or the value of the property to be affected; (5) the professional skill and experience called for; (6) the attorneys\u2019 character and standing in their profession; and (7) the results secured by the services of the attorneys.\u201d <em>Plath, </em>\u00b6 36. The District Court considered these factors in determining the Houdens\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">\n<em>\u0430. Board member exemption</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">\u00b638 Todd challenges the award of attorneys\u2019 fees because of his status as an HOA board member. The Original Covenants contained a waiver of liability for HOA board members for any \u201closs, damage or injury arising out of or in any way connected with the adoption, implementation or enforcement of [the Original Covenants]... or any amendment hereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">\u00b639 The Houdens sued Todd in his individual capacity. The lawsuit arose from Todd\u2019s actions as an individual lot owner who voted for the Second Amendment, not from any action taken as a board member of the HOA. Todd does not provide any authority for his argument that his position as a board member insulates him from liability for his actions as an individual lot owner. As such, we agree with the District Court that the liability waiver in the Original Covenants does not insulate Todd from liability in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">\u0431. <em>Fees incurred in recovering fees (fees-for-fees)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">\u00b640 Todd next contends that the District Court erred by allowing the Houdens to recover fees-for-fees. The fee provision in the Original Covenants allowed for an award of fees in any action to \u201cconstrue the provisions of this Declaration.\u201d The court considered a dispute over a reasonable amount of fees as an action to interpret a contract provision and concluded that an award of fees-for-fees was reasonable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">\u00b641 Contractual fee-shifting provisions are a recognized exception to the American Rule that a party generally pays its own attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>Chase, </em>\u00b6 29. Nevertheless, a general contract provision shifting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>attorneys\u2019 fees does not authorize an award of fees for time spent in seeking the fees themselves. <em>Chase, </em>\u00b6 30. The contract provision at issue in <em>Chase </em>authorized attorneys\u2019 fees \u201cin any action of any kind <em>for the enforcement </em>of the Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions.\u201d <em>Chase, </em>\u00b6 31 (emphasis in original). Because the contract authorized a fee award, the Court determined that establishing a right to such an award was an action to enforce the contract. <em>Chase, </em>\u00b6 32. We therefore permitted fees-for-fees to the extent that such fees were incurred establishing the prevailing party\u2019s entitlement to such fees. <em>Chase, </em>\u00b6 32. The Court declined, however, to allow fees for the time spent establishing the amount of reasonable attorneys\u2019fees. <em>Chase, </em>\u00b6 32. The Court expressed concern that allowing such fees under a general contract provision would allow the exception of contractual fee-shifting to swallow the general rule that a party should pay its own fees. <em>Chase, </em>\u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">\u00b642  The Houdens argue that establishing a reasonable amount of attorneys\u2019 fees is an action to \u201cconstrue\u201d the provisions of the Original Covenants as allowed by the attorneys\u2019 fee provision. We disagree. The attorneys\u2019 fees provision in the Original Covenants can be characterized as a general contract provision that does not specifically contract for fees incurred in connection with a proceeding to establish the amount of fees that may be recovered. In accordance with <em>Chase, </em>we agree that the Houdens are entitled to recover fees incurred in establishing their entitlement to fees under the Original Covenants. This right does not extend, however, to fees incurred in establishing the amount of reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>Chase, </em>\u00b6 32. We reverse the District Court\u2019s determination and remand for the court to recalculate the fee award properly excluding fees incurred in establishing the reasonable amount of the Houdens\u2019 claimed fees.</p>\n<p id=\"Av\">\n<em>c. Removal fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">\u00b643 When the Houdens sought remand to state court, they requested an award of costs and attorneys\u2019 fees incurred as a result of the Defendants\u2019 improper removal. Such fees are authorized pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c). The U.S. District Court denied the Houdens\u2019 motion for fees and costs. The Houdens appealed this denial. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the district court\u2019s judgment, holding that Todd\u2019s removal was \u201cobjectively unreasonable.\u201d On remand to the federal district court, the Houdens requested fees and costs in the amount of $55,968.12. The court awarded fees in the amount of $20,957.62. The court reduced the requested amount for two reasons. First, it determined that the Houdens did not request fees for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in a timely manner under the Ninth Circuit Local Rides. Second, it determined that the hourly rates charged by the Houdens\u2019 attorneys were unreasonable and lowered each requested rate by $50 per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">\u00b644 In their request to the District Court for attorneys\u2019 fees, the Houdens deducted the $20,957.62 already awarded by the federal court. They included, however, a request for $35,010.50, the difference between the amount they had requested and the amount the federal court awarded. The District Court included the additional amount in the Houdens\u2019 fee award. Todd argues that this award of fees is unreasonable because a federal judge already had determined that they were excessive. The Houdens counter that the District Court was not bound by the federal court\u2019s fee determination. Further, they contend that the federal court\u2019s fee award was limited by statutory restrictions that do not apply to the contractual fee provision they sought to enforce in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">\u00b645  The Houdens\u2019 attempt to characterize the District Court\u2019s additional fee award as allowable because it stemmed from the contractual provision is unpersuasive. Their requested fee award was reduced by the federal court because they failed to follow the court\u2019s local rules and failed to convince the judge that their hourly rate was reasonable. The amount of reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees attributed to the improper removal already was adjudicated. Concerns of comity and judicial economy invoke the law of the case doctrine here. The law of the case doctrine is the practice of courts \u201cgenerally to refuse to reopen what has been decided.\u201d <em>McCormick v. Brevig, </em>2007 MT 195, \u00b6 38, 338 Mont. 370, 169 P.3d 352. A decision \u201cmade at one stage of litigation which is not appealed when the opportunity to do so exists, becomes the law of the case for the future course of that litigation ... .\u201d <em>McCormick, </em>\u00b6 38. Contrary to the District Court\u2019s assertion, the law of the case doctrine applies to coordinate courts, including between state and federal courts on removal and remand. Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Edward H. Cooper, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>vol. 18B, \u00a7 4478.4,770 (2d ed., West 2002). The Houdens litigated their fee claim for improper removal and received the fees to which the federal court determined they were entitled under federal law for a federal proceeding. They cite no cases in which additional fees have been awarded by a state court under these circumstances. Allowing the Houdens a second chance to recover the same fees required the District Court to review what the federal court already decided, which disregards the comity afforded to a coordinate court. We conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>the District Court abused its discretion by including the $35,010.50 as part of the Houdens\u2019 fee award. On remand, the District Court should recalculate the fee award to deduct this requested amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">\n<em>d. Two law firms</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">\u00b646 Todd contends that the court abused its discretion by awarding the Houdens fees for two separate law firms when one firm would have been adequate. The District Court found that the use of two law firms was reasonable because of the extensive motion practice the case generated, the number of defendants and Todd\u2019s actions that multiplied the litigation. Further, the District Court found that the costs between the two firms did not \u201cunreasonably increase costs or fees or lead to unreasonable duplication,\u201d and that they \u201cproperly allocated the tasks between them to avoid duplication of effort.\u201d The court concluded that \u201c[t]he working relationship between [Houdens\u2019 lawyers] is not appreciably different from the efforts of two attorneys in the same firm working on the same case.\u201d Todd does not contend that these findings are clearly erroneous, nor does he articulate why the award constitutes an abuse of discretion. Rather, he generally asserts that only one firm was necessary. The court\u2019s extensive findings and the record upon which they are based support an award for two attorneys. We are not convinced that the District Court abused its discretion by determining that fees for two law firms was reasonable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">\n<em>e. Fees for drafting and filing the Restated Covenants</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">\u00b647 Todd disputes the court\u2019s imposition of fees for drafting and filing the Restated Covenants. He argues that the $16,000 charged by the Houdens\u2019 attorneys for execution of the Settlement Agreement and the Restated Covenants \u201cclearly had nothing to do with the enforcement or interpretation of the Original Covenants, Second or Third Amendments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">\u00b648 The District Court actually concluded that Todd was not responsible for these fees because the settling parties paid them. The Houdens received $157,000 from the settling parties that they deducted from their request for fees. The District Court concluded that \u201cWayne Todd is not being asked to pay for the fees and costs that the Houdens incurred in the settlement but has benefitted significantly by Houdens\u2019 receipt of those funds.\u201d Todd does not dispute these findings and we find no abuse of discretion on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-10\">\n<em>f. Findings contradicted by the record</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b37-11\">\u00b649 Todd makes a general argument that the District Court\u2019s adoption of the Houdens\u2019 proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>ignored contrary evidence and resulted in substantial injustice to Todd. \u00b650 Specifically, he argues that the court mischaracterized the \u201ccrux\u201d of his argument. In its findings of fact, the court found that Todd\u2019s defense revolved around the claim that he and other Defendants were told prior to the purchase that the Houdens would not develop Lot Twenty-Six. It determined that there was no evidence supporting this assertion. Todd argues that his argument was actually based on the language of the Original Covenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">\u00b651 Todd fails to demonstrate how this finding resulted in the imposition of unreasonable attorneys\u2019 fees. When discussing this argument, the court merely was pointing out one of the many ways Todd\u2019s actions complicated the litigation. This was an attempt to counter Todd\u2019s arguments that attorneys\u2019 fees were unreasonably high for a simple contract case that did not go to trial. The court\u2019s findings regarding the protracted litigation in this case were detailed, thorough and followed the factors articulated in <em>Plath. </em>The court stated, \u201cTodd did everything possible to portray the case other than a simple matter of contract interpretation and cannot now seek refuge in the very simplicity he sought to obscure.\u201d The corut listed the ways that Todd\u2019s action \u201cgreatly multiplied the issue, requiring an enormous amount of additional work by Houdens\u2019 counsel\u201d and did not rely only on the one argument that Todd now challenges. We are not persuaded that awarding fees as a result of the court\u2019s characterization of Todd\u2019s argument amounted to an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"AT-\">\n<em>g. Fees on appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">\u00b652  The Houdens request an additional award of attorneys\u2019 fees for the present appeal. We previously have held that \u201cif a contract includes a provision stating that a prevailing party is entitled to reasonable attomey[s\u2019] fees arising from litigation under the contact, appellate attomey[s\u2019] fees are included under the provision.\u201d Boyne <em>USA, Inc. v. Lone Moose Meadows, </em>LLC, 2010 MT 133, \u00b6 26, 356 Mont. 408, 235 P.3d 1269. Although we are reversing a portion of the District Court\u2019s fee award, we uphold its decision on the merits and its imposition of fees in this case. As such, the Houdens are the prevailing party and are entitled to fees incurred on appeal. On remand, the District Court should impose reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees associated with this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">\u00b653 Because the underlying merits of this case are now moot, we do not address whether the District Court erred in its decision to void the Second and Third Amendments. Thus, its judgment in favor of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Houdens is affirmed. The Restated Covenants did not moot the Houdens\u2019 right to attorneys\u2019 fees and costs under the fee-shifting provision of the Original Covenants. As the prevailing party, they are entitled to reasonable fees and costs. We reverse and remand the District Court\u2019s fee award. On remand, the court should recalculate the fee award to properly exclude fees-for-fees in accordance with this Opinion, to exclude fees incurred on removal, and to include the Houdens\u2019 fees and costs on appeal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b39-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES RICE, COTTER and McKINNON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b27-11\"> There was a First Amendment to the Original Covenants adopted in 2002; it is not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
