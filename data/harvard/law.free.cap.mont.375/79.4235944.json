(CTA) appeals from an order of the Eleventh Judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>District Court, Flathead County, denying CTA\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granting Rowland and Jaimie Days\u2019 (Days) motion for partial summary judgment. We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">\u00b62 We restate the dispositive issue on appeal as:</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court err in denying CTA\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granting the Days\u2019 motion forpartial summary judgment based on its finding that the arbitration clause in the contract was unenforceable?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">\u00b64 This dispute arises out a standard-form contract<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for professional services entered into by the Days, property owners in Flathead County, and CTA, a firm offering architectural, engineering, and construction management services. On May 11, 2012, the Days filed a complaint against CTA, Martel Construction, Inc., and John Does 1-5, alleging that the Defendants negligently designed and constructed the Days\u2019 home, resulting in property damage, and that CTA breached its contract with the Days. On July 12, 2012, CTA filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) \u201con grounds that the contract giving rise to the dispute in this matter is subject to mandatory arbitration and the [cjourt lacks subject matter jurisdiction to resolve the dispute.\u201d Because CTA submitted a copy of the contract with its motion, the court converted the motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 12(d). The Days filed a cross-motion for partial summary judgment, alleging that the arbitration clause contained in the contract was unenforceable. On October 21, 2013, the District Court issued an order denying CTA\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granting the Days\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment. CTA timely appealed. The District Court stayed litigation of the case pending resolution of CTA\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">\u00b65 CTA argues that the District Court erred in concluding that the arbitration clause in the contract was invalid and unenforceable. CTA maintains that because the contract was not a contract of adhesion, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>District Court incorrectly considered the factors enumerated in <em>Kortum-Managhan v. Herbergers NGBL, </em>2009 MT 79, \u00b6 27, 349 Mont. 475, 204 P.3d 693. The Days counter that the District Court correctly found that there was no mutual consent to he bound by arbitration because there was no knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of the right to a jury trial and access to the courts by the Days.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">\u00b66 When a district court converts a motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment, we use the same standard of review applied to an appeal from a grant or denial of summary judgment. <em>Doe v. Community Med. Ctr., </em>2009 MT 395, \u00b6 15, 353 Mont. 378, 221 P.3d 651. We review a district court\u2019s summary judgment ruling de novo, applying the same criteria as a district court pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 56(c). Summary judgment is appropriate when there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Doe, </em>\u00b6 15 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">\u00b67 <em>Did the District Court err in denying CTA\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granting the Days\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment based on its finding that the arbitration clause in the contract was unenforceable?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">\u00b68 \u201cArbitration is a matter of contract,\u201d <em>Graziano v. Stock Farm Homeowners Assn., </em>2011 MT 194, \u00b6 17, 361 Mont. 332, 258 P.3d 999 (citation omitted), and \u201cAgreements to arbitrate generally represent valid and enforceable contracts under Montana law.\u201d <em>Kelker v. Geneva-Roth Ventures, Inc., </em>2013 MT 62, \u00b6 11, 369 Mont. 254, 303 P.3d 777 (citations omitted). We evaluate an arbitration clause to determine whether the clause was unconscionable under generally applicable Montana contract law. A contract is unconscionable if it is a contract of adhesion and if the contractual terms unreasonably favor the drafter. <em>Kelker, </em>\u00b6 29 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">\u00b69 We begin our analysis by determining whether the contract between the parties was a contract of adhesion. A contract of adhesion is a standard-form contract prepared by one party, to be signed by the party in a weaker position who adheres to the contract with little or no choice about its terms. <em>Graziano, </em>\u00b6 18 (citation omitted). The weaker party accepts or rejects the contract without an opportunity to negotiate its terms. <em>Kortum-Managhan, </em>\u00b6 23; <em>Graziano, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">\u00b610 The contract between the Days and CTA is not a contract of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>adhesion. Though the contract was a standard-form contract, there is no dispute that the Days had the ability to change at least some of the terms of the contract.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In an affidavit, Rowland Day stated he has no recollection of meeting with or talking to CTA\u2019s architect, signing the contract, reading the arbitration clause, or discussing the arbitration clause with anyone. This affidavit does not refute the evidence in the record that the parties negotiated some of the terms of the contract. Moreover, the District Court specifically found there was no disparity in bargaining power as Rowland Day is a securities attorney in California, nor does Day now argue there was a disparity. Disparity in bargaining power is an essential element of a contract of adhesion. <em>See e.g. Zigrang v. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, Inc. , </em>2005 MT 282, \u00b6 14, 329 Mont. 239, 123 P.3d 237 (citation omitted) (\u201cContracts of adhesion arise when a party possessing superior bargaining power presents a standardized form of agreement to a party whose choice remains either to accept or reject the contract without the opportunity to negotiate its terms.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">\u00b611 Even if the contract did constitute a contract of adhesion, this factor alone does not make the arbitration clause unenforceable. <em>Graziano, </em>\u00b6 20 (citation omitted). An arbitration clause will be enforced unless the clause (1) was not within a party\u2019s reasonable expectations, or (2) was within the party\u2019s reasonable expectations, but when considered in context, is unduly oppressive, unconscionable, or against public policy. <em>Graziano, </em>\u00b6 20 (citation omitted); <em>Kelker, </em>\u00b6 17 (citing <em>Kortum-Managhan, </em>\u00b6 23).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This Court has analyzed the reasonable expectations of a party entering an arbitration contract using the factors enumerated in <em>Woodruff v. Bretz, Inc., </em>2009 MT 329, \u00b6 15, 353 Mont. 6, 218 P.3d 486, and <em>Kortum-Managhan. See Graziano, </em>\u00b6 21; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number><em>Kelker, </em>\u00b6 33. Under <em>Woodruff, </em>\u201creasonable expectations derive from all of the circumstances surrounding the execution of the contract, such as the consumer\u2019s business experience and sophistication, any routine practice between the parties established through prior dealings, whether the consumer studied the agreement and comprehended its terms, whether the consumer had the advice or representation of counsel, and whether the challenged provision and the consequences of the provision were fully and adequately explained to the consumer.\u201d <em>Woodruff, </em>\u00b6 15. The <em>Kortum-Managhan </em>factors are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-4\">whether there were any actual negotiations over the waiver provision; whether the clause was included on a take-it-or-leave-it basis as part of a standard-form contract; whether the waiver clause was conspicuous and explained the consequences of the provision (e.g. waiver of the right to trial by jury and right of access to the courts); whether there was disparity in the bargaining power of the contracting parties; whether there was a difference in business experience and sophistication of the parties; whether the party charged with the waiver was represented by counsel at the time the agreement was executed; whether economic, social or practical duress compelled a party to execute the contract (e.g. where a consumer needs phone service and the only company or companies providing that service require execution of an adhesion contract with a binding arbitration clause before service will be extended); whether the agreement was actually signed or the waiver provision separately initialed; whether the waiver clause was ambiguous or misleading; and whether the party with the superior bargaining power lulled the inferior party into a belief that the waiver would not be enforced.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABA\"><em>Kortum-Managhan, </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The <em>Kortum-Managhan </em>factors were to be used to determine \u201cwhether an individual deliberately, understandingly and intelligently waived their [sic] fundamental constitutional rights to trial by jury and access to the courts.\u201d <em>Kortum-Managhan, </em>\u00b6 27; <em>Kelker, </em>\u00b6 55 (Baker, J., dissenting). However, in <em>Kelker, </em>we considered the totality of the factors in determining whether the arbitration clause fell within Kelker\u2019s reasonable expectations. <em>Kelker, </em>\u00b6 33. Thus, the inquiry of whether a party voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waived its rights has become part of the inquiry of the party\u2019s reasonable expectations. Because the <em>Woodruff </em>and <em>Kortum-Managhan </em>factors are so similar, and because of the manner in which this case was briefed, we apply the <em>Kortum-Managhan </em>factors to determine whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>the arbitration clause fell within the Days\u2019 reasonable expectations. The District Court determined that these factors weigh against enforcement of the arbitration clause. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">\u00b612 The Days do not contend they were motivated by duress to enter into the contract. The arbitration clause was in the body of the contract under a bolded, capitalized heading, and the clause was not ambiguous or misleading. As noted above, Rowland Day is not an ordinary citizen with a relative lack of sophistication in such matters; he is a securities attorney. The District Court concluded that this fact \u201cdoes not establish that [Day\u2019s] waiver of fundamental constitutional rights was intelligently, knowingly and voluntarily waived\u201d because \u201c[s]omeone who practices in the area of securities in another state is not necessarily familiar with Montana law regarding agreements to arbitrate.\u201d Familiarity with Montana contract law regarding arbitration clauses is not, however, required in order for a waiver of rights to be valid. Rowland Day\u2019s professional experience and sophistication make him more similar to the plaintiff in <em>Graziano, </em>the former Chief Financial Officer of Apple Computer, Inc., than to the consumers in <em>Woodruff, Kortum-Managhan, </em>and <em>Kloss v. Edward D. Jones &amp; Co., </em>2002 MT 129, 310 Mont. 123, 54 P.3d 1 (preempted in part by the Federal Arbitration Act). <em>See Graziano, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">\u00b613 Graziano had extensive business experience and had personal experience with arbitration agreements. His separation agreement with Apple Computer, Inc. contained an arbitration provision that his counsel at the time explained to him. <em>Graziano, </em>\u00b6 23. In an affidavit, Graziano stated that no one explained the Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions (CCRs) to him, that he did not know the CCRs contained language affecting his rights, and that he was not represented by counsel. This Court found the affidavit self-serving in light of Graziano\u2019s extensive business experience. We concluded that the affidavit constituted \u201cweak evidence\u201d regarding his understanding of the purchase of his property, especially because Graziano attempted to <em>enforce </em>portions of the CCRs against the Defendants while seeking to personally escape the effect of the arbitration provision. <em>Graziano, </em>\u00b6 24 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">\u00b614  Rowland Day\u2019s affidavit similarly constitutes \u201cweak evidence\u201d regarding his understanding of the contract in light of his professional experience. It is unsurprising that Rowland Day has no recollection of signing the contract or of the negotiations leading up to it as twelve years passed between execution of the contract and the filing of the complaint. However, Rowland Day\u2019s lack of recollection does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>compel a finding that the arbitration clause was outside of his reasonable expectations in 2000, nor does he assert in his affidavit that the clause <em>was </em>outside his expectations. Moreover, like Graziano, the Days attempt to enforce portions of the contract against CTA, yet seek to personally escape the effect of the arbitration provision. <em>See Graziano, </em>\u00b6 24. We conclude that, given the surrounding circumstances, the arbitration clause was within the Days\u2019 reasonable expectations. We further conclude that the arbitration clause was not oppressive, unconscionable, or against public policy. The arbitration clause is therefore enforceable. <em>Graziano, </em>\u00b6 20; <em>Kelker, </em>\u00b6 17 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">\u00b615 Because this issue is dispositive, we need not address CTA\u2019s argument that the District Court erred in disregarding the mandatory mediation provision in the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">\u00b616 For the foregoing reasons, we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b109-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, RICE and McKINNON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b104-11\">A \u201cstandard-form contract\u201d is \u2018Ta] usu. preprinted contract containing set clauses, used repeatedly by a business or within a particular industry with only slight additions or modifications to meet the specific situation.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>373 (Bryan A.
