We affirm and restate Cudd\u2019s sole issue on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">\u00b62 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion by denying Cudd\u2019s challenge for cause of a juror whose daughter had been the victim of sexual violence?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">\u00b63 The State charged Cudd with Sexual Intercourse without Consent, alleging that Cudd engaged in a continual sexual relationship with his stepdaughter, D.F., from 2006 to 2010. At the time the offenses began, D.F. was twelve years old, under the age of statutory consent in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">\u00b64 The case against Cudd proceeded to trial on May 21, 2012. Voir dire was conducted by initially asking general questions of the prospective jurors, followed by an opportunity for confidential voir dire of individual jurors. Several jurors, including juror M.R., asked to discuss matters privately in chambers. This colloquy followed between M.R., the District Court, prosecutor David Sibley, and defense counsel Robert Kelleher:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-10\">[THE COURT:] And, [M.R.], I probably won\u2019t do a lot of the questioning, I\u2019ll leave that to the attorneys, but if you could just tell me what the nature of your concern is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-11\">[M.R.]: My daughter has been in numerous abusive relationships, and one of those was rape.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-12\">THE COURT: So you\u2019ve had a daughter that\u2019s been the subject of some sexual violence; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-13\">[M.R.]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-14\">THE COURT: Mr. Sibley.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-15\">MR. SIBLEY: [M.R.], do you believe that it would make it impossible for you to judge the evidence fairly and hold the State to its burden that we still must prove each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-16\">[M.R.]: I would do my best to be fair. That\u2019s all I can say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-17\">MR. SIBLEY: That\u2019s all we\u2019re asking, is just that the purpose of this is to, as the judge said, give you the privacy to make those disclosures without being in the public forum. But that really is the relevant question: Could you judge the evidence fairly and give Mr. Cudd a fair trial in which he\u2019s entitled?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>[MR.]: XJli-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-4\">MR. SIBLEY: Do you believe you could?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-5\">[M.R.]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-6\">THE COURT: Anything else, Mr. Sibley?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-7\">MR. SIBLEY: Nothing further from the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-8\">THE COURT: Mr. Kelleher.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-9\">MR. KELLEHER: [M.R.], what was the outcome, were any of those people prosecuted?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-10\">[M.R.]: One of them was, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-11\">MR. KELLEHER: What was the outcome of that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-12\">[M.R.]: He was found guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-13\">MR. KELLEHER: Would anything that had to do with that trial \u2014 I mean, the question is whether you\u2019re tilting more to toward one side or the other. That\u2019s the issue. And because of that experience whether you would be more in favor of the prosecution as opposed to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-14\">[M.R.]: Well, in that case, of course, I would be more secured to my daughter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-15\">MR. KELLEHER: I\u2019m sorry. Based on your experience in the case with your daughter, whether in this case today you\u2019d be more tuned into the prosecution or leaningmore toward the prosecution just from the outset?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-16\">[M-RJ: To be honest, I\u2019d probably be going towards the victim. You know, looking at their point of view.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-17\">MR. KELLEHER: So you\u2019d be more likely to believe the testimony of the alleged victim in this case than you would a defense witness?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-18\">[MR.]: I hate to say that, but yes, I probably would.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-19\">MR. KELLEHER: I think we need to excuse her for cause, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-20\">MR. SIBLEY: Your Honor, may I have the chance to rehabilitate?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQf\">THE COURT: You may.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-21\">MR. SIBLEY: What were the charges that were filed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-22\">[M.R.]: The one that was found guilty was domestic abuse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-23\">MR. SIBLEY: So that wasn\u2019t a rape case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-24\">[MR.]: No, that was not a rape case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-25\">MR. SIBLEY: As you said, you could judge the credibility of the witnesses and if you would not believe the witness \u2014 you would be more inclined if you didn\u2019t believe them \u2014 you would still hold the State to the burden.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-26\">[MR.]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-27\">MR. SIBLEY: I believe she\u2019s capable to serve as a juror. I believe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>she has stated that she can hold the State to its burden of proof and burden and be fair and impartial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-5\">MR. KELLEHER: 111 continue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-6\">THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-7\">MR. KELLEHER: I request that she removed for cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-8\">THE COURT: The challenge for cause is denied. [M.R.], I appreciate you coming in.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">\u00b65 The defense subsequently used all of its preemptory challenges, including one to excuse M.R. Cudd was convicted following trial and sentenced to the Montana State Prison. He appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b242-11\">\u00b66 \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s denial of a challenge for cause using an abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>State v. Johnson, </em>2014 MT 11, \u00b6 8, 373 Mont. 330, 317 P.3d 164 (citation omitted). A district court abuses its discretion if it denies a challenge for cause when a prospective juror\u2019s statements during voir dire raise serious doubts about the juror\u2019s ability to be fair and impartial or actual bias is discovered. <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 8 (citations omitted). If a district court abuses its discretion by denying a legitimate challenge for cause, the error is structural and automatic reversal is required. <em>State v. Good, </em>2002 MT 59, \u00b6\u00b6 62-63, 309 Mont. 113, 43 P.3d 948.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b242-13\">\u00b67 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion by denying Cudd\u2019s challenge for cause of a juror whose daughter had been the victim of sexual </em>violence?</p>\n<p id=\"b242-14\">\u00b68 A criminal defendant has a fundamental right to be tried by an impartial jury. <em>State v. Allen, </em>2010 MT 214, \u00b6 25, 357 Mont. 495, 241 P.3d 1045 (citation omitted). To safeguard this right, \u201c[e]ach party may challenge jurors for cause, and each challenge must be tried by the court.\u201d Section 46-16-115(1), MCA. A challenge for cause may be taken when a juror demonstrates \u201ca state of mind in reference to the case or to either of the parties that would prevent the juror from acting with entire impartiality and without prejudice to the substantial rights of either party.\u201d Section 46-16-115(2)(j), MCA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A court must decide a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>challenge for cause under \u00a7 46-16-115(2)(j), MCA, based on the totality of the circumstances presented. <em>State v. Golie, </em>2006 MT 91, \u00b6 8, 332 Mont. 69, 134 P.3d 95. As a general principle, \u201c[a] prospective juror\u2019s \u2018spontaneous statements\u2019 are given more weight than \u2018coaxed recantations\u2019 elicited by counsel because spontaneous statements are \u2018most likely to be reliable and honest.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Jay, </em>2013 MT 79, \u00b6 19, 369 Mont. 332, 298 P.3d 396 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">\u00b69  Jurors who state that they are unable or unwilling to suspend their prejudicial beliefs and follow the law should be excused for cause. <em>Jay, </em>\u00b6 20 (citation omitted). However, \u201ca juror should not be removed merely because she voices a concern about being impartial \u2014 every person comes to jury duty with preconceptions.\u201d <em>Jay, </em>\u00b6 20; <em>accord State v. Normandy, </em>2008 MT 437, \u00b6 22, 347 Mont. 505, 198 P.3d 834 (\u201c[I]f the prospective juror merely expresses concern about impartiality but believes he can fairly weigh the evidence, the court is not required to remove the juror.\u201d). We have recognized that \u201c[i]n reality, few people are entirely impartial regarding criminal matters ... .\u201d <em>Allen, </em>\u00b6 26 (citation omitted). Therefore, the critical inquiry is whether a prospective juror can convincingly affirm his or her ability to lay aside any misgivings and fairly weigh the evidence. <em>See Allen, </em>\u00b6 26 (citation omitted). Because district court judges sit in the best position to observe the disposition of prospective jurors, we grant lower courts a certain degree of deference in making this determination. <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 20 (citations omitted); <em>Allen, </em>\u00b6 26 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">\u00b610 Cudd argues that M.R.\u2019s \u201cstate of mind prevented her from acting with entire impartiality.\u201d He maintains that M.R. acknowledged her bias several times: (1) when she stated, \u201cWell, in that case, of course, I would be more secured to my daughter\u201d; (2) when she further stated, \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019d probably be going towards the victim. You know, looking at their point of view\u201d; and (3) when asked by defense counsel, \u201cSo you\u2019d be more likely to believe the testimony of the alleged victim in this case them you would a defense witness,\u201d she replied, \u201cI hate to say that, but yes, I probably would.\u201d Cudd argues that these statements \u201craised serious questions about [M.R.\u2019s] ability to be impartial\u201d and \u201cdeprived him of the fundamental right to be tried by an impartial jury\u201d when the District Court denied his challenge for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>cause. He characterizes M.R.\u2019s initial assurances that she could judge the evidence fairly and hold the State to its burden of proof as \u201cattempts to show respect for the judicial process and avoid confrontation with those officers of the court that were peppering her with questions,\u201d and not as evidence of impartiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">\u00b611 The State contends that \u201cM.R.\u2019s comments did not establish that she harbored actual bias or that her state of mind prevented her from acting impartially.\u201d It argues that, although M.R. honestly advised the court of her past experiences and perspectives, she at no time indicated she was unwilling to fairly and objectively evaluate the case. The State points to the fact that when directly asked, M.R. clearly affirmed her ability to remain impartial despite her daughter\u2019s experiences. In support of its position, the State analogizes to several cases, including our recent holding in <em>Johnson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">\u00b612 In <em>Johnson, </em>the State\u2019s case relied heavily on law enforcement testimony to establish that Johnson burglarized a residence. During voir dire, prospective juror Harsell (Harsell) stated that he believed law enforcement officers \u201cto be a very trustworthy bunch\u201d and found \u201cthem more believable than the average person.\u201d When asked by defense counsel whether he could take officer testimony with \u201ca grain of salt,\u201d he replied, \u201cI think a grain of salt is way too light. I just tend to find them more believable than the average person.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 5. Harsell then told the court that he could assess the witnesses on a person-by-person basis, regardless of occupation. <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 6. This Court found it persuasive that, even though Harsell admitted to harboring bias, he assured the district court that he could set aside his prior experiences and evaluate the witnesses fairly. <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15,19. We affirmed the district court\u2019s determination not to excuse Harsell for cause. <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">\u00b613 Similar to the juror in <em>Johnson, </em>M.R. expressed some concerns about impartiality, but also affirmatively stated that she could judge the evidence fairly and give Cudd a fair trial. Notably, M.R.\u2019s seemingly biased statements arose only after defense counsel required her to choose between the prosecution and the defense \u2014 between the victim and a defense witness. In <em>State v. Crosley, </em>2009 MT 126, \u00b6 21, 350 Mont. 223, 206 P.3d 932, defense counsel posed a nearly identical choice to potential juror Aronson when he asked, \u201cIf it came down to Detective Clarkson saying A and an unknown witness saying B, who are you going to believe?\u201d Aronson responded, \u201cProbably Mr. Clarkson.\u201d On appeal, we reasoned that \u201c[w]hile there was much questioning about Aronson\u2019s ability to fairly weigh testimony from Detective Clarkson against other testimony, this is significantly different than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>the type of improper state of mind that raises serious doubts about a juror\u2019s ability to be fair and impartial.\u201d <em>Crosley, </em>\u00b6 36. We noted that even though Aronson admitted he would give credibility to Detective Clarkson, he also stated he would keep an open mind and look to the facts. We explained that, \u201c[w]hile these answers perhaps lack the conviction that defense counsel would prefer, they do not raise serious doubts about Aronson\u2019s ability to be fair and impartial.\u201d <em>Crosley, </em>\u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"AsF\">\u00b614 Cudd attempts to distinguish precedent cited by the State on the grounds that M.R. \u201cneither retracted nor disavowed her bias\u201d <em>after </em>stating that she would probably favor the testimony of the victim, and that the subsequent rehabilitative questions posed by the State related strictly to the burden of proof and not M.R.\u2019s bias. According to Cudd, \u201c[o]nce [M.R.\u2019s] bias was unveiled, the prosecutor used the burden of proof concept as a red herring instead of addressing the real issue of impartiality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">\u00b615  While we recognize the distinction drawn by Cudd on this point, we do not find it determinative. Certainly, some of our cases have involved factual situations where the prospective juror disavowed his or her stated bias during follow-up questioning by the prosecution or the court. However, there is no authority suggesting that a district court is required to grant or deny a challenge for cause strictly based on answers given <em>after </em>a juror\u2019s potential bias is revealed. To the contrary, we evaluate a prospective juror\u2019s responses as a whole. <em>Golie, </em>\u00b6 10. In situations where, as here,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-5\">\u201ca juror makes conflicting statements ... the decision whether to grant a challenge for cause is within the discretion of the trial judge, who has the ability to look into the eyes of the juror in question, and to consider her responses in the context of the courtroom, and then determine whether serious doubts exist about the juror\u2019s ability to be impartial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-6\"><em>Crosley, </em>\u00b6 35 (citation omitted). M.R. expressly confirmed her ability to judge the evidence fairly and afford Cudd the fair trial to which he was entitled. These views were declared by M.R. in her initial responses. <em>See Jay, </em>\u00b6 19 (\u201cA prospective juror\u2019s \u2018spontaneous statements\u2019 are given more weight than \u2018coaxed recantations\u2019 elicited by counsel....\u201d). We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the challenge for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">\u00b616 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b245-8\">JUSTICES COTTER, BAKER, WHEAT and McKINNON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b242-15\"> We have also explained that \u201cjurors should be disqualified based on their prejudices only where they have \u2018form[ed] fixed opinions o[f] the guilt or innocence of the defendant which they would not be able to lay aside and render a verdict based solely on the evidence presented in court.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Falls Down, </em>2003 MT 300, \u00b6 23, 318 Mont. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>219, 79 P.3d 797 (citations omitted). The \u201cfixed opinion\u201d principle is only one basis on which prejudice maybe established under \u00a7 46-16-115(2)(j), MCA. <em>Johnson, </em>U 10 (citation omitted). Cudd does not argue here that M.R. held a \u201cfixed opinion\u201d of his guilt and, therefore, we do not address this principle.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
