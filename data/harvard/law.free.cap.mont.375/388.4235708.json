Drew appeals the District Court\u2019s Order Adopting Petitioner\u2019s Motion to Amend Parenting Plan, which limits his custody over their child, K.B.W. The following issue is presented for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">\u00b62 <em>Did the District Court err by entering a final parenting plan without holding a </em>hearing?</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">\u00b63 We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b413-12\">\u00b64 Drew and Jennifer were married on March 24,2001. They had one child from their marriage, KB.W. Another child from Jennifer\u2019s previous marriage, E.L.M., also resided with Drew and Jennifer. Jennifer petitioned for the dissolution of the marriage on May 31, 2011. On October 28, 2011, the District Court held a hearing in the matter and outlined an interim schedule for the parenting and custody of the children while Drew procured a permanent residence in the area. After Drew obtained permanent housing in the area, the parties continued to operate under the same schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-13\">\u00b65 On January 18,2013, Jennifer filed a Motion to Modify Parenting Plan, requesting that Drew\u2019s parenting time be dramatically reduced, allegedly to reflect the amount of time that Drew was spending with the children. Drew\u2019s response argued for a parenting plan wherein the children resided primarily with him. On March 20, 2013, the District Court ordered the parties to attend mediation on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>\u00b66 Drew was mailed a letter notifying him of the date of the mediation. However, Drew was purportedly incapacitated by medication that he was receiving for a shoulder injury and did not pick up his mail. Drew did not attend the mediation and when his lawyer called he did not answer his phone. The District Court then entered an order amending the parenting plan on May 22,2013. The only reason the court provided for issuing the order was Drew\u2019s failure to appear at the mediation. Drew then filed a motion pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(4) seeking relief from that order. The District Court failed to rule on the motion within the 60-day period prescribed by M. R. Civ. P. 60(c)(1), and it was consequently denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">\u00b67 Where a movant seeks relief under subsection (4) of Rule 60(b), the standard of review is de novo, since the determination that a judgment is or is not void is a conclusion of law. <em>Essex Ins. Co. v. Moose\u2019s Saloon, Inc., </em>2007 MT 202, \u00b6 16, 338 Mont. 423, 166 P.3d 451 (citing <em>Export Group v. Reef Indus., Inc., </em>54 F.3d 1466, 1469 (9th Cir. 1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">\u00b68  In deciding the parenting of the child, a district court must \u201cdetermine the parenting plan in accordance with the best interest of the child.\u201d Section 40-4-212(1), MCA. The court must consider all relevant parenting factors in determining whether parenting time is in the child\u2019s best interest. Section 40-4-212(1), MCA. We require that the district court make findings of fact sufficient for this Court to determine whether the court considered the statutory factors and made its ruling on the basis of the child\u2019s best interest. <em>Woerner v. Woerner, </em>2014 MT 134, \u00b6 15, 375 Mont. 153, 325 P.3d 1244 (citing <em>Jacobsen v. Thomas, </em>2006 MT 212, \u00b6 16, 333 Mont. 323, 142 P.3d 859). This requirement finds its roots in \u00a7 40-4-219(1), MCA, which provides that a District Court \u201cmay in its discretion amend a prior parenting plan <em>if it finds, upon the basis of facts ... </em>that the amendment is necessary to serve the best interest of the child.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"AW-\">\u00b69 The District Court here gave but one reason for its amendment of the parenting plan: \u201cPetitioner and her counsel were present [for the mediation]. Respondent\u2019s counsel was present but the Respondent did not appear. Attempts by Respondent\u2019s counsel to contact the Respondent were unsuccessful.\u201d The court issued no corresponding findings of fact or conclusions of law, and critically, the court made no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>mention of the best interest of the child. Accordingly, we cannot determine whether the court considered the child\u2019s best interest in making its ruling. The only conclusion we can draw from the court\u2019s order is that Drew\u2019s absence at the mediation was the determinative factor in amending the parenting plan. There is no support in the law for reliance on this factor alone in amending a parenting plan. The District Court\u2019s order ran awry of the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 40-4-212(1), 219(1), MCA, and is therefore contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">\u00b610  Jennifer argues that Drew\u2019s absence at mediation should be treated as a default judgment. Jennifer relies on our holding in <em>Caplis v. Caplis, </em>2004 MT 145, \u00b6\u00b6 16, 24, 321 Mont. 450, 91 P.3d 1282 that \u201cdefault judgments are proper upon facts establishing careless conduct or willful ignorance\u201d toward the legal proceeding. Default judgments are appropriate when a party against whom judgment is sought has failed to plead or otherwise defend. M. R. Civ. P. 55(a). Jennifer cites no legal authority treating parenting-time mediation as part of a party\u2019s pleading or defense, and we can find no precedent supporting such an application. This is because default judgments in parenting dissolutions are particularly repugnant to the idea that the court should protect the best interest of the child and that both parents should be involved with the child. Further, <em>Caplis </em>is easily distinguishable as it concerned a civil suit between officers and shareholders in a corporation, rather than a parenting plan tailored to serve the best interest of the child. We therefore decline to allow for default judgments in a parenting plan proceeding solely on the basis of a party\u2019s absence at mediation.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">\u00b611  A party is entitled to relief from a judgment under M. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(4) when the judgment is void. \u201cA judgment is void only if the court which rendered it lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter or of the parties, or if it acted in a manner inconsistent with due process of law.\u201d <em>Greater Missoula Area Fedn. Of Early Childhood Educators v. Child Start, Inc., </em>2009 MT 362, \u00b6 21, 353 Mont. 201, 219 P.3d 881 (quoting <em>O\u2019Rourke Bros., Inc. v. Nesbitt Burns, Inc., </em>201 F.3d 948, 951 (7th Cir. 2000)). A natural parent\u2019s right to the care and custody of his or her child is a fundamental liberty interest that must be protected by fundamentally fair procedures. <em>Steab v. Luna, </em>2010 MT 125, \u00b6 22, 356 Mont. 372, 233 P.3d 351 (citations and quotations omitted). \u201c[I]f a permanent change in custody appears to the court to be necessary then due process requires that an application be made for that purpose and proper notice of such application be given.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Shelhamer, </em>159 Mont. 11, 15, 494 P.2d 928, 930 (1972). The procedure for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>amending parenting plans is clearly established by statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-5\">The court shall deny the [motion to amend a parenting plan] unless it finds that adequate cause for hearing the motion is established by the affidavits, <em>based on the best interests of the child, </em>in which case <em>it shall set a date for a hearing on an order to show cause </em>why the requested plan or amendment should not be granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Section 40-4-220(1), MCA (emphasis added). In this case, the court did not issue findings concerning the best interests of the child, nor did it hold a hearing for Drew to show cause why the amendment should not be granted. We find no evidence in the court\u2019s order or the record showing that Drew was afforded any process of law, much less due process. Accordingly, the judgment is void as a matter of law and Drew is entitled to relief from that judgment under M. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"Ad7\">\u00b612 As a final matter, Jennifer argues that the original parentingplan was only an interim parenting plan, and that \u00a7 40-4-220, MCA, \u201conly applies when a party is seeking an interim parenting plan or an amendment of a final parenting plan, neither of which occurred in this matter.\u201d Whether the District Court was making a new interim plan, creating a final parenting plan, amending an interim plan, or amending a final plan, one thing is clear; the court made no findings concerning the best interest of the child in coming to its conclusion. That consideration is required no matter the permanent status of the parenting plan or motion for amendment. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 40-4-212,-213(1), -220(1), -234(l)-(2), MCA. The failure to hold a hearing in consideration of the best interest of the child is a violation of due process requiring reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">\u00b613 The District Court\u2019s Order Adopting Petitioner\u2019s Motion to Amend Parenting Plan and denying Drew\u2019s 60(b)(4) motion is reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b416-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES SHEA, McKINNON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
