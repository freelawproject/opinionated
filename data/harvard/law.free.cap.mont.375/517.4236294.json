(San Diego) has petitioned this Court to exercise supervisory control in relation to a proceeding pending before the Ninth Judicial District Court, Toole County, denominated <em>NaturEner USA, LLC v. San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co., </em>Cause No. DV-13076. San Diego requests that this Court determine that the District Court is proceeding under a mistake of law based on its April 28, 2014 Order denying San Diego\u2019s Motion to Dismiss or Stay. We grant the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">\u00b62 The underlying action arose as the result of a contractual dispute between San Diego and several NaturEner wind-energy companies (collectively, NaturEner). San Diego is a California utility, and NaturEner is a group of Delaware limited liability companies headquartered in California. In January 2012, San Diego and NaturEner entered into two contracts. The first is an agreement (Purchase Agreement) for San Diego to purchase renewable energy credits and electricity from NaturEner. The credits and electricity are generated at the Rim Rock wind farm in Glacier and Toole counties, Montana. The Purchase Agreement contains the following clauses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASB\">This Agreement and the rights and duties of the Parties hereunder shall be governed by and construed, enforced and performed in accordance with the laws of the state of California, without regard to principles of conflicts of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-7\">THE PARTIES HEREBY CONSENT TO CONDUCT ALL DISPUTE RESOLUTION, JUDICIAL ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS ARISING DIRECTLY, INDIRECTLY OR OTHERWISE IN CONJUNCTION WITH, OUT OF, RELATED TO OR ARISING FROM THIS AGREEMENT IN THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">(Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">\u00b63 The second contract (Contribution Agreement) requires San Diego to invest approximately $285 million to acquire an equity interest in the Rim Rock wind farm. The Contribution Agreement contains a clause specifying that New York law applies in the event of a dispute, and that \u201cTHE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMIT TO THE NON EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT IN NEW YORK COUNTY, NEW YORK ... .\u201d (Emphasis in original.) In both the Purchase Agreement and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>Contribution Agreement, the parties also agreed to certain \u201cAvian Conditions\u201d for the protection of birds and bats that might be harmed through operation of the wind farm. The parties later amended the Contribution Agreement through a separate \u201cAvian Conditions Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">\u00b64 On December 19, 2013, San Diego filed suit in California's San Diego Superior Court, seeking a declaration that NaturEner had not satisfied the \u201cAvian Conditions\u201d of the agreements. The next day, NaturEner filed a nearly identical suit in Montana\u2019s Ninth Judicial District Court, seeking a declaration that it had satisfied the \u201cAvian Conditions,\u201d and alleging breach of the Contribution Agreement and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. San Diego filed a Motion to Dismiss or Stay, which the District Court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">\u00b65 San Diego then petitioned this Court for a writ of supervisory control, or in the alternative, a writ of review. This Court subsequently ordered that a response be filed by NaturEner, which has been filed. The issue raised in San Diego\u2019s petition is whether the District Court erred as a matter of law by accepting jurisdiction over the parties\u2019 dispute in light of the forum selection clause contained in the Purchase Agreement, as well as <em>forum non conveniens </em>and principles of comity.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">\u00b66 This Court \u201chas general supervisory control over all other courts.\u201d Mont. Const, art. VII, \u00a7 2(2). However, \u201cSupervisory control is an extraordinary remedy, reserved for extraordinary circumstances.\u201d <em>Stokes v. Mont. Thirteenth Jud. Dist. Ct., </em>2011 MT 182, \u00b6 5, 361 Mont. 279, 259 P.3d 754 <em>(citing Hegwood v. Mont. Fourth Jud. Dist. Ct., </em>2003 MT 200, \u00b6 6, 317 Mont. 30, 75 P.3d 308). Acceptance of supervisory control is decided on a case-by-case basis and is \u201climited to cases involving purely legal questions, in which the district court is proceeding under a mistake of law causing a gross injustice or constitutional issues of statewide importance are involved.\u201d <em>Stokes, </em>\u00b6 5 (citing M. R. App. P. 14(3)). We may assume supervisory control to direct the course of litigation if the district court \u201cis proceeding based on a mistake of law, which if uncorrected, would cause significant injustice for which appeal is an inadequate remedy.\u201d <em>Stokes, </em>\u00b6 5 (citing <em>Simms v. Mont. Eighteenth Jud. Dist. Ct., </em>2003 MT 89, \u00b6 18, 315 Mont. 135, 68 P.3d 678).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">\u00b67 We conclude that this case is appropriate for the exercise of supervisory control. The issues raised by San Diego are purely legal, involving questions of contract interpretation and judicial expediency. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Requiring an appeal from final judgment could result in inconsistent judgments from multiple states\u2019 courts, protracted and redundant litigation, and undue burden on state resources. We have previously explained that promoting judicial economy and avoiding procedural entanglements are adequate grounds for this Court to issue a writ of supervisory control. <em>Truman v. Mont. Eleventh Jud. Dist. Ct., </em>2003 MT 91, \u00b6 15, 315 Mont. 165, 68 P.3d 654 (citation omitted). Therefore, we will address the issues raised in San Diego\u2019s petition that we conclude are dispositive \u2014 the nature of the forum selection clause contained in the Purchase Agreement and <em>forum non conveniens.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">A. Choice of Law Provision</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">\u00b68 \u201cWhere a contract contains both a choice of law clause and a forum selection clause, we first determine whether the choice of law clause is valid.\u201d <em>Polzin v. Appleway Equip. Leasing, </em>Inc., 2008 MT 300, \u00b6 13, 345 Mont. 508, 191 P.3d 476 (citation omitted). We rely on the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws, \u00a7\u00a7 6, 187-88 (1971) in making this determination. <em>Polzin, </em>\u00b6 14. A contractual choice of law clause is valid unless three factors can be established: \u201c(1) but for the choice of law provision, Montana law would apply under \u00a7 188 of the <em>Restatement', </em>(2) Montana has a materially greater interest in the particular issue than the parties [sic] chosen state; and (3) application of the chosen state\u2019s law would contravene a Montana fundamental policy.\u201d <em>Polzin, </em>\u00b6 14 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">\u00b69  The Purchase Agreement states that California law governs the rights and duties of the parties in this case. Neither San Diego nor NaturEner dispute the validity of the choice of law clause. We likewise see no reason that application of California law would contravene Montana\u2019s fundamental policy, regardless of the outcome of an analysis under factors (1) and (2). Accordingly, we accept the choice of law clause as valid and apply California law in interpreting the forum selection clause contained in the Purchase Agreement. <em>See Polzin, </em>\u00b6 19 (applying Washington law in determining that the forum selection clause was valid and that Montana venue was inappropriate under the terms of the contract).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">B. Forum Selection Clause</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">\u00b610 In California, forum selection clauses are valid and will be given effect in the court\u2019s discretion and in the absence of a showing that enforcement would be unreasonable. <em>Smith, Valentino &amp; Smith, Inc. v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Cnty., </em>551 P.2d 1206, 1209 (Cal. 1976). To prove that enforcement would be \u201cunreasonable,\u201d \u201c \u2018the party assailing the clause must establish that ... the forum selected would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number><em>unavailable </em>or <em>unable to accomplish substantial justice.' \" Cal-State Bus. Prods. &amp; Servs., Inc. v. Ricoh, </em>16 Cal. Rptr. 2d 417, 425 (Cal. Ct. App. 1993) (citations omitted) (emphasis in original). \u201c[F]orum selection clauses [] \u2018play[] an important role in both national and international commerce\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018as a general rule should be <em>welcomed.\u201977 America Online, Inc. v. Super. Ct., </em>108 Cal. Rptr. 2d 699, 707 (Cal. Ct. App. 2001) (citations omitted). \u201c[B]oth the United States Supreme Court and the California Supreme Court have placed a heavy burden on a [party] seeking to defeat such a clause <em>...\u201d Lu v. Dryclean-U.S.A. of Cal., Inc., </em>14 Cal. Rptr. 2d 906, 907 (Cal. Ct. App. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"AYM\">\u00b611 California courts construe forum selection clauses as either mandatory or permissive. Clauses containing \u201clanguage of exclusivity\u201d are held to be mandatory, while clauses that merely provide for submission to jurisdiction in a particular forum without requiring it are held to be permissive. <em>Animal Film, LLC v. D.E.J. Prods., Inc., </em>123 Cal. Rptr. 3d 72, 76-77 (Cal. Ct. App. 2011). To qualify as mandatory, \u201cthe language within a forum selection clause must be clear and unambiguous in designating a forum as exclusive and mandatory.\u201d <em>CQL Original Prods., Inc. v. Natl. Hockey League Players\u2019 Assn., </em>46 Cal. Rptr. 2d 412, 418-19 (Cal. Ct. App. 1995); <em>Hunt v. Super. Ct., </em>97 Cal. Rptr. 2d 215, 219 fn.5 (Cal. Ct. App. 2000). California courts rely on the reasoning of federal courts when interpreting forum selection clauses, as do the parties in this case. <em>See e.g. Smith, Valentino &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>551 P.2d at 1208-09; <em>Net2phone, Inc. v. Super. Ct., </em>135 Cal. Rptr. 2d 149, 152 (Cal. Ct. App. 2003); <em>Olinick v. BMG Ent., </em>42 Cal. Rptr. 3d 268, 279-80 (Cal. Ct. App. 2006); <em>Cal-State Bus. Prods. &amp; Servs., Inc., </em>16 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 424-26. California federal law states that \u201c[a] clause that specifies a venue with mandatory language will be enforced.\u201d <em>BrowserCam Inc. v. Gomez, Inc., </em>2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 82159 at *3 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 26, 2008). \u201c[Mandatory forum selection clauses contain language such as \u2018exclusive\u2019 or \u2018only,\u2019 [but] permissive clauses do not preclude the action from being litigated in another court.\u201d <em>Softwareworks Group, Inc. v. IHosting, Inc., </em>2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75989 at *7 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 4, 2006) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">\u00b612 In the present case, the District Court determined that the forum selection clause contained in the Purchase Agreement is permissive and does not require the parties to litigate in California. San Diego argues that this was error and that the forum selection clause is mandatory. San Diego focuses heavily on the use of the words \u201cconduct all.\u201d Such language, it maintains, establishes that \u201c[t]he parties consented to the place of litigation, not simply to a court\u2019s jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>....\u201d In support, San Diego cites <em>Paster v. Putney Student Travel, Inc., </em>1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9194 (C.D. Cal. June 7, 1999). There, the forum selection clause provided: \u201c T agree and consent to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Vermont, with venue in Windham County, Vermont or the United States District Court for the District of Vermont, for the resolution of all legal matters concerning this agreement....\u2019 \u201d <em>Paster, </em>1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9194 at <em>*2. </em>The court determined that common rules of contract interpretation required it to enforce the forum selection clause as mandatory. The court focused exclusively on the terms \u201cthe resolution of all legal matters\u201d in reaching this conclusion. <em>Paster, </em>1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9194 at **9-10.</p>\n<p id=\"APV\">\u00b613 San Diego also analogizes to the following cases, which either interpreted their respective forum selection clauses as mandatory or indicated that they would have been enforced as mandatory absent other procedural issues: <em>Marvin Kommel Prods. v. Lettergraphics Intl., Inc., </em>1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22892 at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 10, 1984) (\u201c\u2018Any and all suits for any and every breach of this Agreement must, at the sole option of Licensor, be instituted and maintained in any court of competent jurisdiction in the State of California, it being understood and agreed that the venue of such suit shall be in Los Angeles County, State of California.\u2019 \u201d); <em>Chandler Mgmt. Corp. v. First Specialty Ins. Corp., </em>2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13417 at *3 (N.D. Tex. Jan. 31, 2013) (\u201c \u2018The parties irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of the State of New York, and to the extent permitted by law the parties expressly waive all rights to challenge or otherwise limit such jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d); and <em>Zeneca, Inc. v. Monsanto Co., </em>1996 Del. Ch. LEXIS 29 at *4 (Del. Ch. Mar. 7, 1996) (\u201c \u2018MONSANTO hereby agree that any suit to enforce or compel the performance of any provision of this Agreement, [or] to obtain a remedy for any breach or violation of this Agreement... shall be brought in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">\u00b614 The following forum selection clauses have also been held to be mandatory by California courts: <em>Cal-State Bus. Prods. &amp; Servs., Inc., </em>16 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 420 fn.4 (\u201c \u2018[A]ny appropriate state or federal district court located in the Borough of Manhattan, New York City, New York shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any case of controversy arising under or in connection with this Agreement... .\u2019 \u201d); <em>Furda v. Super. Ct., </em>207 Cal. Rptr. 646, 648 fn.1 (Cal. Ct. App. 1984) (\u201c \u2018Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement ... shall be litigated either in a state court for Ingham County, Michigan, or in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan.\u2019 \u201d); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number><em>Lu, </em>14 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 907 (\u201c \u2018[A]ny and all litigation that may arise as a result of this Agreement shall be litigated in Dade County, Florida.\u2019 \u201d); <em>CQL Original Prods., Inc., </em>46 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 414 (\u201c \u2018[A]ny claims arising hereunder shall, at the Licensor\u2019s election, be prosecuted in the appropriate court of Ontario.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">\u00b615 NaturEner maintains that the forum selection clause contained in the Purchase Agreement is permissive. NaturEner argues that \u201c[t]he word \u2018consent\u2019 connotes \u2018acquiescence\u2019 ... and lacks the compulsory connotation of a word like \u2018shall.\u2019 \u201d NaturEner and the District Court in its Order cite several cases as examples of forum selection clauses that have been held to be permissive. In <em>BrowserCam Inc., </em>2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 82159 at **3-4, the forum selection clause provided: \u201c \u2018Each party hereby agrees to jurisdiction and venue in the courts of the City of New York or the federal courts sitting therein, for all disputes and litigation arising under or relating to this Agreement ... .\u2019 \u201d The court explained that because this clause did not contain language expressly designating New York as the exclusive venue, it was not mandatory and was merely offering consent to the jurisdiction of New York courts. Put another way, the \u201cclause plainly means that \u2018all disputes\u2019 <em>could </em>be litigated in a New York court, not that they <em>must </em>be.\u201d <em>BrowserCam Inc., </em>2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 82159 at *5 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">\u00b616 Similarly, in <em>Softwareworks Group, Inc., </em>2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75989 at **3-4, the forum selection clause provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-6\">\u201cEach of the parties to this Note consents to the jurisdiction and venue of the courts of the state of New Jersey and the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey... with respect to any action relating to a claim, dispute or controversy arising out of or in connection with this Note....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">The court determined that this type of language \u201cindicates consent to jurisdiction and venue in New Jersey, but does not mandate such jurisdiction and venue.\u201d <em>Softwareworks Group, Inc., </em>2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75989 at * 8. The following forum selection clauses have likewise been held to be permissive by California courts: <em>Animal Film, LLC, </em>123 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 75 (\u201c \u2018THE PARTIES HERETO SUBMIT AND CONSENT TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE COURTS PRESENT IN THE STATE OF TEXAS IN ANY ACTION BROUGHT TO ENFORCE (OR OTHERWISE RELATING TO) THIS AGREEMENT.\u2019 \u201d) (emphasis in original); <em>Hunt Wesson Foods, Inc. v. Sup. Oil Co., </em>817 F.2d 75, 76 (9th Cir. 1987) (\u201c The coruts of California, County of Orange, shall have jurisdiction over the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>in any action at law relating to the subject matter or the interpretation of this contract.\u2019 \u201d); and <em>Berg v. Mtc Elecs. Techs. Co., </em>71 Cal. Rptr. 2d 523, 527 (Cal. Ct. App. 1998) (\u201c \u2018The company [MTC] has expressly submitted to the jurisdiction of the State of California and United States Federal courts sitting in the City of Los Angeles, California, for the purpose of any suit, action or proceedings arising out of this Offering.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">\u00b617  We conclude that the preceding authority establishes that the forum selection clause contained in the Purchase Agreement is mandatory in nature.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> NaturEner and the District Court incorrectly focus their respective analyses on the word \u201cconsent.\u201d While they accurately conclude that clauses that merely consent to the jurisdiction of a particular court or courts are permissive, the forum selection clauses at issue in the cases cited by NaturEner and the District Court are readily distinguishable from the present one. Those cases all involved instances where the parties simply agreed that a particular court or courts would <em>have jurisdiction </em>over any or all disputes arising under a contract. In construing those provisions, the respective California courts were quick to point out that authorizing a particular court or courts to exercise jurisdiction is not the same as agreeing that no other court may exercise jurisdiction. Therefore, the possibility of litigating in other courts has not been foreclosed. This analysis makes sense because, as a practical matter, it is entirely possible for multiple courts to have the authority (jurisdiction) to hear any and all potential disputes that might arise under a contract. A permissive consent to jurisdiction clause, as construed by California courts, simply designates one or more of these courts explicitly without barring other possibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">\u00b6 18 In contrast, as San Diego notes, the present forum selection clause utilizes the phrase \u201cconduct all.\u201d This \u201cconduct all\u201d language is analogous in effect to the language that California courts have held to be mandatory, e.g. \u201c[a]ny and all suits ... must... be instituted\u201d and \u201c[a]ny controversy ... shall be litigated.\u201d Like the words \u201cinstitute[]\u201d and \u201clitigateD,\u201d \u201cconduct\u201d is a verb that relates to the taking of a definite action. The forum selection clause specifies that \u201call\u201d such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>action is to be taken in San Diego. Certainly, the clause does not use the words \u201cshall\u201d or \u201cmust,\u201d but it strains logic to its breaking point to argue that one could agree to \u201cconduct all\u201d litigation in San Diego but at the same time conduct it elsewhere. Although the clause contains the term \u201cconsent,\u201d it is not drafted as a consent to jurisdiction clause. It is in the nature of a promise to litigate all disputes in a particular forum, as opposed to simply authorizing a particular court or courts to hear a dispute. Under a plain reading, the phrase \u201cconduct all\u201d specifically limits the parties\u2019 litigation activities to a single forum (mandatory), and does not merely state that one court, among many, may exercise jurisdiction (permissive).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">\u00b619 On the other hand, the forum selection clause contained in the Contribution Agreement (\u201cTHE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMIT TO THE NON EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT IN NEW YORK COUNTY, NEW YORK....\u201d) is permissive. By submitting to the non-exclusive <em>jurisdiction </em>of any New York County court, the parties have authorized such courts to exercise jurisdiction but have not foreclosed the possibility of litigating elsewhere. NaturEner urges us to read this forum selection clause in conjunction with the forum selection clause contained in the Purchase Agreement to conclude that both are permissive. NaturEner argues that pursuant to Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 1642, \u201c[w]here, as here, \u2018[sjeveral contracts relat[e] to the same matters,\u2019 are \u2018between the same parties,\u2019 and address \u2018substantially one transaction,\u2019 they are \u2018to be taken together.\u2019 \u201d Therefore, according to NaturEner, these provisions \u201cmust be harmonized, rather than interpreted in a way that \u2018render[s] some meaningless,\u2019 \u201d citing <em>Zalkind v. Ceradyne, Inc., </em>124 Cal. Rptr. 3d 105, 116 (Cal. Ct. App. 2011); <em>accord </em>\u00a7\u00a7 28-3-202, -203, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">\u00b620 While NaturEner accurately cites one of California\u2019s canons of contract interpretation, it does not apply here. The Purchase Agreement and the Contribution Agreement were specifically drafted to contain separate choice of law clauses (California vs. New York) and separate forum selection clauses (San Diego vs. New York County). The rules of contract interpretation require courts to give effect to the mutual intentions of the parties, based, if possible, solely on the provisions of the contract. <em>Waller v. Truck Ins. Exch., Inc., </em>900 P.2d 619, 627 (Cal. 1995). Indeed, \u201c[t]he language of a contract is to govern its interpretation, if the language is clear and explicit, and does not involve an absurdity.\u201d Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 1638. Under the Purchase Agreement, San Diego and NaturEner agreed to <em>conduct all </em>litigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>in California. We will not interpret this mandatory clause as permissive based on wholly distinct language contained in the Contribution Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">\u00b621 Lastly on this point, NaturEner asks us to find that a mandatory forum selection clause violates Montana\u2019s public policy and that San Diego waived its venue challenge by failing to raise it in its first appearance. We find neither of these arguments persuasive under the facts of this case and hold that the Purchase Agreement must be litigated in the San Diego Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">C. <em>Forum Non Conveniens</em></p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">\u00b622 <em>Forum non conveniens </em>is a common law doctrine that \u201callows a court to \u2018resist imposition upon its jurisdiction even when jurisdiction is authorized by the letter of a general venue statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Haug v. Burlington N. R.R., </em>236 Mont. 368, 374, 770 P.2d 517, 521 (1989) (citation omitted). Under this doctrine, a court may decline jurisdiction and dismiss a case \u201cwhen it believes that the action may be more appropriately and justly tried elsewhere.\u201d <em>Haug, </em>236 Mont. at 374, 770 P.2d at 521; <em>Cook v. Soo Line R.R. Co., </em>2008 MT 421, \u00b6 16, 347 Mont. 372, 198 P.3d 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">\u00b623 San Diego argues that the District Court should have dismissed NaturEner\u2019s action based on <em>forum non conveniens </em>for several reasons: witnesses and documents are more readily accessible in California; a Montana lawsuit would unduly burden Montana with a dispute between Californians regarding a California Contract; and California courts are more familiar with the California law governing the Purchase Agreement dispute. NaturEner, on the other hand, contends that the District Court properly concluded that Montana has a substantial interest in this case; Montana courts are fully capable of applying California law; Montana witnesses or a site visit to the Rim Rock wind farm might be necessary; electronic discovery practices make discovery equally efficient in Montana and California; and the dispute could be most expediently resolved in Montana.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Afj\">\u00b624 Having already determined that the forum selection clause contained in the Purchase Agreement is mandatory and must be litigated in California, we believe that the related issues regarding the Contribution Agreement would be \u201cmore appropriately and justly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>tried\u201d there as well. We have recognized that \u00a7 25-2-201(2) and (3), MCA, is closely related to the doctrine of <em>forum, non conveniens, </em>if not an outright codification. <em>State ex rel. Burlington N. R.R. v. Dist. Ct., </em>270 Mont. 146, 153, 155, 891 P.2d 493, 498-99 (1995); <em>Modroo v. Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>2008 MT 275, \u00b6 70, 345 Mont. 262, 191 P.3d 389. Section 25-2-201(3), MCA, provides: \u201cThe court or judge must, on motion, change the place of trial in the following cases: (3) when the convenience of witnesses and the ends of justice would be promoted by the change.\u201d In <em>Nutter v. Permian Corp., </em>224 Mont. 72, 74-75, 727 P.2d 1338, 1340 (1986) we explained that \u201c[t]he possibility of conflicting results, multiple actions, and duplicate trials meets the statutory qualification of Section 25-2-201(3), MCA, for the convenience of witnesses and the promotion of the ends of justice.\u201d Certainly, we have never construed \u00a7 25-2-201(3), MCA, as authorizing a district court to dismiss a case merely because it can be tried more conveniently in another state. <em>Modroo, </em>\u00b6 70. However, the caselaw interpreting that statute is helpful to a <em>forum non conveniens </em>analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"AXV\">\u00b625 Pursuant to <em>Nutter, </em>there is a strong possibility of inconsistent results here if mirror image trials are held in both Montana and California. As we have explained, \u201call matters should be addressed by one court and under one cause number, thus ehminating the prospect of conflicting rulings by two separate courts.\u201d <em>Yellowstone Cnty. v. Drew, </em>2007 MT 130, \u00b6 19, 337 Mont. 346, 160 P.3d 557. Moreover, litigating duplicate actions in separate forums would constitute a substantial waste of time and judicial resources. Both San Diego and NaturEner are headquartered in California. San Diego presented evidence that during the District Court\u2019s evidentiary hearing on the preliminary injunction, all of the parties\u2019 fact witnesses were Californians. San Diego filed suit first in San Diego Superior Court, which is where we have determined the Purchase Agreement must be litigated. Accordingly, we believe it prudent to litigate the related issues concerning the Contribution Agreement there as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">\u00b626  In sum, the circumstances warrant exercise of supervisory control in this case. The Purchase Agreement requires the parties to litigate all disputes, at least as they pertain to that contract, in San Diego. The District Court was proceeding in error to conclude otherwise. The Contribution Agreement involves similar issues and would be \u201cmore appropriately and justly tried\u201d in the same forum to promote judicial expediency and prevent inconsistent judgments. The parties\u2019 remaining arguments regarding comity need not be addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"Ad-q\">\u00b627 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Application for Writ of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>Supervisory Control is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">\u00b628 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the District Court\u2019s Order of April 28, 2014, denying San Diego\u2019s Motion to Dismiss or Stay is VACATED.

The court offered little analysis on this point, and its ruling is not binding in any event.
