We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"AGc\">\u00b62 The issue presented on appeal is whether the District Court erred when it granted Old-Horn\u2019s motion to suppress on the grounds that his statements to police were made involuntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">\u00b63 In 2007, Old-Horn was halfway through a five-year sentence for burglary in the Great Falls Regional Prison. He had a close relationship with his cellmate, Robert Gardner, who was serving a 50-year sentence for deliberate homicide. One night, Old-Horn disclosed to Gardner that he had previously acted as a confidential informant, and said he had been holding on to some information about a \u201cmurder rap.\u201d He offered to provide this information through Gardner, in the hope that Gardner would receive a reduction in his sentence. Gardner contacted a detective in Great Falls and asked to speak with two drug investigators with whom Old-Horn had previously cooperated, saying he had friends who had information about the unsolved murder of Harold Mitchell, Jr. Detective Jay Doyle, the lead investigator on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>Mitchell homicide, made arrangements to meet with Gardner. Gardner requested a reduction in his sentence and immunity from prosecution for his friends, whom he did not identify.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">\u00b64 Doyle discussed Gardner\u2019s request with Lake County Attorney Mitch Young. Young wrote a letter on December 3, 2007, in which he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-6\">After speaking with Detective Doyle, I would agree not to file charges against your sources for any collateral crimes committed by them in the course of this incident. I will not, however, offer immunity for any acts which would constitute accountability for the homicide of Mr. Mitchell. If either of the sources was involved in the homicide, their cooperation with the police would certainly be viewed favorably in any subsequent proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">Doyle sent this letter to Gardner, enclosing a letter of his own in the same envelope. That letter said, \u201cMitch [Young] did agree to give immunity to your friends.\u201d Gardner shared these letters with Old-Horn.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">\u00b65 On April 2, 2008, Old-Horn wrote a letter to Doyle identifying himself as one of Gardner\u2019s witnesses. He said, \u201c[I]f I testify you already promised me immunity and I still have that in writing but would the prosecutor be willing to suspend the rest of my five year sentence?\u201d Old-Horn said he was outside the Mitchell house at the time of the homicide and identified two other individuals responsible for Mitchell\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">\u00b66 Doyle arranged an interview with Old-Horn at the Great Falls Regional Prison on April 14, 2008. Doyle, Young, and Detective Mike Sargeant met with Old-Horn outside the interview room. Doyle and Sargeant then took Old-Horn into the interview room. Doyle told Old-Horn he would need to read him his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and then asked whether Old-Horn had seen the letters sent to Gardner. Old-Horn said he had. Doyle then continued reading Old-Horn his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and Old-Horn signed a waiver. Old-Horn initially told Doyle and Sargeant he was outside the house when the homicide occurred. As the interview progressed, Sargeant told Old-Horn, \u201cOne of the things that you have to understand; even if you... were in the house doesn\u2019t make you a participant.\u201d Old-Horn responded, \u201c[S]o if I seen it happen and I didn\u2019t stop it, then I ain\u2019t got nothing to do with this then, I mean.\u201d Doyle said, \u201cIf you didn\u2019t actively have any active participation in planning that thing out, you know that\u2019s cool. We can work with that.\u201d Old-Horn then admitted he was inside the house and gave a full statement about the events leading to Mitchell\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>\u00b67 Two years later, on April 22, 2010, Young filed an information charging Old-Hom with deliberate homicide under the felony murder rale, \u00a7 45-5-102(l)(b), MCA. The information alleged that Old-Hom aided or abetted an attempted robbery, during the course of which another individual caused Mitchell\u2019s death. Young moved to have OldHom transported to the Lake County Detention Center on or before April 28, 2010, for his initial appearance on the deliberate homicide charge. Old-Hom was told he was being transported for a court hearing, but was not told what the hearing was about.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">\u00b68 Old-Hom, meanwhile, had written another letter to Doyle after learning that the second witness referred to by Gardner had been arrested. On April 28,2010, Doyle and Sargeant met with Old-Hom at the Lake County Detention Center. Sargeant told Old-Hom, \u201cWell, Jay [Doyle] found out that you really needed to get back here, and like I said earlier, he pulled some strings, and you over here [sic]. He listened to what you are saying. It is our information that you want to visit with us about this.\u201d Doyle asked Old-Hom if he was surprised when he received the transport order. Sargeant asked Old-Hom if he had been told why he was there, and Old-Hom said he had not. Sargeant then said, \u201cIt is our understanding that you would like to revisit with some of the facts and circumstances on this case.\u201d Old-Hom said, \u201cMy main concern was, you know [the second witness] and I came forward because, you know, Mitch Young said that we wouldn\u2019t be, that we would have immunity from all this.\u201d Doyle and Sargeant did not immediately respond to Old-Horn\u2019s concerns about the second witness\u2019s arrest, and continued to question him about the Mitchell homicide. Doyle told Old-Horn, \u201cI know that Mitch [Young] has, as far as I know, he\u2019s not changed his mind. I think he talked to you in Great Falls.... Ever since then, it has been the same thing.\u201d Old-Hom was not informed that he had been charged with deliberate homicide until after the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">\u00b69 On December 15,2010, Old-Hom moved to exclude his statements to Doyle and Sargeant on the grounds they were involuntary. He claimed he would not have come forward as a witness, given statements to police, or waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights if he had not been led to believe he had immunity. The District Court denied the motion without an evidentiary hearing, reasoning, \u201cThe \u2018immunity\u2019 letter from the Lake County Attorney expressly excluded any acts which would constitute accountability for the homicide. That is exactly the charge against the Defendant for which he did not receive prosecution immunity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>\u00b610 A jury trial was held beginning on June 20, 2011. Old-Horn testified in his defense and claimed the story he gave to Doyle and Sargeant was fabricated. He was convicted and later sentenced to 100 years in the Montana State Prison. Old-Horn appealed his conviction to this Court, claiming the District Court erred by denying his motion to exclude the statements and failing to hold an evidentiary hearing. On November 7, 2012, this Court remanded with instructions to hold an evidentiary hearing and enter written findings of fact and conclusions of law. The remaining issues raised in the appeal were held in abeyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">\u00b611 The evidentiary hearing was held January 4, 2013. Old-Horn testified that after reading the letters from Young and Doyle, he thought he was promised immunity from prosecution. He said he waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights during the 2008 interview because Doyle asked if he had seen the letters immediately before reading the <em>Miranda </em>warning. Old-Horn said, \u201c[T]he way he talked to me was like, \u2018So you know, everything is all right. I\u2019m going to go ahead and read you your <em>Miranda </em>rights now.\u2019 So I figured, you know, I don\u2019t have nothing to worry about if I\u2019m given immunity.\u201d Old-Horn testified that at the second interview, he still believed he had immunity, in part because two years had passed and he had not, to his knowledge, been charged. Old-Horn testified he would not have given either interview unless he believed he was immune from prosecution. He also said he would not have testified at his trial if the earlier statements had not been admitted as evidence. He repeated his claim that the story was fabricated.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">\u00b612 The District Court vacated the judgment, ordered a new trial, and ordered Old-Horn\u2019s letter to Doyle, the 2008 and 2010 statements, and Old-Horn\u2019s trial testimony excluded from evidence. This Court dismissed the remainder of Old-Horn\u2019s appeal, previously held in abeyance, as moot. Pursuant to \u00a7 46-20-103(2), MCA, the State appealed from the District Court\u2019s order suppressing Old-Horn\u2019s confessions and granting a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">\u00b613 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s decision on a motion to suppress to determine whether its findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether they are correctly applied as a matter of law. <em>State v. Scarborough, </em>2000 MT 301, \u00b6 29, 302 Mont. 350, 14 P.3d 1202. A finding of fact is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the district court misapprehended the effect of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>evidence, or if this Court is definitely and firmly convinced that the district court made a mistake. <em>Scarborough, </em>\u00b6 30. Substantial evidence must be \u201c \u2018more than a mere scintilla of evidence, but may be less than a preponderance of the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Scarborough, </em>\u00b6 30 (quoting <em>Gypsy Highview Gathering Sys., Inc. v. Stokes, </em>221 Mont. 11, 15, 716 P.2d 620, 623 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">\u00b614 The question of whether a defendant has given a confession voluntarily is a factual determination within the province of the district court. <em>State v. Hayworth, </em>1998 MT 158, \u00b6 20, 289 Mont. 433, 964 P.2d 1. The district court has the opportunity to observe the demeanor of witnesses and is in the best position to determine their credibility. <em>State v. Gittens, </em>2008 MT 55, \u00b6 27, 341 Mont. 450, 178 P.3d 91. We will not, on appeal, reweigh the evidence or substitute our evaluation of the evidence for that of the district court. <em>Gittens, </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">\u00b615 <em>Whether the District Court erred when it granted Old-Horn\u2019s motion to suppress on the grounds that his statements to police were made involuntarily.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">\u00b616  The true test of admissibility of a confession is whether it was given \u201c \u2018freely, voluntarily, and without compulsion of any sort.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Allies, </em>186 Mont. 99, 109, 606 P.2d 1043, 1049 (1979) (quoting <em>Wilson v. United States, </em>162 U.S. 613, 623, 16 S. Ct. 895, 899 (1896)). A defendant may move to suppress a confession or admission that was given involuntarily. Section46-13-301, MCA. Theburden then lies with the prosecution to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the confession was voluntary. Section 46-13-301, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">\u00b617  When determining the voluntariness of a confession, the district court must take into account the totality of the circumstances, including the interrogation techniques used by police; the defendant\u2019s age and level of education; the defendant\u2019s prior experience with the criminal justice system; the defendant\u2019s demeanor, coherence, articulation, and capacity to make use of his or her faculties; and whether the defendant was advised of his or her <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>State v. Hoffman, </em>2003 MT 26, \u00b6\u00b6 18-19, 314 Mont. 155, 64 P.3d 1013; <em>State v. Loh, </em>275 Mont. 460, 475-76, 914 P.2d 592, 601-02 (1996). A confession induced by any threat of violence, improper influence, or by any direct or implied promise, however slight, may be involuntary. <em>Hoffman, </em>\u00b6 19; <em>Loh, </em>275 Mont. at 476, 914 P.2d at 602.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">\u00b618 The District Court found Old-Horn wrote the letter to Doyle, waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and gave his 2008 and 2010 statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>under the belief he had been granted immunity from prosecution. The District Court also found Old-Horn\u2019s belief was reasonable. Although the District Court denominated these findings conclusions of law, they address factual matters. Therefore, we treat them as findings of fact, reviewable for clear error. <em>See Wray v. State Compen. Ins. Fund, </em>266 Mont. 219, 222, 879 P.2d 725, 727 (1994); <em>Wheeler v. Carlson Transp., </em>217 Mont. 254, 263, 704 P.2d 49, 54-55 (1985). We hold the District Court\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">\u00b619 Old-Hom testified that after reading the letters from Young and Doyle, he believed he had been promised immunity. The State argues Old-Hom could not reasonably have interpreted the letters to grant him unqualified immunity. Instead, the State claims the letters clearly proposed two alternatives: if Old-Hom was not involved in the homicide, he would not be prosecuted for \u201ccollateral crimes\u201d; or, if he was involved, his cooperation would be \u201cviewed favorably in any subsequent proceedings.\u201d The State\u2019s interpretation of the letters would have required Old-Horn, who was 21 years old and had an eighth-grade education, to discern between \u201ccollateral crimes\u201d and \u201cacts which would constitute accountability.\u201d In the context of a felony murder case, where Old-Hom\u2019s participation in an attempted robbery formed the basis for a deliberate homicide charge, this distinction is not readily apparent even to those trained in the law. It is reasonable that Old-Hom would instead have relied on the explanation given in Doyle\u2019s letter, which stated simply, \u201cMitch [Young] did agree to give immunity to your friends.\u201d This is exactly what Old-Horn testified, saying, \u201cAfter reading the first one, I was a little conflicted but the second one made me believe that I\u2019m okay, that I was good. As long as I came up with the information, that I wouldn\u2019t be prosecuted for this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AHk\">\u00b620 Old-Hom also testified that when he waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights at the beginning of the 2008 interview, he believed he had nothing to worry about because he had been granted immunity. The transcript of the interview supports this testimony. Doyle told Old-Hom he needed to read him his <em>Miranda </em>rights, then stopped and instead asked OldHom whether he had received the letters sent to Gardner. After explaining Gardner\u2019s friends would be \u201ctaken care of\u2019 as long as they were not involved in the homicide, Doyle resumed the <em>Miranda </em>warning. In this context, it was reasonable for Old-Hom to believe he had been granted immunity, and therefore had no need to ask for an attorney or exercise his right to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">\u00b621 The State claims Old-Hom\u2019s initial statements, in which he attempted to distance himself from the homicide, show he understood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>the immunity offer was limited, and therefore did not believe he was immune from prosecution when he gave his full confession. This assertion is undermined by evidence of verbal assurances given to Old-Horn during the 2008 interview. Sargeant explicitly told Old-Horn being in the house would not make him a participant. Old-Horn\u2019s response shows he understood this to mean he would not be prosecuted even if he witnessed the homicide. Doyle echoed Sargeant\u2019s statements, telling Old-Horn that as long as he did not participate in planning the murder, he could \u201cwork with that.\u201d It was only after these assurances were given that Old-Horn gave a full confession. There is substantial evidence showing Old-Horn reasonably believed he would not be prosecuted for his involvement in the homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">\u00b622  Old-Horn testified he still believed he had immunity when he waived his rights at the beginning of the 2010 interview. At the beginning of the interview, Old-Horn stated he did not understand why the second witness had been arrested, because \u201cMitch Young said that we wouldn\u2019t be, that we would have immunity from all this.\u201d Old-Horn was not informed he had already been charged with deliberate homicide, and his belief he had been granted immunity was never contradicted by Doyle and Sargeant. Doyle continued to assure Old-Horn that Young had \u201cnot changed his mind.\u201d Substantial evidence supports the finding that Old-Horn reasonably believed he had been given immunity at the time he gave the 2010 interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">\u00b623 The State argues Old-Horn\u2019s testimony is not credible, because at his trial and in subsequent proceedings, he claimed his confession was fabricated. As we have observed, Old-Horn\u2019s testimony is not the only evidence supporting the District Court\u2019s findings. The letters and interview transcripts are consistent with his testimony and also support the District Court\u2019s findings that Old-Horn reasonably believed he had been granted immunity. Furthermore, the credibility of witnesses is within the province of the District Court, and we will not attempt to reweigh the evidence on appeal. <em>Gittens, </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">\u00b624 The State also argues the District Court incorrectly applied its findings of fact when it concluded that Old-Horn did not voluntarily waive his <em>Miranda </em>rights and that the State failed to meet its burden of proving that Old-Horn\u2019s statements were voluntary. A confession induced by \u201cany direct or implied promises, however slight,\u201d may be involuntary. <em>Hoffman, </em>\u00b6 19; <em>Loh, </em>275 Mont. at 476, 914 P.2d at 602. The District Court found that Old-Hom\u2019s waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and his 2008 and 2010 statements were induced by the promise of immunity. The District Court correctly applied this finding when it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>concluded Old-Horn\u2019s waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights was involuntaiy.</p>\n<p id=\"AANr\">\u00b625 The District Court also found Old-Horn was not told until the end of the 2010 interview that he had already been charged with deliberate homicide. The transcript of the interview shows Doyle and Sargeant carefully and deliberately avoided contradicting Old-Horn\u2019s belief he had been granted immunity byignoring his questions and affirmatively telling him Young had \u201cnot changed his mind.\u201d We will not condone the use of deception to obtain a confession. <em>See State v. Reavley, </em>2003 MT 298, \u00b6 16, 318 Mont. 150, 79 P.3d 270; <em>State v. Phelps, </em>215 Mont. 217, 225, 696 P.2d 447, 452 (1985); <em>Allies, </em>186 Mont. at 113, 606 P.2d at 1051.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">\u00b626  Though not specifically addressed by the District Court\u2019s findings, we are also concerned by the manner in which Doyle administered the <em>Miranda </em>warning at the beginning of the 2008 interview. This warning must be meaningful, rather than \u201cmere lip service.\u201d <em>State v. Grimestad, </em>183 Mont. 29, 37, 598 P.2d 198, 203 (1979). When a defendant\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights are downplayed and he is assured that he is not a suspect, the waiver of those rights may be considered involuntary. <em>Grimestad, </em>183 Mont. at 37, 598 P.2d at 203. The <em>Miranda </em>warning given by Doyle was interwoven with explanations and assurances about the immunity offer. Old-Horn testified that Doyle\u2019s reading of the <em>Miranda </em>warning made him feel that everything was all right, and the waiver was simply a formality. Doyle emphasized the immunity offer in a way that downplayed Old-Horn\u2019s rights to remain silent and to be represented by counsel. The District Court correctly concluded that the State failed to meet its burden of proving that Old-Horn\u2019s statements were voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">\u00b627  The State claims the District Corut failed to conduct a fact-intensive inquiry into the totality of the circumstances. A district court\u2019s findings and conclusions need not be exhaustive so long as they dispose of the material issues and provide a sufficiently clear rationale. <em>Williams v. State, </em>2002 MT 189, \u00b6 27, 311 Mont. 108, 53 P.3d 864; <em>In re Mental Health of S.C., </em>2000 MT 370, \u00b6 14, 303 Mont. 444, 15 P.3d 861. The District Court stated in its order that it considered exhibits including the transcripts and recordings of the 2008 and 2010 interviews, as well as the testimony of Doyle and Old-Horn at the evidentiary hearing. The District Court\u2019s order makes specific findings of fact regarding the content of the letters written by Young, Doyle, and Old-Horn; the fact that Old-Horn waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights; the fact that Doyle and Sargeant failed to inform Old-Horn of charges against him during the 2010 interview; and Old-Horn\u2019s testimony that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>he believed he had been promised immunity. The District Court clearly reasoned that the letters led Old-Horn to believe he had been granted immunity; Old-Horn waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights believing he had been granted immunity; this belief was furthered by the failure to inform Old-Horn of charges against him; and his confessions were, as a result, involuntary. The District Court considered the totality of the circumstances and provided a sufficiently clear rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">\u00b628 Finally, the State asks this Court to address the remaining issues raised by Old-Horn in his direct appeal, previously held in abeyance and then dismissed as moot after the District Court ordered a new trial. Because we affirm the order of the District Court, we decline the State\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">\u00b629 For the reasons stated above, the order of the District Court granting Old-Horn a new trial and suppressing his letter to Doyle, his 2008 and 2010 statements, and his trial testimony is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b343-6\">JUSTICES WHEAT, McKINNON, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
