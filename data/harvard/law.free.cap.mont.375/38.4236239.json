Morrow and Betty Jean Morrow, husband and wife, are the owners of a home on fifty acres of land outside White Sulphur Springs, Montana. The Morrows, who are from South Carolina, built the home in 2006 and planned to spend their retirement there. This case arises from the Morrows\u2019 attempts to secure a modification of their home loan, serviced by Bank of America, through the federal Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-15\">\u00b611 HAMP is intended to help homeowners in default or at immediate risk of default on their home loans by modifying their monthly payments to affordable levels. The program requires participating loan servicers to execute a servicer participation agreement and service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>eligible loans according to a uniform modification process. The process begins with a Trial Period Plan, under which the homeowner makes reduced payments for three months, while the loan servicer verifies income and other eligibility information. At the end of the trial period, if the homeowner has successfully made the trial payments and if eligibility has been verified, the modification is made permanent. At the time relevant to the Morrows\u2019 claims, only loans secured by the borrower\u2019s primary residence were eligible for HAMP.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">\u00b612 The Morrows\u2019 home was financed by Quicken Loans for $291,200.00, secured by a deed of trust. The loan was to be repaid over a fifteen-year term at 4.99% interest, with monthly payments of $2,301.28. The loan was subsequently sold to Countrywide. Bank of America is the successor by merger to Countrywide and BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">\u00b613 In 2009, the Morrows lost most of their anticipated retirement income when the purchaser of two businesses they had owned in South Carolina defaulted on his payments. The Morrows resumed control of one of the businesses and returned to South Carolina to manage it until they could find a new buyer. From February2009until May 2012, they spent most of their time in South Carolina, returning to the Montana property for only six to eight weeks of each year. The Morrows first contacted Bank of America to discuss a modification of their loan in May 2009, beginning a process that would continue for nearly two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">\u00b614 The Morrows remained current on their payments until November 2009. They claim that in October 2009, a Bank of America employee informed them they should intentionally miss the following month\u2019s payment to become eligible for a modification. Bank of America denies its employees would instruct a borrower to intentionally default, and argues that the Morrows defaulted because they could not afford their payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">\u00b615 On December 8, 2009, the Morrows spoke with Sunil Kumar, a Bank of America representative from Hyderabad, India, who identified himself as \u201cBrian.\u201d According to the Morrows, Kumar told them they were \u201clocked\u201d for a modification with trial payments of $1,239.99. Kumar explained to the Morrows they would be required to make the trial payments for three to four months. At the end of that period, if the Morrows had successfully made the trial payments, the modification would be made permanent. The modification, according to the Morrows, extended the period of the loan from fifteen to forty years and reduced the interest rate from 4.99% to 2%. The Morrows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>believed the modification had been approved, subject to execution of the documents and completion of the trial period. Bank of America claims the Morrows were informed during this conversation that they were only applying for a modification and had not yet been approved. Kumar has no specific recollection of his conversation with the Morrows, but denies he would tell a customer over the phone that they were approved for a modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">\u00b616 The Morrows made their first trial payment of $1,239.99 in December 2009. They also submitted financial documentation including their tax return, bank statement, and employment verification. On February 16,2010, Bank of America sent the Morrows a notice of intent to accelerate indicating their loan was in default. Mr. Morrow claims he called Bank of America on March 2,2010 and spoke with an employee named \u201cRon,\u201d who instructed him to ignore the letter and continue making the reduced payments. Bank of America records indicate that on March 2, 2010, an employee named Rohitash S. Baneijee advised Mr. Morrow that the account was under review. Baneijee also noted that the Morrows intended to pay the trial amount by the end of the month. The Morrows continued to make monthly payments of $1,239.99 until February 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">\u00b617 On March 3,2010, the day after Baneijee informed Mr. Morrow his account was under review, Bank of America issued another notice of intent to accelerate. On March 16, 2010, Bank of America sent a letter to the Morrows acknowledging receipt of the financial information they had submitted in December 2009. The letter, issued over ninety days after the Morrows had sent their financial information to Bank of America, also indicated that \u201creceipt of your documentation starts the review process, which may take up to 45 days to complete.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">\u00b618 On April 22, 2010, Bank of America sent a form letter to the Morrows inviting them to apply for HAMP. The letter stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-8\">Once we receive all of your documents, we will validate your information and check your eligibility. You can expect to hear back from us within 10 business days. If you qualify for the program, you will enter a three month Trial Period Plan where you will make a monthly trial period payment for three months.... You will receive a permanent modification if you successfully make all of your Trial Period Plan payments and you are notified in writing that your modification has been approved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-9\">As long as you comply with the terms of the Trial Period Plan, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>will not start foreclosure proceedings. If foreclosure proceedings have already started, we will not conduct a foreclosure sale as long as you comply with the terms of the Trial Period Plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7x\">According to the Morrows, by the time they received this letter, they had already been making trial payments for at least four months.</p>\n<p id=\"AM\">\u00b619 On May 24, 2010, the Morrows filled out a Request for Modification and Affidavit as required under HAMP. The Morrows certified that the property was owner-occupied and they intended to reside there for the next twelve months. On May 26, 2010, Bank of America sent the Morrows a letter requesting additional documentation. On July 8, 2010, Bank of America sent the Morrows another notice of intent to accelerate. On August 6,2010, the Morrows received another request for additional documentation, and on August 31, 2010, they received another notice of intent to accelerate. The Morrows claim each time they received a notice, they contacted Bank of America, and each time, a Bank of America employee instructed them to ignore the notice and continue making the modified payments.</p>\n<p id=\"AjJ\">\u00b620 In October 2010, the Morrows were informed their modification had been denied due to missing or incomplete paperwork. Mr. Morrow filed a complaint with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Bank of America assigned a liaison, Luke Mai, to handle the Morrows\u2019 account. Mr. Morrow claims that in December 2010, Mai informed him over the phone that the modification had been approved. Mai does not recall his conversations with Mr. Morrow, but claims it is not his standard practice to verbally approve a modification for clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">\u00b621 On January 11, 2011, the Morrows received another letter indicating their modification had been denied. In February 2011, Bank of America rejected the Morrows\u2019 payment of $1,239.99 and scheduled a trustee\u2019s sale of the property. The Morrows\u2019 complaints to Bank of America were assigned to unit manager Jesse Vasquez. On March 23, 2011, Vasquez explained that the modification had been denied because the Morrows appeared to reside in South Carolina, and the Montana property was not their primary residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">\u00b622 The Morrows filed a complaint in the District Court of Lewis and Clark County on May 6, 2011, which was later amended to state the following claims: oral contract established and breached; negligence, negligent misrepresentation, and tortious breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing; fraud; and violation of the Montana Consumer Protection Act (MCPA). Both parties moved for summary judgment, and the District Court granted summary judgment to Bank of America on April 3,2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>\u00b623 The District Court first concluded that the Morrows\u2019 breach of contract claim was barred by the Statute of Frauds, which requires certain contracts to be made in writing. The District Court also rejected the Morrows\u2019 claims of negligence, negligent misrepresentation, and tortious breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, concluding Bank of America owed no duty to the Morrows. The District Court concluded that the Morrows\u2019 claims for fraud and violation of the MCPA were also barred by the Statute of Frauds, because they presented alternative theories of enforcement of the oral agreement to modify the loan. The Morrows appealed to this Court, seeking reversal of the grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">\u00b624 We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same criteria as the district court under M. R. Civ. P. 56(c). <em>Turner v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., </em>2012 MT 213, \u00b6 11, 366 Mont. 285, 291 P.3d 1082. Summary judgment is appropriate where no genuine issues of material fact exist and where the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Clark v. Eagle Sys., </em>279 Mont. 279, 283, 927 P.2d 995, 997 (1996). The moving party must establish there is no genuine factual issue which would entitle the non-moving party to recover. <em>Clark, </em>279 Mont. at 283, 927 P.2d at 997. If the moving party meets this burden, the non-moving party must then present evidence, in affidavits or other sworn testimony, demonstrating a genuine factual issue exists. <em>Yarbro, Ltd. v. Missoula Fed. Credit Union, </em>2002 MT 152, \u00b6\u00b6 9-10, 310 Mont. 346, 50 P.3d 158. All reasonable inferences from the factual record must be drawn in favor of the non-moving party. <em>Clark, </em>279 Mont. at 284, 927 P.2d at 998. Summary judgment is an extreme remedy, which should never take the place of a trial. <em>Clark, </em>279 Mont. at 283, 927 P.2d at 997.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">\u00b625 <em>Issue One: Whether the District Court erred in finding that the Morrows failed to establish the existence of an oral contract for modification of their loan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">\u00b626 A promissory note is a written contract, and may be modified in writing or by an executed oral agreement. Section 28-2-1602, MCA; <em>Nimmick v. Hart, </em>248 Mont. 1, 14, 808 P.2d 481, 490 (1991). An executed oral agreement exists where the obligations of both parties have been fully performed, and nothing remains to be done by either party. <em>Winkel v. Fam. Health Care, P.C., </em>205 Mont. 40, 45, 668 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>208, 210 (1983); Hart <em>v. Billings Pub. Stockyards, </em>157 Mont. 345, 356-57, 486 P.2d 120, 126 (1971); <em>Contl. Oil Co. v. Bell, </em>94 Mont. 123, 134, 21 P.2d 65, 67 (1933). Performance by only one party is not sufficient. <em>See e.g. Contl. Oil Co., </em>94 Mont. at 134, 21 P.2d at 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">\u00b627 The Morrows claim that Bank of America offered to modify their home loan by reducing the interest rate and reamortizing the payments over forty years. The modified terms were never reduced to writing. Therefore, the agreement is enforceable only if it was fully executed, with nothing left to be done by either party. Section 28-2-1602, MCA; <em>Winkel, </em>205 Mont. at 45, 668 P.2d at 210. The oral agreement contemplated that Bank of America would perform by finalizing the modification of the Morrows\u2019 loan and issuing documents reflecting their new repayment status. The Morrows were expected to perform by repaying the loan obligation under the modified terms. Undisputedly, Bank of America has not issued new documents reflecting the permanent modification, and the Morrows have not satisfied their repayment obligation. The oral agreement was not fully executed, and therefore the written contract was not validly modified. Section 28-2-1602, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">\u00b628 Moreover, a mortgage or deed of trust \u201ccan be created, renewed, or extended only by writing, with the formalities required in the case of a grant of real property.\u201d Section 71-1-203, MCA; \u00a7 71-1-305, MCA (deed of trust subject to all laws relating to mortgages). An agreement to extend the time for repayment of a debt secured by a mortgage or deed of trust is within the scope of \u00a7 71-1-203, MCA. <em>See Register Life Ins. Co. v. Kenniston, </em>99 Mont. 191, 193-96, 43 P.2d 251, 252-53 (1935); <em>Hastings v. Wise, </em>89 Mont. 325, 337-40, 297 P. 482, 484-85 (1931); <em>Vitt v. Rogers, </em>81 Mont. 120, 126-30, 262 P. 164, 165-67 (1927); <em>O.M. Corwin Co. v. Brainard, </em>80 Mont. 318, 324-25, 260 P. 706, 708 (1927).</p>\n<p id=\"AZ\">\u00b629 That section, unchanged since its adoption in 1895,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-7\">contemplates the making of a contract assented to by the parties: the delivery by the mortgagor to the mortgagee of the mortgage, or renewal or extension. In order that notice of the existence of the mortgage, or renewal, or extension may be given to subsequent purchasers and mortgagees, the instrument must be filed with the county clerk for record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-8\"><em>O.M. Corwin Co., </em>80 Mont. at 324, 260 P. at 708. This effects the historic purpose of the Statute of Frauds and recording statutes, which serve to \u201c \u2018give security and certainty to titles.\u2019 <em>\u201dHinebauch v. McRae, </em>2011 MT 270, \u00b6 23, 362 Mont. 358, 264 P.3d 1098 (quoting <em>Great Falls Waterworks Co. v. Great N. Ry., </em>21 Mont. 487, 500, 54 P. 963, 967 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>(1898)).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">\u00b630  The Morrows\u2019 original promissory note provided for a repayment period of fifteen years. Mr. Morrow claims that Bank of America offered a modification which would have reamortized the loan over a period of forty years. The Morrows\u2019 deed of trust states that it secures repayment of \u201call renewals, extensions, and modifications of the Note.\u201d It also states that the debt is to be paid in full by May 1, 2023. The purported oral agreement extended the life of the security by twenty-five years, presumably to May 1, 2048. Such an extension must be made in writing, \u201cwith the formalities required in the case of a grant of real property.\u201d Section 71-1-203, MCA. The agreement to extend the debt, and thereby the security for the debt, was neither written nor recorded, and its enforcement would create substantial uncertainty in the land records. We affirm the order of the District Court granting summary judgment to Bank of America on the Morrows\u2019 breach of contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">\u00b631  The Morrows also claim that Bank of America tortiously breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Implied in every contract is a covenant of good faith, which requires \u201chonesty in fact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade.\u201d Section 28-1-211, MCA; <em>Story v. Bozeman, </em>242 Mont. 436, 451, 791 P.2d 767, 776 (1990), <em>overruled in part, Arrowhead Sch. Dist. No. 75 v. Klyap, </em>2003 MT 294, \u00b6 54, 318 Mont. 103, 79 P.3d 250. A claim may be brought for tortious breach of the covenant where a special relationship exists between the parties. <em>Story, </em>242 Mont. at 451, 791 P.2d at 776. The existence of a contract, however, is a prerequisite to a claim for tortious breach of the covenant. <em>Knucklehead Land Co. v. Accutitle, Inc., </em>2007 MT 301, \u00b6 18, 340 Mont. 62, 172 P.3d 116. While an original contract existed between the parties, the Morrows\u2019 claim is not based on this contract, but on the breach of the alleged oral contract to modify their loan. Therefore, we also affirm the order of the District Court granting summary judgment to Bank of America on the Morrows\u2019 claim for tortious breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">\u00b632 <em>Issue Two: Whether the District Court erred in finding that Bank of America owed no common law or fiduciary duty to the Morrows.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Az\">\u00b633 We next address the Morrows\u2019 claims of negligence. A plaintiff in an action for negligence must offer proof of a duty, breach of that duty, causation, and damages. <em>Hatch v. Dept. of Hwys., </em>269 Mont. 188, 192, 887 P.2d 729, 732 (1994). The existence of a duty is a question of law for determination by the court. <em>Fisher v. Swift Transp. Co., </em>2008 MT <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>105, \u00b6 17, 342 Mont. 335, 181 P.3d 601. Once a duty has been established, the breach of that duty is a question of fact to be resolved by a jury. <em>Nelson v. Driscoll, </em>1999 MT 193, \u00b6 40, 295 Mont. 363, 983 P.2d 972 (citing <em>Smith v. Kerns, </em>281 Mont. 114, 117, 931 P.2d 717, 719 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">\u00b634 We recognize at the outset that a bank has no duty to modify or renegotiate a defaulted loan. <em>Mont. Bank, N.A. v. Ralph Meyers &amp; Son, Inc., </em>236 Mont. 236, 244, 769 P.2d 1208, 1213 (1989). Furthermore, \u201c[t]he relationship between a bank and its customer is generally described as that of a debtor and creditor and as such does not give rise to fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d <em>Deist v. Wachholz, </em>208 Mont. 207, 216, 678 P.2d 188, 193 (1984) (internal citation omitted). However, where a bank goes beyond the ordinary role of a lender of money and actively advises customers in the conduct of their affairs, the bank may owe a fiduciary duty. <em>Deist, </em>208 Mont. at 216-17, 678 P.2d at 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">\u00b635 The complexity of modem banking and credit transactions, in particular, may \u201c \u2018thrust a bank into the role of an advisor, thereby creating a relationship of trust and confidence....\u2019 \u201d <em>Deist, </em>208 Mont. at 216, 678 P.2d at 193 (quoting <em>Tokarz v. Frontier Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assn., </em>656 P.2d 1089, 1092 (Wash. App. Div. 3 1982)). A bank owes a fiduciary duty only when it gives advice \u201cother than that common in the usual arms-length debtor/creditor relationship.\u201d <em>Coles Dept. Store v. First Bank, N.A., </em>240 Mont. 226, 229, 783 P.2d 932, 934 (1989). We have found a fiduciary duty where the borrower has relied on the bank\u2019s advice in financial matters over the course of a long and exclusive relationship. <em>Deist, </em>208 Mont. at 217-18, 678 P.2d at 193-94 (finding fiduciary relationship where widow had been advised by bank officer for over twenty years).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">\u00b636 If the borrower has not been advised by the bank or has not relied on that advice, no fiduciary relationship exists. <em>Coles Dept. Store, </em>240 Mont. at 230, 783 P.2d at 934 (no fiduciary duty where decisions about management of department store were made with little, if any, input from bank); <em>Simmons v. Jenkins, </em>230 Mont. 429, 433-34, 750 P.2d 1067, 1070 (1988) (no fiduciary duty where there was no evidence bank ever advised plaintiffs); <em>Pulse v. N. Am. Land Title Co., </em>218 Mont. 275, 283, 707 P.2d 1105, 1110 (1985) (no fiduciary duty where terms of sale were not a product of the bank\u2019s advice). No fiduciary duty arises if the borrower is also advised by others, such as legal counsel. <em>Simmons Oil Corp. v. Holly Corp., </em>258 Mont. 79, 85, 852 P.2d 523, 526 (1993). Even if a fiduciary duty exists, a bank is not obligated to avoid foreclosure. <em>Richland Natl. Bank &amp; Trust v. Swenson, </em>249 Mont. 410, 418, 816 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>1045, 1050 (1991). A bank may also refuse to modify or renegotiate a loan for \u201csolid business reasons.\u201d <em>See Lachenmaier v.

The Morrows contend they relied on this advice when they intentionally defaulted on their mortgage hoping to qualify for a modification. The Morrows were not advised by any other parties when they made this decision. The pattern of active advising alleged by the Morrows continued for over a year, with regular and frequent contacts between the parties. Throughout this period, the Morrows claim Bank of America continued to advise them to pay a reduced amount each month and ignore notices of default. Instructing a borrower not to repay a loan, to pay less than the amount required by the loan documents, or to ignore notices of impending foreclosure and avoid curing a default is not the type of advice \u201ccommon in the usual arms-length debtor/creditor relationship.\u201d <em>Coles Dept. Store, </em>240 Mont. at 229, 783 P.2d at 934. While the Morrows stood at arm\u2019s length to their lender in negotiating the initial loan, once their loan was in default they had little choice but to continue placing their trust in the bank. <em>See Lachenmaier, </em>246 Mont. at 34, 803 P.2d at 619 (no fiduciary relationship where borrower could transfer loans elsewhere). It is unrealistic to say Bank of America and the Morrows continued to hold equal footing throughout the negotiations. <em>See Stone v. Davis, </em>419 N.E.2d 1094, 1098 (Ohio 1981) (\u201cwhile a bank and its customer may be said to stand at arm\u2019s length in negotiating the terms and conditions of a mortgage loan, it is unrealistic to believe that this equality of position carries over into the area of loan processing....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">\u00b638 The recent foreclosure crisis has led to many cases alleging breaches of duty by mortgage servicers, and these cases have not reached uniform results. <em>Compare Ansanelli v.

LEXIS at **21-22. Those courts have found, as we do today, that special circumstances, if proven, could support a fiduciary duty where \u201cDefendant went beyond its conventional role as a loan servicer by soliciting Plaintiffs to apply for a loan modification and by engaging with them for several months....\u201d <em>Crilley v.

Bank &amp; Trust, </em>249 Mont. at 418, 816 P.2d at 1050; <em>Lachenmaier, </em>246 Mont. at 34, 803 P.2d at 619 (citing <em>Tresch, </em>238 Mont. at 515, 778 P.2d at 876). Under the facts alleged, Bank of America owed a duty to manage the modification process in a manner that would not cause the Morrows to suffer loss or injury by reason of its negligence. The Morrows allege that on several occasions, Bank of America said their application would be processed under HAMP. While HAMP does not provide a private right of action and does not itself create a duty of care, reference to its provisions may provide evidence of a breach of an already existing duty. <em>Mackenzie v. Flagstar Bank, FSB, </em>738 F.3d 486, 495-96 (1st Cir. 2013). Drawing all reasonable inferences in the Morrows\u2019 favor, we conclude they may proceed to trial on the theory that Bank of America owed them a fiduciary duty in the processing of their application for a loan modification. Accordingly, we look to the federal guidelines in effect when their loan was under consideration to further define the standards to which Bank of America had to conform its conduct, if the evidence establishes the basis for imposition of such a duty.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>\u00b640 Servicers participating in HAMP \u201cshould provide the borrower with information designed to help them understand the modification terms that are being offered and the modification process.\u201d Introduction of the Home Affordable Modification Program, Supp. Directive 09-01 at *13 (U.S. Treas.

Supp. Directive 09-01 at *15.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">\u00b641 The facts alleged by the Morrows, if proven, would demonstrate that Bank of America failed to provide them with accurate information about the modification process; failed to minimize the confusion and risk associated with the modification; and failed to timely respond and resolve their inquiries and complaints. The Morrows also allege that Bank of America placed the loan in default, rather than in forbearance; failed to determine eligibility within the usual three-month period; and failed to promptly communicate its eligibility decision. The Morrows claim Bank of America\u2019s excessive delays in processing the modification significantly increased the deficiency they owed, making foreclosure all but inevitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">\u00b642  Bank of America contests these factual allegations, claiming it accurately explained to the Morrows the servicing status of their loan; did not initiate foreclosure until after the application for modification had been denied; and was justified in taking several months to process the application because the Morrows\u2019 documentation raised questions about their residency status. Bank of America also denies advising the Morrows to miss a payment or ignore notices of default. It is evident there are genuine issues of material fact regarding the Morrows\u2019 claim for negligence.

The District Court did not address the Morrows\u2019 claim of negligent misrepresentation in its original Order. It then issued an Addendum to that Order, in which it stated, \u201cFor the reasons set forth in the Court\u2019s discussion of the negligence and fraud counts, summary judgment is also granted to Defendants on the claim of negligent misrepresentation.\u201d The District Court failed to address the specific elements of a negligent misrepresentation claim, as distinct from either negligence or fraud. We address those elements here.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">\u00b645 We have adopted the following definition of negligent misrepresentation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-6\">One who, in the course of his business, profession or employment, or in any other transaction in which he has a pecuniary interest, supplies false information for the guidance of others in their business transactions, is subject to liability for pecuniary loss caused to them by their justifiable reliance upon the information, if he fails to exercise reasonable care or competence in obtaining or communicating the information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-7\"><em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 552 (1977); <em>State Bank v.

Since <em>Kitchen Krafters </em>was decided, we have continued to cite both the original language of the Restatement and the <em>Kitchen Krafters </em>elements. <em>Compare Kurtzenacker v. Davis Surveying, Inc., </em>2012 MT 105, \u00b6 25, 365 Mont. 71, 278 P.3d 1002 (citing <em>Kitchen Krafters </em>elements), <em>with W. Sec. Bank v.

We have recognized that negligent misrepresentations may occur outside of this context. <em>Jackson v. Dept. of Fam. Servs., </em>1998 MT 46, \u00b6 36, 287 Mont. 473, 956 P.2d 35 (applying <em>Kitchen Krafters </em>elements of negligent misrepresentation to claims by prospective parents about adoption process). At the same time, we have continued to apply the Restatement definition, particularly in the context of professional negligence. <em>W. Sec. Bank, </em>\u00b6 35 (applying Restatement definition to negligent misrepresentation claims against accountant). We are faced today with defining the appropriate duty of care owed by a bank to its customers, and so we find it necessary to resolve this disparity with respect to banking transactions. We hold that a claim of negligent misrepresentation against a financial institution is governed by the definition in the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 552, which we adopted in <em>State Bank, </em>204 Mont. at 33, 664 P.2d at 301, and <em>Brown, </em>197 Mont. at 12, 640 P.2d at 459-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">\u00b647 The Morrows allege Bank of America made several false statements regarding the servicing of their existing loan and the status of their application for modification: in October 2009, Bank of America told the Morrows they should intentionally default on their payments to be considered for a modification; in December 2009, Sunil Kumar said they were approved for a HAMP modification, which would be finalized subject to the trial payment period; in March 2010, Rohitash S. Banexjee told them to disregard notices of default and impending foreclosure and continue making reduced payments; and in December 2010, Luke Mai said their modification had been approved. Bank of America claims these statements were never made, demonstrating the existence of genuine issues of material fact. Bank of America also insists the Morrows\u2019 modification was never approved, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>instructing a borrower to default is contrary to its policies and procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">\u00b648 The alleged statements were made in the course of Bank of America\u2019s business as a loan servicer for the guidance of the Morrows in their loan transaction. Bank of America argues that the Morrows suffered no pecuniary loss because of its alleged misconduct. The Morrows have asserted losses including lost time from Mr. Morrow\u2019s accounting work, travel expenses, loss of personal lines of credit, and increased costs due to negative credit reporting. The Morrows cannot recover for losses related to credit reporting, because state statutory causes of action premised on damages directly related to a bank\u2019s credit reporting duties are preempted by the Fair Credit Reporting Act. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681t(b)(l)(F) (2006); <em>Feller v. First Interstate Bancsystem, </em>Inc., 2013 MT 90, \u00b6 23, 369 Mont. 444, 299 P.3d 338. The validity of the Morrows\u2019 remaining damages is a question for determination by a finder of fact. <em>See Rohrer v. Knudson, </em>2009 MT 35, \u00b6 32, 349 Mont. 197, 203 P.3d 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">\u00b649 Bank of America also argues the Morrows did not rely on the information it supplied. Bank of America argues the Morrows\u2019 continuing default was simply due to their inability to afford the payments. The Morrows have offered testimony that at the time Bank of America instructed them to default, they had the financial resources available to continue making payments for the immediate future, and therefore defaulted only at Bank of America\u2019s direction. A genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the Morrows\u2019 default was caused by their reliance on Bank of America\u2019s alleged misrepresentations.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">\u00b650 Bank of America further argues that any reliance by the Morrows was not justified, because they knew their modification had not been approved. The Morrows have presented evidence of confusing and directly conflicting communications from Bank of America. These communications informed the Morrows in one instance that their modification was pending and in another that it was approved. They were told by mail their loan was in default, but over the phone that they were in a modification status. In essence, Bank of America claims the Morrows were entitled to rely on one set of statements, but not the other. The conflicting communications issued by Bank of America raise genuine questions of material fact regarding whether the Morrows\u2019 reliance was justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">\u00b651  Finally, the allegations by the Morrows raise questions of fact regarding whether Bank of America \u201cexercise[d] reasonable care or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>competence in obtaining or communicating the information.\u201d <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 552. At the least, the Morrows\u2019 allegations that they received directly conflicting information from Bank of America regarding the status of their loan indicates a lack of reasonable care in communicating the information. The District Court erred in granting summary judgment to Bank of America on the Morrows\u2019 claim of negligent misrepresentation. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">\u00b652 <em>Issue Four: Whether the District Court erred in finding that the Statute of Frauds precluded the Morrows\u2019 claims of actual fraud, constructive fraud, and violations of the Montana Consumer Protection Act.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">\u00b653 The District Court concluded that, because enforcement of the alleged oral contract was precluded by the Statute of Frauds, the same was true of the Morrows\u2019 fraud-related claims. We have held that \u201c[t]he Statute of Frauds applies to liabilities based on contract, and not to theories of liabilities based on fraud or negligent misrepresentation.\u201d <em>Phil-Co Feeds v. First Natl. Bank, </em>238 Mont. 414, 421, 777 P.2d 1306, 1311 (1989). The Statute of Frauds is a bar to the enforcement of certain oral contracts, but it is not a rule of evidence, and it does not preclude admission of evidence of an oral agreement for other purposes. <em>LaBarre v. Shepard, </em>84 F.3d 496, 500 (1st Cir. 1996); <em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts </em>\u00a7 143 (1981) (\u201cThe Statute of Frauds does not make an unenforceable contract inadmissible in evidence for any purpose other than its enforcement in violation of the statute.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"Az4\">\u00b654 As its name suggests, the Statute of Frauds is primarily concerned with the prevention of fraud. <em>Hinebauch, </em>\u00b6 23. The Statute of Frauds cannot \u201c \u2018be used as a shield or cloak to protect fraud, or as an instrument whereby to perpetrate a fraud, or as a vehicle or means of culpable wrong, injustice, or oppression.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Farm Credit Bank v. Dist. Ct., </em>267 Mont. 1, 26-27, 881 P.2d 594, 609 (1994) (quoting 73 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Statute of Frauds </em>\u00a7 562 (1974)). A claim of fraud is therefore not barred by the Statute of Frauds, even if the claim relies on evidence of an oral agreement that would be unenforceable in contract. <em>See Phil-Co Feeds, </em>238 Mont. at 421, 777 P.2d at 1311; 37 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Fraud and Deceit </em>\u00a7 92 (\u201cFalse representations of existing or current facts are actionable even if combined with promises as to future events.\u201d). Nevertheless, a claim of fraud may not serve as an alternative means of enforcing an oral agreement within the Statute of Frauds, because \u201c \u2018the breach of a promise which the law does not regard as binding is not a fraud.\u2019 \u201d <em>Austin v. Cash, </em>274 Mont. 54, 62, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>906 P.2d 669, 674 (1995) (quoting <em>Schwedes v.

Independent of their allegations that Bank of America promised to grant them a modified loan, they also allege Bank of America misrepresented the status of their existing loan and serviced that loan in an unfair and deceptive manner. The District Court erred in concluding that the Statute of Frauds precluded the Morrows\u2019 claims of actual fraud, constructive fraud, and violations of the MCPA. We now address the merits of each of these claims in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">\u00b656 <em>Issue Five: Whether the District Court erred in granting summary judgment to Bank of America on the Morrows\u2019 claim of actual </em>fraud. \u00b657 A party asserting a claim of actual fraud must establish the following elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-6\">(1) a representation; (2) the falsity of that representation; (3) the materiality of the representation; (4) the speaker\u2019s knowledge of the representation\u2019s falsity or ignorance of its truth; (5) the speaker\u2019s intent that the representation should be acted upon by the person and in the manner reasonably contemplated; (6) the hearer\u2019s ignorance of the representation\u2019s falsity; (7) the hearer\u2019s reliance upon the truth of the representation; (8) the hearer\u2019s right to rely upon the representation; and (9) the hearer\u2019s consequent and proximate injury or damages caused by their reliance on the representation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-7\"><em>Franks v.

We have already noted in our discussion of negligent misrepresentation that the Morrows\u2019 allegations raise genuine issues of material fact regarding whether Bank of America made false representations; whether the Morrows knew of the falsity of the representations; whether the Morrows relied on those representations; whether their reliance was justified; and whether they were damaged as a result. <em>Supra </em>\u00b6\u00b6 47-50. As we also noted, it does not appear to be contested that the statements, if made, were intended to guide the Morrows in repaying their loan. <em>Supra </em>\u00b6 48. Under the facts alleged, it is clear the statements were material in that they led directly to the Morrows\u2019 default and subsequent foreclosure proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>\u00b659 The Morrows must also show that Bank of America made the alleged statements with knowledge of their falsity or ignorance of their truth. <em>Franks, </em>\u00b6 17. The Dissent argues that evidence of a fraudulent intent or intent to deceive is required to establish a prima facie case of actual fraud. Dissent, \u00b6 89. Fraud does not require knowledge of the statement\u2019s falsity. <em>Franks, </em>\u00b6 17. The requisite knowledge may also be established where the defendant is ignorant of whether the statement is true. <em>Franks, </em>\u00b6 17. A statement made with \u201creckless disregard for the truth\u201d is sufficient. <em>Brown, </em>197 Mont. at 11, 640 P.2d at 458. The \u201cintent to deceive or dishonesty of purpose\u201d to which our cases have referred pertains to the \u201cfifth element,\u201d which is the defendant\u2019s intent that its statement be relied upon. <em>Town of Geraldine v. Mont. Mun. Ins. Auth., </em>2008 MT 411, \u00b6 28, 347 Mont. 267, 198 P.3d 796. Thus, the Morrows must establish that Bank of America \u201cmade a representation with the \u2018intent it be relied upon\u2019 to satisfy the intent element of a prima facie fraud claim.\u201d <em>W. Sec. Bank, </em>\u00b6 61 <em>(citing Durbin v.

They have also produced evidence of communications regarding Bank of America\u2019s loan servicing policies, which Bank of America says do not accurately represent its policies. This evidence raises genuine issues of material fact regarding whether the representatives who allegedly made these statements did so despite their ignorance of whether the statements were true. The Morrows have stated a prima facie case of fraud, and the factual issues they have raised should now be resolved by a jury. <em>Franks, </em>\u00b6 18. We therefore reverse the order of the District Court granting summary judgment to Bank of America on the Morrows\u2019 claim of actual fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">\u00b661 <em>Issue Six: Whether the District Court erred in granting summary judgment to Bank of America on the Morrows\u2019 claim of constructive fraud.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">\u00b662 Constructive fraud is a breach of duty which, without fraudulent intent, creates an advantage for the breaching party by misleading another person to that person\u2019s prejudice. Section 28-2-406, MCA. The Dissent argues that constructive fraud, as defined by statute, provides only grounds for rescinding a contract. Dissent, \u00b6 95. We find several cases allowing a plaintiff to seek damages for constructive fraud independently of any action to rescind a contract. <em>Mattingly, </em>285 Mont. at 218-20, 947 P.2d at 71-73 (recognizing claim for constructive fraud <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>where no request for rescission was brought); <em>Lee v.

Having provided the Morrows with information about the repayment status of their existing loan, Bank of America had a duty to ensure the information was not misleading. <em>See Deist, </em>208 Mont. at 216, 678 P.2d at 193 (quoting <em>Tokarz, </em>656 P.2d at 1092). Because Bank of America had access to its servicing records that the Morrows did not, it also had a duty to disclose material information about its servicing of the Morrows\u2019 loan. <em>See Deist, </em>208 Mont. at 216, 678 P.2d at 193 (quoting <em>Tokarz, </em>656 P.2d at 1092).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>\u00b665  As noted in our discussion of negligent misrepresentation, the Morrows have alleged Bank of America made several misleading statements regarding the status of their loan and their application for modification. <em>Supra </em>\u00b6 47. The Morrows allege Bank of America gained an advantage as a result of these statements, because the Morrows made payments to the Bank for an additional fourteen months rather than immediately seeking another lender or proceeding with a short sale or foreclosure. The Morrows allege these statements also resulted in prejudice to them, because they defaulted on their loan and allowed the default to grow for months in reliance on the Bank\u2019s representations. Again, Bank of America denies that its representatives made the allegedly misleading statements. Genuine issues of material fact exist regarding the Morrows\u2019 claim of constructive fraud.

The MCPA applies to banks engaged in consumer lending and the collection and servicing of loans. <em>Baird v. Norwest Bank, </em>255 Mont. 317, 328, 843 P.2d 327, 334 (1992).

Section 30-14-133, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">\u00b668 The Morrows claim Bank of America instructed them to default on a loan and make partial payments on that loan, while keeping them in a servicing status that required them to make full payments on that loan. The Morrows claim they were not accurately informed of their servicing status, because Bank of America told them both that they remained in regular servicing and that they were in a modification program. These conflictingrepresentations sometimes occurred within a day or two of one another, only for the cycle to be repeated again the following month. The Morrows were not granted a decision on their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>modification until October 2010, ten months after they had allegedly been told to make reduced payments. They were not informed of the reason for that decision until five months later, in March 2011. The Morrows\u2019 default grew for more than a year, while Bank of America repeatedly told them to ignore it, and while the Morrows made trial payments for fourteen months.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">\u00b669 The allegations stated by the Morrows, if true, would constitute a practice substantially injurious to consumers. <em>See e.g. Wigod v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., </em>673 F.3d 547, 574-75 (7th Cir. 2012) (ineffectual implementation of HAMP sufficient to state claim under Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Businesses Practice Act); <em>Bosque v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., </em>762 F. Supp. 2d 342, 353-54 (D. Mass. 2011) (deceptive representations about eligibility for HAMP sufficient to state claim under Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act). Notably, the Morrows offered an expert report from the former Montana Commissioner of Financial Institutions, who concluded that the pattern and practice of the Bank was unfair, irresponsible, and substandard practice. Bank of America offered no competing expert testimony. The Bank denies it instructed the Morrows to miss a payment or to ignore notices of default, demonstrating the existence of genuine issues of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">\u00b670 Bank of America also argues that the Morrows have failed to show \u201cany ascertainable loss of money or property\u201d as required to state a claim under the MCPA.

What the Morrows primarily want is a court decree that their original mortgage has been modified, pursuant to discussions with Bank of America employees over the telephone, to have an extended term and a lower interest rate. This is not possible, of course, because such agreements must be in writing. Indeed, the Morrows\u2019 attempt to enforce oral communications concerning a mortgage is contrary to fundamental and longstanding principles of contract law, which mandate that agreements relating to real property be in writing. <em>Ducie v. Ford, </em>8 Mont. 233, 237, 19 P. 414, 415 (1888); <em>Hinebauch v. McRae, </em>2011 MT 270, \u00b6 23, 362 Mont. 358, 264 P.3d 1098. It is also contrary to the recording system, which is founded on the principle that interests in real property must be written and duly recorded. Sections 70-21-301,-302, MCA; <em>Earl v. Pavex, Corp., </em>2013 MT 343, \u00b6\u00b6 17-18, 372 Mont. 476, 313 P.3d 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">\u00b673 Hence, the Morrows are left with only the possibility of recovering tort damages arising out of the manner in which Bank of America handled their request for a loan modification. I agree with the Court that the Morrows have alleged facts which, if proved, would establish that Bank of America owed them a fiduciary duty in managing the loan-modification process. I also agree that the Morrows may pursue a claim of negligent misrepresentation as defined in <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 552 (1977). Finally, I agree that the Morrows\u2019 allegations regarding Bank of America\u2019s conduct, if true, would constitute a practice that violates the Montana Consumer Protection Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">\u00b674 Beyond this, however, I do not agree with the Court\u2019s analysis of the Morrows\u2019 fraud claims. While I conclude, as does the Court, that the Morrows may proceed with a claim of actual fraud, I believe our Opinion blurs the distinction between actual fraud and negligent misrepresentation. In my view, it is important in this case that we clarify that distinction. Furthermore, I do not agree with the Court that the Morrows have stated a claim of constructive fraud. Thus, for these reasons, I concur in the Court\u2019s resolution of Issues One, Two, Three, Four, Five, and Seven, but write separately to discuss certain facets of Issues Two, Four, and Five. I dissent as to Issue Six.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>Issue Two - Negligence</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">\u00b675 I agree with the Court\u2019s analysis and conclusion under Issue Two that the District Court erred in granting Bank of America summary judgment on the Morrows\u2019 negligence claim. Since there are genuine issues of material fact regarding this claim, Opinion, \u00b6 42,1 believe it is important to discuss how our decision in <em>Gliko v. Permann, </em>2006 MT 30, 331 Mont. 112, 130 P.3d 155, applies in the present context.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">\u00b676 The relationship between a bank and its customer is generally described as that of debtor and creditor. <em>Deist v. Wachholz, </em>208 Mont. 207, 216, 678 P.2d 188, 193 (1984). As such, a financial institution generally owes no fiduciary duty to a borrower when the institution\u2019s involvement in the loan transaction does not exceed the scope of its conventional role as a mere lender of money. <em>Deist, </em>208 Mont. at 216, 678 P.2d at 193; <em>Lachenmaier v. First Bank Sys., Inc., </em>246 Mont. 26, 33, 803 P.2d 614, 618 (1990). A limited exception to this general rule has been recognized where there is proof of \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d \u2014 as, for example, where a bank is thrust beyond the role of a simple creditor into the role of an advisor, thereby creating a relationship of trust and confidenc<em>eLachenmaier, </em>246 Mont. at 33, 803 P.2d at 618; <em>Deist, </em>208 Mont. at 216-17, 678 P.2d at 193. To establish a fiduciary relationship, the bank must \u201cact as a financial advisor in some capacity, other than that common in the usual arms-length debtor/creditor relationship.\u201d <em>Coles Dept. Store v. First Bank (N.A.)</em>\u2014Billings, 240 Mont. 226, 229, 783 P.2d 932, 934 (1989) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>accord First Sec. Bank v. Abel, </em>2008 MT 161, \u00b6 34, 343 Mont. 313, 184 P.3d 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">\u00b677 In <em>Gliko, </em>the parties disputed whether the existence of a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d giving rise to a fiduciary duty between a bank and its customer is a question of fact or a question of law. We noted that there were precedents supporting both approaches. <em>Gliko, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16-23. After discussing these precedents, we held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-8\">whether a fiduciary duty exists between two parties is a question of law, not fact, and it may be resolved on summary judgment when no genuine issues of material fact remain. Likewise, whether a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d exists between two parties such as would give rise to a fiduciary duty is a question of law, not fact, for the relationship and the duty are two sides of the same coin. To determine the existence or absence of a special relationship in cases where it normally does not exist \u2014 such as between a bank and a customer \u2014 a court may be required to make a fact-intensive inquiry. The circumstances of the particular relationship are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>factual, and disputes over material facts will preclude summary judgment. However, the <em>conclusion </em>drawn by a court from undisputed facts is one of law, not of fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-5\"><em>Gliko, </em>\u00b6 24 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">\u00b678 As clarified in <em>Gliko, </em>therefore, the existence of a special relationship is a question of law that is determined by the court based on the facts of the case. Where the material facts are undisputed, the existence of a special relationship may be resolved on summary judgment. <em>Gliko, </em>\u00b6 16 (citing cases standing for the proposition that, \u201cin the absence of a genuine issue of material fact, the question of the existence of a fiduciary relationship could properly be resolved on summary judgment\u201d). But, where there are genuine issues of material fact relating to the existence of a special relationship, it becomes necessary for a fact-finder to resolve the factual dispute one way or the other. If the fact-finder resolves the factual dispute in favor of the customer, by finding the facts necessary to establish a special relationship, then a fiduciary duty exists as a matter of law and the issue then becomes whether the bank breached that duty and thereby caused the customer damages. Conversely, if the fact-finder resolves the factual dispute in favor of the bank, by finding facts that do not support a special relationship, then a fiduciary duty does not exist and the customer\u2019s negligence claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">\u00b679 Importantly, then, in situations where the material facts are disputed, the existence of a special relationship is still a question of law. <em>Gliko, </em>\u00b6 24. If the court determines that the facts alleged by the customer would not support a special relationship, even if those facts were resolved by the fact-finder in the customer\u2019s favor, then the customer\u2019s negligence claim necessarily fails and summary judgment for the bank is proper. On the other hand, if the trial court determines that the facts alleged by the customer would support a special relationship if they were resolved by the fact-finder in the customer\u2019s favor, then summary judgment is not proper. This latter scenario is what we have determined exists here. Opinion, \u00b6 37 (\u201cThe Morrows have alleged facts which, if proven, would establish that Bank of America owed them a fiduciary duty.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">\u00b680 Properly instructingthe jury is critical to this scheme. On remand, the District Court will need to identify the specific facts which, if proved by the Morrows, would establish that Bank of America had a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with them. The relevant facts alleged by the Morrows are discussed at \u00b6\u00b6 37 and 41 of our Opinion. The District Court also may draw from a long line of authority identifying what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>facts are essential to the creation of a fiduciary duty between a bank and its customer. <em>See e.g. Deist, </em>208 Mont. at 216-18, 678 P.2d at 193-94; <em>Pulse v. N. Am. Land Title Co. of Mont., </em>218 Mont. 275, 283-84, 707 P.2d 1105, 1110 (1985); <em>Simmons v. Jenkins, </em>230 Mont. 429, 433-34, 750 P.2d 1067, 1070 (1988); <em>Shiplet v. First Sec. Bank of Livingston, Inc., </em>234 Mont. 166, 176, 762 P.2d 242, 248 (1988); <em>Simmons Oil Corp. v. Holly Corp., </em>258 Mont. 79, 85-86, 852 P.2d 523, 526-27 (1993). The District Court will then need to instruct the jurors that if they find these facts were proved by a preponderance of the evidence, then Bank of America owed the Morrows a fiduciary duty and the jurors must proceed to the questions of breach, causation, and damages. The jurors will need to be further instructed that if they find these facts were <em>not </em>proved, then Bank of America owed the Morrows no duty and there is nothing further to determine regarding the Morrows\u2019 negligence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">\u00b681 I believe that instructing the jurors in this manner is necessary to maintain our clarifications in <em>Gliko. </em>The facts, where there is a genuine dispute, are d etermined by a fact-finder.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But whether the facts, if resolved by the fact-finder in the plaintiffs favor, would be sufficient to establish a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d creating a fiduciary duty is determined as a matter of law by the court. With these observations, I concur in the Court\u2019s resolution of Issue Two.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Issue Four - Statute of Frauds</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">\u00b682 The District Court agreed with Bank of America\u2019s argument that the Morrows cannot use fraud claims to enforce an alleged oral contract. In this respect, I believe the District Court\u2019s decision is correct. As we explain, \u201ca claim of fraud may not serve as an alternative means of enforcing an oral agreement within the Statute of Frauds, because \u2018the breach of a promise which the law does not regard as binding is not a fraud.\u2019 \u201d Opinion, \u00b6 54 (quoting <em>Austin v. Cash, </em>274 Mont. 54, 62, 906 P.2d 669, 674 (1995)). To hold Bank of America liable in fraud for failing to honor an unenforceable contract would effectively nullify the Statute of Frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">\u00b683 In litigation of this nature, however, the parties and the court must recognize the subtle distinctions between (1) a contract action where a party is trying to enforce or rescind a contract and (2) a tort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>action where a party is alleging fraud surrounding an alleged contract. For example, an action is permissible for fraudulent representations that preceded a contract and allegedly induced the aggrieved party into signing the contract. Such an action is in tort, independent of any contract action. <em>State ex rel. Dimler v. Eleventh Jud. Dist. Ct., </em>170 Mont. 77, 81-82, 550 P.2d 917, 919-20 (1976); <em>see also Falls Sand &amp; Gravel Co. v. W. Concrete, Inc., </em>270 F. Supp. 495, 500 (D. Mont. 1967) (\u201c \u2018[Q]ne who has been fraudulently induced into a contract may elect to stand by that contract and sue for damages for the fraud.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Bankers Trust Co. v. Pac. Employers Ins. Co., </em>282 F.2d 106, 110 (9th Cir. 1960))). We have also stated that the Statute of Frauds does not apply to liability based on fraud or negligent misrepresentation. <em>Phil-Co Feeds, Inc. v. First Natl. Bank in Havre, </em>238 Mont. 414, 421, 777 P.2d 1306, 1311 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">\u00b684 I thus agree with the Court that an action in tort may be maintained independently of an action in contract, given appropriate facts. Opinion, \u00b6 54. Nevertheless, as Justice Cotter noted in her dissent in <em>Town of Geraldine v. Mont. Mun. Ins. Auth., </em>2008 MT 411, 347 Mont. 267, 198 P.3d 796, \u201cthe dividing line between breaches of contract and torts often lies in a twilight zone, where it is difficult to determine whether the case applies strictly to the one or to the other.\u201d <em>Town of Geraldine, </em>\u00b6 37 (Cotter &amp; Leaphart, JJ., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted). I believe the dividing Une in the present case \u2014 between the contract claim to enforce an oral modification to a mortgage, and the tort claims seeking damages based on the parties\u2019 underlying communications \u2014 lies in that \u201ctwilight zone.\u201d Nevertheless, the Morrows have alleged that Bank of America made material representations which turned out to be false, and that they were injured due to their justified reliance on these representations. These allegations are independent of the Morrows\u2019 contract claim and sound in tort. I thus concur in the Court\u2019s conclusion that the District Court erred in granting summary judgment to Bank of America on the Morrows\u2019 non-contract claims, based on the Statute of Frauds. Opinion, \u00b6 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Issue Five - Actual Fraud</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">\u00b685 According to the Court\u2019s Opinion, the Morrows may establish claims of negligent misrepresentation and actual fraud if they prove the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-7\"><em>negligent misrepresentation: </em>Bank of America, in the course of its business, supplied false information for the guidance of the Morrows in their business transaction; Bank of America failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>exercise reasonable care or competence in obtaining or communicating this information; the Morrows justifiably relied upon the information; and the Morrows suffered pecuniary loss as a result. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 45-46 (citing <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 552).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-4\"><em>actual </em>fraud: Bank of America made a false representation to the Morrows; the representation was material to their requested loan modification; Bank of America knew the representation was false or was ignorant of its truth; Bank of America intended the Morrows to act upon the representation in the manner reasonably contemplated; and the Morrows were ignorant of the representation\u2019s falsity, justifiably relied upon its truth, and suffered damages as a result. Opinion, \u00b6 57.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">\u00b686 As articulated, these two causes of action appear essentially the same. Both are satisfied if the Bank supplied false information for the Morrows\u2019 use or guidance, the Bank was ignorant (perhaps due to a lack of reasonable care) about the information\u2019s truth, and the Morrows justifiably relied on the information to their detriment. Indeed, the Court states that \u201c[t]he Morrows\u2019 claim of fraud rests on the same factual allegations as [their] claim of negligent misrepresentation.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 58. In particular, the Bank allegedly made several false statements regarding the servicing of the Morrows\u2019 existing loan and the status of their application for a loan modification; the statements were made in the course of the Bank\u2019s business and for the Morrows\u2019 guidance; the Bank failed to exercise reasonable care in obtaining the information and was ignorant of the statements\u2019 truth or falsity; and the Morrows did not know of the statements\u2019 falsity and suffered damages due to their justifiable reliance on the statements. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 47-51, 58-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">\u00b687 I believe we have lost sight of the distinction between actual fraud and negligent misrepresentation. Initially, it is important to note that actual fraud may be based on common law or statute. The statutory provision states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-7\">Actual fraud, within the meaning of this part, consists in any of the following acts committed by a party to the contract or with the parly\u2019s connivance <em>with intent to deceive another party to the contract or to induce the other party to enter into the contract: </em>(1) the suggestion as a fact of that which is not true by one who does not believe it to be true; (2) the positive assertion, in a manner not warranted by the information of the person making it, of that which is not true, though the person believes it to be true; (3) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>suppression of that which is trae by one having knowledge or belief of the fact; (4) a promise made without any intention of performing it; or (5) any other act fitted to deceive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">Section 28-2-405, MCA (emphasis added, paragraph breaks omitted). As reflected in the italicized language, actual fraud involves an \u201cintent to deceive... or to induce\u201d another party. A showing of actual fraud under this statute means that consent to a contract was not given freely and the party is entitled to rescind the contract. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 28-2-102(2), -301(1), -302, -401(l)(c), -404, -405, -1711(1), MCA. Here, however, the Morrows do not seek to rescind a contract. If anything, they seek to enforce one. Hence, the Morrows are not asserting statutory actual fraud. Rather, they assert common law actual fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">\u00b688 The common law definition of actual fraud consists of the nine elements set forth at \u00b6 57 of today\u2019s Opinion and in numerous prior cases, such as <em>Franks v. Kindsfather, </em>2005 MT 51, \u00b6 17, 326 Mont. 192, 108 P.3d 487, and <em>Town of Geraldine, </em>\u00b6 28. These elements can be traced back through our caselaw to <em>Lee v. Stockmen\u2019s Natl. Bank of Hardin, </em>63 Mont. 262, 207 P. 623 (1922), where we adopted the definition of actual fraud set forth in Corpus Juris:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-6\">In order to go to the jury the plaintiff must make out a <em>prima facie </em>case embracing the elements of actual fraud, <em>viz.: </em>(1) A representation; (2) its falsity; (3) its materiality; (4) the speaker\u2019s knowledge of its falsity, or ignorance of its truth; (5) his intent that it should be acted upon by the person and in the manner reasonably contemplated; (6) the hearer\u2019s ignorance of its falsity; (7) his reliance upon its truth; (8) his right to rely thereon; (9) and his consequent and proximate injury. (26 C. J. 1062.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">63 Mont. at 284, 207 P. at 630 (citing 26 C.J. <em>Fraud </em>\u00a7 6 (1921)). This rale presently may be found at 37 C. J.S. <em>Fraud </em>\u00a7 12 (2008). A showing of actual fraud as a common law tort entitles the person to damages. <em>See e.g. Cartwright v. Eq. Life Assurance Socy. of the U.S., </em>276 Mont. 1, 22-26, 914 P.2d 976, 990-91 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">\u00b689 The Court opines that an \u201cintent to deceive or injure\u201d is not required to establish actual fraud. Opinion, \u00b6 59 (citing <em>W. Sec. Bank v. Eide Bailly LLP, </em>2010 MT 291, \u00b6 61, 359 Mont. 34, 249 P.3d 35). This is incorrect. As stated in the same authority from which we adopted the nine-element definition of actual fraud, \u201ca fraudulent intent, or an intent to deceive, is an essential element of fraud.\u201d 26 C. J. <em>Fraud </em>\u00a7 44 (footnotes omitted); <em>accord </em>37 C.J.S. <em>Fraud </em>\u00a7 4 (\u201cActual fraud is intentional fraud, with an intent to deceive being an essential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>element thereof\u201d). Moreover, we have recognized in several cases that common law actual fraud includes an \u201cintent to deceive or dishonesty of purpose.\u201d <em>State ex rel. State Compen. Mut. Ins. Fund v. Berg, </em>279 Mont. 161, 175-76, 927 P.2d 975, 983 (1996); <em>accord Town of Geraldine, </em>\u00b6 28; <em>Barrett v.

Ross, </em>276 Mont. 463, 470-71, 916 P.2d 758, 763 (1996) (posing a hypothetical example of actual fraud in which real estate brokers \u201clied in order to sell a property\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Intent to deceive \u201cmeans that the party charged [with actual fraud] was inspired by a deliberate, fraudulent purpose to iiyure and deceive the party complaining. Actual fraud implies deceit, artifice, and design, and imports the active operation of the mind.\u201d 37 C. J.S. <em>Fraud </em>\u00a7 4 (footnote omitted). This mental state, \u201cconsisting in an intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud,\u201d is known as scienter. <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1463 (Bryan A. Gamer ed., 9th ed., Thomson Reuters 2009). The scienter requirement is a critical distinction between actual fraud and negligent misrepresentation. <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 552 cmt. a (actual fraud involves \u201cintent to deceive,\u201d whereas negligent misrepresentation involves \u201cgood faith coupled with negligence\u201d); <em>Falls Sand &amp; Gravel, </em>270 F. Supp. at 501 (\u201can action for negligent misrepresentation is quite different from an action for intentional fraudulent and deceitful misrepresentation, since there is no requirement of scienter\u201d); <em>Barrett, </em>256 Mont. at 107, 845 P.2d at 717 (\u201cNegligent misrepresentation has a lesser standard of proof than [actual] fraud. Rather than requiring an intent to misrepresent, it requires a showing of a failure to use reasonable care or competence in obtaining or communicating the information.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">\u00b690 \u201cBecause an intent to defraud is generally not susceptible to direct proof, it invariably must be proven by circumstantial evidence.\u201d 37 C.J.S. <em>Fraud </em>\u00a7 42. Such intent may be established \u201cby inferences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>drawn from examining the scheme itself which demonstrate that the scheme was reasonably calculated to deceive persons of ordinary prudence and comprehension.\u201d 37 C.J.S. <em>Fraud </em>\u00a7 42. An intent to deceive \u201ccannot be inferred merely from the falsity of a statement,\u201d 26 C.J. <em>Fraud </em>\u00a7 44, or from \u201cmere carelessness\u201d by the speaker, 37 C.J.S. <em>Fraud </em>\u00a7 42. But it may be inferred where the speaker makes a statement \u201cwith knowledge of its falsity,\u201d \u201cin reckless ignorance,\u201d or \u201cin positive terms importing a knowledge of which the speaker is consciously ignorant,\u201d and the speaker intends the statement to \u201cbe acted upon by a party reasonably within the contemplation of the speaker.\u201d 26 C.J. <em>Fraud </em>\u00a7 44. In other words, intending that a statement be acted upon, while consciously ignorant of whether the statement is true, suggests a fraudulent intent on the part of the speaker.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">\u00b691 The Court posits that knowledge of the statement\u2019s falsity is not required and that \u201c[t]he requisite knowledge may also be established where the defendant is ignorant of whether the statement is true.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 59.1 agree that actual knowledge is not required, but I do not agree that simple ignorance, by itself, is sufficient. Again, the authority from which we adopted the nine-element definition of actual fraud explains that \u201cignorance of [the representation\u2019s] truth\u201d means that the speaker \u201cdoubts the truth of his representations,\u201d speaks \u201cwith conscious ignorance or reckless indifference as to their truth or falsity,\u201d or makes \u201cunqualified\u201d assertions that \u201cimportt ] a knowledge of which the speaker is consciously ignorant.\u201d 26 C.J. <em>Fraud </em>\u00a7\u00a7 37, 39, 40, 44 (footnotes omitted). Similarly, the Restatement sets forth three conditions under which a misrepresentation is fraudulent: \u201cA misrepresentation is fraudulent if the maker (a) knows or believes that the matter is not as he represents it to be, (b) does not have the confidence in the accuracy of his representation that he states or implies, or (c) knows that he does not have the basis for his representation that he states or implies. <em>\u2019Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 526. \u201cThe fact that the misrepresentation is one that a [person] of ordinary care and intelligence in the maker\u2019s situation would have recognized as false is not enough to impose liability\u201d for fraudulent misrepresentation (actual fraud). <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 526 cmt. d. \u201cFraudulent\u201d means that the speaker had \u201cknowledge of the untrue character of his representation.\u201d <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 526 cmt. a. This does not mean the speaker must have had <em>actual </em>knowledge of the falsity. It is sufficient if the speaker was conscious of a likelihood that the facts may not be as he represented them:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>In order that a misrepresentation may be fraudulent it is not necessary that the maker know the matter is not as represented. Indeed, it is not necessary that he should even believe this to be so. It is enough that <em>being conscious that he has neither knowledge nor belief in the existence of the matter </em>he chooses to assert it as a fact. Indeed, since knowledge implies a firm conviction, a misrepresentation of a fact so made as to assert that the maker knows it, is fraudulent if he is conscious that he has merely a belief in its existence and recognizes that there is a chance, more or less great, that the fact may not be as it is represented.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AfU\"><em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 526 cmt. e (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">\u00b692 Thus, both the Restatement and Corpus Juris recognize that, at a minimum, a \u201cconscious\u201d ignorance by the speaker about whether his or her statements are true is necessary to establish actual fraud. Without evidence that the defendant at least \u201crecognizetd] that there is a chance, more or less great, that the fact may not be as it is represented,\u201d <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 526 cmt. e, it is impossible to infer that the defendant intended to deceive the plaintiff. As discussed, an intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud is an essential element of actual fraud and is the critical distinction between actual fraud and negligent misrepresentation \u2014 the latter involving \"good faith coupled with negligence.\u201d <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 552 cmt. a. Accordingly, in my view, the Court errs in suggesting that merely being unaware or oblivious about a representation\u2019s truth or falsity is sufficient. Opinion, \u00b6 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">\u00b693 Here, the Morrows did not expressly allege in their First Amended Complaint that Bank of America had an intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud them. And, frankly, I question what Bank of America would have hoped to gain from such an effort. It seems to me that what the Morrows\u2019 allegations genuinely reflect is a classic claim of negligent misrepresentation resulting from Bank of America\u2019s left hand not knowing what its right hand was doing. This view finds support in the Court\u2019s footnote referring to the Consent Order, which \u201cnotes that Bank of America failed to devote appropriate resources, oversight, and training to its foreclosure processes.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 39 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">\u00b694 Nevertheless, the Morrows did allege in their First Amended Complaint that Bank of America \u201cknew\u201d its representations to the Morrows \u201cwere false.\u201d The Morrows have presented evidence of a multitude of conflicting communications from the Bank. A jury could infer from the Morrows\u2019 evidence that Bank employees were at least consciously aware that the facts they communicated to the Morrows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>likely were not as represented. <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 526 cmt. e. I thus concur in the Court\u2019s conclusion that the District Court erred in granting summary judgment to Bank of America on the Morrows\u2019 actual fraud claim. I do so, however, with recognition that actual fraud does not contemplate merely making statements about which the speaker is ignorant; it instead contemplates that the speaker had some degree of \u201cknowledge of the untrue character of his representation,\u201d <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 526 cmt. a, and \u201cwas inspired by a deliberate, fraudulent purpose to injure and deceive\u201d the plaintiff, 37 C. J.S. <em>Fraud </em>\u00a7 4.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Issue Six - Constructive Fraud</p>\n<p id=\"AY7\">\u00b695 As a final matter, I disagree with the Court\u2019s analysis of constructive fraud. Our cases discussing constructive fraud have tied such claims to \u00a7 28-2-406, MCA, as the Court does again today. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6 62; <em>Harris v. St. Vincent Healthcare, </em>2013 MT 207, \u00b6 30, 371 Mont. 133, 305 P.3d 852; <em>In re Adoption of S.R.T., </em>2011 MT 219, \u00b6 17, 362 Mont. 39, 260 P.3d 177; <em>Lee v. Armstrong, </em>244 Mont. 289, 294, 798 P.2d 84, 87-88 (1990); <em>McJunkin v. Kaufman &amp; Broad Home Sys., Inc., </em>229 Mont. 432, 439, 748 P.2d 910, 914-15 (1987). This statute and the other provisions of Title 28, chapter 2, MCA, pertain to contract formation, enforcement, modification, and extinction. Actual fraud under \u00a7 28-2-405, MCA, and constructive fraud under \u00a7 28-2-406, MCA, are referred to in the Code as \u201c[t]he <em>contract </em>definitions of fraud,\u201d not the <em>tort </em>definitions of fraud. Section 27-1-221(4), MCA (emphasis added). Constructive fraud under \u00a7 28-2-406, MCA, is a ground for rescinding a contract. <em>See e.g. Gliko, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 31, 36. Here, however, the Morrows do not seek to rescind a contract. If anything, they seek to enforce one. Hence, the Morrows are not asserting constructive fraud under \u00a7 28-2-406, MCA. As a matter of fact, they do not cite or make any argument under this statute in their briefs, and the statute thus does not apply. In my view, the Court errs by nevertheless applying \u00a7 28-2-406, MCA \u2014 a ground for rescinding a contract \u2014 when we have determined that the alleged contract (a modified loan agreement) does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>not exist in the first place. Our reasoning is unsound and will cause confusion in subsequent applications of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">\u00b696 Perceiving that I have concluded that the Morrows\u2019 constructive fraud claim must fail \u201cbecause they do not seek to rescind a contract,\u201d the Court cites several cases for the proposition that a plaintiff may seek damages for constructive fraud apart from any action to rescind a contract. Opinion, \u00b6 62 (citing <em>Mattingly v. First Bank of Lincoln, </em>285 Mont. 209, 947 P.2d 66 (1997), <em>Lee, </em>244 Mont. 289, 798 P.2d 84, and <em>McGregor v. Mommer, </em>220 Mont. 98, 714 P.2d 536 (1986)). It appears the Court has misapprehended my point. I agree that a plaintiff may seek damages for the <em>tort </em>of constructive fraud (assuming such a tort has been recognized), independent of any contract action. But I disagree that the <em>tort </em>of constructive fraud is defined by a statute (\u00a7 28-2-406, MCA) that undeniably sets forth a <em>\u201ccontract </em>definition[ ] of fraud.\u201d Section 27-1-221(4), MCA (emphasis added). The provisions of Title 28 were not intended to create causes of action sounding in tort. Construing statutory language identical to \u00a7 28-2-406, MCA, the South Dakota Supreme Court determined that constructive fraud under this statute will support an action to avoid a contract, but not a tort action for damages. <em>Schmidt v. Wildcat Cave, Inc., </em>261 N.W.2d 114, 116-17 (S.D. 1977); <em>Harding Co. v. Frithiof, </em>575 F.3d 767, 774 (8th Cir. 2009) (citing <em>Schmidt). </em>Here, the Morrows do not seek to avoid or rescind a contract pursuant to \u00a7 28-2-406, MCA. Their constructive fraud claim is intended as a <em>tort </em>claim, not a <em>contract </em>claim, and we err by perpetuating the erroneous use of a contract statute for the purpose of defining the elements of a tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">\u00b697 Unlike actual fraud \u2014 which is defined for contract purposes in \u00a7 28-2-405, MCA, and for tort purposes in our nine-element definition discussed above \u2014 this Court has never articulated a common law definition of constructive fraud. I question whether it is necessary to do so, given our determination in <em>Bottrell v. American Bank, </em>237 Mont. 1, 20-21, 773 P.2d 694, 706 (1989), that constructive fraud and negligent misrepresentation are coextensive when based on the same misrepresentation and the breach of a legal duty.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But assuming, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>the sake of discussion, that we should adopt a common law cause of action for constructive fraud, whatever else such a claim might entail it would include the requirement (also contained in \u00a7 28-2-406, MCA) that the defendant gained an advantage from the alleged fraud. We have explained that \u201c[c]ourts may invoke constructive fraud as a matter of law to prevent a party from being unjustly enriched as a result of false statements made, even if the false statement is not knowingly made.\u201d <em>Durbin, </em>276 Mont. at 470, 916 P.2d at 762. It is said that \u201c[c]onstructive fraud is a fraud that arises by the operation of law from conduct, which if sanctioned by law, would secure an unconscionable advantage [to the defendant], irrespective of the actual intent to defraud.\u201d 37 C. J.S. <em>Fraud </em>\u00a7 5 (footnote omitted); <em>accord </em>37 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Fraud and Deceit </em>\u00a7 33 (2013) (\u201c[T]he primary difference between pleading a claim for constructive fraud and one for breach of fiduciary duty is the constructive fraud requirement that the defendant benefit himself or herself.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">\u00b698 Here, I disagree with the Court\u2019s assertion that the Morrows have alleged Bank of America gained an advantage from making misleading statements regarding the status of their loan and their application for modification. Opinion, \u00b6 65.1 see no such allegation in the constructive fraud allegations of their First Amended Complaint, in their summary judgment briefing, or in their briefs on appeal. Moreover, aside from failing to allege that Bank of America gained an advantage from the allegedly misleading statements, the Morrows also fail to identify what that supposed advantage was. The Court opines that the Bank gained an advantage because the Morrows made payments to the Bank for an additional 14 months rather than immediately seek another lender or proceed with a short sale or foreclosure. Opinion, \u00b6 65. Again, the Morrows made no such allegations. Furthermore, the Morrows had a preexisting contractual obligation to the Bank to make monthly mortgage payments of $2,301.28. The monthly payments the Morrows made during the 14-month period ($1,239.99) were approximately half of what the Bank was entitled to receive under the original mortgage. As the Court concedes, the Bank had no obligation in the first place to avoid foreclosure or to grant a modification of the loan. Opinion, \u00b6 39. Thus, it could be argued that the Bank incurred a <em>disadvantage </em>from the Morrows\u2019 reduced payments. In short, there is no evidence, let <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>alone allegations, that the Bank was \u201cunjustly enriched\u201d as a result of conflicting statements about the servicing of the Morrows\u2019 existing loan and the status of their application for a modification. <em>Durbin, </em>276 Mont. at 470, 916 P.2d at 762. For this reason, I believe the District Court correctly granted summary judgment to Bank of America on the constructive fraud claim, and I dissent from the Court\u2019s contrary holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">\u00b699 In conclusion, I dissent as to Issue Six and, except as otherwise stated above, I concur as to all other issues.</p>\n<judges id=\"b97-5\">JUSTICE RICE joins the Concurrence and Dissent of JUSTICE MCKINNON.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b87-8\"> We noted in <em>Gliko, </em>\u00b6 25, that although the existence of genuine issues of material fact is not always easily ascertained, neither conclusory assertions nor mere disagreement about the interpretation of a fact constitutes a genuine issue of material fact.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b91-5\"> <em>Western Security Bank, </em>upon which the Court relies for the contrary proposition (see Opinion, \u00b6 59), is not persuasive.

W. <em>Sec. Bank, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 60-62 (citing <em>Durbin, </em>276 Mont. at 469, 916 P.2d at 762, and <em>May v.

Neither <em>Western Security Bank </em>nor <em>May, </em>however, contains any in-depth analysis of the nine-element definition. Neither opinion addressed our statements in <em>Berg, Town of Geraldine, </em>and <em>Barrett, </em>or the principles stated in Corpus Juris and the Restatement.
