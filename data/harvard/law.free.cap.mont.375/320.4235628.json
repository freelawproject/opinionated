Whether the District Court erred when it determined that it had jurisdiction to consider arguments that Pickett had not specifically presented to the Montana Medical Legal Panel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">\u00b64 <em>2. Whether this Court should suspend the Rules of Appellate Procedure to consider the District Court\u2019s decisions allowing Pickett to present unpleaded claims at trial and denying Cortese\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">\u00b65 We affirm the District Court\u2019s determination that it had jurisdiction to decide Pickett\u2019s claims. We decline to suspend the Rules of Appellate Procedure to consider the other issues raised by C\u00f3rtese.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">\u00b66 On January 18,2007, C\u00f3rtese performed an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with sphincterotomy on Donna Pickett. During the course ofthe procedure, the first section of Pickett\u2019s small intestine was perforated. As a result, Pickett developed pancreatitis, which became septic. Pickett underwent extensive medical care and incurred significant expense to address these complications.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-11\">\u00b67 On January 15, 2010, Pickett filed a claim for review with the Montana Medical Legal Panel (MMLP). She asserted claims of medical malpractice against C\u00f3rtese stemming from the 2007 procedure. Pickett alleged that C\u00f3rtese was negligent in three ways: (1) in negligently perforating her intestine; (2) in failing to timely diagnose the perforation; and (3) in failing to disclose all material facts and the nature of significant risks that may be encountered so that necessary consent to treatment could be based on an intelligent exercise of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-12\">\u00b68 Following the MMLP\u2019s confidential decision, Pickett filed a complaint before the Second Judicial District Court. The complaint alleged that C\u00f3rtese breached his duty of care in numerous ways, including \u201ccarelessly, unskillfully, and negligently perforating [Pickett\u2019s] duodenum; failing to timely diagnose and treat [her] perforation; failing to disclose all material facts and the nature of significant risks that may be encountered so that necessary consent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>treatment could be based on an intelligent exercise of judgment; failing to employ appropriate after-care or post-operative management; and failing to otherwise use that degree of care and skill required of physicians practicing in Dr. Cortese\u2019s specialty....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">\u00b69 C\u00f3rtese asked Pickett in written discovery to list and explain every distinct action or omission that constituted a departure from the standard of care. Pickett replied with the allegations from her complaint and stated that she would supplement her answer with her expert witness disclosures. On June 3,2013, Pickett served her expert disclosure identifying three experts who would offer standard of care opinions. Pickett\u2019s experts opined that C\u00f3rtese did not obtain all necessary data before recommending and performing the ERCP or sphincterotomy and that he should have managed her care with more conservative, alternative measures.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">\u00b610 On July 25,2013, C\u00f3rtese moved to dismiss Pickett\u2019s claims that C\u00f3rtese \u201cperformed an unnecessary procedure and failed to disclose that less-invasive alternatives were available.\u201d C\u00f3rtese argued that these claims were not presented to the MMLP, so the District Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider them. After briefing and argument, the court denied Cortese\u2019s motion to dismiss. It determined that \u201c[p]art of the standard of care analysis concerns whether or not the procedure should have been performed at all,\u201d and that C\u00f3rtese \u201cpresented an expert\u2019s report addressing this exact issue\u201d to the MMLP. In the same order, the Court denied Cortese\u2019s motions for summary judgment and to preclude unpleaded claims from being presented at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">\u00b611 A district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law that we review for correctness. <em>Ballas v. Missoula City Bd. of Adjustment, </em>2007 MT 299, \u00b6 9, 340 Mont. 56, 172 P.3d 1232. \u201cThe inquiry is whether the complaint states facts that, if true, would grant the district court subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Balias, </em>\u00b6 9. Denial of a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is reviewable prior to final judgment. M. R. App. P. 6(3)(c). We are confined to whether the district court correctly decided the limited question of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Balias, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">\u00b612 <em>1. Whether the District Court erred when it determined that it had </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number><em>jurisdiction to consider arguments that Pickett had not specifically presented to the Montana Medical Legal Panel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">\u00b613 Any person alleging malpractice against a health care provider must submit a claim to the MMLP before filing a complaint in district court. Section 27-6-301, MCA. With few exceptions, none applicable here, the panel is required to review all malpractice claims against health care providers. Section 27-6-105, MCA. The application to the MMLP must contain \u201ca statement in reasonable detail of the elements of the health care provider\u2019s conduct that are believed to constitute a malpractice claim, the dates on which the conduct occurred, and the names and addresses of all physicians... and hospitals having contact with the claimant and all witnesses.\u201d Section 27-6-302(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">\u00b614 In her MMLP filing, Pickett did not expressly allege that C\u00f3rtese should have explored alternative treatment and that he unnecessarily performed the ERCP. C\u00f3rtese contends that Pickett failed to meet the statutory requirement to bring this claim to the MMLP before filing it with the District Court. Pickett responds by arguing that this claim is included within two issues she presented to the MMLP \u2014 whether C\u00f3rtese negligently operated on her and whether C\u00f3rtese failed to obtain informed consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">\u00b615 We have not previously addressed the specificity of pleading required before the MMLP. C\u00f3rtese urges us to adopt the rule from two administrative law cases in which we held that an issue not squarely raised, argued or adjudicated in the administrative context is not ripe for consideration in a judicial review proceeding. <em>Art v. Mont. Dept. of Labor &amp; Indus. ex. rel. Mason, </em>2002 MT 327, \u00b6 14, 313 Mont. 197, 60 P.3d 958; <em>Marble v. Mont. Dept. of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>2000 MT 240, \u00b6 28, 301 Mont. 373, 9 P.3d 617. Pickett distinguishes these cases because the standard of review that the trial court utilizes in an administrative law action differs from a medical malpractice claim. Trial courts review administrative decisions to determine whether the agency \u201cexceeded its authority, abused its discretion, made clearly erroneous findings of fact, or interpreted the law incorrectly.\u201d <em>Marble, </em>\u00b6 15. In contrast, filing a claim with the MMLP is simply a condition precedent to filing a medical malpractice action in district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">\u00b616 We agree with Pickett that <em>Art </em>and <em>Marble </em>have no application here because both involve judicial review of an agency decision under the Montana Administrative Procedure Act. A proceeding before the MMLP, however, results in no record and no agency decision presented to the court for review. \u201cThe panel\u2019s decision is without administrative or judicial authority and is not binding upon any party.\u201d Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>27-6-606(1), MCA. The decision and reasoning of the panel are confidential and cannot be used as evidence in an action filed in court. Sections 27-6-703, -704, MCA. A district court presented with a medical malpractice claim analyzes that claim anew rather than relying on any finding made by the MMLP.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">\u00b617 Nevertheless, there must be some relationship between a claim filed with the MMLP and a complaint filed in district court. Submitting a claim for evaluation by the MMLP is a condition precedent to commencing a medical malpractice action. <em>Linder v. Smith, </em>193 Mont. 20, 629 P.2d 1187 (1981). A \u201cclaim\u201d must include \u201creasonable detail of the elements of the health care provider\u2019s conduct that are believed to constitute a malpractice claim.\u201d Section 27-6-301, MCA. The essence of Pickett\u2019s claim against C\u00f3rtese is that he failed to meet the standard of care in performing the January 18, 2007 ERCP. This claim was submitted to the MMLP before Pickett commenced her district court action. The District Court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction is based on its \u201cfundamental authority to hear and adjudicate cases\u201d of medical malpractice. <em>BNSF Ry. Co. v. Cringle, </em>2010 MT 290, \u00b6 15, 359 Mont. 20, 247 P.3d 706. The issue is whether the elements of Pickett\u2019s malpractice complaint were sufficiently presented before the panel in order to satisfy the condition precedent to filing in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">\u00b618 Although the scope of a claim before the MMLP was not at issue, our decision in <em>Griffin v. Moseley, </em>2010 MT 132, 356 Mont. 393, 234 P.3d 869, is therefore instructive. Griffin\u2019s complaint alleged that her doctor was negligent and that his actions fell below the standard of care. <em>Griffin, </em>\u00b6 37. The complaint contained only two claims against Moseley: \u201c(1) negligence during the performance of the surgery; and (2) failure to obtain informed consent prior to surgery.\u201d <em>Griffin, </em>\u00b6 16. We determined that the District Court construed those claims too narrowly when it did not allow Griffin to argue that the doctor failed to attempt alternative pre-surgical treatment. <em>Griffin, </em>\u00b6 39. In light of the allegations of the complaint and the deposition testimony of Griffin\u2019s experts, we held that the doctor was on notice that the plaintiff claimed he was negligent \u201cin both his surgical treatment of [Griffin], as well as in his pre-surgical treatment of her.\u201d <em>Griffin, </em>\u00b6 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">\u00b619 <em>Griffin </em>is useful here for its discussion regarding what a general claim for negligence encompasses. A claimant before the MMLP is required to provide only \u201creasonable detail\u201d of the elements of her claim. Section 27-6-301, MCA. The requirement that a claimant first file a claim with the MMLP exists to avoid litigation where possible. Section 27-6-102, MCA. Filing with the MMLP is just the first step in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>a medical malpractice case, occurring well before the conduct of any discovery, the substantial involvement of experts or the full development of legal theories. As such, \u201creasonable detail\u201d of a party\u2019s claim cannot be expected to include each and every theory that may come to fruition after discovery occurs. For these reasons, we decline to impose Cortese\u2019s suggested heightened pleading standard for \u201creasonable detail.\u201d The notice requirement we utilized in <em>Griffin </em>applies a standard that is equally workable in the analysis of a claim before the MMLP.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">\u00b620  In her filing with the MMLP, Pickett alleged that C\u00f3rtese negligently performed the ERCP and failed to provide her with sufficient information to enable her informed consent. Pickett\u2019s expert disclosure alleged that C\u00f3rtese failed to obtain all relevant data, failed to explore alternative solutions and performed the ERCP unnecessarily. Both allegations arise out of the same procedure and are premised on Cortese\u2019s alleged failure to meet the standard of care in performing that procedure. Like <em>Griffin, </em>Pickett\u2019s claim that C\u00f3rtese failed to consider alternative treatment before performing the ERCP properly may be subsumed into her claims that C\u00f3rtese negligently performed the ERCP and failed to get informed consent. Further, as the District Court noted, C\u00f3rtese presented an expert\u2019s report to the MMLP that spoke to the necessity of the procedure. C\u00f3rtese reasonably was on notice of Pickett\u2019s claims and had the opportunity to conduct additional discovery once Pickett\u2019s expert disclosure was served. Under these facts, the District Court correctly determined that Pickett\u2019s claim to the MMLP was sufficient to encompass her claims before the court. Accordingly, we affirm its decision denying Cortese\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">\u00b621 <em>2. Whether this Court should suspend the Rules of Appellate Procedure to consider the District Court\u2019s decisions allowing Pickett to present unpleaded claims at trial and denying Cortese\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">\u00b622 C\u00f3rtese requests that we consider ruling on two further interlocutory orders \u2014 the District Court\u2019s denied of his motion for summeuy judgment and its denied of his motion to exclude impleaded cleiims at trial. Unlike a court\u2019s decision on a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, these orders are not appealable until after final judgment. M. R. App. P. 6(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">\u00b623 Nevertheless, C\u00f3rtese asks us to exercise our authority under M. R. App. P. 29 to suspend the requirements of these rules \u201c[i]n the interest of expediting decision ... or for other good cause shown.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>C\u00f3rtese points out that we have suspended the Rules in the interest of judicial economy. <em>See Durden v. Hydro Flame Corp., </em>1998 MT 47, \u00b6\u00b6 17-19, 288 Mont. 1, 955 P.2d 160. In <em>Durden, </em>we faced one of a \u201climited class of cases\u201d where a party appeals an order granting a motion for judgment as a matter of law and an order granting a new trial on damages. <em>Durden, </em>\u00b6 19. Because the order granting a new trial was appealable, we chose to also consider the order granting judgment as a matter of law to \u201csave the necessity either for a second appeal or a second trial,\u201d an outcome we characterized as a \u201cnear certainty.\u201d <em>Durden, </em>\u00b6 19. Here, there has been no trial, and there is no \u201cnear certainty\u201d of a second appeal. \u201cIn the absence of extraordinary and compelling circumstances beyond simply requiring a party to proceed to trial,\u201d we have declined to review orders denying summary judgment before the entry of final judgment. <em>State ex rel. Kosena v. Dist. Ct., </em>172 Mont. 21, 22, 560 P.2d 522, 523 (1977). C\u00f3rtese has not presented any compelling reason necessitating review of these pretrial rulings, and, consistent with our Rules of Appellate Procedure, we decline to address them.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">\u00b624 The District Court\u2019s order denying Cortese\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is affirmed. The case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b350-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES McKINNON, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b350-7\">JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"Aqq\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">\u00b625 The Court relies heavily upon <em>Griffin v.
