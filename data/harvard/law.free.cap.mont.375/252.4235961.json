E.G. contends that the District Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to revoke his suspended sentence because the case against him was improperly transferred from Youth Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">\u00b62 In 2008, when E.G. was age 15, the State petitioned to have him declared a delinquent youth. He was accused of offenses that, if committed by an adult, would constitute sexual intercourse without consent, three incidents of assault with a weapon, and intimidation. He admitted to two instances of assault and to intimidation and the other accusations were dismissed. The Youth Court found E.G. to be delinquent and ordered that he be committed to the Department of Corrections until age 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">\u00b63 E.G. appealed to this Court, which reversed and remanded for reconsideration of several issues not involved in the current proceeding. <em>Matter </em>of E.G., 2009 MT 404N. A Youth Court commitment order entered after remand stated that the Youth Court would retain jurisdiction until E.G. was 21 and would consider transfer of the case to District Court. E.G. turned 18 in October 2010 and shortly thereafter the State filed a motion in Youth Court to transfer supervisory control over E.G. to the District Court. The Youth Court conducted a hearing on the motion on November 8, 2010. E.G. appeared with his attorney and expressly consented to the transfer to District Court, acknowledging that his ongoing treatment needs would benefit from moving to adult supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">\u00b64 At the November 2010 hearing, the Court inquired whether E.G.\u2019s parents had received notice of the proceeding as provided in \u00a7 41-5-208(2), MCA. The parents lived out of state and E.G. did not know if any such notice had been provided. The parties and the Court discussed notifying E.G.\u2019s parents and re-convening the hearingif they wished to participate. The record does not reflect whether any such notice was provided or, if so, the parents\u2019 response. E.G. stated that he wanted to proceed with the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>\u00b65 On December 7,2010, the Youth Court entered an order granting the motion to transfer the supervision of E.G. to District Court. The Youth Court found that E.G. did not contest the transfer and that it was necessary to ensure E.G.\u2019s compliance with the conditions of probation. The order further provided that E.G. would remain under the jurisdiction of the District Court until he was age 25, but that he could be released from supervision earlier upon recommendation of his probation officer and compliance with all conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">\u00b66 On October 24,2012, the State filed a petition in District Court to revoke E.G.\u2019s suspended sentence based upon violations of his conditions of probation. E.G. subsequently admitted several of the violations and the remainder were dismissed. On March 13,2013, the District Court sentenced E.G. to the Montana Department of Corrections until age 25, with no time suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">\u00b67 E.G. appeals. He contends that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to revoke his probation and sentence in 2010 because his parents did not receive notice of the hearing on the motion to transfer supervision of his probation from Youth Court to District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">\u00b68 Determination of subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law that this Court reviews to determine whether the district court had authority to act. <em>Green v. Gerber, </em>2013 MT 35, \u00b6 12, 369 Mont. 20, 303 P.3d 729.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">\u00b69 The youth court has original jurisdiction over cases involving persons under age 18. <em>State v. Andersen-Conway, </em>2007 MT 281, \u00b6 15, 339 Mont. 439, 171 P.3d 678. Section 41-5-208, MCA, provides that a youth court may upon motion transfer jurisdiction of a case to the district court and \u201corder the transfer of supervisory responsibility from juvenile probation services to adult probation services.\u201d Section 41-5-208(1), MCA. The youth court must hold a hearing before ordering transfer and must give notice of the hearing to the youth, the youth\u2019s counsel, and the youth\u2019s parents or guardian. Section 41-5-208(2), MCA. The youth has the right to counsel, to be heard, to present witnesses and evidence, to cross-examine witnesses, and to a written statement of the evidence and reasons supporting the transfer. Section 41-5-208(2), MCA. The State and the youth may stipulate to the transfer. <em>Anderson-Conway, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">\u00b610 In the present case the State moved to transfer supervision of E.G. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>to District Court and the Youth Court held a hearing. E.G.\u2019s parents did not receive notice of the motion or hearing, but E.G. stated that he wanted to proceed. He stated that he agreed to the transfer to adult probation because it would be beneficial to him. On appeal E.G. now contends that the lack of notice to his parents deprived the Youth Court of jurisdiction to transfer his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">\u00b611 Jurisdiction is \u201cthe court\u2019s fundamental authority to hear and adjudicate cases or proceedings.\u201d <em>Matter of A.D.B., </em>2013 MT 167, \u00b6 54, 370 Mont. 422, 305 P.3d 739; <em>Lorang v. Fortis Ins. Co., </em>2008 MT 252, \u00b6 57, 345 Mont. 12, 192 P.3d 186. Jurisdiction encompasses a court\u2019s adjudicatory authority and may delineate classes of cases (subject matter jurisdiction) or persons (personal jurisdiction) that are subject to the court\u2019s authority. <em>Elseiver v. Muchnick, </em>559 U.S. 154, 160-161, 130 S. Ct. 1237, 1243 (2010). Lack of personal jurisdiction over an individual does not deprive the court of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Matter of B.F., </em>2004 MT 61, \u00b6 18, 320 Mont. 261, 87 P.3d 427. Jurisdiction of the district courts in Montana is established by the Montana Constitution. Mont. Const, art. VH, \u00a7 4 (district courts have \u201coriginal jurisdiction in all criminal cases amounting to felony and all civil matters and cases at law and in equity.\u201d); <em>BNSF v. Cringle, </em>2010 MT 290, \u00b6 15, 359 Mont. 20, 247 P.3d 706. The Montana Youth Court Act provides that youth courts have original jurisdiction over cases involving persons under the age of 18. Section 41-5-203(1), MCA; <em>Matter of J.A., </em>2011 MT 132, \u00b6 8, 361 Mont. 16, 255 P.3d 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">\u00b612 Statutory time and notice prescriptions applicable to various proceedings are different from jurisdictional provisions that delineate the cases that fall within a court\u2019s subject matter adjudicatory authority. <em>Cringle, </em>\u00b6 17. Filing deadlines or notice requirements enacted by the Legislature do not affect a court\u2019s fundamental subject matter jurisdiction, and the Legislature does not deprive courts of subject matter jurisdiction when it enacts filing or notice deadlines. <em>Green, </em>\u00b6 24; <em>Matter of A.D.B., </em>\u00b6 54; <em>Cringle, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 13, 15. A party\u2019s assertion that statutory notice and hearing opportunities were not provided raises a question of due process, not jurisdiction. <em>Watson v. West, </em>2011 MT 57, \u00b6 23, 360 Mont. 9, 250 P.3d 845; <em>Steab v. Luna, </em>2010 MT 125, \u00b6 24, 356 Mont. 372, 233 P.3d 351. A party who properly raises an issue regarding statutory notice or time requirements may expect them to be applied regularly and consistently, <em>Cringle, </em>\u00b6 18, but due process issues can be waived. <em>State v. Lindsey, </em>2011 MT 46, \u00b6\u00b6 18-21, 359 Mont. 362, 249 P.3d 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">\u00b613  These principles clearly apply to the parental notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>requirement in \u00a7 41-5-208, MCA. While the statute imposes several requirements, including a requirement for parental notification (\u201cshall\u201d), the Legislature did not designate parental notification as a jurisdictional requirement. Compare, for example, \u00a7 41-5-205, MCA, designating circumstances under which youth court \u201cjurisdiction terminates.\u201d <em>Matter of J.A., </em>\u00b6 9. The Legislature\u2019s failure to designate a particular notice requirement as jurisdictional is important in determining whether the requirement should be construed as jurisdictional. <em>Matter of B.F., </em>\u00b6 19; <em>Davis v. State, </em>2008 MT 226, \u00b6 21, 344 Mont. 300, 187 P.3d 654 (statutory time limit for filing petition for postconviction relief did not specifically diminish the court\u2019s jurisdiction). The parental notice requirement of \u00a7 41-5-208, MCA, does not withdraw, circumscribe, limit or affect the Youth Court\u2019s jurisdiction over the issue of transferring supervision of E.G. to the District Court. <em>Cringle, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">\u00b614 E.G. was an adult and was represented by counsel at the time of the transfer proceeding. Nothing in \u00a7 41-5-208, MCA, prohibited him from determining that it was in his interest to proceed with the transfer hearing, as he did in this case, in the absence of satisfaction of the parental notification requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">\u00b615  E.G. does not raise any other issue concerning the transfer of supervision to District Court or concerning the revocation of his probation or his sentence. He does not argue that his rights were compromised or that he was injured in any way by the lack of parental notification. <em>Matter of B.F., </em>\u00b6 16 (mother in guardianship proceeding was not injured by deficiencies in statutorily-required notice to children\u2019s father).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">\u00b616 The District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b280-8\">JUSTICES WHEAT, BAKER, COTTER and McKINNON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
