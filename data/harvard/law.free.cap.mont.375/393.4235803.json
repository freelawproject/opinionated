We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">\u00b62 <em>1. Whether Simpson preserved his objection to the award of restitution for two victims based on their lack of affidavits or testimony.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aai\">\u00b63 <em>2. Whether the District Court\u2019s restitution order was supported by substantial evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">\u00b64 We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">\u00b65 On July 16,2012, Simpson pleaded guilty to a single count of theft by common scheme arising from the theft of property from a salvage yard owned by Robert Appley. In exchange for the guilty plea, the State agreed to dismiss the remaining charges against him. Pursuant to the plea agreement, the State recommended a five-year commitment, suspended, to the Department of Corrections and restitution to be determined by the District Court. The agreement specifically provided that Simpson would be hable for restitution \u201cto any victim on the charges that were dismissed pursuant this plea agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">\u00b66 The court ordered a pre-sentence investigation (PSI) in part to determine an appropriate amount of restitution. The officer completing the PSI noted that restitution had been a \u201cnightmare\u201d to calculate, in large part because it was difficult to determine the value of the various scrap items. The PSI calculated Apple/s restitution request to be $30,460.59 for the various vehicle parts and scrap metal. The PSI also included amounts for two other alleged victims of thefts Simpson had committed, Archie Johnson and Kyle Coder. Johnson requested $500 for the insurance deductible for Simpson\u2019s theft and damage of a flatbed trailer, and Coder requested $360 to reimburse him for his purchase from Simpson of a stolen Oldsmobile. Both items were recovered in Pondera County. Simpson\u2019s plea agreement resulted in dismissal of the charges for these thefts, but Simpson agreed to pay restitution for the dismissed charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-12\">\u00b67 The District Court held a sentencing and restitution hearing on September 4, 2012. Near the end of the hearing, Simpson\u2019s counsel raised objections to the evidence presented. He disputed Apple/s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>claimed amount of losses and argued that $8,000 would be a more appropriate amount of total restitution in this case. The court sentenced Simpson pursuant to the plea agreement on September 25, 2012. On December 13, 2012, it issued its order for restitution, ordering Simpson to pay a total of $31,878.78 to the victims. Simpson appeals the court\u2019s order for restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">\u00b68 A criminal sentence is reviewed for legality. <em>State v. Benoit, </em>2002 MT 166, \u00b6 18, 310 Mont. 449, 51 P.3d 495. \u201cFindings of fact regarding the amount of restitution ordered as part of a criminal sentence are reviewed to determine whether they are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>State v. Coluccio, </em>2009 MT 273, \u00b6 40, 352 Mont. 122, 214 P.3d 1282, <em>overruled in part on other grounds, State v. Kirn, </em>2012 MT 69, 364 Mont. 356, 274 P.3d 746. A finding of fact is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence. <em>City of Billings v. Edward, </em>2012 MT 186, \u00b6 18, 366 Mont. 107, 285 P.3d 523. Substantial evidence is \u201cevidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion; it consists of more than a mere scintilla of evidence, but may be somewhat less than a preponderance.\u201d <em>State v. Jent, </em>2013 MT 93, \u00b6 10, 369 Mont. 468, 299 P.3d 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">\u00b69 <em>1. Whether Simpson preserved his objection to the award of restitution for two victims based on their lack of affidavits or testimony.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AXz\">\u00b610 A sentencing court is required to order an offender to pay full restitution to any victim who has sustained a pecuniary loss. Section 46-18-241, MCA. The court must comply with statutory requirements in determining an amount of restitution. <em>Benoit, </em>\u00b6 23. Simpson contends that the District Court erred by ordering him to pay restitution to Johnson and Coder when the PSI did not include affidavits detailing their loss and they did not testify at the restitution hearing. He alleges that the court failed to comply with the statutory procedural requirements that a PSI include \u201can affidavit that specifically describes the victim\u2019s pecuniary loss and the replacement value in dollars of the loss, submitted by the victim.\u201d Section 46-18-242(l)(b), MCA. The State responds that Simpson failed to object to the amounts requested by Johnson and Coder and that he has waived his right to appeal the court\u2019s order of restitution for these two victims.</p>\n<p id=\"A2O\">\u00b611 \u201c[W]e will not put a district court in error for failing to address an issue or an argument that was not made before it.\u201d <em>State v. David C. Johnson, </em>2011 MT 116, \u00b6 21, 360 Mont. 443, 254 P.3d 578. \u201cAbove all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>else, the rationale underlying the timely-objection rule is judicial economy and \u201cbringing alleged errors to the attention of each court involved, so that actual error can be prevented or corrected at the first opportunity.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. West, </em>2008 MT 338, \u00b6 17, 346 Mont. 244, 194 P.3d 683 (quoting <em>City of Missoula v. Asbury, </em>265 Mont. 14, 20, 873 P.2d 936, 939 (1994)). Although the Court will review an unpreserved claim that a criminal sentence is illegal, <em>State v. Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. 338, 343, 602 P.2d 997, 1000 (1979), \u201ca sentencing court\u2019s failure to abide by a statutory requirement rises to an objectionable sentence, not necessarily an illegal one....\u201d <em>State v. Kotwicki, </em>2007 MT 17, \u00b6 13, 335 Mont. 344, 151 P.3d 892. In <em>David C. Johnson, </em>we affirmed a district court\u2019s restitution order despite the lack of victim affidavits where the defendant had not objected on that ground at the time of sentencing. <em>David C. Johnson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 19-21. Soon thereafter, we reiterated that a defendant\u2019s failure to object to restitution imposed at sentencing forfeits his claim on appeal that the PSI did not contain adequate information to support a restitution award. <em>State v. Charley Johnson, </em>2011 MT 286, \u00b6 14, 362 Mont. 473, 265 P.3d 638.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">\u00b612  Here, Simpson made a general objection at the restitution hearing to the lack of evidence presented for Applets requested restitution. He did not object to the amounts requested by Johnson and Coder or to the basis for their awards. As we held in <em>David C. Johnson </em>and <em>Charley Johnson, </em>the District Court\u2019s alleged failure to require evidentiary support for these victim losses results in a merely objectionable sentence. Because Simpson failed to object on this ground, he has waived this issue for consideration on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">\u00b613 <em>2. Whether the District Court\u2019s restitution order was supported by substantial evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">\u00b614  A victim who sustains pecuniary loss from a defendant\u2019s criminal action is entitled to recover all special damages substantiated by evidence in the record that are recoverable in a civil action. Section 46-18-243(l)(a), MCA. Offenders are liable for restitution only for those offenses of which they have been found guilty or to which they have admitted or agreed to pay restitution. <em>State v. Breeding, </em>2008 MT 162, \u00b6 19, 343 Mont. 323, 184 P.3d 313. Even if actual losses are uncertain, they may be recoverable if they are calculated by use of reasonable methods based on the best evidence available under the circumstances. <em>Benoit, </em>\u00b6 29. Reasonable methods include \u201ca reasonably close estimate of the loss.\u201d <em>State v. Dodson, </em>2011 MT 302, \u00b6 12, 363 Mont. 63, 265 P.3d 1254 (internal citations omitted). We have held that \u201c \u2018[n]othing in the controlling restitution statutes... requires a court or a victim to substantiate a restitution calculation with documentation.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number><em>Aragon, </em>2014 MT 89, \u00b6 12, 374 Mont. 391, 321 P.3d 841 (quoting <em>State v. McMaster, </em>2008 MT 268, \u00b6 29, 345 Mont. 172, 190 P.3d 302). A sentencing court accordingly may award restitution in reliance on victim testimony. <em>Aragon, </em>\u00b6 14. A defendant has a due process right to \u201c \u2018explain, argue, and rebut any information\u2019 presented at sentencing.\u201d <em>Aragon, </em>\u00b6 12 (quoting <em>State v. Roedel, </em>2007 MT 291, \u00b6 65, 339 Mont. 489, 171 P.3d 694). When a Defendant does not present contradictory evidence, the District Court does not err in relying on a victim\u2019s estimates of loss. <em>Dodson, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">\u00b615 Simpson challenges the court\u2019s calculation of restitution for Appley, asserting that its calculations were not supported by substantial evidence in the record. He also objects to the court\u2019s reliance on Appley\u2019s estimates of loss. We address each specific argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">\n<em>a. Total weight of the scrap metal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">\u00b616 The District Court ordered Simpson to reimburse Appley for the cost of fourteen tons of scrap metal, amounting to $2,800.00 in damages. Simpson argues that the evidence in the record does not support the allegation that he stole this much scrap metal. Simpson points to receipts obtained from Pacific Steel and Recycling, attached to the PSI, which account for only approximately seven tons of scrap metal.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">\u00b617 To support its findings regarding the amount of scrap metal, the District Court relied on Appley\u2019s testimony that he had ten tons of scrap located in one area of the properly and four tons in another area. Appley testified as to the items that were missing from the two locations. He also completed a lengthy hand-written affidavit of these items, which was attached to the PSI. The officer who completed the PSI testified that the receipts from Pacific Steel and Recycling were from the Pondera County Attorney's initial investigation and that they may be incomplete. Later, when she was compiling the PSI, the officer was unable to obtain any records from Pacific Steel because of the amount of time that had passed. Additionally, although law enforcement\u2019s initial investigation revealed that Simpson also scrapped metal at another recycling plant, there are no receipts from that center included in the PSI.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">\u00b618 \u201c The credibihty of witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony are determined by the trier of fact, whose resolution of disputed question of fact and credibility will not be disturbed on appeal.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Heath, </em>2004 MT 126, \u00b6 52, 321 Mont. 280, 90 P.3d 426 (quoting <em>State v. Hilgers, </em>1999 MT 284, \u00b6 12, 297 Mont. 23, 989 P.2d 866). Here, the District Court chose to believe Appley\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>assessment of how much scrap iron was on his property and awarded him that amount rather than a reduced amount tied solely to the receipts attached to the PSI. Simpson does not support his contention that the attached receipts establish conclusively how much scrap iron Simpson stole from Appley\u2019s property. The District Court acted within its discretion in relying on Appley\u2019s testimony. The District Court\u2019s determination of how much restitution to award for the scrap iron is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">\n<em>b. Other parts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">\u00b619 Simpson next disputes the court\u2019s order of restitution for $400 in miscellaneous parts. Again, the District Court relied largely on Appley\u2019s testimony to determine the value of loss for these items. Appley testified that he had parts in a shed that were taken by Simpson, including some \u201cbell housings and transmissions.\u201d A court may use reasonable methods to calculate restitution, including estimates, if it is reasonable under the best evidence available under the circumstances presented. <em>Benoit, </em>\u00b6 29. Simpson argues that Appley\u2019s request of $400 for these items was nothing more than complete guess work. Although there was confusion at the hearing when discussing the miscellaneous parts, Appley testified as to what was missing and, as written in his inventory, estimated that the missing items were worth $400. The District Court is in the best position to judge the credibility of witnesses and weigh the evidence before it. <em>Heath, </em>\u00b6 52. Appley\u2019s testimony and inventory attached to the PSI comprise sufficient evidence to support the $400 in restitution for the miscellaneous parts. We do not find clear error in this portion of the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">c. <em>Radiators</em></p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">\u00b620 Simpson next disputes the court\u2019s imposition of restitution for the radiators stolen from vehicles in Appley\u2019s yard. Simpson first argues that he did not take the radiators. The charging documents specifically list radiators as items stolen from Appley. The District Court sentenced Simpson pursuant to a plea agreement in which he agreed to pay restitution for losses related to any of the charges against him. Although Simpson disputes the number of radiators he stole, the District Court was entitled to reject his testimony. Imposing restitution for the radiators was proper. <em>Breeding, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">\u00b621 Alternatively, Simpson alleges that the court did not have sufficient evidence to calculate the worth of the radiators to be $7,420.70. The District Court relied on Appley\u2019s testimony in conjunction with receipts attached to the PSI from Appley\u2019s car repair business. Simpson argues that Appley\u2019s receipts were an improper tool <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>for calculation because they included the cost of removing the radiator from the vehicle, which was already done. Appley testified to the necessity for the labor cost at the hearing, stating that when Simpson took out the radiators, he caused damage to the inside of the vehicles, making it more difficult to replace the radiators. Again, the District Court weighed the evidence before it and chose to believe Appley\u2019s estimate over Simpson\u2019s objections. Simpson does not point to more refiable or accurate information in the record that the District Court ignored. The District Court relied on testimony from Appley, who works in car repairs, and the documentation that he provided. We conclude that there is sufficient evidence in the record to support the District Court\u2019s order for $7,420.70 in radiator replacement costs.</p>\n<p id=\"AK_\">\n<em>d. Road repairs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">\u00b622 Simpson next disputes the cost for repair of Appley\u2019s road. The District Court found that Simpson severely damaged the half-mile driveway to Appley\u2019s salvage yard when he attempted to haul the stolen goods out in muddy conditions. The court ordered Simpson to pay $9,000 for repair of the road. The court based this amount on testimony from Appley and from Sam Nickol, an independent contractor who gave an estimate on repairing Appley\u2019s road. Nickol\u2019s estimate also is attached to the PSI.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">\u00b623 Simpson argues that this order for restitution provides a windfall to Appley by improving the road beyond the condition it was in before Simpson damaged it. Simpson points to Appley\u2019s testimony that the road was only a dirt road, arguing that the amount of restitution will result in upgrading \u201cwhat was essentially a dirt path\u201d into an improved gravel road. Simpson also testified as to his opinion that the amount of gravel in the estimate was unnecessary to improve the road. Nickol contradicted Appley\u2019s statement that the road was only a dirt road, stating \u201cWhether or not [Appley] remembers it, there\u2019s been truckloads of gravel dumped in mud holes and that kind of stuff on and on and on ... . He said it was a dirt trail. Actually, it wasn\u2019t. I mean it was an access road. In order to repair that, you have to replace that to where it will stand back up.\u201d Simpson did not introduce contrary evidence of what would constitute a reasonable amount of repair. Further, a victim is entitled to recover \u201cthe full replacement cost of property taken, destroyed, harmed, or otherwise devalued as a result of the offender\u2019s criminal conduct.\u201d Section46-18-243(l)(b), MCA. The State is required to submit evidence of only a \u201ccausal relationship\u201d between an offense and damage before a defendant maybe charged withpayingrestitution for the damage. <em>Jent, </em>\u00b6 13. Here, the evidence supported the State\u2019s contention that Simpson\u2019s use of a flat-bed trailer on Appley\u2019s property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>caused damage to the road. The testimony and documentation in the record supports the $9,000 repair cost. We affirm the road repair cost included in the court\u2019s restitution order.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">\n<em>e. Aluminum Boats</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">\u00b624 The District Court\u2019s restitution order included $500 for the value of two aluminum boats Simpson allegedly stole from Appley\u2019s property. Simpson argues that this award was improper because he was not charged with stealing the boats. Although Simpson agreed to pay restitution for charges dismissed under the plea agreement, he did not agree to pay for items that he was never charged with stealing. We have disallowed restitution for offenses that defendants have not admitted, been found guilty of or agreed to pay. <em>Breeding, </em>\u00b6 19; <em>In re B.W., </em>2014 MT 27, \u00b6 23, 373 Mont. 409, 318 P.3d 682.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">\u00b625 The State charged Simpson with three counts of theft. The information lists the property he was accused of stealing as \u201cradiators, scrap metal and automobile parts,\u201d and \u201ca 1951 GMC Pickup and a 1940 Oldsmobile.\u201d The charging documents include no reference to the allegedly stolen boats. Appley did not report the boats missing until approximately a month after the charges were filed against Simpson. When questioned at the hearing, Simpson denied stealing the boats. The evidence presented regarding the boats does not establish that Simpson admitted to stealing them or that he agreed to pay restitution for the loss. Accordingly, we reverse the District Court\u2019s imposition of restitution for the two aluminum boats.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">\n<em>f. 1951 GMC truck</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">\u00b626 Simpson finally disputes the court\u2019s valuation of a 1951 GMC truck. The District Court included $4,000 in restitution for the truck, which Simpson admitted to having taken from the property. The court relied on Appley\u2019s testimony that he estimated that the truck was valued at approximately $4,000. Appley based his testimony on the fact that he found a similar truck, in good condition, worth $17,000. Because his truck was not in good condition, Appley opined that $4,000 was an acceptable valuation. Appley\u2019s testimony was not supported by any documentation of a similar make or model truck with the value he ascribed. Instead, the PSI author explained that she was unable to determine a specific value for the truck and found advertisements for similar trucks in good condition being sold for $2,800 and $5,000. The trucks in these advertisements appear to be in much better condition than Appley\u2019s truck. The defense included as an exhibit at the restitution hearing a picture of Appley\u2019s truck showing that it was riddled with bullet holes. Appley testified that he previously had received restitution for damage to the truck from that vandalism.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>\u00b627 Although \u201cdocumentation supporting the claimed loss is not generally required,\u201d we have held that restitution is not supported by substantial evidence where the evidence before the court is conflicting and no other testimony or evidence is available to be examined or reviewed as to the discrepancy. <em>Aragon, </em>\u00b6 20. Losses must be calculated by reasonable methods based on the best information available under the circumstances. <em>McMaster, </em>\u00b6 28. In <em>Aragon, </em>the court was faced with two estimates for repair to a garage that the defendant damaged in a drunk-driving incident. <em>Aragon, </em>\u00b6 6. The estimates were significantly different because one included the cost of repainting the house \u201cto match the current color.\u201d <em>Aragon, </em>\u00b6 18. We reversed the District Court\u2019s decision to use the more expensive estimate because there was no evidence indicating that the house needed to be painted and \u201c[a] reasonable mind could not conclude, solely from the two estimates, that one was more appropriate than the other.\u201d <em>Aragon, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">\u00b628 Here, the District Court relied on Appley\u2019s guess that his truck was worth $4,000 and ignored the prices in the advertisements included in the PSI. As in <em>Aragon, </em>the court did not give context for its decision to choose one estimate over another. A reasonable mind cannot conclude, from the competing evidence before the District Court, that Appley\u2019s evidence was more appropriate to use. Accordingly, we reverse the court\u2019s imposition of restitution for the $4,000 value of the GMC truck and remand for further factual findings to determine a proper amount of restitution for this item of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">\u00b629  We affirm the District Court\u2019s order of restitution to Johnson and Coder because of Simpson\u2019s failure to preserve the objection he raises on appeal. We also affirm the Court\u2019s order of restitution to Appley for the value of scrap metal, road repairs, miscellaneous parts and radiators. We reverse the court\u2019s restitution to Appley for the aluminum boats and the 1951 GMC truck. We remand for further factual findings regarding the proper amount of restitution for Appley\u2019s 1951 GMC truck.</p>\n<judges id=\"b425-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
