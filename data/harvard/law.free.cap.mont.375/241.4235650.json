Pound appeals and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">\u00b62 Pound presents the following issues for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">\u00b63 Issue One: Whether the District Court erred when it found that the victim was unable to testify in open court in the presence of Pound.</p>\n<p id=\"AoJ\">\u00b64 Issue Two: Whether the District Court erred when it allowed the State to present the testimony of a forensic interviewer about the victim\u2019s statements that were inconsistent with the victim\u2019s trial testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">\u00b65 In December 2011 the State charged Jimmy Pound with felony sexual assault against his girlfriend\u2019s 4-year-old daughter, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-502, MCA. A jury found Pound guilty in June 2012 and in September 2012 the District Court designated him a Tier III sexual offender and sentenced him to 75 years in the Montana State Prison with 10 years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">\u00b66 Prior to trial the State moved pursuant to \u00a7 46-16-227, MCA, that the victim, who was then age 5, be allowed to testify outside the presence of Pound. The District Court conducted an evidentiary hearing on the issue and received briefs. Kathleen Shea, a licensed clinical social worker testified based upon her five sessions with the victim. She described the victim as being developmentally younger than her actual age, and as having had little peer interaction. She found that the victim becomes very anxious when separated from her mother. The victim had age-appropriate verbal skills but a limited vocabulary.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">\u00b67 The victim described to Shea Pound\u2019s sexual contact with her vaginal area, and that it had happened more than once. After making that disclosure, the victim had great difficulty concentrating or focusing. She described chronic nightmares, poor appetite and restlessness. She was hyper-vigilant regarding her mother\u2019s safety and had great difficulty separating from her mother. The victim said she was \u201cvery afraid\u201d of Pound and became \u201cnoticeably anxious\u201d when talking about him. Shea found that the victim acted very differently when talking about Pound. She became agitated, stopped talking and stopped making eye contact. Shea testified that the victim had her own genuine fear of Pound.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-11\">\u00b68 Shea concluded that the victim would likely \u201cfreeze\u201d if called to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>testify \u201cin front of any of us\u201d but especially in front of Pound. Shea concluded that it was likely that the victim would be unable to testify in Pound\u2019s presence and that forcing her to do so would likely lead to substantial emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">\u00b69 Based upon the hearing testimony concerning the victim and her relationship with Pound, the District Court found that the victim acts younger than her stated age and that testifying in front of Pound would cause her \u201ca great deal of fear.\u201d The District Court found that this fear would prevent the victim from testifying and could cause her \u201csubstantial emotional distress, setting backher therapy.\u201d The District Court found that the victim described suffering trauma inflicted by Pound and that he had hurt her a great deal.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">\u00b610 The District Court concluded \u201cby clear and convincing evidence that the child would be unable to testify in open court in the presence of Defendant and that the child would suffer substantial emotional trauma from testifying in the presence of Defendant.\u201d The District Court ordered that the victim\u2019s testimony be given in a separate room attended by the judge, both attorneys and the court reporter. Pound and the jury would watch the victim\u2019s testimony in real time by an audio-video device. The District Court further ordered that Pound have a \u201cmeans of immediate private communication with his attorney during the testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">At trial the victim was a reluctant witness. On direct examination she testified that someone had \u201cbothered\u201d her but that she did not remember his name. She said she had nothing to tell the court about Pound and that he had not \u201cbothered\u201d her. She said, however, that she was \u201ctoo scared\u201d to tell the truth about Pound. The victim testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-7\">Q. So are you willing to tell - can you tell the judge the truth? Is that a yes or a no?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-8\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-9\">Q. So tell the Judge what the truth is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-10\">A. I don't remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-11\">Q.

What color were they?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-10\">A. Different colors on the bones.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-11\">Q. Did you say balloons or bones?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-12\">A. Bones. And then the bones were different colors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-13\">\u00b611 She persistently responded to questions by saying she could not remember, but said that she had told the truth to her grandma. She testified that she told her grandma that Pound had used his finger and \u201ctouched my privates.\u201d She described the pajamas she was wearing and said that the touching happened at the \u201cbrick house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-14\">\u00b6 12 Defense counsel asked the victim if she remembered talking to the forensic examiner Paula Samms, but she did not. She said that her grandma had told her to tell the truth, and after agreeing with many things the attorney asked, said \u201cI\u2019m getting bored.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-15\">\u00b613 After the victim testified the State offered the testimony of Paula Samms, a forensic interview specialist, and director of the County Child Advocacy Center. Samms had conducted an interview with the victim in which the victim had described Pound\u2019s sexual conduct with her. The defense objected to any testimony from Samms about what the victim had told her on the ground that the State had not shown the victim her prior statement and had not questioned her about the prior statement. The defense also objected to Samms\u2019 testimony as a violation of the right of confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-16\">\u00b614 After hearing arguments, the District Court concluded that Samms could testify about the victim\u2019s statements that were inconsistent with the victim\u2019s trial testimony, but that the State could not introduce the entire interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-17\">\u00b615 Samms testified that the victim told her that Pound had used \u201cslippity stuff when he touched her privates and that it tickled. Samms testified that the victim told her that Pound had tom a hole in the crotch of her paj amas. Samms testified that the victim said she had watched \u201csexy\u201d movies with Pound, and remembered seeing two girls kiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-18\">\u00b616 The State also presented the testimony of a neighbor who had babysat for the victim. The neighbor testified about the victim\u2019s pajamas with the hole in the crotch, and the victim\u2019s statement to her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>that Pound had caused the hole and \u201cneeds to stop touching me.\u201d The victim told the babysitter that Pound had touched her three times. The babysitter\u2019s testimony is not at issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">\u00b617 A district court has broad discretion to determine the relevancy and admissibility of evidence, and this Court will not overturn evidentiary rulings absent a showing of abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Lotter, </em>2013 MT 336, \u00b6 13, 372 Mont. 445, 313 P.3d 148; <em>State v. Berosik, </em>2009 MT 260, \u00b6 28, 352 Mont. 16, 214 P.3d 776. We review a district court\u2019s application of a statute or rule of evidence de novo to determine whether it is correct, <em>hotter, </em>\u00b6 13. A court abuses its discretion if it acts arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason, resulting in substantial injustice. <em>State v. Breeding, </em>2008 MT 162, \u00b6 10, 343 Mont. 323, 184 P.3d 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">\u00b618 We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Olson v. Jude, </em>2003 MT 186, \u00b6 34, 316 Mont. 438, 73 P. 3d 809. We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>Brimstone Mining, Inc. v. Glaus, </em>2003 MT 236, \u00b6 20, 317 Mont. 236, 77 P.3d 175. A finding of fact may be clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence in the record; if the district court misapprehended the evidence; or when our review of the record leaves this Court with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. <em>Brimstone, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">\u00b619 The district court is in the best position to observe and determine the credibility of witnesses and we will not second guess its determination regarding the strength and weight of conflicting testimony. <em>Tomlin Enterprises, Inc. v. Althoff, </em>2004 MT 383, \u00b6 22, 325 Mont. 99, 103 P.3d 1069; <em>Shors v. Branch, </em>221 Mont. 390, 399, 720 P.2d 239, 245 (1986). On appeal the district court\u2019s findings of fact are construed in favor of the prevailing party, <em>Tomlin, </em>\u00b6 22, and the district court\u2019s findings will be upheld even if the evidence could have supported different findings. <em>Brimstone, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">\u00b620 This Court exercises de novo plenary review of a district court\u2019s decision on constitutional issues. <em>State v. Baker, </em>2013 MT 113, \u00b6 17, 370 Mont. 43, 300 P.3d 696.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">\u00b621 Issue One: Whether the District Court erred when it found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>the victim was unable to testify in open court in the presence of Pound.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">\u00b622 Section 46-16-227, MCA, provides that upon motion, the district court shall conduct a hearing to \"consider whether the testimony of a child witness may be taken outside the presence of the defendant and communicated to the courtroom by two-way electronic audio-video communication.\u201d The district court is required to consider a nonexclusive list of factors found in \u00a7 46-16-228(3), MCA, including \u201cany other matter that the court considers relevant. \u201d The district court may order that the child testify outside the presence of the defendant if it finds by \u201cclear and convincing evidence that the child witness is unable to testify in open court in the presence of the defendant...\u201d Section 46-16-229(1), MCA. The district court must conclude that the child witness is unable to testify because of fear caused by being in the presence of the defendant; because the child would suffer emotional trauma from testifying in the presence of the defendant; or if the conduct of the defendant or the defendant\u2019s attorney causes the child to be unable to continue testifying. Section 46-14-229(1), MCA; <em>State v. Stock, </em>2011 MT 131, \u00b6\u00b6 19-21, 361 Mont. 1, 256 P.3d 899.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">\u00b623 In this case the State filed the motion under \u00a7 46-16-227, MCA, and the District Court held the hearing and issued a written order. The District Court\u2019s order specifically considered each of the factors set forth in \u00a7 46-16-228(3), MCA. The District Court\u2019s order concluded that the victim would be unable to testify in the presence of Pound and that she would suffer \u201csubstantial emotional trauma\u201d if forced to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"AxF\">\u00b624 Pound contends that the District Court abused its discretion by ordering that the victim testify outside of his presence, \u201cchoosing to adopt the most extreme version\u201d of Shea\u2019s testimony. Pound contends that the District Court ignored conflicts in the facts and reached only \u201cconclusory assumptions\u201d regarding the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">\u00b625 The District Court is in the best position to observe and determine the credibility of witnesses and we will not second guess its determination regarding the strength and weight of conflicting testimony. <em>Tomlin, </em>\u00b6 22; <em>Shors, </em>221 Mont. at 399, 720 P.2d at 245. We construe the District Court\u2019s findings of fact in a light favorable to the prevailing party, <em>Tomlin, </em>\u00b6 22, and the findings will be upheld even if the evidence could have supported different findings. <em>Brimstone, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"Atm\">\u00b626 In this case the District Court properly and carefully followed the statutory requirements set out in \u00a7\u00a7 46-16-227, -228 and -229, MCA. The District Court heard and evaluated the testimony, considering the factors in \u00a7 46-16-228(3), MCA, as they were relevant to this case. Based upon the evidence the District Court found that the victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>would be unable to testify in Pound\u2019s presence because of the fear it would cause her, and that forcing her to testify in his presence would cause her substantial emotional trauma. Section 46-16-229, MCA. We do not agree that the District Court mischaracterized or overstated Shea\u2019s testimony. We will not second-guess the District Court\u2019s evaluation of the testimony and will not reverse because the evidence might have supported other findings or conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">\u00b627  There was no abuse of discretion and we conclude that the District Court did not err in ordering that the child victim testify outside the presence of Pound.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">\u00b628 Issue Two: Whether the District Court erred when it allowed the State to present the testimony of a forensic interviewer about the victim\u2019s statements that were inconsistent with the victim\u2019s trial testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">\u00b629 While the State offered the entire transcript of forensic examiner Samms\u2019 interview with the victim, the District Court allowed only those portions that were inconsistent with the victim\u2019s testimony at trial. Pound contends that the District Court erred by admitting Samms\u2019 testimony about statements the victim made to her. Pound contends that the State failed to provide notice of its intent to have Samms testify about the victim\u2019s statements to her and failed to lay a proper foundation for Samms\u2019 testimony during the direct examination of the victim. Pound also contends that Samms\u2019 testimony about the victim\u2019s statements to her violated M. R. Evid. 613 and 801, and violated his constitutional right to confront witnesses against him.</p>\n<p id=\"A8M\">\u00b630 Both Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution and Amendment VI of the United States Constitution provide a defendant with the right to confront or to face the witnesses against him. <em>State v. Maier, </em>1999 MT 51, \u00b6 18, 293 Mont. 403, 977 P.3d 298; <em>Stock, </em>\u00b6 23. The essential purpose of the right to confront witnesses is to secure the opportunity to test the witness\u2019 testimony through cross-examination. <em>Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 678, 106 S. Ct. 1431, 1435 (1986); <em>Stock, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">\u00b631 The right to confrontation \u201cincludes no guarantee that every witness called by the prosecution will refrain from giving testimony that is marred by forgetfulness, confusion or evasion.\u201d <em>United States v. Owens, </em>484 U. S. 554, 558, 108 S. Ct. 838, 842 (1988). The right to confront includes the opportunity for cross-examination, but not any guarantee that it will elicit helpful evidence. <em>Owens, </em>484 U. S. at 558, 108 S. Ct. at 842.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">\u00b632 Both Federal and State decisions establish that the right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>confront witnesses is not violated when a testifying witness\u2019s prior statement is admitted into evidence. <em>California v. Green, </em>399 U. S. 149, 90 S. Ct. 1930 (1970); <em>Maier, </em>\u00b6 44. When a witness appears at trial and is available for cross-examination, the right to confrontation does not constrain admission of prior testimonial statements by the witness. <em>State v. Howard, </em>2011 MT 246, \u00b6 33, 362 Mont. 196, 265 P.3d 606 <em>(citing Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U. S. 36, 124 S. Ct. 1354 (2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"AnL\">\u00b633 Montana Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(A) provides that a statement is not hearsay if it is a prior statement by a witness who testifies at trial subject to cross-examination, and the prior statement is <em>inconsistent </em>with the witness\u2019s testimony. It is established that a \u201cclaimed lapse of memory is an inconsistency within the meaning of Rule 801(d)(1)(A).\u201d <em>State v. Lawrence, </em>285 Mont. 140, 159, 948 P.2d 186, 198 (1997). Similarly, direct testimony that is marked by \u201cevasion, denial, and inability to remember,\u201d or is \u201cevasive and uncooperative\u201d can be an inconsistent statement under the same rule. <em>Maier, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 26-28. Montana Rule of Evidence 613(b) provides that extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement is not admissible unless the witness is afforded the opportunity to explain or deny it and the opposing party has an opportunity to interrogate the witness on it, or if \u201cthe interests of justice otherwise require.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">\u00b634 It is clear that Pound knew about the Samms interview and about its contents from the inception of the case. The existence of the Samms interview of the victim and a detailed summary of the contents of the interview were set out in the affidavit filed in support of the motion for leave to file the information. The information charging Pound listed Samms as a witness. Therefore, there was no lack of notice or failure to disclose with regard to the Samms interview or its contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">\u00b635 Pound contends that the State failed to lay a proper foundation for Samms\u2019 testimony during its direct examination of the victim. Pound contends that the State failed to afford the victim an opportunity to explain or deny the contents of her prior statement to Samms, as required by M. R. Evid. 613(b). Pound contends in turn that the State\u2019s limited direct examination of the victim precluded him from effectively cross-examining her or Samms regarding the Samms interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">\u00b636 During the State\u2019s direct examination of the victim she testified that Pound (\u201cJimmy\u201d) had touched her privates with his finger, but that she did not remember how it felt, and that her pajamas were ripped. She testified that she was scared to tell the truth and could not remember the truth. She testified that Pound had touched her in a brick house and denied that she had ever watched movies with him. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>She testified that her grandmother was the only person she had ever talked to about Pound and that she had never told anyone else the truth about him. On cross-examination, the defense asked the victim if she remembered talking to Samms and the victim said \u201cno\u201d but remembered talking several times with \u201cTara.\u201d She denied ever having gone into a room like the one in which the Samms interview took place. She was asked whether she made a number of specific statements that were in the Samms interview. She both admitted and denied making most of them. She acknowledged telling Samms that Pound had touched her \u201cpee pee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">\u00b637 Several things are clear from the victim\u2019s testimony. It was clearly marked by \u201cevasion, denial [and] inability to remember\u201d as described in <em>Maier, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 26-28. Because the victim gave different and more consistent responses to many of the same questions in the interview with Samms, those responses were prior inconsistent statements as provided for in M. R. Evid. 801(d)(1)(A). <em>Lawrence, </em>285 Mont. at 159, 948 P.2d at 198. In <em>State v. Baker, </em>2013 MT 113, 370 Mont. 43, 300 P.3d 696, this Court examined a situation similar to the present case. Baker was charged with sexual contact with his girlfriend\u2019s daughter when she was about age 4. The victim was interviewed by a forensic examiner and told her that Baker had touched her in a bad way and had put his privates into her privates. At trial she testified that Baker was mean, but that what he did was a secret that she could not tell. She testified that she had told the secret only to her mom and that she did not recall the forensic interview. The district court allowed the State to play a recording of the forensic interview to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">\u00b638  Baker made the same contentions as Pound now makes, arguing that the State failed to lay a sufficient foundation during its direct examination of the victim, and that this failure prevented defense counsel from conducting effective cross-examination. This Court concluded that the State\u2019s direct examination of the victim provided sufficient foundation for introduction of an inconsistent statement, and that it provided \u201csufficient opening\u201d for defense counsel to conduct an effective cross-examination. <em>Baker, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 23-26. This Court reached the same result under similar facts in <em>State v. Howard, </em>2011 MT 246, \u00b6 33, 362 Mont. 196, 265 P.3d 606. In the present case there was sufficient foundation that the victim denied or could not remember her prior statements to Samms. The victim\u2019s prior statements to Samms were inconsistent with her trial testimony and were therefore admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>\u00b639 It is also clear that admission of a prior statement that is inconsistent with a witness\u2019s trial testimony, pursuant to M. R. Evid. 613(b) and 801(d)(1)(A), is not a violation of an accused\u2019s constitutional right of confrontation. It is established that when a witness is available for cross-examination at trial, the confrontation clause does not prohibit admission of extrinsic evidence of prior inconsistent statements. <em>Maier, </em>\u00b6 21, citing <em>Green, Owens, </em>and <em>Baker, </em>\u00b6 26. It is not a violation of the right of confrontation if the prior inconsistent statement is introduced into evidence after the testimony of the witness in question. <em>Howard, </em>\u00b6 33. The District Court limited Samms\u2019 testimony to the victim\u2019s statements that were inconsistent with her trial testimony. Therefore, the State did not get to present the victim\u2019s same testimony twice.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">\u00b640  The District Court properly applied established Montana law in this case and did not abuse its discretion. The conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b275-5\">JUSTICES RICE, COTTER, BAKER and McKINNON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
