We reverse. We restate the issue on appeal as follows:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">\u00b62 Was Plouffe\u2019s constitutional right against compelled self-incrimination, guaranteed by Article II, Section 25 of the Montana Constitution and the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution, violated by the State\u2019s use of confidential Treatment Court material?</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">\u00b63 Plouffe was charged in 2011 with trespass to property and possession of dangerous drugs (marijuana), both misdemeanor offenses. At his initial appearance in Justice Court, Plouffe was advised of his rights, including his right to counsel. Justice of the Peace Wanda James advised Plouffe that he may be eligible to participate in the Mineral County Treatment Court (Treatment Court), and Plouffe expressed interest in doing so. Judge James then contacted the public defender\u2019s office to notify it that Plouffe needed to be appointed counsel. Public defender Kirk Krutilla was appointed, although Plouffe maintains that he never met with any defense counsel regarding either of the two charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">\u00b64 The Treatment Court has a Treatment Team consisting of professionals who assist Judge James with processing cases. The Treatment Team includes Judge James, County Attorney Marcia Boris, Mineral County Sheriff Ernie Ornelas, and two probation and parole officers, Tim Case and Jay Childress. Initially, the Treatment Team included defense attorney Krutilla, but the Team at the time had no defense attorney due to a lack of funding. Nevertheless, although Krutilla no longer officially participated in Treatment Court, it appears he at least reviewed the Treatment Agreement with Plouffe, as Plouffe\u2019s Treatment Agreement was signed by Kirk Krutilla, \u201cAttorney for Defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">\u00b65 Before Plouffe could participate in Treatment Court, he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>required to enter into a written Treatment Agreement. The Treatment Agreement is governed by the provisions of the Drug Offender Accountability and Treatment Act, Title 46, chapter 1, part 11, MCA. Plouffe signed a Treatment Agreement to enroll in Treatment Court, along with two of his friends, Christopher Hewitt and Roger Raedel. Pursuant to the Treatment Agreement, Plouffe entered conditional guilty pleas to the two misdemeanors. Sentencing was continued until he either successftdly completed Treatment Court, or was otherwise discharged from the program. The Treatment Agreement provided that if Plouffe successftdly completed Treatment Court, he would be able to withdraw his guilty pleas and have the charges dismissed. However, if Plouffe did not successftdly complete Treatment Court and was discharged from the program, the Treatment Agreement provided he would \u201cbe sentenced by the Mineral County Justice of the Peace in a manner consistent with the sentences typically imposed on other defendants for comparable offenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">\u00b66 The Treatment Agreement emphasized the extended period needed for treatment, depending on the \u201ctreatment issues\u201d and \u201cpace of progress\u201d of the participant, and that it was likely a participant would be enrolled in Treatment Court a minimum of 18 months. The Treatment Agreement also required that Plouffe waive several rights in order to obtain treatment. Plouffe was required to waive his right to speedy trial, his right to assert any claim based on the delay in sentencing, and his privilege of confidentiality that attaches to records maintained by health care providers. The Treatment Agreement required Plouffe to release confidential information from his treatment providers to the Treatment Team, and allow for the sharing of confidential information between Treatment Team members and the court so that Plouffe\u2019s progress, or lack thereof, could be assessed and monitored.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">\u00b67 The Treatment Agreement also required Plouffe to comply with a number of conditions, including to \u201ccheck in with the Mineral County Misdemeanor Probation Officer as directed and follow all reasonable directives of the probation officer.\u201d He was required to submit to random drug testing that was requested by a Treatment Team member. The Treatment Agreement explained that a positive drug test result was sufficient to conclude that Plouffe had violated program rules and would result in an appropriate sanction, to which Plouffe would \u201cpromptly submit.\u201d Reasonable incentives may include but are not limited to: graduation certificates, early graduation, fee reduction or waiver of fees, record expungement of the underlying case, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>reduced contact with a probation officer. Section 46-1-1104(3), MCA. Sanctions may include: a short-term jail sentence, fines, extensions of time in the program, peer review, geographical restrictions, termination, or contempt of court. Section 46-1-1104(4), MCA. Plouffe also agreed to \u201chonestly answer all questions asked by team members, counselors, therapists or law enforcement personnel including the probation officer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">\u00b68 Plouffe, as is typical of participants in a treatment court, had varied success in complying with Treatment Court requirements. Relevant to the instant proceedings, in October 2011, Plouffe was ordered not to associate with Hewitt and Raedel while a participant in Treatment Court, as the three were suspected of using drugs together. Further, Plouffe was rewarded early in his Treatment Court progress with a \u201cweek off\u201d for his \u201cgreat honesty,\u201d and for successfully completing a report about honesty. In spite of this, Plouffe was sanctioned on August 3, 2011, and September 14, 2011, for being dishonest and received a four-day jail sentence and house arrest, respectively. Plouffe was therefore aware of the significance Treatment Court placed on being honest and that he could be sanctioned with incarceration if his actions were interpreted by the Treatment Team as dishonest. He also understood that he was not to associate with Hewitt and Raedel.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">First, non-Mirandized, interview</p>\n<p id=\"Amh\">\u00b69 On October 5,2011, Treatment Team member Case administered a routine urinalysis (UA) to Plouffe, Hewitt, and Raedel pursuant to standard Treatment Court procedures. All three tested positive for benzodiazepine. A few days prior, Hewitt\u2019s grandmother, Ms. Mary Mellen, reported to the Mineral County Sheriffs Office that someone had stolen prescription pills from a locked box in her home. The investigating sheriffs deputy learned that numerous people had access to the locked box, and law enforcement was thus unable to determine who had taken the pills. Case explained to the District Court that generally, when a Treatment Court participant has a positive UA, he asks the participant the type and quantity of the drug the participant ingested, and where it was obtained. Case decided it was necessary to separate Plouffe, Hewitt, and Raedel to ask them these questions individually. Case thus requested Sheriff Ornelas, also a Treatment Team member, to assist with questioning. Case next requested assistance from felony probation officer Valerie Chestnut, who was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>apparently filling in for Treatment Team member Childress.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Case told Ornelas and Chestnut that he was suspicious of Plouffe\u2019s UA results in light of the recent report of theft by Hewitt\u2019s grandmother.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">\u00b610 Plouffe was attending an AA meeting when Case removed him for questioning about his positive UA. Case did not advise Plouffe of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. In separate rooms, Ornelas and Chestnut questioned Raedel and Hewitt, respectively, also without advising them of their <em>Miranda </em>rights. Plouffe, Hewitt, and Raedel were asked why they had tested positive. Raedel stated that Hewitt had stolen pills from Hewitt\u2019s grandmother, Ms. Mellen. Plouffe and Hewitt, however, reported a different incident involving Valium.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Second, Mirandized, interview</p>\n<p id=\"AVq\">\u00b611 After considering the report on the unresolved theft of Ms. Mellen\u2019s prescription drugs, Ornelas decided to conduct a second, more in-depth interview. Plouffe, Hewitt, and Raedel were taken to the Sheriff\u2019s Office and Case read them their <em>Miranda </em>rights. Case and Chestnut questioned Plouffe, separate from Hewitt and Raedel, in an attempt to \u201cget the story of why it was that they were positive.\u201d Case explained to the District Court that he advised Plouffe of his <em>Miranda </em>rights just to be cautious, and that he did not contemplate that there would be new criminal charges. Case, as a misdemeanor probation officer employed by Mineral County to work on the Treatment Team, had no authority to conduct felony criminal investigations. Case described his role in the interview process as follows: \u201cI was not gathering evidence for a new crime. I was getting to the truth on a bad UA, which led to information on a new crime.\u201d During this second interview, Plouffe admitted that he had used Valium, but denied possessing any of the stolen pills.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>\u00b612 Plouffe was never informed during this second interview that the questioning was related to a new charge and unrelated to Treatment Court. Rather, the second interview was conducted under the auspices of Treatment Court, as evidenced by Case\u2019s statement that \u201cthey handled this case the way they had handled every other drug court investigation.\u201d While conducting the interview, Case emphasized the importance of telling the truth on multiple occasions, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-5\">Case: And who did they tell you did it? Stole [the prescription pills]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-6\">Plouffe: (inaudible) younger (inaudible)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-7\">Case: Who?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-8\">Plouffe: I ain\u2019t gonna say anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-9\">Case: This, we\u2019re beyond the \u201cI\u2019m not gonna rat out somebody.\u201d We already, we\u2019re already here at this place and this isn\u2019t about you saying that he did it or this, this isn\u2019t, we\u2019re not, we\u2019re now at the point of just comparing stories. So I mean, I\u2019ve never led you wrong, I\u2019ve only tried to help you, ya know, so whatever you want to say but be honest is gonna be the most helpful thing for you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-10\">Case:... the confusing part is [Hewitt and Raedel] are surprisingly more honest and open about all of it than you\u2019re being and I really expected you\u2019d be more open \u2018cause it, you....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-11\">Plouffe: I\u2019m being open, I\u2019m telling you the truth. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-12\">Case: Okay so why don\u2019t you tell us, \u2018cause obviously you know who lives [at the house where the Valium was purchased]. And I know who lives there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-13\">Plouffe: I even know who lives there now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-14\">Case: So this is where I\u2019m talking about you not being completely honest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-15\">Case: Right now, are [Hewitt and Raedel] hiding? If we wanted, if we need to go find \u2018em, are they in the 5th wheel, do you have any idea where [Hewitt] would be stupid enough to hide them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AsC\">Plouffe: Chris probably, I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-16\">Case: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-17\">Plouffe: I\u2019m being honest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-18\">Case: I know, okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-19\">Plouffe: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-20\">Case:... Uh, so thank you for being honest okay?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-21\">At the conclusion of the interview, Case told Plouffe that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>information Plouffe provided would be discussed with Judge James and result in a sanction. Case later explained that at the time he made that statement, he thought that a Treatment Court sanction would be the only result from the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">Third, Mirandized, interview</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">\u00b613 As a result of their two interviews, Case and Chestnut decided to turn over all the information gathered to the Sheriff\u2019s Office, and that \u201c[the Sheriff\u2019s Office] would decide if they were going to investigate it further \u2014 if it was a new crime.\u201d After reviewing this new information, Sheriff Ornelas assigned Deputy Joseph Bettis to investigate further. Case testified in the District Court that he then advised Bettis, who was not a Treatment Team member, \u201cabout the three individuals, since I knew them, and had been working with all three of them\u201d and \u201c[I could] give him the information that we had.\u201d Thereafter, Bettis conducted a third interview, in which Case participated. Case described his participation as, \u201cI just helped where I saw a need to,\u201d so that \u201c[I could] help clarify details, direction, who they are, who they were involved with, family members, stuff like that.\u201d Bettis started his interview of Plouffe by reading him his <em>Miranda </em>rights and asking Plouffe if he knew why he was being questioned. Plouffe responded that he was there because he was being blamed for stealing pills, and because of a positive UA. At no time during this third interview was Plouffe informed that he was being investigated for new criminal charges or that the questioning was unrelated to Treatment Court. Although Case explained to the District Court that he did not intend to ask any questions during this third interview, he nevertheless asked a \u201cfew\u201d questions on \u201cthings that I thought Deputy Bettis was either confused on, or where I could see where there was miscommunication between the two of them, just due to my knowing the offenders as much as I did.\u201d At the end of the interview Bettis informed Plouffe that he was going to turn the information over to County Attorney Marcia Boris. As previously noted, Boris was also a member of the Treatment Team. A review of this third interview confirms that there were more than nine instances in which Bettis cautioned Plouffe about being dishonest, not telling \u201cthe whole story,\u201d lying, or not being truthful. Upon conclusion of this third interview, Plouffe had again admitted that he used Valium and, in contrast to his earlier statement, that he had used and sold some of the pills Hewitt stole from his grandmother. Plouffe revealed that he, Hewitt, and Raedel \u201call sold a few\u201d and that he had sold five to ten pills.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">\u00b614 During the same timeframe these interviews were being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>conducted, the Treatment Team held its weekly staffing meeting and considered Plouffe\u2019s treatment progress. As a result of Plouffe\u2019s positive UA, Plouffe received an \u201cF\u201d for the week and was sanctioned to seven days in jail. The record does not establish whether the Treatment Team, in imposing its sanction, considered Plouffe\u2019s \u201chonesty\u201d during the interviews when he divulged the nature and source of his drug usage and other incriminating information.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">\u00b615 Following the third interview, Case sent a report to Sheriff Ornelas, County Attorney Boris, Chestnut, and Bettis detailing the information he learned from all three interviews with Plouffe. Boris then filed an Affidavit of Probable Cause and Complaint in Justice Court, accusing Plouffe of distribution of dangerous drugs in violation of \u00a7 45-9-101, MCA, and two counts of possession of dangerous drugs in violation of \u00a7 45-9-102, MCA. An Information was subsequently filed in District Court charging Plouffe with the same offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">\u00b616 Plouffe filed motions to suppress and dismiss, arguing in part that the State had: violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel; violated his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination; and violated the confidentiality provision of \u00a7 46-1-1111(4), MCA, by disclosing the results of his UA to persons not on the Treatment Team. Judge James testified at the suppression hearing that she did not believe Treatment Team members could share confidential information with individuals who were not on the Treatment Team and, further, that allowing for such would undercut the purpose of Treatment Court. Plouffe testified that he believed the interviews would only result in his being sanctioned by the Treatment Court, and that he feared he would be sanctioned if he was not honest with Case, or if he refused to answer Case\u2019s questions. Plouffe stated that he understood he was providing incriminating information.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">\u00b617 The District Court denied Plouffe\u2019s motions. Plouffe entered into an agreement to plead guilty to possession of dangerous drugs, expressly reserving his right to appeal the rulings on the motions to suppress and dismiss. Plouffe received a three-year deferred sentence and was required to enter and complete the boot camp program.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">\u00b618 The interpretation of a statute is a matter of law, and we review whether the district court correctly interpreted and applied a statute de novo. <em>State v. Shively, </em>2009 MT 252, \u00b6 13, 351 Mont. 513, 216 P.3d 732 (citing <em>State v. McWilliams, </em>2008 MT 59, \u00b6 22, 341 Mont. 517, 178 P.3d 121; <em>State v. Triplett, </em>2008 MT 360, \u00b6 13, 346 Mont. 383, 195 P.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>819). We review a motion to suppress to determine whether a district court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous, and whether those findings were correctly applied as a matter of law. <em>State v. Dawson, </em>1999 MT 171, \u00b6 13, 295 Mont. 212, 983 P.2d 916 (citing State <em>v. Parker, </em>1998 MT 6, \u00b6 17, 287 Mont. 151, 953 P.2d 692; State <em>v. Roberts, </em>284 Mont. 54, 56, 943 P.2d 1249, 1250 (1997)). \u201cThe grant or denial of a motion to dismiss in a criminal proceeding is a question of law which we review de novo to determine whether the district court\u2019s conclusion of law is correct.\u201d State <em>v. Walker, </em>2008 MT 244, \u00b6 9, 344 Mont. 477, 188 P.3d 1069 (citing State <em>v. Weaver, </em>2008 MT 86, \u00b6 9, 342 Mont. 196, 179 P.3d 534; State <em>v. Luckett, </em>2007 MT 47, \u00b6 6, 336 Mont. 140, 152 P.3d 1279).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">\u00b619 We have not previously had occasion to resolve a dispute arising from a treatment court proceeding, despite treatment courts having been in existence in Montana since 2005. The premier authority on the goals and practice guidelines of treatment courts can be found in the Key Components established by the National Association of Drug Court Professionals (NADCP) and the United States Department of Justice. <em>See </em>Natl. Assn, of Drug Court Professionals, Drug Court Standards Committee, <em>Defining Drug Courts: The Key Components </em>(U.S. Dept, of Just., Bureau of Just. Assistance, Oct. 2004). Drawing from the Key Components, the terms of the particular Treatment Agreement currently at issue, and the provisions of the Drug Offender Accountability and Treatment Act, we make severed observations about the functioning of treatment courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">\u00b620 To begin, treatment courts operate in a manner that is fundamentally different than that of the traditional adversarial system. The shared goals of treatment court \u2014 providing a participant with the tools to combat addiction and to reduce recidivism \u2014 are accomplished through a collaborative approach that addresses a participant\u2019s dependency issues. While each treatment court is different, they all share certain basic elements. In general, honesty is a linchpin to progressing through the phases of treatment court. Participants are rewarded for telling the truth, and sanctioned for lying. When participants attend treatment court\u2019s weekly open sessions, they are rewarded with reduced sanctions when they are truthful about relapses or other violations of the treatment agreement. Treatment court team members meet weekly to discuss the progress of participants. By virtue of statutory provisions and the limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>releases granted by participants for the disclosure of confidential information, the treatment team\u2019s discussions remain confidential and information utilized by the treatment team is for treatment court purposes only. If a participant fails to comply with any of .the rules listed in the treatment court agreement, the treatment team will decide whether to impose a sanction, which may include incarceration and a change in the participant\u2019s treatment plan. Correspondingly, positive behavior is encouraged via incentives, which may include anything from praise to advancement through a phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">\u00b621 The facts of the instant case specifically involve many of these Key Components. Key Component #2 states: \u201cUsing a nonadversarial approach, prosecution and defense counsel promote public safety while protecting participants\u2019 due process rights.\u201d In order to accomplish this goal, the prosecuting attorney must agree \u201cthat a positive drug test or open court admission of drug possession or use will not result in the filing of additional drug charges based on that admission.\u201d Key Component #5, which addresses drug and alcohol testing, states: \u201cFrequent court-ordered AOD [alcohol and other drug] testing is essential. An accurate testing program is the most objective and efficient way to establish a framework for accountability and to gauge each participant\u2019s progress.\u201d Key Component #5 further provides that \u201c[t]imely and accurate test results promote frankness and honesty among all parties\u201d and that \u201cAOD testing is central to the drug court\u2019s monitoring of participant compliance.\u201d Finally, regarding the maintenance of confidential information and its importance to treatment courts, Key Components #4, #8, and #9 require, respectively, that \u201c[i]nformation exchange complies ... with applicable State statutes\u201d; that \u201c[a]utomated manual information systems must adhere to written guidelines that protect against unauthorized disclosure of sensitive personal information about individuals\u201d; and that the Treatment Team be educated regarding \u201cFederal, State and local confidentiality requirements.\u201d These Key Components illustrate that participant honesty, including honesty about drug use, is required to comply with treatment court objectives and rules. In order to facilitate these objectives, the NADCP encourages that certain practice guidelines be established, consistent with state statutes, which maintain the confidentiality of treatment court information</p>\n<p id=\"AsK\">\u00b622 Was <em>Plouffe\u2019s constitutional right against compelled self-incrimination, guaranteed by Article II, Section 25 of the Montana Constitution and the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution, violated by the State\u2019s use of confidential </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number><em>Treatment Court material?</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">\u00b623 The Fifth Amendment and Article II, Section 25, provide that no person shall be compelled to testify against himself or herself in a criminal proceeding. Generally, this right to be free from compelled self-incrimination must be affirmatively invoked by the person claiming the right at the time of questioning; if a person fails to invoke the right then the right will be deemed waived. <em>U.S. v. Monia, </em>317 U.S. 424, 427, 63 S. Ct. 409, 410-11 (1943); <em>State v. Hameline, </em>2008 MT 241, \u00b6 22, 344 Mont. 461, 188 P.3d 1052; <em>State v. Fuller, </em>276 Mont. 155, 160, 915 P.2d 809, 812 (1996). An exception to this general rule exists, however, where a person is not free to admit, deny, or refuse to answer when questioned. <em>Fuller, </em>276 Mont. at 161, 915 P.2d at 812 (citing <em>Minn. v. Murphy, </em>465 U.S. 420, 429, 104 S. Ct. 1136, 1143 (1984)). Such a situation arises when \u201cthe government prevents a voluntary invocation of the Fifth Amendment by threatening to penalize the individual should he or she invoke it.\u201d <em>Fuller, </em>276 Mont. at 162, 915 P.2d at 813; <em>see also State v. Woods, </em>2005 MT 186, \u00b6 18, 328 Mont. 54, 117 P.3d 152. \u201cIf a defendant is in a situation where he is not \u2018free to admit, deny, or refuse to answer,\u2019 then his privilege against self-incrimination is automatic and self-executing.\u201d <em>Woods, </em>\u00b6 18 (quoting <em>Fuller, </em>276 Mont. at 161, 915 P.2d at 812). We have identified this dilemma as a \u201cclassic penalty situation.\u201d <em>Hameline, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">\u00b624  Where an individual reveals incriminating information pursuant to an agreement or a guarantee of confidentiality, that information cannot be used as a basis for a subsequent criminal prosecution. <em>Fuller, </em>276 Mont. at 167, 915 P.2d at 816. As we have stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-6\">We emphasize that this holding does not stand for the proposition that the State may not compel a defendant to answer. It can; indeed, in order for treatment to be effective, it must, because a defendant who refuses to disclose his offense history cannot be successfiilly treated. However, <em>if the State chooses to compel answers to incriminating questions, it cannot use those answers against the defendant in a later criminal proceeding.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-7\"><em>Fuller, </em>276 Mont. at 167, 915 P. 2d at 816 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">\u00b625 In 2005, Montana enacted the Drug Offender Accountability and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Treatment Act. Its purpose was to \u201crecognize that state courts have a jurisdictional basis to implement drug treatment courts to reduce recidivism and restore drug offenders to being productive, law-abiding, and taxpaying citizens.\u201d Section 46-1-1102, MCA. The structure and general operation of drug treatment courts are set forth in \u00a7 46-1-1104, MCA, which provides for a method of graduated sanctions and incentives designed to motivate and support the participant in his or her path toward living a substance-free life which is productive and law-abiding. In order to facilitate these goals and purposes, \u00a7 46-1-1111, MCA, provides for the manner of drug testing, an integral part of the functioning of a drug treatment court, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-4\">(1) The drug treatment court team shall ensure fair, accurate testing and reliable drug testing procedures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-5\">(2) A drug offender must be ordered to submit to frequent, random, and observed drug testing to monitor abstinence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-6\">(3) The results of all drug tests must be provided to the drug treatment court team as soon as practicable but, in the event of a positive test, not later than 7 days from the test.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-7\">(4) <em>Anyone in receipt of drug tests shall maintain the information in confidentiality.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-8\">(5) A drug offender is responsible for costs, pursuant to 46-1-1112(2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">\u00b626 Section 46-1-1111(4), MCA, is clear on its face and prohibits members of a drug court treatment team from sharing drug testing results with non-treatment team members. Case and all other Treatment Team members were therefore prohibited from disclosing the results of Plouffe\u2019s UA to anyone outside the Treatment Team. Plouffe\u2019s belief that the results of his UA would be kept confidential among the Treatment Team was justified and warranted by law. Consequently, the State breached the Treatment Agreement and violated \u00a7 46-1-1111(4), MCA, when it disclosed the results of Plouffe\u2019s UA to persons who were not members of the Treatment Team and, further, when it used Plouffe\u2019s UA as a basis for questioning and investigating a new offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-11\">\u00b627 The State argues that Plouffe\u2019s drug testing results are \u201cconfidential criminal justice information\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 44-5-103(3), MCA, and therefore can be shared with criminal justice agencies. It is a well-established rule of statutory construction that specific provisions prevail over general provisions. <em>Oster v. Valley </em>Co., 2006 MT 180, \u00b6 17, 333 Mont. 76, 140 P.3d 1079 (\u201c[M]ore specific statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>prevail over general provisions of law.\u201d); <em>Taylor v. Dept. of Fish, Wildlife &amp; Parks, </em>205 Mont. 85, 91, 666 P.2d 1228, 1231 (1983) (\u201cWe recognize the rule of statutory construction which provides that special statutes will prevail over general statutes.\u201d); \u00a7 1-2-102, MCA (\u201c[A] particular intent will control a general one that is inconsistent with it\u201d). The State here argues that Plouffe\u2019s drug test results are not controlled by a statute addressing the confidentiality of drug test results within the Drug Offender Accountability and Treatment Act, Title 46, chapter 1, part 11, MCA, but rather by a statute within the Montana Criminal Justice Information Act of 1979, Title 44, chapter 5, parts 1-6, MCA. We are not, however, persuaded. It is clear that \u00a7 46-1-1111(4), MCA, which specifically addresses drug test results in the context of treatment court, controls over the more general confidentiality provisions contained within \u00a7 44-5-103, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">\u00b628 We are also convinced that, apart from the State\u2019s actions in breaching the Treatment Agreement and in violating the provision of \u00a7 46-1-1111(4), MCA, the particular circumstances surrounding Plouffe\u2019s interviews placed Plouffe in a \u201cclassic penalty situation\u201d for which he was compelled to provide incriminating information. There is little question that what initially began as an appropriate inquiry for Treatment Court purposes grew into a criminal investigation of new charges. The common and predominant thread through all three interviews, whether by design or accident, was the presence of and reference to Case and other Treatment Team members. Case testified that he participated in the third interview \u2014 the interview from which the substance of the new charges was ultimately derived \u2014 in order to \u201chelp clarify details, direction, who they are, who they were involved with, family members, stuff like that.\u201d The third interview was conducted by Deputy Bettis, who was not a member of the Treatment Team. The information that Case provided was obtained through his role as a probation officer on the Treatment Team. Significantly, the interviews originated primarily from Plouffe\u2019s positive UA and thereafter grew from Plouffe\u2019s correct belief and corresponding action that he must be honest in order to comply with the requirements of Treatment Court. Plouffe similarly understood that he was providing incriminating information. Bettis\u2019s statement that the results of the interviews would be passed to the prosecutor did little to inform Plouffe that he was not being questioned pursuant to Treatment Court protocol, as the prosecutor was also a member of the Treatment Team and Bettis\u2019s representation was consistent with imposition of a Treatment Court sanction. We therefore conclude that Plouffe was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>placed in the \u201cclassic penalty situation\u201d of having to provide incriminating information or face the alternative of a sanction or discharge from Treatment Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">\u00b629 In reaching this conclusion, we observe that Plouffe had been working with Case in a therapeutic setting for the past seven months. Case found Plouffe in an AA meeting, which he was attending as a requirement of Treatment Court. Case then questioned Plouffe about the results of a drug test that was administered pursuant to Treatment Court, in the same building where Treatment Court was held. Throughout the second interview, Case repeatedly emphasized that Plouffe was required to tell the truth, and Plouffe repeatedly made incriminating statements after being prompted to be honest. These circumstances support Plouffe\u2019s contention that the informal, collaborative functioning of the Treatment Court was used by law enforcement and the County Attorney, whether knowingly or not, to obtain information for investigation of a new criminal offense. Under these circumstances, and absent clear evidence establishing the interviews were conducted outside the context of Treatment Court, Plouffe was \u201cnot free to admit, deny, or refuse to answer when questioned.\u201d <em>Fuller, </em>276 Mont. at 161, 915 P.2d at 812.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">\u00b630  We conclude that the State violated \u00a7 46-1-1111(4), MCA, by disclosing confidential drug testing information to law enforcement in order to investigate a new criminal offense. Absent evidence establishing that questioning by law enforcement occurred outside the context of Treatment Court proceedings, we conclude that Plouffe was impermissibly required to \u201cchoose between making incriminating statements and jeopardizing his conditional liberty by remaining silent,\u201d <em>Fuller, </em>276 Mont. at 166-67, 915 P.2d at 816 (citing <em>Murphy, </em>465 U.S. at 436, 104 S. Ct. at 1147), because Plouffe believed that he had to answer questions honestly in order to comply with Treatment Court rules. As a result, the State may not use the information derived from the three interviews in a later criminal proceeding. The District Court erred in denying Plouffe\u2019s motions to dismiss and suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"ACP\">\u00b631 We reverse Plouffe\u2019s conviction and vacate the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<judges id=\"b466-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER, COTTER, WHEAT, and RICE and DISTRICT JUDGE NEILL, sitting for the vacant position.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b454-11\"> As we have determined that our restated issue is dispositive, we will not address Plouffe\u2019s other alleged constitutional violations primarily related to his right to counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b457-6\"> While the State and Plouffe agree that Chestnut was filling in for Childress, the parties dispute whether Chestnut was a member of the Treatment Team and thus could share in the exchange of confidential material. As Chestnut\u2019s status on the Treatment Team is not critical to resolving the instant dispute because confidential information was exchanged with Deputy Bettis, who clearly was not a member of the Treatment Team, we will refrain from commenting further regarding Chestnut\u2019s status. We do observe, however, that in order to protect the integrity of the treatment court process, guidelines must be in place which guard against the unauthorized disclosure of confidential material. To the extent such guidelines are absent or perhaps unobserved by the Mineral County Treatment Court, we suggest that the Treatment Team reacquaint themselves with these principles. <em>See </em>Natl. Assn, of Drug Court Professionals, Drug Court Standards Committee, <em>Defining Drug Courts: The Key Components </em>(U.S. Dept, of Just., Bureau of Just. Assistance, Oct. 2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b463-9\"> The constitutional issues on appeal have been confounded. Nevertheless, Plouffe has consistently claimed that his right against compelled self-incrimination has been violated. Our task here is to address the issues raised in the appeal. We therefore have restated the issue regarding Plouffe\u2019s constitutional claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
