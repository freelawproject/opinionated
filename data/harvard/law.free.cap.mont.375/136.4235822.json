The sole issue is whether the District Court erred when it denied Hendrickson\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b161-11\">\u00b62 On February 8,2012, Jenny LaTray reported to law enforcement that her ex-boyfnend, Hendrickson, had entered her residence without permission and assaulted her the previous night. LaTray told the officers that Hendrickson had crawled through her bedroom window at night, punched her repeatedly in the head and face, and choked her for over an hour. LaTray reported that Hendrickson had threatened to beat her again if she reported the incident to the police, and that he forced her to write a list of the names and addresses of family and friends that would allow him to find her if she ever told anyone about the assault. The responding officers observed visible injuries on LaTray. The crime scene corroborated her story.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-12\">\u00b63 The State charged Hendrickson by information onMarch22,2012, with aggravated burglary and tampering with witnesses and informants. During arraignment, the District Court told Hendrickson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>that the charges against him carried a maximum penalty of fifty years and a $100,000 fine. Hendrickson told the court that he understood and pleaded not guilty to both counts. The State did not file a notice of intent to pursue a persistent felony offender (PFO) designation or otherwise indicate that it intended to pursue a PFO designation. Hendrickson was released on pretrial supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">\u00b64 Between February 8, 2012, and May 9, 2012, LaTray gave four taped statements to law enforcement. In her first two statements, she maintained that Hendrickson broke into her residence and assaulted her. On May 1, she recanted those statements and stated that another man, named John Dean or John Gibson, actually assaulted her. On May 9, she returned to her original story and explained that she had invented the statements about the other man.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">\u00b65 While Hendrickson was released on bond, he was arrested for allegedly placing several telephone calls to LaTray in violation of the conditions of his release. On May 30, Hendrickson made a recorded phone call from jail to his current girlfriend, Natalie Fleming, in which he seemed to suggest that Fleming should try to take the blame for contacting LaTray. Based on the recording of this call, the State filed an amended information on August 1, 2012, charging Hendrickson with an additional count of tampering with witnesses and informants.</p>\n<p id=\"AP_\">\u00b66 The State offered that in return for a plea of guilty on the tampering charge for the call to Fleming, the State would not pursue the other charges and would recommend a total sentence of ten years with eight suspended. The agreement would allow Hendrickson to argue for a ten-year commitment with all ten years suspended. Additionally, the State agreed not to file a petition to revoke Hendrickson\u2019s conditional pre-trial release based on positive urinalysis tests for methamphetamine. The State informed him that if the plea negotiations failed, the State would file another amended information to add several new charges against him, including sexual intercourse without consent and aggravated assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">\u00b67 Hendrickson ultimately agreed to the State\u2019s offer and the agreement was reduced to writing. He signed a document entitled \u201cPlea of Guilty and Waiver of Rights,\u201d which stated that \u201c[t]he maximum possible punishment provided by law for the above-named offense is: State Prison not to exceed 10 years and/or fine of $50,000.\u201d A line in the document regarding the potential for sentence enhancement for previous offenses was marked as inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">\u00b68 Hendrickson appeared in court for a change of plea hearing on August 1, 2012. During the court\u2019s colloquy, the court explained the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>charge against Hendrickson and told him, \u201cYou understand that you are now charged with the offense of tampering with witnesses and informants. That\u2019s a felony. That carries up to a potential of ten years in the State prison and/or a $50,000 fine. Do you understand that?\u201d Hendrickson explained that he understood the charge and the consequences of changing his plea. He stated that he was not impaired by alcohol or drugs and that he was satisfied with the services of his attorney, John Smith. Hendrickson summarized the factual basis for the plea, stating, \u201cI purposely induced Natalie into testifying falsely.\u201d Smith stated that the plea was free and voluntary. The court accepted Hendrickson\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">\u00b69 After the plea was entered by the court, LaTray contacted the law firm representing Hendrickson to recant her story again \u2014 this time claiming that Hendrickson had not beaten her or called her afterward. LaTray recorded another taped statement with Smith where she claimed that Fleming, not Hendrickson, had been the one to call her. Hendrickson engaged new counsel and moved to withdraw his guilty plea based on \u201cnew evidence\u201d from LaTray\u2019s most recent version of the events giving rise to the charges against him. The State opposed the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">\u00b6 10 In his reply brief, Hendrickson made an additional argument that his plea was involuntary because his previous counsel, Smith, had incorrectly explained to Hendrickson that he faced mandatory PFO sentence enhancements because he previously had been convicted of a felony for tampering with a witness. Smith\u2019s affidavit, filed with the reply brief, stated that he incorrectly told Hendrickson that, if convicted, he faced a mandatory, consecutive five to one hundred years in prison for being a PFO. Because Hendrickson had completed a deferred imposition of sentence on his prior felony offense and successfully moved to dismiss the charge, he was not eligible for PFO designation. Smith attested that his incorrect legal advice was a significant factor in Hendrickson\u2019s decision to plead guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">\u00b611 The District Court denied Hendrickson\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. The coturt noted that, \u201c[a]t most, what has been presented here, is that LaTray keeps changing her story.\u201d The court pointed out that the witness with whom Hendrickson agreed he had tampered was Fleming, not LaTray. The court agreed that if Smith had told Hendrickson that he faced a sentence enhancement based on his potential for designation as a PFO, the advice was incorrect. The court noted, however, that Hendrickson signed a plea agreement form and a waiver of rights, and engaged in a proper colloquy at his change of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>plea hearing. The court also observed that Smith\u2019s advice correctly determined that there was a substantial risk of significantly more punishment if the plea was rejected \u2014 up to 160 years if convicted on all charges the State intended to pursue. The court concluded that the plea was not involuntary and that Hendrickson could not demonstrate good cause for allowing him to withdraw his guilty plea. Hendrickson appeals the court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">\u00b612 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea de novo, because whether a plea was entered voluntarily is a mixed question of law and fact. <em>State v. Valdez-Mendoza, </em>2011 MT 214, \u00b6 12, 361 Mont. 503, 260 P.3d 151. We review the trial court\u2019s underlying factual findings for clear error. <em>State v. Warclub, </em>2005 MT 149, \u00b6 23, 327 Mont. 352, 114 P.3d 254. We review for correctness the district court\u2019s interpretation of the law and its application of the law to the facts. <em>Warclub, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">\u00b613 Hendrickson contends that he should be allowed to withdraw his guilty plea for two related reasons. First, he argues that his plea was involuntary because his attorney misinformed him about his PFO eligibility. Second, he argues that his attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel for the same reason. This second argument asserts a stand-alone ineffective assistance claim that was not presented to the District Court and we decline to address the issue on appeal. <em>State v. McFarlane, </em>2008 MT 18, \u00b6 12, 341 Mont. 166, 176 P.3d 1057. Hendrickson does not appeal the denial of his motion on the ground that LaTray\u2019s most recent statement amounted to \u201cnew evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">\u00b614  The remaining issue is whether good cause exists to allow Hendrickson to withdraw his guilty plea because his counsel incorrectly advised him that he was PFO eligible. Pursuant to \u00a7 46-16-105(2), MCA, a court may for good cause permit a plea of guilty to be withdrawn and a plea of not guilty substituted within one year after the judgment becomes final. \u201cGood cause\u201d includes the involuntariness of the plea, but it may include other reasons. <em>Warclub, </em>\u00b6 16. To prove that a plea was involuntary, \u201callegations of having had certain mental impressions at the time of the plea must be supported by objective proof in the record.\u201d <em>State v. Brinson, </em>2009 MT 200, \u00b6 12, 351 Mont. 136, 210 P.3d 164 (quoting <em>State v. Humphrey, </em>2008 MT 328, \u00b6 23, 346 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>Mont. 150, 194 P.3d 643). It is the defendant\u2019s obligation to provide such proof. <em>See State v. Robinson, </em>2009 MT 170, \u00b6\u00b6 17-18, 350 Mont. 493, 208 P.3d 851. If any doubt exists on the basis of the evidence presented regarding whether a guilty plea was voluntarily or intelligently made, the doubt must be resolved in favor of the defendant. <em>State v. Melone, </em>2000 MT 118, \u00b6 14, 299 Mont. 442, 2 P.3d 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">\u00b615 This Court utilizes the standard articulated in <em>Brady v. U.S., </em>397 U.S. 742, 748, 90 S. Ct. 1463, 1468-69 (1970), to determine whether a plea was voluntarily made. <em>State v. Prindle, </em>2013 MT 173, \u00b6 17, 370 Mont. 478, 483, 304 P.3d 712. The <em>Brady </em>standard requires that, to make a voluntary plea, a criminal defendant must be \u201cfully aware of the direct consequences, including the actual value of any commitments made to him by the court, prosecutor, or his own counsel.\u201d <em>State v. Lone Elk, </em>2005 MT 56, \u00b6 21, 326 Mont. 214, 108 P.3d 500, <em>overruled in part on other grounds, Brinson, </em>\u00b6 9 (quoting <em>Brady, </em>397 U.S. at 755, 90 S. Ct. at 1472). \u201cUnder <em>Brady, </em>we will not overturn a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea if the defendant was aware of the direct consequences of such a plea, and if his plea was not induced by threats, misrepresentation, or an improper promise such as a bribe.\u201d <em>Warclub, </em>\u00b6 32 <em>(citing Brady, </em>397 U.S. at 755, 90 S. Ct. at 1472).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">\u00b616 When evaluating an argument that counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness impacted the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s plea, we apply the <em>Strickland </em>test for ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>McFarlane, </em>\u00b6 11; <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Under <em>Strickland, </em>\u201cthe defendant must show (1) that his counsel's advice fell outside the range of competence demanded of a criminal attorney and (2) but for counsel\u2019s deficient performance, he would not have entered a guilty plea.\u201d <em>McFarlane, </em>\u00b6 11. We have recognized that the defendant bears a significant burden under <em>Strickland; </em>we may determine that counsel committed an error and still conclude that the defendant did not carry his burden to establish an error serious enough to allow him to withdraw his plea. <em>See Prindle, </em>\u00b6 23; <em>Weaver v. State, </em>2005 MT 158, \u00b6 20, 327 Mont. 441, 114 P.3d 1039.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">\u00b617 Determining whether a defendant entered a plea voluntarily and whether a district court erred in denying a motion to withdraw a plea requires case-specific considerations, including \u201cthe adequacy of the district court\u2019s interrogation, the benefits obtained from a plea bargain, the withdrawal\u2019s timeliness, and other considerations that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>may affect the credibility of the claims presented.\u201d <em>McFarlane, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"Asq\">\u00b618 As an initial matter, we agree with the District Court that, if Smith told Hendrickson that he could be subject to a PFO sentence enhancement, the advice was incorrectState <em>v. Gladue, </em>209 Mont. 235, 240, 679 P.2d 1256, 1259 (1984). We also agree with the court, however, that Hendrickson has not met his burden to show good cause for the withdrawal of his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">\u00b619 Prior to accepting a guilty plea, the trial court must satisfy the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 46-12-210 and 46-16-105, MCA. <em>Melone, </em>\u00b6 16. Section 46-12-210(1), MCA, provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[bjefore accepting a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, the court shall determine that the defendant understands the maximum penalty provided by law, including the effect of any penalty enhancement provision.\u201d Section 46-16-105, MCA, provides, in relevant part, that a court may accept a plea of guilty or nolo contendere when \u201cthe court has informed the defendant of the consequences of the plea and of the maximum penalty provided by law that may be imposed upon acceptance of the plea.\u201d These requirements were satisfied when the District Court advised Hendrickson at the plea hearing that he faced a maximum penalty of ten years in prison and a $50,000 fine. The court said nothing about a potential PFO enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">\u00b620  Even if Hendrickson\u2019s counsel misled him regarding his potential PFO status, Hendrickson must demonstrate that the misrepresentation induced his plea. <em>Warclub, </em>\u00b6 32. \u201cThe rule that a plea must be intelligently made to be valid does not require that a plea be vulnerable to later attack if the defendant did not correctly assess every relevant factor entering into his decision.\u201d <em>Lone </em>Elk, \u00b6 26 (quoting <em>Brady, </em>397 U.S. at 757, 90 S. Ct. at 1473). In <em>Lone Elk, </em>after the defendant pleaded guilty, counsel for the defendant testified that she incorrectly had told Lone Elk that the judge could not require sexual offender treatment for burglary despite that the underlying felony he intended to commit was sexual assault. <em>Lone Elk, </em>\u00b6 4. The defendant moved to withdraw his plea. The district court denied the motion. We affirmed, observing that the district court specifically told Lone Elk during the plea colloquy that his sentence could require sexual offender treatment and that Lone Elk had admitted in court that he understood the repercussions of his decision. <em>Lone Elk, </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"A3e_\">\u00b621  A similar conflict between the plea colloquy and the advice of counsel exists in this case. The District Court clearly stated the maximum penalty that Hendrickson faced for the charge against him and the maximum penalty was stated correctly in the signed document <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>containing his plea of guilty and waiver of rights. Hendrickson does not challenge the adequacy of the plea colloquy. Smith\u2019s post-plea affidavit is the only document in the record that suggests that Hendrickson\u2019s plea was involuntary. Hendrickson did not submit his own affidavit or provide testimony confirming that the incorrect advice was a factor in his decision to plead guilty. Smith\u2019s affidavit does not establish that Hendrickson misunderstood the potential maximum sentence that he faced. In light of the fact that the District Court and the written plea agreement clearly explained the correct maximum sentence, the record shows that Hendrickson was well-advised of the penalty he faced.</p>\n<p id=\"ASP\">\u00b622 We stated in <em>Lone Elk </em>that involuntariness could be established if the plea was induced, \u201chowever slightly,\u201d by improper promises, threats or misrepresentations. <em>Lone Elk, </em>\u00b6 21. We made clear in <em>Brinson, </em>however, that the \u201chowever slightly\u201d language had no place in the determination of voluntariness of a plea, and overruled <em>Lone Elk </em>to that extent. <em>Brinson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 8-9. Rather, in ruling on a motion to withdraw a guilty plea, the trial court is to examine all relevant \u201ccase-specific considerations.\u201d <em>McFarlane, </em>\u00b6 17. Other considerations affect the credibility of Hendrickson\u2019s claims in this case. The District Court found that Hendrickson was properly advised in open court and understood the possible punishment for his offense. The court further found that Hendrickson faced additional charges that the State would pursue if he did not accept the plea agreement, including aggravated burglary, sexual intercourse without consent, aggravated assault, and another tampering with witnesses charge. Smith correctly explained to Hendrickson that there was a substantial risk of significantly more punishment if the plea was rejected. Hendrickson received a significant \u201cbenefit of the bargain\u201d by accepting the State\u2019s plea offer. State <em>v. Muhammad, </em>2005 MT 234, \u00b6 24, 328 Mont. 397, 121 P.3d 521. He could have faced up to 180 years of incarceration for all charges. He also might have been subjected to a PFO sentence enhancement \u2014 although for different reasons than those mistakenly articulated by Hendrickson\u2019s counsel \u2014 because he allegedly committed four felonies on February 7,2012, against LaTray, and another felony on May 30,2012, when he induced Fleming to testify falsely. <em>See State v. Anderson, </em>2009 MT 39, \u00b6 14, 349 Mont. 245, 203 P.3d 764 (\u201c[T]he PFO statute can be used to enhance a sentence when the second felony was committed before conviction of the first felony.\u201d). Even if the State did not pursue additional charges, Hendrickson faced an additional forty years and $50,000 on the initial aggravated burglary charge. Thus, while his counsel's statement regarding Hendrickson\u2019s PFO <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>status was incorrect, it amounted to an \u201cinaccurate prediction\u201d rather than a \u201cgross mischaracterization of the likely outcome.\u201d <em>Prindle, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 30-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">\u00b623 The timeliness of Hendrickson\u2019s argument to withdraw his plea also does not support that his counsel\u2019s advice rendered his plea involuntary. Hendrickson initially moved to withdraw his plea because LaTray had changed her story. It was not until his reply brief that he argued that he would not have pleaded guilty but for his counsel\u2019s incorrect advice. This indicates that the PFO claim was not the primary reason that Hendrickson\u2019s plea was alleged to have been involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">\u00b624  After full consideration, the record supports the District Court\u2019s determination that Hendrickson was fully aware of the direct consequences of his plea and that the plea was not induced by misrepresentation. The reference in <em>Melone, </em>\u00b6 20, to \u201cany doubt\u201d about voluntariness of a plea cannot be interpreted, as suggested by the Dissent, to be tantamount to the \u201chowever slightly\u201d standard we expressly disapproved in <em>Brinson. </em>The record must be examined as a whole to determine whether the plea was voluntary. Smith\u2019s mistaken statements regarding the potential for a PFO designation are but one factor in this analysis. The District Court\u2019s findings of historical fact surrounding the entry of Hendrickson\u2019s plea are not clearly erroneous. Upon examination of all case-specific considerations, we conclude that Hendrickson has not shown that, but for counsel\u2019s deficient performance, he would not have entered a guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">\u00b625 The District Court\u2019s order denying Hendrickson\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b168-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b168-10\">JUSTICE COTTER,</author>\n<p id=\"ATe\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-11\">\u00b626 I respectfully dissent from our decision to affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Hendrickson\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"A2Z\">\u00b627 The Court concludes that Hendrickson did not meet his burden under the second prong of <em>Strickland </em>and therefore failed to raise \u201cany doubt\u201d regarding the voluntariness of his plea. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 18, 24. Under <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>second prong, a defendant must show that, but for counsel\u2019s deficient performance, a reasonable probability exists that he would not have entered a plea of guilty. <em>State v. Henderson, </em>2004 MT 173, \u00b6 4, 322 Mont. 69, 93 P.3d 1231; <em>St. Germain v. State, </em>2012 MT 86, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>\u00b6 11, 364 Mont. 494, 276 P.3d 886 (citation omitted). \u201cA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the proceedings.\u201d <em>St. Germain, </em>\u00b6 11 (citation omitted). Smith\u2019s affidavit clearly establishes that, but for his incorrect advice, there is a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that Hendrickson would not have pleaded guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">\u00b628 Smith testified he told Hendrickson that \u201cif he was convicted of even a single felony offense, he would face a mandatory, consecutive, 5-100 years in prison for being a persistent felony offender.\u201d Hendrickson was apparently reluctant to sign the plea agreement but eventually did so after his counsel \u201creiterated ... the good reasons to accept the plea agreement, including that if he proceeded with a guilty plea to the tampering charge concerning Natalie he would not face being designated a persistent felony offender.\u201d Smith testified that he \u201cbelieves the stated potential application of the persistent felony offender statute was a significant factor in [Hendrickson\u2019s] decision to plead guilty.\u201d These unrefuted statements raise a plain and obvious doubt about the voluntariness of the plea, which must be resolved in favor of Hendrickson. As we stated in <em>Melone, </em>if \u201cthere is any doubt that a guilty plea was not voluntarily or intelligently made, the doubt must be resolved in favor of the defendant.\u201d <em>Melone, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">\u00b629 I find it puzzling that the Court reaches the decision it does, given the correct statements of law set forth in \u00b6 15 of the Opinion. As the Court notes, \u201cthe actual value of any commitments made to [the defendant] by the court, prosecutor, or his own counsel\u201d are of significant consequence in determining the voluntariness of a plea. <em>Lone Elk, </em>\u00b6 21. There is no dispute that Hendrickson\u2019s lawyer incorrectly advised him he would face a PFO designation unless he accepted the plea deal, a fact even the Court is willing to concede. Opinion, \u00b6 18. Nor is there any doubt in Smith\u2019s mind that the potential of a PFO sentence was \u201ca significant factor\u201d in Hendrickson\u2019s decision to plead guilty. As the Court further observes in \u00b6 15, this Court \u201cwill not overturn a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea if ... his plea was not induced by threats, <em>misrepresentations, </em>or an improper promise such as a bribe.\u201d <em>Warclub, </em>\u00b6 32 (citing <em>Brady, </em>397 U.S. at 755, 90 S. Ct. at 1472) (emphasis added); <em>see also State v. Leitheiser, </em>2006 MT 70, \u00b6 20, 331 Mont. 464, 133 P.3d 185, <em>overruled in part on other grounds, State v. Herman, </em>2008 MT 187, \u00b6 12, 343 Mont. 494, 188 P.3d 978 (A plea is voluntary where defense counsel, the State, and the District Court have fully advised the defendant of the consequences of his plea and \u201cdid not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>induce Mm to enter the agreement based on threats, misrepresentation or improper promises.\u201d). I find it impossible to reconcile the Court\u2019s concession that Hendrickson\u2019s lawyer misrepresented the consequences Hendrickson faced if he did not accept the plea deal with its conclusion that Ms plea was nonetheless voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">\u00b630 The Court reasons that Hendrickson received a significant \u201cbenefit of the bargain,\u201d and that \u201cSmith correctly explained to Hendrickson that there was a substantial risk of sigmficantly more pumshment if the plea was rejected.\u201d Opimon, \u00b6 22. WMle tMs may be true, the Court misses the point. Hendrickson had the right to evaluate Ms options and Ms prospects free of misrepresentations. He had the right to make a fully informed choice, even if that choice might not turn out to be in Ms best interests. It is not tMs Court\u2019s prerogative to rationalize away an involuntary guilty plea because it might have been the wisest course for the defendant to take. Where a plea is entered on the basis of a misrepresentation, under the foregoing authorities the proper course is to allow the defendant to withdraw Ms guilty plea. Because Smith\u2019s advice was clearly wrong and Hendrickson acted upon it, Hendrickson\u2019s plea was not voluntary. I would therefore hold that the District Court erred in denying Hendrickson\u2019s motion to withdraw Ms guilty plea.</p>\n<judges id=\"b170-5\">JUSTICE McKINNON joins in the dissenting Opinion of JUSTICE COTTER.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
