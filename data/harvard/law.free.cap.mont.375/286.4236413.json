We reverse and remand for a new trial. We restate the sole dispositive issue on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"AN\">\u00b62 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied Gleed\u2019s motion for continuance?</p>\n<p id=\"b311-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">\u00b63 In August 2012, the State charged Gleed with aggravated assault, alleging that Gleed intentionally submerged G.C. in scalding water after G.C. came to the emergency room with severe bums over the majority of his body. On August 23, 2012, Gleed was arraigned and pleaded not guilty. The District Court discussed with the parties the setting of a trial date. The State expressed it had several out-of-state expert witnesses and requested a first trial setting in February, which was still within 200 days of Gleed\u2019s arrest. Defense counsel objected to such a late date. Although the State expressed concern about setting a trial date in mid-December, the District Court set a trial date of December 17, 2012, and suggested that if scheduling problems developed the parties could advise the District Court within a couple of weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">\u00b64 In November 2012, Gleed filed a notice of expert disclosure and an expert report of San Francisco-based bum expert Dr. Jerold Z. Kaplan. In his expert report, Dr. Kaplan concluded that G.C.\u2019s bums were not caused by intentional child abuse, stating \u201cI am personally certain that this is an accidental injury, and would be happy to so testify in deposition, or court, if necessaiy.\u201d At the end of his report, Dr. Kaplan stated, \u201cI will be on vacation [in New Zealand] from Nov 16 through Dec 20, but may be paged until Nov 15 and e-mailed at any time.\u201d Later that month, Gleed disclosed a witness and exhibit list to the State, which included Dr. Kaplan. The State\u2019s witness list identified 22 witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">\u00b65 Trial began on Monday, December 17. During voir dire, defense counsel, the State, and the District Court all repeatedly told jurors that the case could last until Friday, December 21. The District Court advised the jury panel during voir dire:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-7\">we are anticipating \u2014 I talked with the lawyers about how long this case is going to last. Everybody wants to know that. And we\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re telling me it could last three days or could last all week. And I know that is an issue as well.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">Later during voir dire, the District Court advised:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-9\">So \u2014 and the final thing,... is that we\u2019ve anticipated the trial will be over \u2014 we have wild estimates here \u2014 from Wednesday, possibly, to maybe Friday. I always think it\u2019s best in a case like that to err on the conservative side so you\u2019re not disappointed and say Friday. And I\u2019m anticipating it will be sooner. And I\u2019ll keep you posted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">The State similarly advised the panel during voir dire that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>So as far as the length of this trial, my best estimate, and I\u2019m often times wrong, but my best estimate is this is going to go to the jury probably on Thursday. It may go to Friday, but my best estimate is that this case may end as soon as Wednesday. I don\u2019t know. But I\u2019m betting it\u2019s going to \u2014 you are going to get it Thursday. It might go to Friday.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">\u00b66 In his opening statement, defense counsel told the jury that they would have a burn expert, Dr. Kaplan, who would explain the relationship between water temperature and the time it takes to burn skin. Defense counsel represented that Dr. Kaplan would corroborate that G.C.\u2019s bums were accidental. Defense counsel, however, was not clear in what manner Dr. Kaplan\u2019s testimony would be presented to the jury and stated, \u201cWe have an expert witness we\u2019re going to bring here hopefully. He\u2019s in New Zealand right now. And hopefidly we can get him here by the time this trial is over... we\u2019re going to either bring him up here or have him testify by video conference.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">\u00b67 During its case-in-chief, the State presented expert testimony from a pediatrician specializing in child abuse, who stated that the bums were indicative of forced submersion in scalding water, and thus were more likely the result of child abuse. The State rested ahead of schedule on Tuesday, December 18. Defense counsel thereupon advised the court, \u201cOur expert I think is in transit from New Zealand to San Francisco. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be able to get him. And accordingly, at the end of Mr. Gleed\u2019s testimony, I would ask the Court to recess, take a recess for one day, so that we can get that expert witness here.\u201d The State objected and the following colloquy transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-7\">County Attorney: Your Honor, I object to that. We\u2019ve known \u2014 this trial has been set for a long, long time, and why \u2014 we\u2019ve known when the expected trial date was going to end. Why we should put this off and keep the jury hanging, and the Court\u2019s time, is something I don\u2019t understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-8\">Court: Okay. Can we do it by video?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-9\">County Attorney: I don\u2019t care if we do it by video.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-10\">Defense Counsel: Your Honor, if I can get him by video, we\u2019ll certainly do that, but I\u2019m not certain we can arrange that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-11\">Court: Well, we\u2019ll see where we go tomorrow. I\u2019ll take that under advisement and see where we\u2019re at tomorrow, and the efforts to get him on video. And we would certainly accommodate that. Okay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-12\">\u00b68 Late in the morning of Wednesday, December 19, after all other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>defense witnesses had been called, defense counsel moved the court to recess for a day and a half until Dr. Kaplan would be available to testify. Defense counsel advised, \u201cYour Honor, we cannot get our expert here. And so I would request that the Court recess until we can get our expert here, and I suspect that is Friday.\u201d The court responded, \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll have to deny that. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">\u00b69 There is no further discussion or explanation of the matter in the record. At 2:05 p.m. on December 19, the jury was dismissed to deliberate, and they found Gleed guilty of aggravated assault. Gleed was sentenced to 20 years in Montana State Prison. Although Gleed raises multiple issues on appeal, we will only address the issue regarding the motion for continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">\u00b610 We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for continuance for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Toulouse, </em>2005 MT 166, \u00b6 14, 327 Mont. 467, 115 P.3d 197 (citing <em>State v. Garcia, </em>2003 MT 211, \u00b6 10, 317 Mont. 73, 75 P.3d 313). A trial court abuses its discretion when it \u201c \u2018acts arbitrarily without the employment of conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason, resulting in substantial injustice.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Hicks, </em>2013 MT 50, \u00b6 14, 369 Mont. 165, 296 P.3d 1149 (quoting <em>State v. Derbyshire, </em>2009 MT 27, \u00b6 19, 349 Mont. 114, 201 P.3d 811).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">\u00b611 A district court considers a motion for continuance in a criminal trial in light of the diligence shown by the moving party, and may grant the continuance in its discretion, if the interests of justice so require. Section 46-13-202, MCA; <em>Garcia </em>\u00b6 14; <em>State v. Fields, </em>2002 MT 84, \u00b6 20, 309 Mont. 300, 46 P.3d 612. \u201cWhen a continuance is requested and is reasonable, viewing all the relevant factors including the interests of justice and the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial, a district court abuses its discretion in denying the request.\u201d <em>Fields, </em>\u00b6 20 (citing <em>State v. Borchert, </em>281 Mont. 320, 327, 934 P.2d 170, 175). In <em>State v. Fife, </em>187 Mont. 65, 69, 608 P.2d 1069, 1071-72 (1980) (citing <em>State v. DiGiallonardo, </em>160 Mont. 379, 382-84, 503 P.2d 43, 44 (1972)), we articulated the three factors to consider in determining whether a district court has abused its discretion in ruling on a motion for continuance based on an absent witness: (1) whether a reasonable expectation or prospect of obtaining the presence of the absent witness exists; (2) whether the witness\u2019s testimony would help the defense; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>(3) whether that witness would testify. Establishing whether a district court abused its discretion in denying a motion for continuance depends not on the application of a mechanical test but rather on \u201cthe circumstances present in every case, particularly in the reasons presented to the trial judge at the time the request is denied.\u201d <em>State v. Klemann, </em>194 Mont. 117, 120-21, 634 P.2d 632, 635 (1981) (citing <em>Ungar v. Sarafite, </em>376 U.S. 575, 589, 84 S. Ct. 841, 850 (1964)).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">\u00b612 As a preliminary matter, the civil statute governing a motion for continuance requires the moving party to include an accompanying affidavit that shows the materiality of the evidence expected to be obtained and that due diligence has been used to procure it. Section 25-4-501, MCA. In contrast, the criminal statute governing a motion for continuance states that \u201cthe court <em>may </em>require that [a motion for continuance] be supported by affidavit.\u201d Section 46-13-202(1), MCA (emphasis added). The State cites <em>Toulouse </em>to stand for the proposition that a motion for continuance in a criminal case requires a supporting affidavit showing the materiality of the evidence expected to be obtained and that due diligence has been used to procure it pursuant to \u00a7 25-4-501, MCA. The State continues that because Gleed failed to present an affidavit demonstrating the materiality of Dr. Kaplan\u2019s testimony and his diligence in procuring it, the District Court did not abuse its discretion by denying his motion for continuance. However, \u00a7 25-4-501, MCA, does not govern criminal proceedings, and <em>Toulouse </em>merely refers to the civil statute in dicta. <em>Toulouse, </em>\u00b6 22. It is clear that \u00a7 46-13-202, MCA, governs a motion for continuance in criminal matters, and does not require an accompanying affidavit unless specifically required by the court. <em>State v. Morales, </em>284 Mont. 237, 240, 943 P.2d 1286, 1288 (1997) (\u201cThe controlling statute to determine whether the District Court should have granted Morales\u2019s motion for a continuance is \u00a7 46-13-202(3), MCA.\u201d); <em>see also Fife, </em>187 Mont. at 68, 608 P.2d at 1071; State <em>v. Sotelo, </em>209 Mont. 86, 90, 679 P.2d 779, 782 (1984); <em>Borchert, </em>281 Mont. at 324, 934 P.2d at 173; <em>State v. Martinez, </em>1998 MT 265, \u00b6 22, 291 Mont. 265, 968 P.2d 705; <em>State v. Root, </em>1999 MT 203, \u00b6 12, 296 Mont. 1, 987 P.2d 1140; <em>Fields, </em>\u00b6 20; <em>Garcia, </em>\u00b6 14. There is no indication in the record that the District Court, in its discretion, imposed this affidavit requirement on Gleed\u2019s motion for continuance. Thus, the fact that Gleed did not include an affidavit with his motion for continuance is not dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">\u00b613 Despite the State\u2019s attempts to distinguish it from the facts at hand, our decision in <em>Fields </em>proves instructive to the instant case. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number><em>Fields, </em>we held that the district court abused its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for continuance in a deliberate homicide case. <em>Fields, </em>\u00b6 26. Fields presented a defense of extreme mental or emotional stress, and planned to have two psychiatrists testify as expert witnesses about his mental state. <em>Fields, </em>\u00b6 7. Trial began on a Monday, and was expected to last four or five days. <em>Fields, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 9,11,22. Fields told the jury about these two experts during voir dire and his opening statement. <em>Fields, </em>\u00b6 11. The trial progressed ahead of schedule, and defense counsel noted that they would be \u201cdone too fast\u201d in order to hear the testimony of one of the psychiatrists, Dr. Stratford. The State rested, and by Wednesday afternoon Fields had called all defense witnesses except for Dr. Stratford, who was scheduled to testify on Thursday morning. <em>Fields, </em>\u00b6 13. Although Dr. Stratford could have appeared on Wednesday afternoon, he was unwilling to appear ahead of schedule because he was dealing with the recent death of his mother. <em>Fields, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 13-14, 24. Fields then asked to recess until Thursday morning, to allow for Dr. Stratford to appear as originally scheduled. <em>Fields, </em>\u00b6 13. The State objected, and the District Court denied Fields\u2019 motion, stating that Fields had already presented the testimony of one psychiatrist who testified that Fields was suffering from emotional stress, and therefore Dr. Stratford\u2019s testimony was unnecessary. <em>Fields, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">\u00b614 On appeal, we held that the district court\u2019s denial of Fields\u2019 motion for continuance was an abuse of discretion. After considering all relevant factors, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">Here, the charged offense at issue is deliberate homicide; the delay requested was less than one-half day in a case originally estimated to require a week;... Fields\u2019 counsel had told the jury he would present two psychiatric experts; Dr. Stratford\u2019s testimony would go directly to Fields\u2019 defense of mitigated deliberate homicide; and, finally, the State used in its closing argument the facts that Fields presented only one expert.... On this record, and considering the interests of justice and Fields\u2019 right to a fair trial, we conclude the motion for a recess was reasonable. On that basis, we hold the District Court abused its discretion in refusing to grant Fields\u2019 motion for a recess to allow Dr. Stratford to testify.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOB\"><em>Fields, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">\u00b615 <em>Fields </em>directly applies to the case at hand. The State contends that Gleed was not sufficiently diligent to satisfy the \u00a7 46-13-202, MCA, criteria because his motion was \u201clast-minute,\u201d and because Gleed knew about Dr. Kaplan\u2019s unavailability \u201csince at least November 12, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>2012,\u201d yet \u201cdid nothing to alert the district court.\u201d However, the record does not support the State\u2019s specific factual assertions in this regard, and, additionally, these assertions do not represent the totality of the circumstances regarding Gleed\u2019s diligence. The record shows that the State, and ostensibly the District Court, also knew of Dr. Kaplan\u2019s unavailability, as it was clearly stated in the expert report that Gleed filed on November 12. Just as in <em>Fields, </em>the court, the State, and Gleed\u2019s counsel, all made repeated statements to the jury that the trial could take all week. <em>See Fields, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 9,11,22. The fact that the State included 22 names on its witness list supports the notion that the trial could have lasted all week. Thus, it is clear that the State, Gleed, and the District Court were operating under the assumption that the trial could last until Friday. Additionally, on Tuesday, once it was clear that the trial was progressing faster than planned, Gleed informed the court that he was planning to move for a continuance in order to allow for Dr. Kaplan to testify. Here, Gleed\u2019s actions were at least comparable to those of Fields, who did not specifically inform the court that he was planning to move for a continuance in advance, but merely alerted the court that they would \u201cbe done too fast\u201d in order to hear the other expert\u2019s testimony. <em>Fields, </em>\u00b6 11. We conclude that, under the facts before us, Gleed met the diligence requirement contained in \u00a7 46-13-202, MCA. <em>See Fields, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 22-24; <em>Fife, </em>187 Mont. at 70, 608 P.2d at 1072; <em>Borchert, </em>281 Mont. at 326-27, 934 P.2d at 175; <em>compare State v. Duncan, </em>2008 MT 148, \u00b6 40, 343 Mont. 220, 183 P.3d 111 (Where defendant had already been granted two continuances over a period of two and a half years in a sexual assault case, and moved for a third continuance two days before trial stating he needed more time to prepare, we held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s motion because defendant failed \u201cto make any showing of diligence in preparing for the trial\u201d or \u201cexplain why ... he was not afforded sufficient time to prepare his defense.\u201d). In drawing this conclusion, however, we must observe that defense counsel has made only the minimal showing necessary to demonstrate diligence. Notably absent from the record is any inquiry from the District Court or the County Attorney regarding whether Dr. Kaplan was actually available to testify and what arrangements had been made by defense counsel to secure his presence at the trial on Friday.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">\u00b616 Further, application of the <em>Fife </em>factors supports our conclusion that the interests of justice and Gleed\u2019s right to a fair trial necessitated the grant of his motion for continuance for a day and a half in order to allow Dr. Kaplan to testify. 187 Mont. at 69, 608 P.2d at 1071-72; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number><em>Fields, </em>\u00b6 20. First, the only conclusion that can be drawn from the record is that there was \u201ca reasonable expectation or prospect of obtaining\u201d Dr. Kaplan\u2019s presence in this case if the trial had been continued from Wednesday afternoon on December 19 to Friday, December 21. Although it is unclear whether the possibility of videoconferencing was explored further, Dr. Kaplan\u2019s own statements in his report, along with defense counsel\u2019s repeated reference to Dr. Kaplan\u2019s forthcoming testimony, support the conclusion that there was a reasonable expectation that he would testify as scheduled. While perhaps the District Court may have suspected that Dr. Kaplan was likely <em>not </em>available or otherwise unable to testify, the record does not bear out this suspicion. We must consider the request for continuance based upon the record before us, which presents no inquiry by the District Court or County Attorney regarding Dr. Kaplan\u2019s ability to testify, by videoconference or otherwise, on Friday.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">\u00b617 Second, it is undisputed that Dr. Kaplan\u2019s testimony would have helped Gleed\u2019s case, as Dr. Kaplan emphatically supported Gleed\u2019s statement that the bums were accidental. The importance of Dr. Kaplan\u2019s testimony was even greater than that of the expert testimony in <em>Fields, </em>as Dr. Kaplan was the only defense expert testifying about the causation of the bums. Here, Dr. Kaplan\u2019s testimony was not merely cumulative or of questionable importance \u2014 to the contrary, it was critical in establishing Gleed\u2019s defense. Consequently, the jurywas tasked to deliberate a case that presented expert testimony as to causation from the State without the opposing expert viewpoint that Dr. Kaplan would have provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">\u00b618  Finally, the record indicates that Dr. Kaplan intended to testify, as he stated in his report. Thus, although the facts at hand present a close call, in considering the totality of the circumstances, includingthe significance of Dr. Kaplan\u2019s testimony to Gleed\u2019s defense, we hold that the District Court abused its discretion in refusing to grant Gleed a recess of the trial for a day and a half in order to present Dr. Kaplan\u2019s testimony. <em>See Fields, </em>\u00b6 26; <em>Fife, </em>187 Mont. at 71, 608 P.2d at 1072-73 (in holding that the district court abused its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s motion for continuance, we stated: \u201cDefendant\u2019s effort was in good faith; the testimony was not cumulative; the testimony was material;... the delay would have been minimal and no one would have been inconvenienced thereby; and, of course, the value, as stated above is a close question which should have been resolved in favor of defendant, assuring him a fair trial. Conversely, without the testimony a conviction resulted.\u201d); <em>Borchert, </em>281 Mont. at 325-27, 934 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>P.2d at 173-75 (the district court abused its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s motion for continuance when defendant specified \u201cseveral bases for his contention that the interests of justice required that his motion for continuance be granted\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">\u00b619 In light of our reasoning in <em>Fields, </em>the State\u2019s reliance on <em>Toulouse </em>is easily distinguished. In <em>Toulouse, </em>a defendant requested a continuance in the middle of trial until the following morning, in order to permit his sister, who was ill due to cancer and chemotherapy, to testify on his behalf. <em>Toulouse, </em>\u00b6 10. However, unlike in the instant case, Toulouse offered \u201cno reasonable expectation or prospect\u201d of obtaining his sister\u2019s testimony \u201cthe next day, the next week, or the next month.\u201d <em>Toulouse, </em>\u00b6 17. More importantly, Toulouse failed to demonstrate how his sister\u2019s testimony would have aided his defense. As previously stated, it is undisputed that Dr. Kaplan\u2019s testimony would have aided Gleed\u2019s defense. As such, the holding in <em>Toulouse </em>does not extend to the facts presented by the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">\u00b620 We reverse Gleed\u2019s conviction, vacate the District Court\u2019s judgment, and remand this matter for a new trial in a manner consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b318-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICE WHEAT, BAKER, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
