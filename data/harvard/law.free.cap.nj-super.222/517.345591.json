Kocen, Jr. was indicted for violating <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-8(a) in that between 1975 and 1986 he \u201cdid unlawfully and purposely obtain, without compensation, from New Jersey Natural Gas Company, services, to wit: natural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>gas, with a value in excess of $500.\u201d He was tried to a jury, found guilty, and sentenced to a probationary term, a $250 fine and ordered to make restitution to New Jersey Natural Gas Company in the amount of $7176.79 at $100 per month. He appealed. We reverse and remand for dismissal of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">At its best, the State\u2019s evidence showed these facts. Defendant and his family bought and moved into an existing home in 1975. It was served with natural gas by New Jersey Natural Gas Company. There was a meter on the premises. Defendant was not billed for use of gas, because the utility had mistakenly recorded the location of the property when it installed gas service for defendant\u2019s predecessor in 1970, and soon thereafter gave up trying to correct its error. It had no record of an account at defendant\u2019s address. It thus unknowingly continued to supply gas without charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Defendant knew that one normally pays for gas, and that he was not doing so. Indeed, after a few years in the house he converted from oil heat to gas heat, apparently as an economy measure. In defense at trial, defendant and family members described unsuccessful efforts to establish an account with the utility in 1975. There was nothing in the evidence to indicate that defendant or anyone else made any false, deceptive or threatening statements to the utility or tampered with the meter or other part of the gas delivery system.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-8(a) says in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-8\">A person is guilty of theft if he purposely obtains services which he knows are available only for compensation, by deception or threat, or by false token, slug, or other means, including but not limited to mechanical or electronic devices or through fraudulent statements, to avoid payment for the service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">Plaintiff\u2019s conduct is not criminalized by this statute. He knowingly accepted services without payment which he knew were available only for compensation. There was no evidence, however, of use of deception or threat, false token, slug, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>mechanical or electronic devices, or fraudulent statements.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But, the State asks, what about the statutory phrase, \u201cother means\u201d? Those words appear in a list whose common characteristic is the doing of an affirmative verbal or physical act whose purpose is to deceive, defraud or threaten, or to foil a supplier\u2019s metering or collection system. There is nothing to indicate that the Legislature meant to ignore the canon of <em>ejusdem </em>generis<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and to use the phrase \u201cother means\u201d to criminalize the passive act of knowingly accepting services for which the supplier negligently does not send a bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">We hold that a person who knowingly accepts services without payment which the person knows are available only for compensation does not violate <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-8(a) unless there is a verbal or physical act of deception, fraud or threat, or false token, slug, mechanical or electronic device or like means employed to avoid payment for the service.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">We need not deal with defendant\u2019s argument that a broader definition of the words \u201cother means\u201d would render the statute unconstitutionally vague, or the unbriefed question whether defendant\u2019s conduct might have been punishable under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-6. We also need not address defendant\u2019s complaints of trial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">Our decision does not reward deadbeats. Neither does it offer the criminal law as a remedy for a utility\u2019s self-created failure to bill a customer for eleven years. Civil liability is another matter. We understand it is not contested in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>Reversed and remanded with instructions to enter judgment dismissing the indictment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b550-8\"> <em>Compare State v.
