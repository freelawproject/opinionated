The new regulations provide for testing at the discretion of the county jail\u2019s physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-12\">On October 7, 1985, the DOC proposed an amendment to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:31-3.12 and 10A:31-3.15. 17 <em>N.J.R. </em>2343 (1985). The OIA requested a public hearing on the proposal. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Department heard testimony on January 21, 1986, and received written comments and documentation. The amendments were adopted on May 29, 1986 without modification of the proposal to eliminate testing for infectious diseases; they took effect on July 7, 1986. 18 <em>N.J.R. </em>1384 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">The OIA argues that the elimination of what it terms \u201croutine, mandatory testing\u201d violates a prisoner\u2019s \u201cfundamental right,\u201d under the federal and state constitutions, to protection from disease, and that the new regulation should be overturned as arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, and contrary to public policy and legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Formerly, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:31-3.12(b)1.iv required that new inmates of county jails have \u201c[mjedical screening, including tests for infectious diseases.\u201d Under the amendment the regulation was revised to require \u201c[m]edical screening as detailed in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:31-3.15 Medical, dental and health service care.\u201d In turn, the first paragraph of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:31-3.15(b)11 was changed to read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-7\">11. Upon admission, all inmates shall receive medical screening by a nurse or medical technician, and a physical examination by a licensed medical doctor, <em>and any tests determined to be necessary by the facility\u2019s responsible physician. </em>The medical screening and physical examination shall be performed on all inmates prior to their placement in the general population or housing area. The findings shall be recorded on a printed screening form approved by the responsible physician. [Emphasis supplied].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">The new regulation requires medical examination by a physician, where none was required before, but leaves to the doctor\u2019s discretion whether to order tests for disease. The prior regulation mandated testing for all incoming inmates but did not specifically enumerate the infectious diseases for which testing was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">The DOC rejected the premise of the objectors that the new regulation would end all testing for infectious diseases: \u201cThe Department does not believe that counties will cease testing for infectious disease where such tests are appropriate and are recommended by the responsible county physician.\u201d 18 <em>N.J.R. </em>1385 (1986). The Department conceded that mandatory testing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>was \u201cdesirable,\u201d but determined \u201cthat differences in populations, facilities and resources require that some latitude be given each county to develop its policy according to its individual needs.\u201d It preferred \u201cto defer to the expertise of local county physicians regarding specific needs\u201d for testing. We have no doubt that in the absence of specific enumeration of the infectious diseases to be tested for in the earlier regulation that local discretion and conditions dictated what testing was to be routinely carried out.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">OIA attacks the amendments on constitutional grounds, alleging that inmates\u2019 rights to mandatory testing for venereal disease and tuberculosis are so \u201cfundamental\u201d as to require that any restriction on those rights be justified by a greater showing of governmental need than would be applicable to a less intrusive health regulation. It also invokes the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, and Article I, Paragraph 1 of the New Jersey Constitution (the right to enjoy life and liberty and to pursue and obtain safety and happiness).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">The test for the constitutional level of prison medical care, under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, was announced in <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 <em>U.S. </em>97, 106, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>285, 292, 50 L.Ed.2d 251, 261 (1976) as being whether there were \u201cacts or omissions sufficiently harmful to evidence deliberate indifference to serious medical needs.\u201d The cases interpreting <em>Estelle </em>have identified two categories of \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d: (1) denial of or delay in access to diagnosis and treatment of conditions causing discomfort, or (2) denial of prescribed treatment. <em>See, e.g., Dean v. Coughlin, </em>623 <em>F.Supp. </em>392, 401 (S.D.N.Y.1985); <em>Todaro v. Ward, </em>431 <em>F.Supp. </em>1129, 1132-33 (S.D.N.Y.1977), aff\u2019d 565 <em>F.2d </em>48 (2d Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">Not every action affecting prisoners\u2019 health implicates the Eighth Amendment: \"ordinary negligence will not qualify; there must be wanton and unnecessary infliction of pain, <em>Whitley v. Albers, </em>475 <em>U.S. </em>312, 319, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1078, 1084, 89 L.Ed.2d 251, 260-61 (1986), or indifference to \u201cserious\u201d medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>needs. <em>Pace v. Fauver, </em>479 <em>F.Supp. </em>456, 458 (D.N.J.1979), aff\u2019d without opinion 649 <em>F.</em>2d 860 (3d Cir.1981). \u201cSerious medical need\u201d has been defined by New Jersey\u2019s Federal District Court \u201cas one that has been diagnosed by a physician as requiring treatment or one that is so obvious that a lay person would easily recognize the necessity for a doctor\u2019s attention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">No cases have been found which hold that the kind of pre-admission testing sought by OIA in this case is constitutionally required. In <em>Lareau v. Manson, </em>651 F.2d 96 (2d Cir.1981), a class of inmates brought an action under 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1983 alleging that overcrowded prison conditions violated their Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. Among their complaints was that incoming prisoners were not screened for communicable diseases. The Court of Appeals upheld the finding of the District Court that the resulting threat to the inmate population was so serious as to constitute punishment without due process under the Fourteenth Amendment, and cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment (citing the <em>Estelle </em>standard). <em>Id. </em>at 109. As part of its remedy the Court ordered that inmates be examined within 48 hours of their admission, which examinations \u201cshall include such tests as are necessary in the opinion of the physician to identify and isolate those who have communicable diseases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 111. The regulation under attack here does require a medical examination by a physician upon admission, and it calls for tests if deemed necessary by the physician. This was the remedy selected by the <em>Lareau </em>Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">In <em>Cody v. Hillard, </em>599 <em>F.Supp. </em>1025 (D.S.D.1984), aff\u2019d 799 F.2d 447 (8th Cir.1986), reh. granted 804 F.2d 440 (8th Cir.1986), inmates challenged a medical screening program as being constitutionally inadequate. The Court agreed, noting that intake examinations were done by corrections officers without medical training; there was no formal medical-screening procedure, and examinations were done up to two weeks after admission. 599 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 1044. The absence of adequate and timely medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>screening was thus found to be a constitutional deprivation under <em>Estelle </em>and <em>Lareau, </em>among others. <em>Id. </em>at 1059.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">There has been no proof that the lack of mandatory tests for venereal disease and tuberculosis has resulted in, or is likely to result in, \u201cmedically significant consequences.\u201d The new regulation is intended to heighten the counties\u2019 responsibilities with regard to medical screening. The old regulation did not require screening by trained personnel or physical exams by physicians. Since each physician retains the discretion to order tests, it must be presumed that the physician will exercise that discretion if good medical practice dictates it is warranted. If experience should show that the new regulation fails to protect inmates, then OIA may assert a challenge based on the demonstrated impact of the regulation on inmates\u2019 medical care. Until some adverse effect can be proven, it would be speculative and premature to say that, on its face, the regulation\u2019s failure to require routine testing denies inmates their constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">OIA also argues that inmates have a right under Article I, Paragraph 1 of the New Jersey Constitution to protect their bodies against contagious disease. In <em>Right to Choose v. Byrne, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>287, 303 (1982), the Court declined to recognize \u201ca fundamental right to health,\u201d although it did acknowledge that this State \u201caccords a high priority to the preservation of health.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 304. Despite the fact that <em>Byrne </em>denied \u201cfundamental right\u201d status to inmates\u2019 interest in their health, OIA seeks to apply the \u201cbalancing test\u201d governing such rights. However, a fundamental right not having been established, the \u201cbalancing test\u201d for assessing restrictions on fundamental rights is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">OIA urges that even if we reject its constitutional attack, the new regulations may be overturned under the traditional standard of review of an administrative regulation, <em>i.e., </em>whether it is arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, or lacking a rational basis. <em>See, e.g., Bergen Pines Hosp. v. Dept. of Human Serv., </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>456, 477 (1984). Regulations are pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>sumed valid; their attacker bears the burden of overcoming this presumption. <em>Ibid. </em>This burden may be met by showing that the regulation contravenes the public interest or legislative intent, or that it represents an irrational \u201cchoice by the state agency charged with administering a program of limited resources.\u201d <em>In re Medicaid Long Term Care Serv. Bulletin, </em>212 <em>N.J.Super. </em>48, 60-61 (App.Div.), certif. den. 107 <em>N.J. </em>31 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">\u201cIf a reasonable difference of <em>opinion </em>from the facts, real or presumed, exists, the administrative decision [in enacting a regulation] will not be disturbed,....\u201d <em>Schwerman Trucking v. Dept. of Env. Protection, </em>125 <em>N.J.Super. </em>14, 19 (App.Div. 1973) (emphasis in original). This court allows the agency the benefit of any doubt. <em>Ibid. </em>In order to uphold a regulation, we need not be convinced that the regulation decrees the most effective remedy. Rather, it is sufficient that it have a rational basis. We are satisfied that there is a sufficient rational basis for the amended regulations in question based upon our review of the record and considering the statutory duty of the DOC.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">We uphold the July 1986 amendments to <em>N.J.A.C. 1</em>0A:31-3.-12(b)1.iv and 10A:31-3.15(b)11.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
