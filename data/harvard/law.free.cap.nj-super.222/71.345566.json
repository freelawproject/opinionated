Charles\u2019 claim was for his personal injuries suffered in the accident and Frances\u2019 claim was for the loss of her husband\u2019s services and consortium. As required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-25a and <em>R. </em>4:21A-1, plaintiffs\u2019 claims were submitted to arbitration. The arbitrators found Morell 100 percent negligent and awarded damages of $4,000. Morell rejected the arbitration award and demanded a trial <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b102-13\">The case was tried before a jury which found Morell and Pfeiffer each 50 percent negligent. The jury also awarded damages of $6,000 to Charles Coughlin and $1,000 to Frances Coughlin.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-14\">Plaintiffs then sought an award of counsel fees and costs against Morell pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:21A-6(c)(1), which provides that a party who demands a trial <em>de novo </em>after an automobile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>arbitration award \u201cmay be liable\u201d for \u201creasonable costs, including attorney\u2019s fees, incurred after rejection of the award by those parties not demanding a trial <em>de novo </em>\u201d unless \u201cthe party demanding the trial <em>de novo </em>has obtained a verdict at least 20 percent more favorable than the award.\u201d Morell opposed the motion on the grounds that under the jury verdict his liability to Charles Coughlin was only $3,000 (50 percent of $6,000),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which was more than a 20 percent improvement over the $4,000 award rendered against him by the arbitrators. Plaintiffs\u2019 reply to this argument was that Morell\u2019s entire obligation under the jury verdict was $3,500 (50 percent of both the $6,000 awarded to Charles and the $1,000 awarded to Frances), which was less than 20 percent more favorable to Morell than the arbitrators\u2019 award. However, Morell urged that the $1,000 which the jury awarded to Frances Coughlin should be disregarded in determining his liability under <em>R. </em>4:21A-6(c)(1), because her claim had not been included in the arbitrator\u2019s award. The trial court agreed with Morell\u2019s argument and denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Morell\u2019s argument that the arbitration award related solely to Charles Coughlin\u2019s claim rests in part on the fact that the award was entered in favor of \u201cplaintiff Coughlin,\u201d ostensibly referring to only one plaintiff. Morell also alleges that Frances Coughlin did not attend the arbitration proceeding. Consequently, he urges that only Charles\u2019 claim and not Frances\u2019 claim was submitted to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">Although the better practice is for arbitrators to separately set forth their award on a <em>per quod </em>claim, we are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>satisfied that the award involved in this case was intended to encompass the claims of both plaintiffs. The submission of both claims to arbitration was mandated by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-25a and <em>R. </em>4:21A-1. Consequently, Morell would not have been entitled to seek a trial <em>de novo </em>until after the arbitration of both claims. Morell asserts that Frances Coughlin failed to attend the arbitration hearing and thus her claim could not have been considered by the arbitrators, whereas plaintiffs assert that Frances\u2019 claim was presented to the arbitrators through the testimony of her husband. <em>Cf. Ackerman v. Kramer Chemical Co., </em>158 <em>N.J.Super. </em>128, 130 (App.Div.1978), certif. den. 79 <em>N.J. </em>463 (1978). However, since automobile arbitration proceedings are not transcribed, <em>see R. </em>l:20A-3(b), it would be inappropriate for us to go behind the arbitration award and attempt to reconstruct precisely what occurred at the hearing. Rather, the fact that submission of both claims to arbitration was mandatory leads us to conclude that the arbitration award should be deemed to encompass both claims, regardless of what actually may have transpired at the arbitration hearing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Moreover, it is unnecessary to determine whether any part of the arbitration award was attributable to Frances Coughlin\u2019s <em>per quod </em>claim, because we are satisfied that a <em>per quod </em>award should be combined with the award to the injured spouse in determining a party\u2019s eligibility for counsel fees and litigation costs under <em>R. </em>4:21A-6(c)(1). Our court rules require a <em>per quod </em>claim to be joined with the claim of the injured party in a single action. <em>R. </em>4:28-3(b); <em>cf. Ekalo v. Constructive Service Corp. of America, </em>46 <em>N.J. </em>82, 91-92 (1965). Moreover, \u201c... both the primary claim of the injured wife and the husband\u2019s derivative claim are ordinarily settled or tried together.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number><em>Boyd v. Steele, </em>107 <em>N.J.Super. </em>405, 413 (App.Div.1969); <em>cf. Tichenor v. Santillo, </em>218 <em>N.J.Super. </em>165, 171-176 (App.Div.1987). In view of the close connection between the principal claim of an injured party and any derivative claim of a spouse for loss of services and consortium, it is appropriate to consider the two claims together in determining whether a party demanding a trial <em>de novo </em>after an automobile arbitration award \u201c... has obtained a verdict at least 20 percent more favorable than the award.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">In this case, plaintiffs\u2019 recovery of $3,500 attributable to Morell\u2019s negligence was only 12.5 percent less than the arbitrator\u2019s award of $4,000 against Morell. Thus, Morell \u201cmay be liable\u201d to plaintiffs for their reasonable litigation costs, in accordance with the provisions of <em>R. </em>4:21A-6. Accordingly, the order denying plaintiffs\u2019 application for attorneys fees and costs is reversed and the matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. Jurisdiction is not retained.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b103-8\"> Actually, Morell is jointly and severally liable with Pfeiffer for the full 56,000 awarded to Charles Coughlin by the jury. However, the parties both seem to assume that in determining whether a jury verdict is 20 percent more favorable than an arbitrator\u2019s award and hence whether <em>R. </em>4:21A\u20146(c)(1) is applicable, it is appropriate to consider only the portion of damages for which a jointly liable defendant will be responsible after receiving contribution from the codefendants in accordance with the Comparative Negligence Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-5.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b104-7\"> If in fact Frances Coughlin\u2019s claim had not been submitted to arbitration, this point should have been raised by motion to dismiss before trial. Morell\u2019s failure to file such a motion indicates that he assumed Frances\u2019 obligation to arbitrate her claim had been satisfied by the proceedings resulting in the $4,000 arbitration award.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b105-10\"> It is unnecessary to determine whether damage awards to different parties should be combined under any other circumstances in determining eligibility for an award of litigation expenses under <em>R. </em>4:21A-6(c)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
