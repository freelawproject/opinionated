That there is no language in the contract, substituting the responsibility of the defendants, for that of the society, or expressive of such intent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b568-6\">The defendants commence, by styling themselves \u201c A committee for building a Congregational church,\u201d &amp;,c., and continue to designate themselves as such committee, and add to their signatures, \u201c building committee are never named or alluded to, in the contract, but as building committee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b568-7\"><em>2. </em>That the rule of law, that an agent binds himself, and not bis principal, unless he use the name of the principal, applies only to <em>sealed </em>instruments. In contracts not under seal, if the agent intend to bind his principal, and not himself, it will be sufficient, if it appear in such contract, that he acts as agent; and a ratification of an act done by one assuming to be agent, relates back, and is eqSivalent to a prior authority. <em>Despatch Line of Packets </em>v. <em>Bellamy Manf. Co., </em>12 N. H. R., 205. <em>Andrews et al. </em>v. <em>Estes et al. </em>2 Fair. R,, 267. <em>Emerson </em>v. <em>Coggswell, </em>4 Shep. R., 77. An agent, who makes a promise, and does not conceal his agency, nor exceed his authority, is not liable, in an action upon such promise. 17 Ver. R., 244. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Huntoon. Abbot </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>17 <em>id. </em>R., 593. If a contract be not under-seal, the authority of one person to contract for another, may be proved, by their subsequent acts. <em>Emerson </em>v. <em>Coggswell, </em>4 Shep. R., 77.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b568-8\"><em>Foster </em>and <em>Wait, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7E\">1. That no person, in making a contract, is considered to be the agent for another, unless he stipulates for his principal, by name, staling his agency, in the instrument which he signs. 1 Sw. Dig., 327. Story on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>Agency, pp. 266, 267. <em>Magill v. Hinsdale, </em>6 Conn. R., 464. <em>Tippetts </em>v. <em>Walker et al., </em>4 Mass. R., 595. <em>Stackpole </em>v. <em>Arnold, </em>11 Mass. R., 26. <em>Alfridson </em>v. <em>Ladd, </em>12 Mass. R., 177. <em>Hastings </em>v. <em>Lovering, </em>2 Pick., 214. <em>Simonds </em>v. <em>Heard, </em>23 Pick., 120. <em>White </em>v. <em>Cuyler, </em>6 T. R., 176. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Smith et al., </em>21 Conn. R., 627. Kent\u2019s Com., vol. 2, pp. 630, 631. Therefore, the defendants not showing, in the contract itself, that they contracted with Kinney, as the agent of a society, nor disclosing the names of any principal, bound themselves personally, and rendered themselves liable to him, and to said plaintiff, as the creditor of Kinney. The addition, \u201c committee,\u201d &amp;c., to their signatures, is merely <em>descriptio personarum. </em>The personal liability of the defendants does not depend upon the question, whether they were in fact agents, nor whether that fact was known to the party with whom the contract was made, but upon the terms of the written instrument. <em>Simonds </em>v. <em>Heard, </em>23 Pick., 125. <em>Windsor et al. </em>v. <em>Griggs, </em>5 Cush. R., 210.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b569-5\">2. That the votes of the society show clearly, that it is the individual contract of the Wheelers, and that they are personally liable thereon. If the defendants were the agents of the society originally,\u2014yet, as their powers were limited, and they, in making this contract, exceeded that limit, they rendered themselves personally liable. 1 Sw. Dig., 327. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>3 Conn. R., 171. <em>Feeder </em>v. <em>Heath, </em>11 Wendell, 477. <em>Bank of Hamburg </em>v. <em>Wray, </em>4 Strobh., 87. U. S. Annual Digest, 1851, p. 380, sec. 26. Although a subsequent ratification might be binding on the society, yet Kinney has still a right to look to the defendants, and his creditors occupy the same ground.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b569-6\">Ellsworth, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AaE7\">The main question in this case is, whether the defendants were debtors of Joseph Kinney, by virtue of the contract, entered into for the building of <em>\u201c </em>a Congrega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>tional church, in the village of Milltown, in North Stonington.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">It is not necessary, in deciding this case, to go through the numerous cases which have been cited at the bar, to show, where agents really or professedly contracting in behalf of others, do not bind their principals, but themselves ; or what should be the form of the agent\u2019s signature, to save himself from responsibility. The books are full of cases upon this refined subject, and are burdened, and overburdened, with elaborate learning, not unfrequently more nice than wise. They show such embarrassing conflict of judicial opinion, that one, in search of- the law, is well nigh tempted to discard the whole that is written, and follow the dictates of his own understanding. The notions too, which prevail in one state or country, and in some cases, in courts of the same country, seem not to be consistent or uniform with themselves. We find one rule applied, in cases of deeds, and another in cases of simple contracts ; one in case of public, another in case of private agents ; and yet they all profess to take the intention of the parties, as the only proper and just rule of construction. Beginning with the case-of <em>Hodgson </em>v. <em>Dexter, </em>1 Cranch, 345, and following along, through all the cases in the states, down to the present time, we can not fail to be struck with their great want of perspicuity and uniformity. And we have sometimes thought, that men of ordinary observation, would not have hesitated, a moment, in discovering the meaning of the parties, where courts, by reason of certain technical rules, have been perplexed and embarrassed beyond measure. We believe, that our own courts are, to a great extent, disentangled from this confusion and contradiction ; and that here, judges are allowed to see and to think as other men see and think.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">It ought always to be a rule of construction, that, whether an agent contracts under seal or without one; by writing or by parol; and whether his principal is the state, or other corporation, or an individual; that the intention of the parties, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>gathered from all the legitimate evidence which belongs to the case, shall be held to be the sure and only criterion of the character and effect of the agent\u2019s act. This is the rule, if I mistake not, of the courts of Connecticut, in those cases where the agent is really clothed with power to act. Undoubtedly, more latitude may be allowed, in cases of parol testimony, than in cases of written instruments, or instruments under seal; and so an act properly done by a public officer, may furnish higher presumptive evidence that he acted in a public capacity; but the <em>intention, </em>when ascertained, is the true and only rule in these, as in other contracts, written or unwritten. We want only to know what the parties, by the language used, intended to declare. The rule of our courts is to be inferred from <em>McGill </em>v. <em>Hinsdale, </em>6 Conn. R., 464; <em>Stamford Bank </em>v. <em>Ferris, 17 </em>Conn. R., 270; <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Hide, </em>10 Conn. R., 330; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>21 Conn. R., 633; <em>Shelton </em>v. <em>Darling, </em>2 Conn. R., 435, and <em>Hovey </em>v. <em>Magill, </em>680.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Now, taking the intention of the parties, as our guide, we are fully satisfied that Mr. Kinney was not building this meeting-house, for the defendants, or on <em>their credit, </em>and we feel confident,- that, had it so happened, in the course of events, that the defendants had failed, leaving this debt unpaid, or that no creditor of Mr. Kinney had laid his attachment on this debt, we should not have heard of any such claim as is now made by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">The contract begins, \u201c This contract,\u201d &amp;c., \u201c by and between Joseph Kinney, on the first part, and Russell Wheeler and Dudley R. Wheeler, a committee for building,\u201d &amp;c. What means this expression, \u201c committee,\u201d but to show the character in which the defendants were going on to contract ? So, for \u201c building a Congregational church in the village of Milltown, in North Stonington.\u201d Was it for the defendants ? No,for the Congregational society. So, again, it is to be built \u201cnear the spot where the present house now stands.\u201d Then to conclude, the contract is signed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>defendants, as building committee. Now, can anything be more expressive and satisfactory than this, as to the character in which these defendants were acting ?</p>\n<p id=\"AqZ\">One of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, in the argument, admitted, that, if the Congregational society had been named in the writing, the defendants would not be held liable as principals. We think they are, or what is equivalent, by the language just quoted. Mr. Kinney very well knew, that this Congregational society were the principals, who entered into this contract, by their committee, formally appointed. Again, this society passed numerous votes and resolutions, on the subject of a contract, and they appointed these defendants, their agents, to make a contract for building this house, and have, in repeated instances, directly and indirectly, ratified the contract itself. Now, from first to last, the agency of the defendants has been known and recognized, by all com cerned in the business, and we are convinced the defendants could not have had the least idea of being personally responsible for this house of public worship. The nature of the case, too, shows how this was understood. Mr. Kinney was one of the signers to the subscription paper, and, from that circumstance, well knew he contracted with the defendants, as a committee of the society.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Since, then, we are satisfied, the parties intended and supposed the contract was made with the society only, and the committee were in fact duly authorized to contract, we are constrained to hold, the defendants must be treated as agents only. '</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">There is no force in the objection, that only two of three of the committee signed the contract. We are not certain but the power is of such a public nature, that a majority only can bind the society. We think the court so held, in the case of <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>already referred to ; but, at all events, if there is a difficulty here, the two who acted professed to act, as the committee, and the society have again and again, ratified and confirmed the particular contract; so that Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>Kinney obtained all the security he originally expected; and, if the society do not complain, he certainly can not. The same may be said, as to the security which the committee were'to exact from the builder. The difficulty, if it ever had any force, which we do not admit, has been waived, by those who alone had any interest to urge it.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">We therefore advise a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">In this opinion, the other judges concurred, except Waite, J., who tried the cause in the court below, and was disqualified.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">New trial to be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
