BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs DaVita, Inc. and Star Dialysis, LLC (collectively, \"DaVita\") are dialysis treatment providers. ECF No. 1 (\"Compl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 1, 12-13. Amy's Kitchen is a California corporation that makes and sells organic foods, and it is the sponsor and plan administrator of the Amy's Kitchen Employee Benefit Health Plan (\"Plan\" or \"Amy's Plan\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14, 16. DaVita provides dialysis treatment to beneficiaries of the Plan who suffer from end-stage renal disease (\"ESRD\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1. ESRD is another term for kidney failure, the last stage of chronic kidney disease.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. Dialysis substitutes many of the normal functions of the kidneys when they have stopped working well enough for the individual to survive otherwise.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. Until 2017, Amy's Plan paid DaVita an \"in-network\" rate for dialysis treatment that was \"significantly lower than the usual and customary\n   rates DaVita charges.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1. As of January 1, 2017, Amy's Plan eliminated network coverage and \"dramatically reduced reimbursement\" for dialysis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   According to DaVita, this elimination of coverage violates the MSPA, which allocates payment responsibility between Medicare and private payers. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 2-4. Before the MSPA was passed by Congress, private insurers had an incentive to push ESRD sufferers onto Medicare because individuals with ESRD are entitled to Medicare regardless of age or financial status.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3. The MSPA reversed this coverage shifting by making \"private insurers ... the 'primary' payers and Medicare the 'secondary' payer\" during an individual's first 30 months of ESRD-based Medicare eligibility.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Bio-Med. Applications of Tenn., Inc. v. Cent. States Se. &amp; Sw. Areas Health &amp; Welfare Fund\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3831301\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/656/277/#p278\">\n    656 F.3d 277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 278 (6th Cir. 2011) ). DaVita claims that Amy's Plan violates this \"foundational principle\" by eliminating in-network coverage of dialysis, which creates incentives for patients with ESRD to drop out of Amy's Plan and rely on Medicare, where their payment obligations would be significantly lower.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The rate DaVita is paid for dialysis treatment depends on whether the patient's insurance is government-sponsored or private, and whether DaVita is in-network or out-of-network.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 25-27. For government-sponsored plans like Medicare, the government unilaterally sets the reimbursement rate, which is usually significantly lower than rates paid by private plans.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. For private insurance plans, the rates depend on whether DaVita is in-network or out-of-network with the plan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. When DaVita is \"in-network,\" DaVita is paid a contractually negotiated rate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   When DaVita is \"out-of-network,\" it is generally paid according to an industry standard rate known as the \"usual, customary, and reasonable\" (\"UCR\") rate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   DaVita's out-of-network payment rates are on average higher than its in-network rates.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Amy's Plan is a preferred provider organization (\"PPO\") health plan, meaning it incentivizes participants to select healthcare providers that have contracted with the plan for discounted rates. Compl. \u00b6 29. In-network coverage generally protects beneficiaries from having to pay any charged amounts not paid for by the plan, a practice known as \"balance billing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30. Until December 31, 2016, Amy's Plan beneficiaries had access to DaVita as an in-network provider.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36. Amy's Plan also covers out-of-network providers who have not contracted with the Plan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31. The Plan pays non-network providers a percentage of what the Plan considers to be the UCR rate for the provided services, leaving the beneficiary to pay higher copayments, along with balance billing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Amy's Plan also relies on third-party claims administrators such as Anthem Blue Cross and regional Blue Cross Blue Shield entities. Compl. \u00b6 32. These entities determine whether to process claims for benefits on a network or non-network basis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Apart from any specific plan, Blue Cross entities have their own networks of contracted and preferred healthcare providers, establishing in-network reimbursement rates for the providers' services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33. Plans then contract with the Blue Cross entities and gain access to these provider networks for their beneficiaries.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   DaVita has contracted with one of these entities, Blue Cross of Oregon, to provide discounted dialysis treatment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   DaVita's claims here stem from claims for treatment rendered by DaVita to Patient 1, an Amy's Plan beneficiary, which were processed by Blue Cross of Oregon on an in-network basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 34. Up through December 2016, DaVita received the rates it had negotiated with\n   Blue Cross of Oregon, which are substantially lower than the usual and customary rates DaVita charges for its services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On January 1, 2017, Amy's Plan \"effectively eliminated network coverage for dialysis treatment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40. On that date, the Plan was amended to include a \"Dialysis Benefit Preservation Program,\" which carves dialysis treatment out of the Plan's in-network/out-of-network approach described above.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41. Instead, dialysis-related claims are subject to \"mandated cost review,\" with dialysis providers no longer treated as in-network.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Neither party disputes that the Plan amendments were designed to save costs on dialysis treatment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 39 (\"This case arises from the Plan's efforts to save money on dialysis treatment.\"); ECF No. 25 at 12-13. According to Amy's, due to the highly concentrated market for dialysis providers, providers like DaVita are able to \"discriminatorily charge plans ... much higher rates for dialysis than they charge government and commercial payers in order to subsidize those larger payers.\" ECF No. 25 at 13. In response, Amy's Plan adopted the Dialysis Benefit Preservation Program as a \"cost-control measure\" to effectuate its \"fiduciary obligation to preserve Plan assets.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   DaVita alleges these actions violated provisions of ERISA and the MSPA, and also asserts related state law claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

ECF No. 25 at 22. Rather, the Plan differentiates on the basis of the medical service provided - dialysis - not the fact of any plan member's ESRD diagnosis or Medicare-eligibility.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3831301\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/656/277/#p278\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Though there appears to be no authority on this question in the Ninth Circuit,\n   <em>\n    National Renal Alliance, LLC v.

DaVita contends that even if Amy's Plan does not facially discriminate against ESRD-based-Medicare-eligible individuals, it violates regulations regarding Medicare secondary payer rules which provide that \"[p]lan provisions that have\n   <em>\n    the effect\n   </em>\n   of denying, restricting, or terminating benefits for [ESRD-based Medicare eligible] individuals\" violate the take-into-account rule as well.

The express terms of the Plan preclude any such claim. A \"similarly situated individual\" here would be someone receiving dialysis treatment who is not Medicare-eligible. Such a patient would be subject to the same provisions as ESRD sufferers under Amy's Plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 25-2 at 36 (\"The Dialysis Program shall be the exclusive means for determining the amount of Plan benefits to be provided to covered persons and for managing cases and claims involving dialysis services and supplies,\n   <em>\n    regardless of the condition causing the need for dialysis.\n   </em>\n   \") (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   DaVita also fails to plead a claim under the differentiation provision of the MSPA.

Although in\n   <em>\n    National Renal Alliance\n   </em>\n   the reimbursement change affected out-of-network facilities only, while here, both in- and out-of-network providers are affected, the fact remains that the Plan does not pay \"a different amount for dialysis treatment of non-ESRD patients [and] ESRD patients.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3348237\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/598/1344/#p1354\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Accordingly, Count 1 is DISMISSED in full because DaVita has failed to adequately plead an MSPA claim.
