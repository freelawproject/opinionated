Plaintiffs' reliance on the fact that the 13 Charities were controlled by Hamas founders, without more, is insufficient to prove that Defendant's activities were violent or endangered human life. Indeed, Plaintiffs offer no evidence, and their experts do not opine, that the 13 Charities participated in, planned, trained the perpetrators of, requested that someone carry out, or were the cause of the attacks giving rise to Plaintiffs' claims.

Plaintiffs' assertions address Defendant's indirect contribution, through banking services, to terrorist activities without establishing any nexus between the banking services and the terrorist activities. Plaintiffs offer no evidence that Defendant's banking services directly involved strong physical force, or intense force, or vehement or passionate threats. Plaintiffs also do not offer evidence sufficient to create a factual dispute as to whether Defendant's banking services directly involved peril or hazard or were likely to cause serious bodily harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Thus, Defendant's request for summary judgment as to the violent acts and acts dangerous to human life prong of \u00a7 2331(1) is granted because Plaintiffs fail to present evidence sufficient to create a jury question as to whether Defendant's activities involved violent acts or acts dangerous to human life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

However, Judge Sifton dismissed Plaintiffs' common law aiding and abetting claims, but did not, and could not address Plaintiffs' statutory aiding and abetting claims under JASTA as the statute did not exist at the time.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Owens v.

Cir. 2018) (\"JASTA does not indicate that Congress merely \"clarified\" existing law when it amended \u00a7 2333 .... If anything, JASTA's passage confirms that Congress knows how to provide for aiding and abetting liability explicitly and that the version of \u00a7 2333 in effect [previously] did not provide for that liability.\"). Defendant contends that Judge Sifton relied on the same legal framework for dismissing Plaintiffs' common law aiding and abetting claims as required for dismissing JASTA claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   , Reply at 8-9, 9, n.9 (citing\n   <em>\n    Strauss I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%202862704\">\n    2006 WL 2862704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 ). Specifically, Defendant contends that Judge Sifton evaluated Plaintiffs' aiding and abetting claim by relying on aiding and abetting precedent set forth in\n   <em>\n    In re Terrorist Attacks on Sept. 11\n   </em>\n   , which considered the\n   <em>\n    Halberstam\n   </em>\n   elements.\n   <em>\n    See,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%202862704\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Terrorist Attacks on Sept. 11, 2001\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9169417\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/349/765/#p798\">\n    349 F.

While Judge Sifton did reference\n   <em>\n    In re Terrorist Attacks on Sept. 11, 2001\n   </em>\n   , it is unclear from\n   <em>\n    Strauss I\n   </em>\n   whether he applied the\n   <em>\n    Halberstam\n   </em>\n   factors.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strauss I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%202862704\">\n    2006 WL 2862704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9. The Second Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Linde\n   </em>\n   made clear that the\n   <em>\n    Halberstam\n   </em>\n   elements of civil aiding and abetting liability and factors relevant to the substantial assistance element provide the proper legal framework for evaluating a JASTA aiding and abetting claim.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515951\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/314/\">\n    882 F.3d at 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because it is unclear whether Judge Sifton applied that framework, the Court does not consider the decision in\n   <em>\n    Strauss I\n   </em>\n   as a bar to Plaintiffs amending their complaint. However, for the reasons that follow immediately below, amendment of the complaint is denied as futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

As a general matter, a Rule 12(b)(6) motion is the benchmark for determining whether amendment is futile.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lucente v.

However, \"when a motion to amend is made in response to a summary judgment motion, the court may deny the amendment as futile when the evidence in support of the plaintiff's proposed new claim creates no triable issue of fact, even if the amended complaint would state a valid claim on its face.\"\n   <em>\n    Alexander\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5746669\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/829/89/#p118\">\n    829 F.

Here, amendment would be futile because Plaintiffs' proposed JASTA claim fails as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Plaintiffs again rely on evidence that apparently tends to support a finding that Defendant had the requisite scienter required for providing material support to a terrorist organization under \u00a7 2339B to support their claim that Defendant had the requisite scienter for aiding and abetting liability under JASTA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   , Opp. at 23-25. Specifically, Plaintiffs assert that Defendant was \"generally aware of its role as repository and distribution mechanism for CBSP's continuing criminal enterprise which carried a foreseeable and enormous ... risk of terror attacks.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-24. However, as discussed in detail above, Plaintiffs present no evidence that creates a triable jury question as to whether Defendant generally was aware that it played a role in any of Hamas' or even CBSP's violent or life-endangering activities. Evidence that Defendant knowingly provided banking services to a terrorist organization, without more, is insufficient to satisfy JASTA's scienter requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Plaintiffs' proposed JASTA aiding and abetting claim cannot survive summary judgment.
