INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Before the court is the Report and Recommendation of United States Magistrate Judge James P. Donohue (R &amp; R (Dkt. # 15)), and Respondents' and Petitioner's objections thereto (Resp't Obj. (Dkt. # 20); Pet'r Obj. (Dkt. # 21)). Having carefully reviewed the foregoing, along with all other relevant documents and the governing law, the court ADOPTS the Report and Recommendation (Dkt. # 15) and DISMISSES Petitioner's action with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A district court has jurisdiction to review a Magistrate Judge's report and recommendation on dispositive matters.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b). \"The district judge must determine de novo any part of the magistrate judge's disposition that has been properly objected to.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"A judge of the court may accept, reject, or modify, in whole or in part, the findings or recommendations made by the magistrate judge.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). The court reviews de novo those portions of the report and recommendation to which specific written objection is made.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Reyna-Tapia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9140196\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/328/1114/#p1121\">\n    328 F.3d 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1121 (9th Cir. 2003) (en banc). \"The statute makes it clear that the district judge must review the magistrate judge's findings and recommendations de novo if objection is made, but not otherwise.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9140196\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/328/1114/#p1121\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   When no objections are filed, the court need not review de novo the report and recommendation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Wang v.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Respondents object to the Report and Recommendation's finding that the court has subject matter jurisdiction to consider a stay of Petitioner's removal pending a resolution of Petitioner's motion to reopen his removal proceedings. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Resp't Obj.) Petitioner objects to the Report and Recommendation's finding that Petitioner's procedural due process rights were not violated. (Pet'r Obj. at 3-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Neither Respondents' nor Petitioner's objections raise any novel issues that were not addressed by Magistrate Judge Donohue's Report and Recommendation. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   R &amp; R.) Moreover, the court has thoroughly examined the record before it and finds Magistrate Judge Donohue's reasoning persuasive in light of that record. Respondents and Petitioners essentially reargue the arguments they made to Magistrate Judge Donohue, as well as arguments that Magistrate Judge Donohue thoroughly addressed in the Report and Recommendation that the parties did not initially raise, and the court independently rejects them for the same reasons as Magistrate Judge Donohue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the court hereby ORDERS as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (1) The court ADOPTS the Report and Recommendation (Dkt. # 15) in its entirety;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (2) The court GRANTS Respondents' motion to dismiss (Dkt. # 4);\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (3) The court DENIES Petitioner's habeas petition (Dkt. # 1);\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (4) The court DENIES Petitioner's motion to stay, (Dkt. # 1-13);\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (5) The court VACATES the temporary stay of removal (Dkt. # 2);\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (6) The court DISMISSES this action with prejudice; and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (7) The court DIRECTS the Clerk to send copies of this order to counsel for Petitioner, counsel for Respondents, and Magistrate Judge Donohue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   JAMES P.

Petitioner did not timely respond, and on the noting date for the motion to dismiss, moved to allow the late filing of his opposition brief. Dkt. 9. Later that day, the Government filed its reply brief opposing the request for an extension of time and asking the Court to dismiss the action. Dkt. 10. Four days later, petitioner filed his response brief.

On October 22, 2018, the parties filed a joint stipulation and proposed order to modify the briefing schedule because petitioner's attorney had suffered a computer problem and hundreds of her files had been deleted, including all of those related to this case. Dkt. 6. The Court granted the joint stipulation, ordered petitioner to file his response brief by October 29, 2018, and re-noted the Government's motion to dismiss for November 2, 2018. Dkt. 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On October 30, 2018, petitioner filed an untimely amended habeas petition. Dkt. 8. On November 2, 2018, petitioner filed a motion to allow the late filing of his response to the Government's motion to dismiss. Dkt. 9. The same day, the Government filed a reply brief, arguing that the Court should not accept petitioner's tardy amended habeas petition, should deny petitioner's request to file his response brief late, and should grant the motion to dismiss. Dkt. 10. On November 6, 2018, petitioner filed his response brief. Dkt. 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Preliminary matters\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   There are two preliminary matters the Court must resolve before turning to the merits of petitioner's habeas petition and the Government's motion to dismiss. First, the Government claims that petitioner's amended habeas petition was filed late and should not be accepted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 10. Petitioner filed his amended habeas petition several days after the deadline to file without written consent of the Government or leave of the Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(1)(B) (\"A party may amend its pleading once as a matter of course within (A) 21 days after serving it, or (B) if the pleading is one to which a responsive pleading is required, 21 days after service of a responsive pleading ....\"); Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2) (\"In all other cases, a party may amend its pleading only with the opposing party's written consent or the court's leave.\"). Petitioner's counsel has acknowledged the error, but she has not\n   obtained the Government's written consent or asked the Court for leave to amend. Because the amended habeas petition was filed in contravention of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the original habeas petition remains the operative pleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Second, petitioner moves the Court to accept his late-filed response brief. Dkt. 9. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide: \"When an act may or must be done within a specified time, the court may, for good cause, extend the time: ... (B) on motion made after the time has expired if the party failed to act because of excusable neglect.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(b)(1). Whether a litigant has established excusable neglect is entrusted to the Court's discretion.\n   <em>\n    Pincay v. Andrews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9149897\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/389/853/#p859\">\n    389 F.3d 853\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 859 (9th Cir. 2004). The Court considers four factors: (1) the danger of prejudice to the non-moving party, (2) the length of delay and its potential impact on judicial proceedings, (3) the reason for the delay, including whether it was within the reasonable control of the movant, and (4) whether the moving party's conduct was in good faith.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9149897\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/389/853/#p859\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 855 (citing\n   <em>\n    Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. Brunswick Assoc. Ltd.

There is no apparent danger of prejudice to the Government beyond a slight inconvenience. The delay was minimal and only minimally impacted the proceedings. The delay was caused by counsel's miscalculation of deadlines in the week following her serious computer malfunction; she has taken responsibility for her mistake, apologized, and acted promptly to remedy the effects. As to the fourth factor, however, petitioner's counsel appears to have misrepresented to the Court that petitioner has a pending T visa application, and this apparent misrepresentation is repeated throughout the response brief. Nevertheless, having weighed the four factors, the Court finds counsel's neglect excusable and GRANTS petitioner's motion to accept his late-filed response brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Jurisdiction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Petitioner contends that it would violate substantive and procedural due process to remove him before his motion to reopen is adjudicated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 1.

Neither party addressed the\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   factors in their briefing, therefore the Court proceeds without the benefit of the parties' arguments. Petitioner has a strong interest in remaining in the United States with his family.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ching v.

There is little risk of an erroneous deprivation of this interest through the current procedures. Petitioner was ordered removed by an IJ after a hearing, he appealed this determination to the BIA, and then sought review in the Ninth Circuit. He has filed a motion to reopen with the BIA, and he may appeal any adverse determination to the Ninth Circuit. If he is removed to Mexico while his motion to reopen is pending, he may continue to litigate his case from abroad.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Toor v.

Importantly, unlike some cases where noncitizens have presented colorable claims of persecution upon removal, and therefore a likelihood that they would not be able to continue to litigate their motions to reopen,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Devitri v.

Allowing petitioner to remain in the United States while his motion to reopen is pending is unlikely to provide additional value, in terms of due process protections, and it likely would provide at least some administrative burdens on ICE, which would be required to continue to monitor him. Finally, the government has an interest in executing administratively final removal orders. Weighing the\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   factors, the Court concludes that due process does not require a stay of petitioner's removal pending adjudication of his motion to reopen.

Stated another way, to indulge this theory is to hold that an illegal [noncitizen] with United States citizen family members cannot be removed, regardless of the illegality of that [noncitizen's] entry into the United States or conduct while within its borders. Such a remarkable proposition, which would radically alter the status quo of our immigration law, simply cannot be gained by judicial fiat from an intermediate court. If there is to be such a fundamental change in immigration law, it must originate with the Congress or with the United States Supreme Court, and not at our level of the judiciary.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    <em>\n     Morales-Izquierdo\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4224783\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/600/1076/#p1091\">\n     600 F.3d at 1091\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
