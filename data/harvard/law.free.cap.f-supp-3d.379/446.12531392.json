Conner, Chief Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Carl Dale Hott (\"Hott\") commenced this action against his former employer, defendant Auto System Centers, Inc. (\"Auto System\"), alleging that Auto System terminated him for participating in jury service in violation of\n   42 PA. CONS. STAT. \u00a7 4563. Hott also brings a claim for wrongful discharge. Auto System moves for summary judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56. (Doc. 38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background &amp; Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Auto System provides automobile repair and maintenance services. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 45-3 at 2). Hott interviewed for a district manager position with Chris Harter (\"Harter\"), Auto System's regional manager. (Doc. 40 \u00b6 2). Harter instead offered Hott a store manager position, which Hott declined. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2-3). Several months later, Hott expressed renewed interest in the offered position and Harter set up an interview for Hott with an Auto System district manager, Trent Kight (\"Kight\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4-5). In September 2015, Kight hired Hott as store manager for Auto System's Allison Park, Pennsylvania location. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 5; Doc. 44 \u00b6\u00b6 1; Hott Dep. 68:8-20 (\"Hott Dep.\")).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As regional manager, Harter was responsible for eight district managers and 48 stores across New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio; he lived and maintained an office in Ohio. (Doc. 40 \u00b6\u00b6 17-19, 21). Harter rotated among the 48 stores and visited the Allison Park location every few months. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-23). As district manager, Kight oversaw daily operation of seven stores in Pittsburgh. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13). His responsibilities included human resources, facilities and equipment maintenance, and sales. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14). Hott reported directly to Kight who, in turn, reported to Harter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12, 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Auto System evaluates store managers based on \"key performance indicators.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kight Dep. 53:14-16, 55:8-13 (\"Kight Dep.\")). The universe of key performance indicators encompasses sales, payroll metrics, cost of goods, store image, employee turnover, each store's \"stat sheet,\" Auto System's \"secret shopper\" program, phone recordings of customer interactions, credit card applications, online reviews, and a customer service index. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Harter Dep. 42:2-45:18 (\"Harter Dep.\"); Kight Dep. 53:14-55:7). In December 2015, Kight circulated \"The 2016 Midas VI\" goals to each of the seven stores in his district. (Doc. 45-2 at 37;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Kight Dep. 50:22-51:13). The 2016 Midas VI set daily, weekly, and monthly goals for store managers in six areas: credit card applications, online reviews,\n   tires, alignments, spins, and gross profits. (Doc. 45-2 at 38;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Kight Dep. 50:22-51:13). Despite some overlap, the Midas VI goals were a distinct set of benchmarks from Auto System's key performance indicators. (Harter Dep. 45:19-21;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Kight Dep. 53:14-20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The offer letter to Hott detailed the responsibilities of an Auto System store manager. (Doc. 40 \u00b6\u00b6 6-10). In particular, Hott was responsible for the Allison Park store seven days a week and was required to work when store staff was shorthanded. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-8). In addition, Hott was an at-will employee, and Auto System reserved the right to require him to work up to six days a week based on staffing and sales needs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6, 9). He was accountable for sales growth, profitability, the store's image, and generally upholding company standards and procedures. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9-10;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Kight Dep. 44:11-17). Kight and Hott spoke by phone at least once a week, and Kight was physically present at the Allison Park store approximately one full day every other week. (Doc. 40 \u00b6 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Allison Park location had once been successful, and Harter hoped that with Hott as store manager, it would \"perform again.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26; Harter Dep. 75:8-11). During his tenure at this location, Hott received some negative feedback on his performance. (Doc. 40 \u00b6 31). Kight told Hott that his performance was \"flat\" and that he needed to increase sales. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30; Hott Dep. 92:1-8, 96:17-20). Harter testified that after visits to the store, he lost hope that it would improve and stated that he \"never saw a sparkle in [Hott].\" (Harter Dep. 93:10-94:1). Harter struggled to recall the nature and frequency of his visits to Allison Park and what factors led to his conclusion that Hott had not improved store operations, beyond purported average sales performance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 93:10-95:11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   When the Allison Park store did not improve as anticipated, Harter informed Kight that he wanted Hott to be terminated for poor performance. (Kight Dep. 108:21-109:9;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 40 \u00b6\u00b6 27, 30; Doc. 44 \u00b6\u00b6 27, 30). Ostensibly against Harter's wishes, Kight offered to transfer Hott to the Penn Hills, Pennsylvania location. (Hott Dep. 92:20-93:2). Hott requested time to think about the transfer offer because the Penn Hills location was one of the poorest performing stores in Kight's district. (Doc. 40 \u00b6\u00b6 32-33). He ultimately agreed to take the position. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Hott was transferred to the Penn Hills location in July 2016 and worked there through mid-October 2016. (Hott Dep. 96:4-7). Harter stated that he hoped Hott would \"grow his skills\" managing the Penn Hills store. (Doc. 40 \u00b6 28; Harter Dep. 75:14-15). Hott testified that Kight asked him to move to the Penn Hills location after Kight had \"two very bad customer service issues\" with previous store managers. (Hott Dep. 87:25-89:1). According to Hott, Kight never indicated that Hott's transfer was based on dissatisfaction with his job performance at Allison Park. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 89:2-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Jury Summons\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On Friday, October 7, 2016, Hott received a jury duty summons directing him to report for jury service on Tuesday, October 11, 2016. (Doc. 40 \u00b6 39). When Hott informed Kight of his jury summons, Kight responded \"okay. That's fine. Just switch your day off.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 41-42). Hott expressed concern that jury duty may be more than one day and explained that he could not take his day off on October 11 because of a preexisting veterinary appointment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43). Kight responded \"[w]ell, you'll have to figure something out, then.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44). Hott had previously taken individual days off work with no negative impact on his employment; on one such\n   occasion, Kight covered the Penn Hills store for Hott. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 57-58).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Hott asked his assistant manager, Jeff Kendall (\"Kendall\"), to cover the store on October 11 in his absence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11, 46). Kendall was purportedly unable to switch days because he had a longstanding commitment at an outpatient clinic on Tuesday mornings. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47; Doc. 44 \u00b6 47; Hott Dep. 49:2-5). Kendall claims he told Hott that he could cover the store on October 11. (Kendall Dep. 15:16-16:9 (\"Kendall Dep.\")). Hott sent Kight a text message on Saturday, October 8, 2016 stating Kendall was unable to cover the store and that, as an exempt employee, he believed Auto System had to pay him for any days spent on jury duty. (Doc. 40 \u00b6 49). Hott texted Kight: \"Either way as soon as they interview me I'll get out of it bc I'm not trying to do that shit but I thought u said u have Harter next week so jus tryin to cover bases.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Hott did not want to serve on a jury. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On Sunday, October 9, Kendall called Hott and stated that he could cover Hott's shift on Tuesday by moving his day off. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51). Hott texted Kight Sunday afternoon to let him know that Kendall was covering the store on Tuesday; Kight received the text and acknowledged it when he was at the store on Monday. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 52-53). Hott was not selected as a member of a jury and returned to work on Wednesday, October 12. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54). When Hott asked Kight whether he needed to provide paperwork to get paid for jury duty, Kight responded \"no.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59). Hott believed he would be paid for the day of jury service based on Kight's response. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Penn Hills Store Visit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Harter conducted store visits in Kight's district beginning on Monday, October 10, 2016. (Kight Dep. 89:2-90:21;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 40 \u00b6\u00b6 49, 62). Harter visited the Penn Hills store on October 12 for the second time during Hott's tenure as store manager at that location. (Doc. 40 \u00b6 61;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   During his visit, Harter became visibly upset at the state of the Penn Hills store. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63). Oil was seeping out of several oil bins and covered an area of five feet or more. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64; Kendall Dep. 22:10-22). The parties dispute the size of the spill and exactly how long the oil spill had been left unaddressed. (Doc. 40 \u00b6\u00b6 64-65; Doc. 44 \u00b6\u00b6 64-65). Harter testified that Oil-Dri, a cat litter-like substance, had been placed on the spill and that rags were left lying around the floor. (Harter Dep. 83:15-84:19). Kendall stated that no effort had been made to contain or clean the spill until Harter and Kight arrived at the store, but he did not recall seeing the spill the previous day, when he covered Hott's shift. (Kendall Dep. 23:4-11, 24:23-25:11). Harter, Kight, and Kendall spent over four hours cleaning up the oil spill. (Doc. 40 \u00b6\u00b6 67, 69, 75). Hott assisted with cleanup but also covered the front desk and office and received customers throughout the day. (Harter Dep. 87:10-16; Kendall Dep. 23:24-24:12; Hott Dep. 106:6-23). Kight and Harter were dissatisfied with Hott's contributions to the cleanup effort and felt Hott showed no concern about the oil spill. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Harter Dep. 184:22-24; Kight Dep. 97:16-98:23). Harter viewed Hott's failure to address the spill earlier as a lack of leadership and evidence of neglect. (Doc. 40 \u00b6\u00b6 73-74).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Harter identified an issue with the store's oil pumps. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71). The oil pumps were on top of the 55-gallon oil barrels rather than inside them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71; Harter Dep. 85:8-13; 87:2-3). Hott explained that he and his team had been unable to get the oil pumps to work properly, at which point Harter showed the group how to prime and operate the pumps. (Hott Dep. 105:12-16; Doc. 40 \u00b6 72). Harter testified that\n   poorly maintained bushes, unaddressed weeds, and debris in the dumpster area also contributed to the store's negative appearance. (Harter Dep. 82:2-14;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Kight Dep. 107:13-14). Approximately one week earlier, Kight had conducted an \"in-shop evaluation\" of the Penn Hills store which graded both weed and trash cleanup, and lawn and beds maintenance, as \"good.\" (Doc. 45-3 at 6). Auto System's October 2016 newsletter noted that the Penn Hills \"office always looks great and the lawn is always well maintained.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Hott's Termination\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On the evening of October 12, 2016, Harter told Kight to terminate Hott's employment. (Doc. 40 \u00b6 86). Harter testified that with each visit to the Penn Hills store, he \"lost more and more faith in [Hott's] performance and abilities.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29; Harter Dep. 75:14-18). He cited Hott's lack of leadership and commitment, his handling of the oil spill, the store's appearance, and his unprofessional \"image\" as reasons for the termination. (Harter Dep. 95:13-96:1, 180:10-181:1). Harter clarified that the Penn Hills store sales, the key performance indicators, and the Midas VI goals played no role in his decision. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 96:4-12, 106:22-108:5). Neither Hott nor Kendall ever told Harter about Hott's jury service. (Doc. 40 \u00b6\u00b6 92, 96-97). Harter contends that he was not aware that Hott missed work on October 11 for jury duty when he directed Kight to fire Hott. (Harter Dep. 66:16-68:10). He also claims that it was solely his decision to terminate Hott's employment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 92:11-23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On October 17, 2016, Kight terminated Hott and informed him that he was being let go for \"poor performance.\" (Doc. 40 \u00b6\u00b6 88-89). Kight testified that Harter made the decision to terminate Hott but that Kight was responsible for completing the employee separation notice. (Kight Dep. 105:2-6, 123:4-12; Harter Dep. 106:12-21). Kight documented what he perceived to be Harter's motivations based on their conversations about Hott. (Kight Dep. 105:21-106:5). The notice states that Hott was terminated for poor performance and \"failure to achieve minimum [key performance indicator] goals.\" (Doc. 45-2 at 28-29). Kight cited to Hott's lack of commitment, his failure to maintain the internal and external appearance of the store, and improperly dressed store technicians as evidence of his poor performance. (Kight Dep. 101:5-9, 101:23-102:11). He further elaborated that Harter considered Hott's failure to achieve the minimum weekly sales threshold at the Penn Hills store for two consecutive weeks as another reason for his termination, but acknowledged that Harter never mentioned key performance indicators as a reason for terminating Hott. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 102:16-22, 107:9-12, 107:19-21; Harter Dep. 107:25-108:5). Harter clarified that he provided Kight with no instruction as to how to fill out Hott's termination notice and claimed he was unaware that Hott had failed to meet target sales goals when he decided to terminate Hott. (Harter Dep. 106:22-107:24, 147:1-9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On October 18, 2016, Kight notified Auto System's payroll department that Hott should receive his normal weekly salary for his final week of work because his absence on October 11 was for jury duty. (Doc. 40 \u00b6 103; Doc. 44 \u00b6 103). Contemporaneous with Hott's termination, Auto System experienced technical difficulties with its payroll system causing employees companywide not to receive their paychecks. (Doc. 40 \u00b6\u00b6 105-06). Hott received a direct deposit in error which Auto System reversed, causing a negative account balance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 107-08). Auto System's payroll department assured Hott that it would deposit the proper amounts \"[o]nce the reverse cleared.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 108-09). Hott contacted Harter to express his frustration with the length of time Auto System took to rectify the payroll issues and deposit\n   error. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 110). At that time, Hott did not raise the issue of jury duty compensation with Harter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 111). At some point following his termination and the payroll issues, Hott realized that Auto System failed to pay him for his day of jury service. (Hott Dep. 70:1-16). Following Hott's deposition in July 2017, Auto System paid Hott for his day of jury service. (Doc. 40 \u00b6 104; Doc. 45-2 at 27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Hott commenced this action in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. Hott asserts one claim of a violation of Pennsylvania's juror protection statute and one claim for wrongful discharge in violation of Pennsylvania public policy. Auto System timely removed the case to federal court. Auto System now moves for summary judgment on both claims.

In the context of other public policy exceptions to the at-will employment doctrine, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court instructs that the activity implicating public policy must be a \"substantial factor\" in an employer's decision to terminate or adversely affect the conditions of employment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Rothrock v.

Harter and Kight never discouraged Hott from participating in jury duty or threatened him with negative employment repercussions for participating therein. Kight's comments simply do not evince hostility toward jury service, especially given that, as store manager, Hott was responsible for scheduling store coverage and working when the staff was shorthanded. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 40 \u00b6\u00b6 7-8, 41-42, 44). The only person to explicitly disparage jury service was Hott, who did not want to serve on a jury. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 40, 49).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We find, however, that Hott has narrowly adduced sufficient circumstantial evidence to allow a reasonable jury to conclude that Auto System terminated Hott because of his jury service. Harter directed Kight to terminate Hott the day after he returned from jury service. (Doc. 40 \u00b6\u00b6 54, 86). Kight effected Hott's termination\n   within one week of his jury service. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 54, 88-89). Hott claims Auto System \"refus[ed] to pay [him] for the jury duty day he missed.\" (Doc. 42 at 22). He did not receive compensation for his one day of jury service, despite Kight's instruction to the payroll department, until after his deposition nearly nine months later. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 40 \u00b6\u00b6 103-04; Doc. 44 \u00b6 103; Doc. 45-2 at 27). Auto System points to companywide payroll issues around the time of Hott's termination, as well as Hott's failure to notify anyone of the mistake, as reasons for its failure to timely compensate him for jury service. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 40 \u00b6\u00b6 105-11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Genuine questions also remain as to Harter and Kight's proffered explanations for Hott's termination. Harter and Kight testified that Hott was transferred to Penn Hills because of his lackluster performance as store manager in Allison Park. (Doc. 40 \u00b6\u00b6 30-31; Hott Dep. 92:1-8, 96:17-20; Harter Dep. 93:10-94:1). But Harter could not recall what factors informed this opinion or how often he visited Allison Park when Hott worked there. (Harter Dep. 93:10-95:11). Hott maintains that he was transferred to Penn Hills after two previous store managers failed, not because he underperformed at the Allison Park store. (Hott Dep. 87:25-89:5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Following his visit to the Penn Hills store, Harter pointed to Hott's purported lack of leadership and commitment, his handling of an oil spill, and the store's appearance as reasons for terminating Hott. (Harter Dep. 95:13-96:1, 180:10-181:1). Harter and Kight's testimony conflict as to whether Penn Hills weekly average sales factored into the termination decision. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Harter Dep. 96:4-12, 147:1-9\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Kight Dep. 102:16-22, 107:9-12). Harter claims that he did not consider Hott's success or failure appertaining Auto System's key performance indicators or the 2016 Midas VI goals, but Kight cited \"failure to achieve minimum [key performance indicator] goals\" as a reason for firing Hott on the employment termination notice. (Harter Dep. 96:4-12, 106:22-108:5; Doc. 45-2 at 28-29). And Harter's testimony regarding the negative exterior appearance of the Penn Hills store on October 11 is contradicted by Kight's in-shop evaluation the week before and the company's October 2016 newsletter which extolled the well-maintained Penn Hills store. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Harter Dep. 82:2-14\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   Kight Dep. 107:13-14\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Doc. 45-3 at 4, 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Auto System argues that Harter exercised sole decisionmaking authority and had no knowledge of Hott's jury service at the time he directed Kight to terminate Hott. (Doc. 48 at 6-11). According to Kight, Harter wanted Hott terminated for poor performance at the Allison Park location, yet Kight instead transferred Hott to the Penn Hills store. (Kight Dep. 108:21-109:9; Hott Dep. 92:20-93:2;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 40 \u00b6\u00b6 32-34). Harter, who is based in Ohio, travelled to Pittsburgh to visit stores with Kight the week of Hott's jury duty. (Doc. 40 \u00b6\u00b6 13, 18, 21, 49, 62; Kight Dep. 89:2-90:21). Kight was aware of Hott's jury summons. (Doc. 40 \u00b6 41). Although admittedly a close call, we find that a reasonable jury could infer that Harter learned of Hott's absence on October 11 for jury service when planning his store visits in Kight's district. On at least one prior occasion, Kight covered the Penn Hills store in Hott's absence. (Doc. 40 \u00b6 58). A jury could plausibly conclude that any absence for jury duty would inconvenience Harter as well as Kight, who as district manager would have been responsible for covering the Penn Hills store during Harter's visit to his district if Hott failed to find coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Taken together, the close proximity of Hott's jury service and termination, discrepancies in Harter and Kight's proffered justifications for firing Hott, and Auto System's failure to timely pay him for jury service militate against summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Moreover, credibility questions remain as to who exercised decisionmaking authority in firing Hott, whether all decisionmakers knew of Hott's jury service at the relevant times, and to what extent Hott's absence may have inconvenienced Harter and Kight. Based on this Rule 56 record, a reasonable jury could conclude that Hott's jury service was a substantial factor in Auto System's decision to terminate him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    B.
