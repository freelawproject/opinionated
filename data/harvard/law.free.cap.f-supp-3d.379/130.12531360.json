INTRODUCTION\n  </strong>\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-10\">\n  This action arises out of the destruction and reproduction of a site-specific mural created by plaintiff Patrick Urbain Pottier (\"Urbain\") at a hotel the defendant Hotel Plaza Las Delicias, Inc. (\"the Hotel\") owns. The Hotel covered the mural with wallpaper (destroying it), printed a copy onto wallpaper, and displayed it in another area of the Hotel. Urbain sues the Hotel for copyright infringement under the federal Copyright Act,\n  <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20106\">\n   17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 106\n  </extracted-citation>\n  <em>\n   et seq.\n  </em>\n  , and the Puerto Rico Authors' Moral Rights Act (\"the PRMRA\"), P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, \u00a7\u00a7 1401i -1401ff. The Hotel moves to dismiss the action because: (1) Urbain has not pleaded damages sufficiently under the federal Copyright Act, (2) the PRMRA does not protect Urbain's site-specific mural, and (3) the Copyright Act preempts the PRMRA. At the March 27, 2019 hearing on the motion, this Court denied the motion to dismiss as to the Copyright Act claim and took the motion under advisement as to the PRMRA claim.\n </opinion>\n <footnote label=\"1\">\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation.\n  </p>\n </footnote>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Phillips is arguing that VARA's silence on a subject is actually evidence that the statute addresses that subject. To say the least, this is an odd way to read a statute. If VARA actually established such a complicated, dual regime, we would expect that the phrase \"site-specific\", or some equivalent, would appear in the language of the statute. There is no such phrase anywhere. Indeed, we would expect much more than just a reference to site-specific art. We would expect an elaboration of how to differentiate between site-specific and non-site-specific art (plop-art). That elaboration is nowhere to be found.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Moreover, the creation of a dual regime -- which would require us, essentially, to rewrite VARA - has potentially far-reaching effects beyond the protection of Phillips' work in the Park.

Such a conclusion could dramatically affect real property interests and laws.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   For example, as Pembroke argues in its brief, Phillips' work in the Park \"lies within a rapidly changing urban area and extends beyond Eastport Park to Boston Harbor.\" If a dual regime were created, there is the potential that: not only would Pembroke's ability to move [Phillips'] work or alter Eastport Park be subject to Phillips' approval, but also the owners of nearby property who had nothing to do with the purchase or installation of Phillips' works would be subject to claims that what they do with\n   <em>\n    their\n   </em>\n   property has somehow affected the site and has, as a result, altered or destroyed Phillips' works....

Said federal legislation applies only to works that have less than two hundred (200) copies. We must clarify the federal legislation is not preemptive, thus allowing states, and in this case, Puerto Rico, to legislate in favor of the moral rights of authors whenever the federal statute does not protect the same. As a matter of fact, states such as New York and California have approved legislation related to authors' moral rights.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   The main objectives of this measure are: 1) to achieve greater certainty and clarify some aspects about how moral rights are applicable; 2) minimize possible clashes with the statutory scheme of the Copyright Act; 3) temper our protections with the realities of the digital age so as not to hinder the Island's economic, educational, cultural, and creative development.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Our artists play an important role in capturing the essence of our culture and preserving it for future generations to appreciate. There is an interest to clearly define the rights of artists, both for their sake and that of the public in general. Access to artistic works must be a priority for a society. Moreover, we must emphasize that such rights belong to the authors and the State must facilitate whatever it is that the former wishes to do with its creations, rather than limiting their abilities. The State must refocus its efforts towards that which supports fostering the arts, making the flow of works more flexible, and safekeeping the balance between society's access to a work and the control of such work by he who creates it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    Statement of Motives of Act No. 55 of 2012\n   </em>\n   at 3-4, Oficina de Servicios Legislatives, www.oslpr.org/download/en/2012/A-0055-2012.pdf (last visited May 9, 2019)(\"Statement of Motives\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Urbain also cites to a Seventh Circuit decision criticizing the First Circuit's interpretation that the VARA does not apply to site-specific art.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    Kelley\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Chicago Park Dist.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4029497\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/635/290/#p306\">\n    635 F.3d 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 306 (7th Cir. 2011) (\"question[ing] [the First Circuit's] interpretation of VARA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Hotel responds that Legislative history reinforces its interpretation of the PRMRA:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   It defies credulity to argue that the Legislative Assembly, aware of the fact that courts within this Circuit had forewarned that statutes that do not mention the concept of site-specific work should not be read as trumping the rights of real property, nonetheless chose to protect such works without making a single reference to them in the PRMRA or the statute's legislative history.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Reply Opp'n 10.

At the hearing, this request was denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Hotel has the better of it. The PRMRA suffers from the same issue as VARA: it does not mention site-specific works.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The legislative history of the PRMRA acknowledges differences between United States law under the Copyright Act, including VARA, and the roots of Puerto Rico's moral rights law in the Spanish Intellectual Property Law of 1879. Statement of Motives 3. The Court recognizes this distinction and the Legislative Assembly's expressed intent that the PRMRA complement federal law. Statement of Motives 4. The Court is persuaded, however, that if the Puerto Rico Legislative Assembly was aware of the thorny property issues that arise in site-specific works - and Court assumes that it was -- it would have addressed the issue explicitly had it intended the PRMRA to cover site specific-works. Where there is no mention of site-specific works of art, and our Circuit is one of the few Circuits by analogy to have dealt with the issue head-on, it would appear the absence of any mention of site-specific art excludes site-specific art from the PRMRA. If protection of site-specific art is necessary under the PRMRA, the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico can amend the statutory scheme.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644473\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/459/128/#p143\">\n    459 F.3d at 143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he plain language of VARA does not protect site-specific art.
