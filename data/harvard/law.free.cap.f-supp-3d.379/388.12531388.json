The claims arise from acquisition negotiations and a confidentiality agreement between EPAM and PointSource, LLC, to which CKSJB alleges it is successor in interest. EPAM moves to dismiss all claims for lack of standing and failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The Court grants the Motion, though CKSJB may amend its breach of contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2016, PointSource, a tech firm, was looking for a buyer that could \"infuse cash and help the company grow its business.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 17.) Several companies showed \"substantial interest\" in purchasing PointSource, including software development company EPAM. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 18-19.) On September 7, 2016, EPAM and PointSource signed a Confidentiality Agreement in which they, among other things, agreed not to disclose to any third party that EPAM was evaluating the possibility of a transaction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 20-23; Am. Compl. Ex. B (\"Agreement\") 1.) The Agreement also made clear that neither party was committing to a transaction, or even to continued negotiations, and that neither any written document that is not intended to be legally binding nor any oral agreement or course of conduct would constitute a \"definitive agreement\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   The recipient shall have no obligation to enter into any further agreement with the other party, conduct or continue discussions or negotiations, or enter into or negotiate a definitive agreement. Each party agrees that no contract or agreement providing for a transaction shall exist until definitive agreements have been executed and delivered by duly authorized representatives of each party. Each party reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reject any and all proposals with regard to any proposed transaction or relationship or any definitive agreement and to suspend or terminate discussions and negotiations at any time. For purposes of this paragraph, definitive agreements do not include an executed letter of intent or any other preliminary written document that the parties state is not intended to be legally binding, or any oral agreement or course of conduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   (Agreement \u00b6 9.) After executing the Confidentiality Agreement, EPAM began assessing PointSource's value. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 24.) PointSource provided financial information and other documents to EPAM, and senior management for both parties\n   arranged phone discussions and in-person meetings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 26-29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On December 29, 2016, EPAM emailed PointSource its proposed price terms, which it specified were \"not binding at this point.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33.) On January 10, EPAM sent PointSource a draft Indication of Interest (\"IOI\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34.) The IOI states that EPAM's proposal \"assumes the purchase by EPAM (or an acquisition vehicle formed by EPAM), of substantially all of the assets of the business of [PointSource].\" (Am. Compl. Ex. C (\"IOI\") 2.) It includes EPAM's proposed valuation of PointSource, \"between $ 24 million and $ 34 million,\" and outlines a proposed transaction structure: \"EPAM would pay the purchase price in two tranches, with $ 24 million paid at closing ... and up to $ 10 million of additional purchase price ... payable contingent on the acquired company achieving certain performance metrics in 2017.\" (IOI 1.) The IOI also contained the following provision, which appeared twice, on two separate pages:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   NON-BINDING AGREEMENT\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   This proposal does not constitute and will not give rise to any legally binding obligation whatsoever on the part of EPAM. Moreover, except as expressly provided in any binding written agreement that EPAM and [PointSource] may enter into in the future, no past, present or future action, course of conduct, or failure to act relating to the transaction described herein and/or this proposal or relating to the negotiation of the terms of the transaction contemplated herein and/or this proposal will give rise to or serve as the basis for any obligation or other liability on the part of such entities or any of their respective affiliates.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (IOI 5, 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After receiving the draft IOI, PointSource called EPAM President and CEO Arkadiy Dobkin \"to inquire about EPAM's intention to negotiate in good faith and to acquire PointSource pursuant to the terms in its letter of intent.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Am. Compl. \u00b6 35.) CKSJB alleges that Dobkin \"assured PointSource that EPAM was fully committed to the transaction and, to induce PointSource to choose to move forward with EPAM, expressly agreed with PointSource to work diligently and to negotiate in good faith to complete the deal described in EPAM's proposal.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36.) PointSource also asked EPAM to \"adjust the carve-outs and allocations to PointSource's key personnel.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37.) On January 15, PointSource sent EPAM a redlined version of the draft IOI. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38.) EPAM agreed to PointSource's proposed changes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37.) EPAM executed the final IOI on January 19, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 37-39; IOI 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   CKSJB alleges that PointSource \"agree[d] to\" and \"accept[ed]\" the IOI's terms. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 126-27.) The Amended Complaint states that \"the executed [IOI] established a framework for the parties' continued negotiations and reflected the material terms of the proposed acquisition, as agreed to by EPAM and PointSource.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 47.) \"The parties intended the [IOI] both to continue and to re-establish their mutually binding agreement to negotiate diligently and in good faith.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On January 19, the day PointSource received the final IOI, PointSource emailed EPAM:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Thank you for the executed LOI, we are excited to move forward. Although the agreement doesn't call for immediate exclusivity, we intend to move forward solely with EPAM. We are stopping discussions with all other companies, and are excited to enter due diligence. Please let us know next steps.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 41.) CKSJB alleges that PointSource declined purchase offers from other companies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Between January and April of 2017, PointSource worked with EPAM as EPAM conducted due diligence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 62-63.) On March 23, 2017, EPAM sent PointSource a draft Asset Purchase Agreement, which \"mirrored the material terms of the deal set forth in the [IOI].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 80, 82.) PointSource and EPAM's leadership teams then met twice in person to discuss the closing timeline and employee transitions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 84-86.) During these meetings, \"EPAM explicitly directed PointSource to treat the transaction as a done deal\" and asked PointSource to \"prepare to tell clients and employees\" about the purchase. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 88.) In early April, \"at EPAM's instruction,\" PointSource told key employees about the purchase and started to prepare them for the transition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 92.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On April 4, 2017, EPAM gave PointSource a timeline for closing, and PointSource sent EPAM its proposed edits to the Purchase Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 93, 100.) EPAM's timeline proposed an April 28 signing and mid-May closing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 94.) PointSource's proposed edits to the Purchase Agreement did not alter material or financial terms. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 101.) The parties scheduled a call and meeting for April 12 and April 18, respectively, to finalize EPAM's due diligence and discuss integration. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 98.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On April 5, EPAM proposed that the structure of the transaction change from an asset purchase to an equity purchase. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 104.) After a phone call with EPAM, PointSource agreed to the change. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 106-07.) EPAM said it would send a revised Purchase Agreement the following week. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 108.) On April 11, however, EPAM \"notified PointSource by phone it was unilaterally and arbitrarily terminating its acquisition.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 111.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The plaintiff bears the burden to establish standing under Article III of the United States Constitution by showing (1) it suffered an injury in fact, (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the defendant's challenged action and (3) it is likely, as opposed to speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.\n   <em>\n    Lujan v.

(Pl.'s Mem. Opp'n Mot. Dismiss (\"Pl.'s Mem.\") 14-18, ECF No. 29.) CKSJB contends that the IOI expressly promises that EPAM will work diligently to close the transaction in an expedient manner and complete due diligence in approximately twelve weeks. CKSJB also argues that EPAM's conduct after executing the IOI establishes its intent to be bound by those promises: in-person meetings with PointSource's leadership, intensive due diligence, production of a timeline for closing, drafting a detailed purchase agreement and assuring PointSource that it should treat the transaction as a \"done deal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Contrary to CKSJB's assertions, the IOI does not include a promise by EPAM to negotiate in good faith. First and foremost, the IOI expressly states that it\n   does not give rise to any legally binding obligation on EPAM, nor does any course of conduct by EPAM \"relating to the negotiation of the terms of the transaction contemplated.\" (IOI 5, 6.) The document undoubtedly contains some optimistic language, including that EPAM's proposal \"has the enthusiastic support of [EPAM's] senior management,\" EPAM \"do[es] not foresee any issues that would prevent [EPAM] from consummating a transaction,\" EPAM is \"prepared to move forward to perform [its] due diligence review and prepare definitive documentation, which [it] expect[s] can be completed in approximately twelve weeks,\" EPAM \"may require a commitment of exclusivity by [PointSource]\" and EPAM \"would work diligently with [its] representatives and [PointSource's] team and representatives to close the transaction in an expedient manner.\" (IOI 3, 5.) Courts, however, routinely dismiss claims for breach of the duty to negotiate in good faith where the parties' letter of intent does not contain a specific promise by the defendant to do so, and nothing in the IOI contains such a promise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    WP 851 Assocs., L.P. v.

The Amended Complaint states that EPAM sent PointSource a draft IOI on January 10, 2017. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 34.) It next alleges that, \"[t]o assuage PointSource's fear of not finding a serious contracting partner, PointSource called EPAM's President,\" who \"expressly agreed with PointSource to work diligently and to negotiate in good faith to complete the deal.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 35-36.) PointSource also proposed changes to some of the IOI's proposed terms, and EPAM executed a final version of the IOI on January 19.

The IOI, after EPAM made the changes requested by PointSource shortly after the alleged phone call between the parties, makes no mention of EPAM's alleged promise to negotiate in good faith; to the contrary, it expressly relieves EPAM from liability for anything (past, present or future) relating to the negotiation of the terms of the transaction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lockheed Martin Corp. v.

Here, the Confidentiality Agreement made clear that nothing about the process obligated EPAM to negotiate a definitive purchase agreement or even to continue negotiations if it didn't want to. Indeed, both EPAM and PointSource were free to break off discussions and walk away, no strings attached, whenever they desired. The expressly titled \"Non-Binding Indication of Interest,\" reviewed, edited, and agreed to by PointSource, could not have been clearer. By its terms, EPAM's proposal was non-binding and preliminary. Whatever else it said or didn't say, the proposal vitiates, on its face, the arguments CKSJB now attempts to make.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   CKSJB derides the document's broad disclaimers by putting the words \"non-binding\" in quotation marks and calling that language \"generic.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 60-61.) But words mean things-and \"non-binding\" means exactly that. This was a sophisticated commercial transaction, with legal counsel undoubtedly involved to the extent businesspeople would involve lawyers in a $ 24 to $ 34 million dollar deal. PointSource, perhaps because EPAM had made the most serious or highest proposal, decided to focus on doing a deal with EPAM-to the exclusion of all other purportedly interested parties. At the eleventh hour, for whatever reason, EPAM did what the documents governing the negotiations gave them the right to do-it walked away. PointSource then had to scramble to get another buyer who paid them a good bit less than they hoped to get from EPAM. PointSource, now via CKSJB, has every right to be upset with being left at the altar. But it cannot circumvent the rules of a process it agreed to\n   and willingly participated in and hope now to impose upon EPAM duties and obligations that EPAM repeatedly and expressly disavowed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   EPAM next argues that CKSJB fails to state a claim for promissory estoppel because EPAM could not have reasonably expected its statements or conduct to induce PointSource's action or forbearance and PointSource could not, in any event, have reasonably relied on those statements or conduct. Under Pennsylvania law, promissory estoppel is an \"equitable remedy to a contract dispute ... [that] makes otherwise unenforceable agreements binding.\"\n   <em>\n    Crouse v.

(Pl.'s Mem. 22-23.) CKSJB argues that EPAM should have reasonably expected these assorted \"promises\" to induce action or forbearance by PointSource-namely, ending discussions with other companies looking to purchase PointSource, declining other purchase offers and negotiating exclusively with EPAM. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   CKSJB has not plausibly alleged that EPAM should have reasonably expected its conduct or statements to induce PointSource to negotiate with EPAM exclusively. The Amended Complaint alleges that both parties intended the IOI to \"re-establish\" their oral agreement to negotiate in good faith. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 48.) PointSource had an opportunity to review and request changes to the IOI before EPAM sent the final version. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 37-39.) Yet the IOI did not promise PointSource anything, nor did it prevent PointSource from negotiating with others.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section III.A. Instead, it states that \"[g]iven the significant amount of time, expense and focus required by EPAM [to conduct due diligence] ..., [EPAM]\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   require a commitment of exclusivity.\" (IOI 5 (emphasis added).) PointSource acknowledged this unambiguous language in an email to EPAM the day it received the IOI: \"Although the agreement doesn't call for immediate exclusivity, we intend to move forward solely with EPAM. We are stopping discussions with all other companies.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   CKSJB then contends that EPAM \"did not object\" to PointSource's (admittedly unilateral) decision to break off negotiations with all other suitors and that EPAM \"did not tell PointSource its reliance on EPAM was misplaced or in any way inappropriate.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 42-43.) Otherwise stated, CKSJB alleges that PointSource, knowing that EPAM did not require a commitment of exclusivity, nonetheless made its own business decision to put all its eggs in the EPAM basket. It then attempts to impose an affirmative duty on\n   EPAM to object to PointSource's unilateral decision and step in to save PointSource from itself. When EPAM chose not to assume such an obligation, EPAM apparently became responsible for the consequences of PointSource's own strategy. Nothing EPAM is alleged to have said or done could have been reasonably expected to induce PointSource to voluntarily give up its ability to negotiate with other potential purchasers and PointSource's decision to do so could in no way have been a result of reasonable reliance on any \"promise\" by EPAM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   EPAM also argues that CKSJB has not sufficiently pled that it was damaged by EPAM's alleged breach of the Confidentiality Agreement. The Amended Complaint states that sometime in March of 2017, PointSource learned that one of EPAM's senior executives disclosed EPAM's plan to purchase PointSource to one of PointSource's former clients.

Compl. \u00b6 118.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Under Delaware law, a claim for breach of contract requires (1) the existence of a contract, (2) the breach of an obligation imposed by the contract and (3) resultant damage to the plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    HSMY, Inc. v.

(Agreement \u00b6 8.) Accordingly, to state a claim for breach of contract, CKSJB must otherwise allege that PointSource suffered resultant harm from EPAM's purported disclosure. The Amended Complaint alleges that EPAM's breach \"threatened material adverse effects on PointSource's business\" and caused PointSource \"material financial and reputational harm.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 120, 161.) In its response to EPAM's Motion, CKSJB tries to bolster these allegations by arguing that EPAM's breach preceded its withdrawal from purchase negotiations, which forced PointSource to accept a less beneficial deal. (Pl.'s Mem. 24.) The Amended Complaint, however, does not aver a connection between EPAM's alleged breach of confidentiality and withdrawal from the deal, nor does it purport to set forth how, under CKSJB's apparent theory of the case, EPAM allegedly telling someone else about the negotiations would have caused EPAM to pull out.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Com. of Pa. ex rel.
