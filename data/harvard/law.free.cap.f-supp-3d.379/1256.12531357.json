However, under the explicit language of the Services Agreement that the Court has quoted above, RM Broadcasting is required to do much more than resell radio airtime to Rossiya Segodnya.

RM Broadcasting asserts that the Department has not alleged that RM Broadcasting actually has broadcast the Radio Programs and, thus, has not alleged that RM Broadcasting actually has acted as a publicity agent for Rossiya Segodnya.

To the extent that this provision disclaims a common-law agency relationship, the Court notes that a common-law agency relationship is unnecessary to satisfy FARA's definition of \"agent of a foreign principal.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Att'y Gen. v.

Control is an appropriate criterion for a determination of common law agency because the agent contemplated by the Restatement has the power to bind his principal. In determining agency for purposes of the Foreign Agents Registration Act, however, our concern is not whether the agent can impose liability upon his principal but whether the relationship warrants registration by the agent to carry out the informative purposes of the Act.\"). Moreover, it goes without saying that a party contracting to act in a way by which the party, in fact, qualifies as an agent of a foreign principal could not avoid FARA's registration requirement by including within the contract a disclaimer that it is not an agent of a foreign principal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   RM Broadcasting asserts that it has no knowledge of the content of Rossiya Segodnya's Radio Programs, no input in that content, and no intent to advance the interests of Rossiya Segodnya or Russia. FARA's definitions of \"agent of a foreign principal\" and \"publicity agent\" lack any requirement of such knowledge, input, or intent.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20611\">\n    22 U.S.C. \u00a7 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), (h).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Finally, RM Broadcasting expresses concern over how broadly FARA may be applied. This Court acknowledges, as have others, that the language of FARA is broad.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. McGoff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1768001,4332414\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/831/1071/\">\n    831 F.2d 1071\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1074 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (\"The scope of persons subject to FARA is broad. Section 611 defines the critical terms 'agents of foreign principals,' to include almost anyone who undertakes any public-related or financial activity on behalf of a foreign principal.\" (alterations omitted)). Nevertheless, the Court must apply the statutory language as written; it is not for the Court to rewrite the statute.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harris v. Garner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11217681\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/216/970/#p976\">\n    216 F.3d 970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 976 (11th Cir. 2000) (stating that \"the role of the judicial branch is to apply statutory language, not to rewrite it\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that the pleadings and the incorporated Services Agreement establish that RM Broadcasting is an agent of a foreign principal and is required to register pursuant to FARA. Thus, the Department's Cross-Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings [DE 30] is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   . RM Broadcasting's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings [DE 26] is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   By no later than\n   <strong>\n    May 17, 2019\n   </strong>\n   , the Department shall submit to the Court, in Word format, a proposed Order granting Final Judgment. The proposed Order shall be sent to: Rosenberg@flsd.uscourts.gov.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Clerk of Court is instructed to\n   <strong>\n    CLOSE THIS CASE\n   </strong>\n   . All hearings are\n   <strong>\n    CANCELED\n   </strong>\n   and all deadlines are\n   <strong>\n    TERMINATED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    DONE and ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   in Chambers, West Palm Beach, Florida, this 6th day of May, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    Because the Court concludes that RM Broadcasting qualifies as a publicity agent, the Court need not consider whether RM Broadcasting also qualifies as an \"information-service employee.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20611\">\n     22 U.S.C. \u00a7 611\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (c), (i).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
