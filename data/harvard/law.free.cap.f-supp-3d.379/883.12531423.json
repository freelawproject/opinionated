The case is not about whether the challenged border barrier construction plan is wise or unwise. It is not about whether the plan is the right or wrong policy response to existing conditions at the southern border of the United States. These policy questions are the subject of extensive, and often intense, differences of opinion, and this Court cannot and does not express any view as to them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trump v.

And I\n   will have Mexico pay for that wall.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Upon taking office in 2017, the President's administration repeatedly sought appropriations from Congress for border barrier construction.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Budget of the U.S. Government: A New Foundation for American Greatness: Fiscal Year 2018\n   </em>\n   , Office of Mgmt. &amp; Budget 18 (2017), https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/budget.pdf (requesting \"$ 2.6 billion in high-priority tactical infrastructure and border security technology, including funding to plan, design, and construct a physical wall along the southern border\").

And Congress considered several bills that, if passed, would have authorized or otherwise appropriated billions of dollars more for border barrier construction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   States RJN Exs. 14-20. None passed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In December 2018-as Congress and the President were negotiating an appropriations bill to fund various federal departments for what remained of the fiscal year-the President announced that he would not sign any funding legislation that lacked substantial funds for border barrier construction.\n   <em>\n    Farm Bill Signing\n   </em>\n   , C-SPAN (Dec. 20, 2018), https://www.c-span.org/video/?456189-1/president-government-funding-bill-include-money-border-wall (\"I've made my position very clear. Any measure that funds the government must include border security.... Walls work whether we like it or not. They work better than anything.\"). Congress did not pass a bill with the President's desired border barrier funding and, due to this impasse, the United States entered into the nation's longest partial government shutdown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The President and those in his administration stated on several occasions before, during, and after the shutdown that, although Congress should make the requisite funds available for border barrier construction, the President was willing to use a national emergency declaration and other reprogramming mechanisms as funding backstops. For example, during a December 11, 2018 meeting with congressional representatives, the President stated that \"if we don't get what we want [for border barrier construction funding], one way or the other - whether it's through [Congress], through a military, through anything you want to call [sic] - I will shut down the government. Absolutely.\" States RJN Ex. 21.

However, the White House increased its request on January 6, 2019, when the Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget transmitted a\n   letter to the U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations, \"request[ing] $ 5.7 billion for construction of a steel barrier for the Southwest border,\" and explaining that the request \"would fund construction of a total of approximately 234 miles of new physical barrier.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 36 (\"Citizen Groups RJN\") Ex. A, at 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The increased request specified that \"[a]ppropriations bills for fiscal year (FY) 2019 that have already been considered by the current and previous Congresses are inadequate to fully address these critical issues,\" including the need for border barrier construction funds.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=132%20Stat.%20348\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Days later, the President explained: \"If we declare a national emergency, we have a tremendous amount of funds - tremendous - if we want to do that, if we want to go that route. Again, there is no reason why we can't come to a deal.... [Congress] could stop this problem in 15 minutes if they wanted to.\" States RJN Ex. 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After the government shutdown ended, the President and others in his administration reaffirmed their intent to fund a border barrier, with or without Congress's blessing. On February 9, 2019, the President explained that even if Congress provided less than the requested funding for a border barrier, the barrier \"[would] get built one way or the other!\" Citizen Groups RJN Ex.

The problem of large-scale unlawful migration through the southern border is long-standing, and despite the executive branch's exercise of existing statutory authorities, the situation has worsened in certain respects in recent years. In particular, recent years have seen sharp increases in the number of family units entering and seeking entry to the United States and an inability to provide detention space for many of these aliens while their removal proceedings are pending. If not detained, such aliens are often released into the country and are often difficult to remove from the United States because they fail to appear for hearings, do not comply with orders of removal, or are otherwise difficult to locate. In response to the directive in my April 4, 2018, memorandum and subsequent requests for support by the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense has provided support and resources to the Department of Homeland Security at the southern border.

While not disputing that the President requested-and was denied-more-comprehensive funds for border barrier construction, Defendants instead note that \"[t]he President's 2019 budget request did not propose additional funding for DoD's counterdrug activities under [ Section] 284.\" Opp. at 16. Defendants then argue that because DHS only formally requested Section 284 support in February 2019, the need for Section 284 support only become foreseen in February 2019.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Separate and apart from the Court's analysis above regarding whether Congress previously denied funding for the relevant item, Plaintiffs also have shown a likelihood of success as to their argument that Defendants fail to meet the \"unforeseen military requirement\" condition for the reprogramming of funds under Section 8005. As the House notes in its\n   <em>\n    amicus\n   </em>\n   brief, DoD has used this authority in the past to transfer funds based on unanticipated circumstances (such as hurricane and typhoon damage to military bases) justifying a departure from the scope of spending previously authorized by Congress. House Br. at 10 (citing Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), DoD Serial No. FY 04-37 PA, Reprogramming Action (Sept. 3, 2004)). Here, however, Defendants claim that what was \"unforeseen\" was \"[t]he need for DoD to exercise its [ Section] 284 authority to provide support for counter-drug activities,\" which \"did not arise until February 2019, when DHS requested support from DoD to construct fencing in drug trafficking corridors.\" Opp. at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Defendants' argument that the need for the requested border barrier construction funding was \"unforeseen\" cannot logically be squared with the Administration's multiple requests for funding for exactly that purpose dating back to at least early 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Citizen Groups Ex. R (February 2018 White House Budget Request describing \"the Administration's proposal for $ 18 billion to fund the border wall\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   States RJN Exs. 14-20 (failed bills);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 21 (December 11, 2018 transcript from a meeting with members of Congress, where the President stated that \"if we don't get what we want [for border barrier construction funding], one way or the other - whether it's through you, through a military, through anything you want to call [sic] - I will shut down the government\"); Case No. 4:19-cv-00872-HSG, ECF No. 89-12, at 14 (testimony of Defendant Shanahan before the House Armed Services Committee explaining that the Administration discussed unilateral reprogramming \"prior to the declaration of a national emergency\"). Further, even the purported need for DoD to provide DHS with support for border security has similarly been long asserted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   States RJN Ex. 27 (April 4, 2018 presidential memorandum directing the Secretary of Defense to support DHS \"in securing the southern border and taking other necessary actions\" due to \"[t]he crisis at our southern border\"). Defendants' suggestion that by not specifically seeking border barrier funding under Section 284 by name, the Administration can later contend that as far as DoD is concerned, the need for such funding is \"unforeseen,\" is not likely to withstand scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Interpreting \"unforeseen\" to refer to the request for DoD assistance, as opposed to the underlying \"requirement\" at issue, also is not reasonable. By Defendants' logic,\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   request for Section 284 support would be for an \"unforeseen military requirement,\n   \" because only once the request was made would the \"need to exercise authority\" under the statute be foreseen. There is no logical reason to stretch the definition of \"unforeseen military requirement\" from requirements that the government as a whole plainly cannot predict (like the need to repair hurricane damage) to requirements that plainly\n   <em>\n    were\n   </em>\n   foreseen by the government as a whole (even if DoD did not realize that it would be asked to pay for them until after Congress declined to appropriate funds requested by another agency). Nothing presented by the Defendants suggests that its interpretation is what Congress had in mind when it imposed the \"unforeseen\" limitation, especially where, as here, multiple agencies are openly coordinating in an effort to build a project that Congress declined to fund. The Court thus finds it likely that Plaintiffs will succeed on this claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. Accepting Defendants?

Defendants' interpretation of Section 8005 is inconsistent with these principles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   While Defendants argue that the text and history of Section 284 suggest that their proposed transfer and use of the funds are within the scope of what Congress has permitted previously, Opp. at 18, that argument only highlights the serious constitutional questions that accepting their position would create. First, Defendants note that in the past DoD has completed what they characterize as \"large-scale fencing projects\" with Congress's approval. Opp. at 18 (citing H.R. Rep. No. 103-200, at 330-31 (1993)). But Congress's past approval of relatively small expenditures, that were well within the total amount allocated by Congress to DoD under Section 284's predecessor, speaks not at all to Defendants' current claim that the Acting Secretary has authority to redirect sums over a hundred orders of magnitude greater to that account in the face of Congress's appropriations judgment in the CAA. Similarly, whether or not Section 284 formally \"limits\" the Secretary to \"small scale construction\" (defined in Section 284(i)(3) as \"construction at a cost not to exceed $ 750,000 for any project\"), reading the statute to suggest that Congress requires reporting of tiny projects but nonetheless has delegated authority to DoD to conduct the massive funnel-and-spend project proposed here is implausible, and likely would raise serious questions as to the constitutionality of such an interpretation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Whitman v.

Trucking Ass'ns\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505769\" index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/457/#p468\">\n    531 U.S. 457\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 468,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505769\" index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/457/#p468\">\n    121 S.Ct. 903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505769\" index=\"226\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/457/#p468\">\n    149 L.Ed.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001) (noting that Congress \"does not, one might say, hide elephants in mouseholes\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Similarly, if \"unforeseen\" has the meaning that Defendants claim, Section 8005 would give the agency making a request for assistance under Section 284 complete control over whether that condition is met, simply by virtue of the timing of the request. As here, DHS could wait and see whether Congress granted a requested appropriation, then turn to DoD if Congress declined, and DoD could always characterize the resulting request as raising an \"unforeseen\" requirement because it did not come earlier. Under this interpretation, DoD could in essence make a de facto appropriation to DHS, evading congressional control entirely. The Court finds that this interpretation likely would pose serious problems under the Appropriations Clause, by ceding essentially boundless appropriations judgment to the executive agencies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Finally, the Court has serious concerns with Defendants' theory of appropriations law, which presumes that the Executive Branch can exercise spending authority unless Congress explicitly restricts such authority by statute. Counsel for Defendants advanced this theory at the hearing on this motion, arguing that when Congress passed the recent DoD appropriations act containing Section 8005, it \"could have\" expressly \"restrict[ed] that authority\" to preclude reprogramming funds for border barrier construction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 138 at 76:16-77:3. According to Defendants: \"If Congress had wanted to deny DOD this specific use of that [reprogramming] authority, that's something it needed to actually do in an explicit way in the appropriations process. And it didn't.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 77:21-24. But it is not Congress's burden to prohibit the Executive from spending the Nation's funds: it is the Executive's burden to show that its desired\n   use of those funds was \"affirmatively approved by Congress.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    FLRA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3862881,3767998\" index=\"227\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/665/1339/\">\n    665 F.3d at 1348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A]ll uses of appropriated funds must be affirmatively approved by Congress,\" and \"the mere absence of a prohibition is not sufficient.\").

Defendants appeared to argue at the hearing on this motion that\n   <em>\n    McIntosh\n   </em>\n   stands for the principle that the Executive enjoys unfettered spending power unless Congress crafts an appropriations rider cabining such authority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 138 at 75:5- 10. As counsel for Defendants put it, \"[Plaintiffs] want to say that something was denied by Congress if it wasn't funded by Congress.... But that is just not how these statutes are written and that's not how [\n   <em>\n    McIntosh\n   </em>\n   ] tells us we interpret the appropriations statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 75:13-20. But Defendants overlook that no party in\n   <em>\n    McIntosh\n   </em>\n   disputed that the government's use of funds was authorized but for the appropriations rider at issue in that case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350591\" index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/833/1163/#p1175\">\n    833 F.3d at 1175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The parties dispute whether the government's spending money on their prosecutions violates [the appropriations rider].\"). It is thus unremarkable that when faced with a dispute exclusively concerning whether the government's otherwise-authorized spending of money violated an appropriations rider, the Ninth Circuit held that \"[i]t is a fundamental principle of appropriations law that we may only consider the text of an appropriations rider.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350591\" index=\"230\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/833/1163/#p1175\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1178 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

Whether Congress gives authority in the first place is not the same issue as whether Congress later restricts that authority. And it cannot be the case that Congress must draft an appropriations rider to breathe life into the internal limitations in Section 8005 establishing that the Executive may only reprogram money based on unforeseen military requirements, and may not do so where the item for which funds are requested has been denied by Congress. To adopt Defendants' position would read out these limitations entirely, which the Court cannot do.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Life Techs. Corp. v.

Turning first to the statutory definition of \"military construction,\" that it uses the word \"includes\" when it provides that military construction \"includes any construction, development, conversion, or extension of any kind carried out with respect to a military installation\" is irrelevant. No one disputes that border barrier construction constitutes \"construction.\" What matters is that Section 2801(a) limits such construction-however broad that term might be-to construction related to a military installation.

There is no dispute that the \"perceptibl[e] impair[ment]\" of an organization's ability to carry out its mission that results in a \"drain on the organization's resources\" is enough for Article III standing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Havens Realty Corp. v.

Plaintiffs ignore the \"in the absence of preliminary relief\" component, but\n   <em>\n    Winter\n   </em>\n   is not complicated on this point. Under\n   <em>\n    Winter\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs must demonstrate that preliminary injunctive relief will prevent some irreparable injury that is likely to occur before the Court has time to decide the case on the merits. In other words, Plaintiffs must present some persuasive counterfactual analysis showing a likelihood that irreparable harm would occur absent an injunction, but would not occur if an injunction is granted. But as it stands, nothing indicates that Plaintiffs' proffered \"diversion\" of funds or resources\n   would change at all if the Court were to issue an injunction. With or without an injunction, Plaintiffs will have to continue to litigate this case and otherwise divert resources in the manner they have described until the case is resolved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   All three cases on which Plaintiffs rely to support their mission-frustration theory support the Court's conclusion. First, in\n   <em>\n    Valle de Sol Inc. v.

Next, in\n   <em>\n    East Bay Sanctuary Covenant v.

Finally, in\n   <em>\n    League of Women Voters v. Newby\n   </em>\n   , plaintiffs demonstrated that their mission interest in registering voters faced likely irreparable injury absent a preliminary injunction because registration deadlines would pass before resolution of the case on the merits.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172291\" index=\"299\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/838/1/#p9\">\n    838 F.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 9 (D.C.

In\n   <em>\n    Valle\n   </em>\n   , injunctive relief meant the difference between prosecution under an unconstitutional statute or not. In\n   <em>\n    East Bay Sanctuary Covenant\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    County of Santa Clara\n   </em>\n   , injunctive relief meant the difference between organizations losing substantial funding or not. In\n   <em>\n    League of Women Voters\n   </em>\n   , injunctive relief meant the difference between registering voters for an election in keeping with organizations' mission interests or not. Here, however, Plaintiffs present no evidence that injunctive relief will make any difference to the purported harm to their mission interests, which will continue until this case's resolution. Plaintiffs thus have not carried their burden to show that the \"extraordinary remedy\" of a preliminary injunction is warranted in this regard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Winter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"300\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p22\">\n    555 U.S. at 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"301\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p22\">\n    129 S.Ct. 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   Although the Court finds that Plaintiffs have not yet met their burden of showing irreparable harm in the absence of a preliminary injunction, the Court fully expects that if and when Defendants identify border barrier construction locations where Section 2808 funds will be used, Plaintiffs will have the opportunity to submit materials in support of their irreparable harm claim. The Court takes Defendants at their\n   word that they \"will inform the Court\" immediately once a decision is made to use Section 2808 to fund border barrier construction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

According to Defendants, these factors tilt in their favor, because their \"weighty\" interest in border security and immigration-law enforcement, as sanctioned by Congress, outweighs Plaintiffs' \"speculative\" injuries. Opp. at 34-35. The Ninth Circuit has recognized that \"the public has a 'weighty' interest 'in efficient administration of the immigration laws at the border,' \" and the Court does not minimize this interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    E.

And the Court has found above that Plaintiffs' injuries as to El Paso Sector Project 1 and Yuma Sector Project 1 are not speculative, and will be irreparable in the absence of an injunction.
