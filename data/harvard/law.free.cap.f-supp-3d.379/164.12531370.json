(\"Pingtan\"). Plaintiff claims to have purchased Pingtan's securities during the putative class period and seeks certification of a purported class. Plaintiff now seeks relief under \u00a7\u00a7 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act ( 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78j(b) and \u00a7 78t(a) ) and Rule 10b-5 against Defendant Xinrong Zhuo, Pingtan's Founder, and Defendant Roy Yu,\n   Pingtan's Chief Financial Officer (collectively, the \"Individual Defendants\") during the putative class period and Defendant Pingtan (collectively, \"Defendants\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On May 29, 2018, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint.

Plaintiff claims to have purchased Pingtan's securities during the putative class period of March 9, 2016 through May 10, 2017 and seeks certification of the purported class. (Am.

Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that, on August 4, 2016, Pingtan issued a press release \"announc[ing] that thirteen of its vessels ha[d] obtained fishing licenses from the Ministry of Agriculture and\n   Fisheries of Timor-Leste, allowing them to operate in the sea areas of Timor-Leste.\" (Am.

Plaintiff alleges that Pingtan's 2016 Q2 and Q3 10-Q and stated: \"Among [Pingtan's] 135 fishing vessels, 13 vessels have obtained fishing licenses from the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries of Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste and will operate in the sea area of Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste.\" (Am.

Compl. \u00b6 51.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that the Aurelius Article reveals Pingtan's fraud. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 9, 52-53.) The Aurelius Article questions Pingtan's value and expresses the opinion that Pingtan \"ha[d] engaged in fraudulent activities that conceal[ed] the reality that its shares likely have zero value.\" (Aurelius Article, Katze Decl., Ex. B, at 26.) Plaintiff contends that Pingtan's stock price dropped twenty-eight percent after the Aurelius Article was published. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 61.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

(Am.

Katze, (the \"Katze Declaration,\" Docket Entry No. 34 ), list a number of statements in Pingtan's public filings to demonstrate that Pingtan disclosed that it relies on third parties to obtain fishing licenses. Pingtan's 2016 10-K states that \"[t]he growth of [Pingtan's] business depends on [its] ability to secure fishing licenses directly or through third parties.\" (2016 10-K at 7.) Pingtan's public filings also make a number of statements about its fishing operations in both Indonesia and Timor-Leste.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Moreover, Pingtan's public filings do not state or even imply that the government of Timor-Leste issued licenses directly to Pingtan. Rather, the licenses were obtained by the vessels themselves. Pingtan clearly states that \"13 vessels have obtained fishing licenses\" from Timor-Leste. (2016 Q2 10-Q at 26; 2016 Q3 10-Q at 27.)

Based on the foregoing analysis, the Court holds that Plaintiff has not stated a claim for a violation of \u00a7 10(b) of the Exchange Act, or its implementing rule, Rule 10b-5. Accordingly, Plaintiff's \u00a7 10(b) claims are dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Plaintiff's Section 20(a) Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Plaintiff also brings claims against Defendants Zhuo and Yu for violations of \u00a7 20(a) of the Exchange Act in their capacities as controlling persons of Pingtan. However, to state a claim under \u00a7 20(a) a plaintiff must adequately allege \"a primary violation by the controlled person.\"\n   <em>\n    Barclays\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4067394\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/750/227/#p236\">\n    750 F.3d at 236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    ATSI\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3512868\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/493/87/#p99\">\n    493 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   108 ). Accordingly, Plaintiff's claims under \u00a7 20(a) must also be dismissed because the Court dismissed Plaintiff's \u00a7 10(b) claims.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4346249\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/173/12/#p22\">\n    173 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   42 ;\n   <em>\n    In re Lions Gate Entm't Corp.

Leave to Amend\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   In her opposition, Plaintiff requests leave to amend her claims (Pl.'s Opp'n at 17), but does not attach a proposed amended complaint. Courts must freely grant such leave \"when justice so requires.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). However, a \"district court has discretion to deny leave for good reason, including futility, bad faith, undue delay, or undue prejudice to the opposing party.\"\n   <em>\n    Holmes v.

Dickson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20Fed.%20Appx.%2014\">\n    100 Fed.Appx. 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 16 (2d Cir. 2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   For the reasons discussed above, the Court finds that any amendment would be futile as those claims would not survive a subsequent motion to dismiss. In particular, the Court does not see how Plaintiff's allegations of scienter could be sufficient after a second amended complaint, especially where they are wholly lacking in Plaintiff's current amended complaint. Accordingly, Plaintiff is denied leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   For the forgoing reasons, Defendants' motion to dismiss is granted and Plaintiff's claims are dismissed with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    Plaintiff further alleges that these public filings were signed by the Individual Defendants and contained certifications pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\"SOX\") attesting to the accuracy of financial reporting, the disclosure of any material changes to Pingtan's internal controls over financial reporting, and the disclosure of all fraud.
