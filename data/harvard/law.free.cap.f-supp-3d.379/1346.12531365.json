The Court has reviewed the Motion and the record and is otherwise fully advised.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This action revolves around consumers' decisions to purchase health insurance to cover routine and unexpected medical expenses. Through its evidence, the FTC gives a well-documented account of a classic bait and switch scheme-aided by rigged internet searches, deceptive sales scripts, and predatory practice. Though consumers believed they were purchasing comprehensive health insurance coverage, Defendants sold them practically worthless limited indemnity or discount plans. While Defendants, under the control of Defendant Steven J. Dorfman (\"Dorfman\"), profited from their scheme, consumers were left with inadequate health coverage and devastating medical bills. Dorfman, relying primarily on his own declaration, disputes the FTC's account and contends that consumers were not misled. Based on the record before it, the Court finds that a preliminary injunction is necessary to protect consumers, prevent future violations of the law, protect assets, and to preserve the status quo pending the resolution of this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 29, 2018, the FTC filed its Complaint for Permanent Injunction and Other Equitable Relief [ECF No. 1] against Defendants Simple Health Plans LLC (\"Simple Health\"), Health Benefits One LLC (\"HBO\"), Health Center Management LLC (\"HCM\"), Innovative Customer Care (\"ICC\"), Simple Insurance Leads LLC (\"SIL\"), Senior Benefits One LLC (\"SBO\") (collectively the \"Corporate Defendants\"), and Dorfman (together with the Corporate Defendants collectively referred to as the \"Defendants\") alleging that Defendants violated Section 5(a) of the FTC Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2045\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), and the FTC's Telemarketing Sales Rule (\"TSR\"), 16 C.F.R. Part 310. In conjunction with the Complaint, the FTC filed an Emergency\n   <em>\n    Ex Parte\n   </em>\n   Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order [ECF No. 3]. On October 31, 2018, the Court entered a Temporary Restraining Order (the \"TRO\") and froze all of Defendants' assets, including Dorfman's personal assets. [ECF No. 15]. The Court also appointed Receiver Michael Goldberg (the \"Receiver\") to administer the affairs of the Corporate Defendants and to take necessary actions to protect consumers. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 16, 2019, the Court held an evidentiary show cause hearing on the FTC's request for preliminary injunctive relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The FTC relied on approximately\n   43 exhibits-encompassing over 1000 pages of documents, the Receiver's First Interim Report (\"RR\") [ECF No. 122], and the live testimony of two of Defendants' former customers. Dorfman relied on his own declaration, selections from the FTC's exhibits, and two of his own exhibits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FINDINGS OF FACT\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Brief Overview of Health Insurance Industry\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   To effectuate their bait and switch scheme, Defendants led consumers to believe they were receiving comprehensive health insurance when, in fact, they received limited indemnity plans or discount memberships. Comprehensive health insurance is exactly what the name implies-comprehensive. It generally covers a large portion of the expense for doctor's visits, emergency room visits, hospital stays, laboratory services, and prescription medicine. With comprehensive health insurance, after the payment of a premium, a deductible, and a co-payment, the risk of large medical bills shifts from the consumer to the insurance company. Plaintiff's Exhibit (\"PX\") 23, at 15. In addition, many comprehensive health insurance plans comply with the Affordable Care Act (\"ACA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2018001\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . ACA-qualified plans include coverage of pre-existing conditions and cover emergency medical care, hospitalization, prescription medication, preventative care, maternity care, and pediatric care. PX 23, at 15. During the relevant time period, individuals enrolled in ACA-qualified insurance plans were not required to pay the penalty imposed on people who could afford insurance but chose not to purchase it. Related to comprehensive health insurance is the concept of a preferred provider organization (\"PPO\"). In a PPO, the plan contracts \"with a broad range of providers (physicians, health systems), designated as the 'preferred network.' A plan member can use any of the preferred providers, typically with favorable co-insurance, copay; and count towards a deductible.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2018001\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2018001\">\n    at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In contrast, \"[i]ndemnity plans provide a defined financial benefit paid to consumers after medical expenses are incurred.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2018001\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2018001\">\n    at 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court finds that the FTC has established, at this stage of the litigation, that there is a concern that Defendants will dissipate the assets if not enjoined. First, Defendants have the infrastructure and means to move millions of dollars. Indeed, Defendants maintain bank accounts in Panama and the Dominican Republic to which they could transfer funds in the absence of an asset freeze. PX 5 \u00b6 37. Second, absent an illicit movement of assets, Dorfman's request to unfreeze additional assets to pay for legal fees and living expenses\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   constitutes a dissipation of assets,\n   as these expenditures would deplete the assets available for consumer redress.

RR, at 34. Nonetheless, Defendants ask that the Court discharge the Receiver or convert his role into that of a monitor. Neither is appropriate. The record clearly reflects a continued need for the Receiver in this action to preserve assets and maintain the status quo.

Defendant later requested, and the FTC consented to, two extensions of the Temporary Restraining Order, the first to December 6, 2018, and the second to January 29, 2019. [ECF Nos. 18 &amp; 30]. On December 19, 2018, Defendant requested an additional delay, proposing a February 26, 2019, date. The Court again continued the hearing and set the case for a status conference on January 16, 2019. A government shutdown followed and the FTC requested a stay which the Court granted. [ECF No. 59]. On Dorfman's emergency motion, the Court lifted the stay to allow the parties to litigate a discovery dispute but found good cause to continue the preliminary injunction hearing [ECF No. 64]. The Court lifted the stay when the government shutdown ended and asked the parties to submit a proposed schedule. Dorfman proposed an April 16, 2019, hearing date. [ECF No. 75]. The Court approved Dorfman's proposed schedule. [ECF No. 76]. Dorfman later moved to strike the Temporary Restraining Order, arguing, in part, that it had expired. [ECF No. 79]. Following an expedited hearing, the Court denied the motion to strike via a paperless order, with a written opinion to follow, and found good cause to continue the temporary restraining order through the hearing on April 16, 2019. [ECF No. 83]. Dorfman immediately appealed the Court's denial of its motion to strike. On April 16, 2019, the Eleventh Circuit dismissed the appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
