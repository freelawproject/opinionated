On April 26, 2019, Defendant, Pedro Martin (\"Martin\"), filed a Motion to Dismiss and/or Strike Plaintiff's Complaint and Request for Expedited Ruling (the \"Motion to Dismiss\") [ECF No. 6 ], which maintains that Ener qualifies as a fugitive from prior court orders and, in effect, refuses to acknowledge the authority of Florida's Eleventh Judicial Circuit in a related matter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court, having reviewed the Motion to Dismiss and Ener's Response in Opposition [ECF No. 20 ], as well as considering argument of counsel, and being otherwise fully advised in the premises, it is hereby\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED AND ADJUDGED\n   </strong>\n   that Martin's Motion to Dismiss is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   and this cause is\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED with prejudice\n   </strong>\n   for the reasons set forth herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2017, Ener and Martin were parties to several disputes in Florida's Eleventh Judicial Circuit Unified Family Court and Domestic Violence Divisions, Case Nos. 11-03210 FC (UF 201) and 17-008159 (FC) (the \"State Court Proceedings\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On July 18, 2017, then-Judge Ariana Fajardo Orshan entered an Order Granting Defendant's Motion for Sanctions and/or Contempt (the \"Contempt Order\"), finding that Ener \"contemptuously, willfully, and deliberately violated the clear and express orders of [the] Court\" by, among other reasons, failing to attend court-ordered mediation, refusing to communicate with the Court-appointed Guardian Ad Litem, and failing to comply with the Court's visitation order. [ECF No. 6-1 ]. Additionally, Judge Fajardo Orshan found that Ener \"has absconded with the [the Parties'] children while cutting off all communication with [Martin].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. The Contempt Order provided Ener with the opportunity to purge herself of the contempt by complying with the Court's orders and reimbursing Martin for the reasonable attorney's fees and costs he incurred because of Ener's contempt.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 31, 2017, over three months after the Contempt Order was entered, Judge Fajardo Orshan entered an Order of Referral to Law Enforcement (the \"Referral to Law Enforcement\") finding that Ener violated a Temporary Injunction. More importantly, the Referral to Law Enforcement authorized any Florida law enforcement officer to detain Ener if located in the jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [ECF No. 6-2 ]. Ener was never detained pursuant to the Referral to Law Enforcement and is currently residing in the United Kingdom.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [ECF No. 23] at \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Despite being fully aware of the Contempt Order and the Referral to Law Enforcement in the State Court Proceedings, Ener filed the instant Complaint in this Court as a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   litigant\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   on April 23, 2019 seeking upwards of $ 200,000,000.00 in damages from Martin and ten unidentified co-conspirators pursuant to six counts: Count I - Defamation, Count II - Invasion of Privacy, Count III - Breach of Contract, Count IV - Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, Count V - Civil Conspiracy, and Count VI - Abuse of Process. [ECF No. 1 ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Martin filed the Motion to Dismiss on April 26, 2019, requesting that the Court dismiss the Complaint pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), 12(b)(6), 12(f), and the fugitive disentitlement doctrine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [ECF No. 6 ]. That same day, Martin's wife, Maria Martin (\"Non-Party Martin\"), filed an Emergency Motion to Intervene and requested that the Court strike what she claimed were \"false,\" \"scandalous,\" and \"defamatory\" allegations relating to Non-Party Martin in the Complaint\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [ECF No. 7 ]. United States District Judge Beth Bloom, the undersigned's predecessor in this action, granted Non-Party Martin's Motion to Intervene and ordered Ener to show cause why the allegations in the Complaint referencing Non-Party Martin should not be stricken. [ECF No. 8 ]. On May 1, 2019, Ener responded to the Order to Show Cause with conclusory statements that the allegations against Non-Party Martin in the Complaint were true, relayed to Ener by Martin himself, and were not scandalous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [ECF No. 9 ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   This action was transferred to the undersigned for all further proceedings on May 6, 2019. [ECF No. 16 ]. The next day, the Court entered an Order setting a Status Conference for May 15, 2019 at 10:00 A.M. EST (3:00 P.M. in Herefordshire, UK) [ECF No. 19] (the \"Status Conference\") in order to clarify the issues in the case and provide Ener, who is ostensibly prosecuting the case\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , with the opportunity to address the Court directly and respond to the Motion to Dismiss in lieu of having to draft further pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On May 14, 2019, Ener telephoned Chambers, confirmed her availability to appear at the Status Conference telephonically, and was provided with the requisite instructions on how to do so. That same day, Ener filed an affidavit informing the Court that while she could not appear at the Status Conference physically, she would be available to appear by phone.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [ECF No. 23] at \u00b6\u00b6 12-13. Despite confirming her availability via affidavit and over the phone, Ener failed to appear for the\n   Status Conference on May 15, 2019. The Court proceeded to hear argument from Martin and Non-Party Martin.

There, a Venezuelan father filed a petition under the International Child Abduction Remedies Act for the return of his two children in the custody of their mother in the United States. The mother failed to appear in court and failed comply with court orders. Consequently, the district court found the mother in contempt, entered a bench warrant for her arrest, and granted the father's petition.\n   <em>\n    Pesin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11121884\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/244/1250/#p1253\">\n    244 F.3d at 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Her behavior to date leaves little doubt that she would defy an adverse ruling. Moreover, it would be inequitable to allow [the mother] to use the resources of the courts only if the outcome is a benefit to her.

She absconded with Martin's two children in violation of various court orders and has remained outside the United States for purposes of evading arrest pursuant to the Contempt Order and the Referral to Law Enforcement in the State Court Proceedings. In this Court, Ener failed to appear at the Status Conference despite the Court confirming her availability and arranging for her to appear telephonically. Moreover, Ener's fugitive status has a direct connection to the instant action as many, if not all, of the allegations levied against Martin stem directly from the facts underlying the State Court Proceedings and the State Court Proceedings themselves. Ultimately, dismissal is necessary to avoid the inequity of allowing Ener, a fugitive, to use court resources to aid only herself, as well as to avoid prejudicing Martin, who has not had access to his children since Ener fled the United States in violation of court orders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [ECF No. 6] at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"In discussing the fugitive disentitlement doctrine, the Supreme Court has stated that '[c]ourts invested with the judicial power of the United States have certain inherent authority to protect their proceedings and judgments in the course of discharging their traditional responsibilities,' but '[t]he extent of these powers must be delimited with care, for there is a danger of overreaching when one branch of the Government, without benefit of cooperation or correction from the others, undertakes to define its own authority.' \"\n   <em>\n    Pharaon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"577764\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/178/1159/#p1162\">\n    178 F.3d at 1162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Degen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11747036\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/820/#p829\">\n    517 U.S. at 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11747036\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/820/#p829\">\n    116 S.Ct. 1777\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

In the Motion to Compel, Non-Party Martin notes the sophistication of Ener's pleadings, and requests that the Court compel Ener to file an affidavit confirming that she is not receiving the assistance of counsel. The Court withholds judgment on the Motion to Compel, but finds that Ener's pleadings, which present coherent legal arguments with proper citations and conventional formatting, are more sophisticated than that of the typical\n    <em>\n     pro se\n    </em>\n    litigant.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Despite ruling on other grounds, the Court notes that Counts I and II seem deficient on their face and Counts III-VI are likely barred by the\n    <em>\n     Rooker-Feldman\n    </em>\n    doctrine.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Casale v.
