ROBRENO, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case presents a novel question not yet addressed by either this Court or the Third Circuit: may an individual whose conviction for first-degree murder was vacated pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus, ordering release or a new trial, and who subsequently entered a no contest plea to third-degree murder, bring a \u00a7 1983 claim for fabrication of evidence and deliberate deception in connection with the vacated conviction for first-degree murder? Plainly put, yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Over twenty-five years ago, in 1992, James Dennis was sentenced to death for first-degree murder, following a trial in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas replete with instances of police misconduct and\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violations (the \"1992 conviction\"). Three years ago, the Third Circuit, sitting\n   <em>\n    en\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    banc\n   </em>\n   , granted Mr. Dennis habeas relief on account of those very\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violations and observed that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's case against Mr. Dennis was \"effectively gutted.\"\n   <em>\n    Dennis v.

Instead, the Commonwealth offered Mr. Dennis a no contest plea to a reduced charge of third-degree murder. On December 22, 2016, after spending over a quarter-century on death row, Mr. Dennis entered the no contest plea, was sentenced to time served, and left prison. He now brings a \u00a7 1983 claim against the City of Philadelphia and two detectives and various Joe Doe police officers from the Philadelphia Police Department for violations of his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process and a fair trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    TABLE OF CONTENTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I.

BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Mr. Dennis alleges the following facts, all of which are presumed to be true for purposes of resolving a motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Murder &amp; The Investigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On October 22, 1991, Ms. Chedell Williams was murdered near the Fern Rock SEPTA station in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 8-10, ECF No. 1. According to eyewitnesses, Ms. Williams was followed by two men, one of whom shot Ms. Williams at close range in the neck.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. The shooter and his accomplice then made their way towards a getaway car, driven by a third man.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Nine eyewitnesses provided descriptions of the assailants to detectives Frank Jastrzembski and Manuel Santiago as well as various Joe Doe officers (together with the two detectives, the \"defendant officers\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. All nine eyewitnesses generally described the shooter as \"about 170 to 180 pounds and 5'9? to 5'10?, ... in his late teens to early twenties, with a dark complexion, and wearing a red sweat suit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Notwithstanding this physical description, Mr. Dennis, who was 5'4? and about 125 pounds with a medium complexion at the time of the incident, was later arrested for the murder of Ms. Williams.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12-18. Mr. Dennis was the only person ever arrested for the three-person crime, despite not matching the physical description of the shooter or the other two men.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Only four of the nine eyewitnesses picked Mr. Dennis out of a photo array, which consistently placed Mr. Dennis in the first position, and three of these four did so \"tentatively.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22, 24, 28, 50, 51. These were the only eyewitnesses invited to the lineup.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50. Three of these four eyewitnesses then identified Mr. Dennis in the lineup and subsequently testified at trial for the Commonwealth, while the one who did not identify him in the lineup did not.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 51- 52. Defense trial counsel never learned that five of the nine eyewitnesses never picked Mr. Dennis out of the photo array, and despite requesting a lineup with all nine eyewitnesses, such a lineup never occurred.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Mr. Dennis alleges that the defendant officers concealed information regarding other individuals who had confessed their involvement with the murder or knew who was involved and concealed and coerced certain witnesses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36-38, 40-41. For example, the defendant officers did not follow up on the inconsistencies between statements made by Zahara Howard, who had accompanied Ms. Williams, the murder victim, to the SEPTA station.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32-34. Specifically, although Ms. Howard had first told the defendant officers that she had never seen the assailants, she later told her aunt and uncle that she recognized the assailants from Olney High School, a school Mr. Dennis had never attended.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32. Ms. Howard's aunt and uncle informed the defendant officers about what Ms. Howard had said, which was also corroborated by Ms. Williams's aunt.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33. This information, which was recorded in the detectives' activity logs, was concealed from Mr. Dennis for ten years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Several days after the murder, the Philadelphia Police Department was advised by Montgomery County law enforcement that an inmate in the Montgomery County Prison had advised them that he had spoken with a man who had confessed his involvement in the murder.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36. The inmate provided a signed statement, which included details about all three men involved in the murder and identified the source of the information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36- 37. The investigation itself of these three individuals and the related materials were never provided to the defense trial counsel; this information was revealed a decade later during PCRA discovery.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Alleged Fabricated Clothing Evidence &amp; Undermining of Mr. Dennis's Alibi\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Mr. Dennis alleges that the defendant officers fabricated the existence of certain clothing matching the clothing of the shooter as described by eyewitnesses to the murder.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 45-46, 66-67. At trial, Detective Jastrzembski testified that the clothing had been found at Mr. Dennis's residence but had since \"disappeared\" from police headquarters.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   According to Mr. Dennis, the defendant officers also engaged in deliberate deception by concealing evidence that would have supported Mr. Dennis's alibi and supporting false testimony at trial that undermined Mr. Dennis's alibi. Specifically, a witness's time-stamped welfare receipt corroborated Mr. Dennis's alibi that he was elsewhere at the time of the murder.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 47-49, 65. But the defendant officers took the only copy of the welfare receipt, never shared it with Mr. Dennis, and did not correct the witness when she misread the receipt's military-style time-stamp while interviewing her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 47-49. The witness repeated her mistake at trial. Under those circumstances, her testimony no longer supported Mr. Dennis's alibi.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65. It was not until direct appeal counsel obtained a copy of the receipt that the witness's mistake and the import of that mistake became apparent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48-49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Complicity of the City\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Further, according to Mr. Dennis, the City of Philadelphia, which operates, directs and controls the Philadelphia Police Department, maintained a policy, practice, or custom of misconduct in homicide investigations, including using coercive interview and interrogation techniques, fabricating and tampering with evidence, and conducting improper identification procedures.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 82-83. To that end, the City failed to discipline, train, and take remedial action against detectives and police officers who engaged in such misconduct and abused their authority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Mr. Dennis's Habeas Petition\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Against that factual background, Mr. Dennis began federal habeas proceedings in 2011 in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\n   <em>\n    Dennis v. Wetzel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076673\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/966/489/#p498\">\n    966 F.Supp.2d 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 498 (E.D. Pa. 2013). After reviewing Mr. Dennis's habeas petition, Judge Brody vacated Mr. Dennis's conviction, expressing concern that Mr. Dennis \"was wrongfully convicted and sentenced to die for a crime he did not commit.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076673\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/966/489/#p498\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076673\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/966/489/#p498\">\n    at 518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On February 9, 2015, however, a Third Circuit panel reversed and remanded the case back to Judge Brody.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dennis v. Sec'y, Pa. Dep't of Corr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3984833\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/777/642/\">\n    777 F.3d 642\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 2015). Subsequently, on August 23, 2016, the Third Circuit,\n   <em>\n    en\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    banc\n   </em>\n   , reversed the Third Circuit panel decision and reinstated the vacatur of Mr. Dennis's conviction, noting that the Commonwealth's case was \"effectively gutted.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dennis v. Sec'y, Pa. Dep't of Corr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055333\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/834/263/#p269\">\n    834 F.3d 263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 269 (3d Cir. 2016). In its mandate, issued on September 30, 2016, the Third Circuit directed the Commonwealth either to set Mr. Dennis free or retry him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mandate, Docket No. 13-9003;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Mandate, Docket No. 11-1660, ECF No. 64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Rather than do either, the Commonwealth offered Mr. Dennis a no contest plea to third-degree murder, which Mr. Dennis entered on December 22, 2016. After nearly twenty-five years on death row, Mr. Dennis walked out of prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Mr. Dennis now brings this action under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   seeking redress for the alleged fabrication of evidence and deliberate deception by the defendant officers, as described above, that deprived him of his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process of law and a fair trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The two named detectives and the City have moved to dismiss the complaint.

As used in Mr. Dennis's complaint, \"deliberate deception\" refers to the defendant officers' concealment of relevant and material evidence and support of false testimony at trial.

Following his conviction and sentencing, he brings a \u00a7 1983 claim for damages, alleging that the police, under color of state law, engaged in an unlawful investigation and destroyed exculpatory evidence. His conviction remains outstanding and unchallenged. But how could the conviction be valid if he recovered damages for the unlawful investigation that resulted in that conviction? It could not. Success on the \u00a7 1983 suit would undermine the validity of the underlying conviction. Such a result is impermissible because absent relief from the state court, only federal habeas relief can vacate the conviction. But, of course, not all \u00a7 1983 claims are alike just as not\n   all convictions are alike.

If this were the chain of events leading up to Mr. Dennis's \u00a7 1983 claim, Defendants would be correct that\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   bars the action. But, importantly, this is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   Mr. Dennis's path. The difference is that Mr. Dennis's 1992 conviction was vacated; he was granted federal habeas relief, breaking the chain of events leading up to his \u00a7 1983 claim. Following the issuance of federal habeas relief, Mr. Dennis entered a no contest plea. Therefore, the issue in this case is whether a \u00a7 1983 action may proceed when there are two convictions, one of which has been invalidated (the 1992 conviction) and one of which has not (the 2016 no contest plea conviction).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

The Second Circuit then explained that \"\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   -based \u00a7 1983 claims necessarily imply the invalidity of the challenged conviction in the trial (or plea)\n   <em>\n    in which the Brady violation occurred\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 132 (emphasis in original) (internal citations omitted). Logically, the subsequent plea conviction could\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   possibly replicate the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violations associated with Mr. Poventud's first conviction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 134. Therefore, Mr. Poventud's \u00a7 1983 action, if successful, would\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   have undermined the validity of the 1998 conviction, which had been vacated, and would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   have undermined the validity of the later guilty plea.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In other words, \"far from necessarily implying the invalidity of his second conviction,\" the \u00a7 1983 action would \"not have any bearing on it.\"\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4065308\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/749/755/#p758\">\n    749 F.3d at 760\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotations marks and alterations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Having determined in step one that only the validity of the 1998 conviction would be undermined if Mr. Poventud succeeded on his \u00a7 1983 action, the Second Circuit proceeded to step two: had the 1998 conviction been invalidated? The answer was yes; that conviction had been vacated by the state court. Therefore, the Second Circuit held that\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   did not bar the action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Application to Mr. Dennis's Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Here, Mr. Dennis has alleged fabrication of evidence and deliberate deception in violation of his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process and a fair trial in\n   connection with his 1992 conviction. This type of action, like a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   -based action, only bears on the conviction in which the violations occurred and not on a subsequent conviction, even if based on the same general underlying conduct of the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Why is this so? A\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation bears upon due process and the fairness of the trial and not upon an individual's ultimate guilt or innocence. Similarly, fabricated evidence and deliberate deception, including the support of false testimony at trial, thwart the basic purposes of due process and work to deny an individual a fair trial. Under our system of justice, even the guilty are entitled to due process and a fair trial. In other words, if a plaintiff brings a \u00a7 1983 claim that does not depend upon his ultimate guilt or innocence of the underlying conviction, it does not matter even if after the first criminal conviction is vacated, he is convicted a second time for the same conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Ninth Circuit clarified this point further in\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   . There, the plaintiff, Mr. Jackson, was reconvicted of first-degree murder following the issuance of habeas relief.\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4065308\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/749/755/#p758\">\n    749 F.3d at 758-59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Notwithstanding the reconviction, the Ninth Circuit found that his \u00a7 1983 claim for Fifth Amendment violations stemming from his first conviction were not barred by\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4065308\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/749/755/#p758\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4065308\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/749/755/#p758\">\n    at 760-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In reaching this conclusion, the Ninth Circuit explained that the second conviction was a \"clean conviction\" and \"entirely insulated from the ... violation associated with his initial conviction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4065308\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/749/755/#p758\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 761 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Poventud\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4067863\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/750/121/#p124\">\n    750 F.3d at 132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, a \u00a7 1983 action such as Mr. Dennis's, like Mr. Poventud's in the Second Circuit and Mr. Jackson's in the Ninth Circuit, only bears on the conviction in which the violations occurred, i.e., the 1992 conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Because, here, success on Mr. Dennis's \u00a7 1983 action would only undermine the validity of his 1992 conviction, where the alleged Fourteenth Amendment violations occurred, the Court moves to the second question: has the 1992 conviction been invalidated? Yes. The 1992 conviction was vacated by a federal writ of habeas corpus. Therefore,\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   does not bar this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

Neither of these early instances of a deliberate deception claim was contingent upon a malicious prosecution claim.

In order to succeed on a \u00a7 1983 claim for fabrication of evidence, Mr. Dennis must prove that \"there is a reasonable likelihood, that, without the use of that evidence, [he] would not have been convicted.\"\n   <em>\n    Halsey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4066643\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/750/273/#p292\">\n    750 F.3d at 294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, to succeed on his deliberate deception claim, Mr. Dennis would need to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he would not have been convicted of first-degree murder in the absence of the deliberate deception.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Drumgold v.

Mr. Dennis is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   seeking damages related to the conviction pursuant to his 2016 no contest plea.

In other words, part of Mr. Dennis's claim against the City could be read to include liability for the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violations he endured. Defendants appear to have only argued that the City is entitled to qualified immunity insofar as Mr. Dennis's claim against the City includes the City's failure to train, supervise, and discipline officers regarding the responsibility to provide\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   materials to the prosecutor's office because the right was not clearly established in 1992. This is correct; as discussed above, police officers and police departments did not have clearly established\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   obligations until 1995 when the Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Kyles v.

Yet, it does not appear as though Defendants have challenged the other aspects of the municipal liability claim. Therefore, the Court concludes that, based on the allegations in the complaint, the City is entitled to qualified immunity insofar as the municipal liability claim encompasses liability for a failure to train or discipline regarding\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   obligations. The other aspects of the claim against the City may go forward as pleaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   In his action before the Court today, Mr. Dennis seeks redress for the allegedly deliberate wrongdoing regarding the use of fabricated evidence and deliberate deception by the police that occurred at the trial associated only with his 1992 conviction. Importantly, Mr. Dennis's conviction for first-degree murder in 1992 was vacated. In 2016, Mr. Dennis entered a no contest plea to third-degree murder, but as Mr.\n   Dennis only seeks redress for alleged constitutional violations in connection with his 1992 conviction,\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   presents no bar. The Court also concludes that Mr. Dennis's claim is timely and that qualified immunity is not available to the Defendant detectives at this time. Further, the Court concludes that the municipal liability claim will go forward, though the City is entitled to qualified immunity to the extent Mr. Dennis seeks relief based upon\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violations. For the foregoing reasons, the Court will afford Mr. Dennis the opportunity to argue for the redress he believes he deserves in light of the alleged deprivation of his constitutional rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   An appropriate order follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ORDER\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <strong>\n    AND NOW\n   </strong>\n   , this\n   <strong>\n    15th\n   </strong>\n   day of\n   <strong>\n    May, 2019\n   </strong>\n   , upon consideration of Defendants' Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 5), Plaintiff's response in opposition (ECF No. 6), and the reply and sur-reply thereto (ECF Nos. 14, 15), and for the reasons set forth in the accompanying memorandum, it is hereby\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Defendants' Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 5) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED in part\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED in part\n   </strong>\n   as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   1.
