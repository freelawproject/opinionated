(\"Micron\") and its officers (the \"Individual Defendants\") move to consolidate the actions and for appointment as lead plaintiff and lead counsel under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (\"PSLRA\"). Following publication of the required notice, nine separate parties filed motions. Three presumptive plaintiffs remain: (1) Novriyanto Lius and Thomas Fish (the \"Lius/Fish Group\"), represented by Glancy Prongay &amp; Murray LLP; (2) Dhiru Patel, Cetin Kayaer, and Alexandru Vintu (the \"Micron Investor\n   Group\"), represented by Levi &amp; Korsinsky, LLP; and (3) James Ferraro and the Ferraro Family Foundation, Inc.

During oral argument, the Micron Investor Group contended only that it did not believe this adjustment was \"necessary.\" (April 23, 2018 Oral Arg. Tr., at 12:3.) But aside from its general unwillingness to employ this methodology, the Micron Investor Group offers no reason why this Court should depart from the growing consensus among judges in this district that\n   <em>\n    Dura\n   </em>\n   -adjusted LIFO losses are the appropriate metric.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Maliarov v.

Apr. 5, 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Further complicating matters, the Ferraro Group disputes some of the Calculations. Specifically, the Ferraro Group takes issue with the Lius/Fish Group's assertion that in adjusting its losses, it excluded both losses\n   <em>\n    and gains\n   </em>\n   on securities bought and sold prior to the corrective disclosure. The Ferraro Group contends that exclusion of gains is improper and as a result, the Lius/Fish Group's reported losses are artificially inflated. The Lius/Fish Group argues that the Ferraro Group has no legal authority justifying a distinction between losses and gains and that including gains would have a distorting effect. However, the Lius/Fish Group also does not point to any authorities endorsing its approach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Ultimately, the Court need not resolve this debate. Neither the Ferraro Group nor Fish's losses individually are affected by\n   <em>\n    Dura\n   </em>\n   adjustments, as neither party sold any shares during the class period, and therefore harvested no pre-disclosure gains or losses. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ferraro Grp.'s Memo., Ex. 3; Portnoy Decl., Ex. C.) And the Ferraro Group conceded during oral argument that Fish has the highest individual losses. (Apr. 23, 2019 Oral Arg. Tr., at 7:8-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Ferraro Group also encourages this Court to evaluate the parties' financial interests not by approximate losses, but rather by net shares purchased. However, the Ferraro Group endorsed the approximate losses approach in its opening brief and cites no precedent in this circuit endorsing a departure from the customary focus on approximate losses. And in any\n   event, the difference of 67,500 net shares between Fish and the Ferraro Group is outweighed by the disparity in their losses-at nearly $ 2.5 million, Fish's losses are almost\n   <em>\n    double\n   </em>\n   those of the Ferraro Group. And judges in this district ultimately accord more weight to approximate losses in comparable circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Foley v. Transocean, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4274930\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/272/126/#p131\">\n    272 F.R.D. 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 131 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (reasoning that \"net shares purchased ... does not seem terribly relevant ... since all of [movant's] sales occurred\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   ... corrective disclosures\" and finding a movant's smaller amount of net shares purchased not \"significant enough to outweigh the fact that it sustained appreciably greater losses\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Finally, the Ferraro Group contends that if this Court disaggregates the investor groups, it should not permit Fish to serve as individual lead plaintiff. This argument ignores the longstanding practice in this district of considering the largest shareholder of a rejected group \"as if he had moved to be appointed as lead plaintiff alone.\"\n   <em>\n    Varghese\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3175568\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/589/388/#p392\">\n    589 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   394 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pipefitters\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4277485\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/275/187/#p191\">\n    275 F.R.D. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   192 ;\n   <em>\n    Repex Ventures v.
