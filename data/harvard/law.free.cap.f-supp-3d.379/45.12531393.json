Willis was Gonsalves's primary supplier. Gonsalves and Willis paid runners to carry money to Florida to buy pills from Willis. The runners, who included friends, family, girlfriends, and exes, transported at least one thousand pills per trip, though some carried many more. Willis hid the pills in vitamin bottles, which he doctored to look never-opened, and gave them to the runners to bring to Massachusetts. Gonsalves packaged the pills into packs of one hundred, which he sold to lower-level drug dealers. Gonsalves paid Willis between $ 14 and $ 17 per pill and resold them for between $ 19 and $ 21. Over the three years of the scheme, Gonsalves brought around 371,327 oxycodone pills to Cape Cod.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 1, 2012, after law enforcement busted his operation, Gonsalves was indicted for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute oxycodone in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2084\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   6.

Two witnesses testified about his possession of a rifle. Mathew Hernon, the brother of an ex-girlfriend of Gonsalves named Alexa Doran, testified that, while he was playing video games at Gonsalves's house at the age of fifteen, Gonsalves took an AR-15 rifle out of a case from behind the couch, cocked it, and cleaned it. The weapon was not loaded. Gonsalves told Hernon the rifle was stolen from the police and he had it for protection because he thought someone was going to rob him. Hernon saw the firearm one more time a few weeks later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Doran, the ex-girlfriend, also testified that Gonsalves kept a rifle in a black case behind the couch at his home for a few weeks. She and Gonsalves were distributing pills out of and counting money in the house when the gun was present. Gonsalves told her he did not have any bullets for the rifle and he bought the firearm because it was cool. She never saw Gonsalves fire the rifle, but he talked about shooting a gun at a friend's house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the end of trial, Gonsalves moved for a directed verdict. With respect to the \u00a7 924(c) charge, he argued that \"a reasonable jury could not conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that [he] possessed guns no matter a real one in furtherance of a drug transaction.\" Dkt. No. 303. at 4. The Court denied the motion. On October 9, 2014, the jury convicted Gonsalves on all counts. For the \u00a7 924(c) conviction, the jury found that he possessed the rifle about which Hernon and Doran had testified in furtherance of his oxycodone-trafficking conspiracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The jury then heard additional arguments and instructions on the forfeiture allegations. The following day, the jury found $ 23,503 in cash, two cars, and a house subject to forfeiture. The jury also calculated $ 5,074,575 as the \"total gross proceeds of the oxycodone conspiracy,\" $ 3,552,203 of which was \"reasonably foreseeable to\" Gonsalves. Dkt. No. 318 at 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Court sentenced Gonsalves on June 12, 2015. To determine the drug quantity for his base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, the Court divided the gross proceeds the jury attributed to him at the forfeiture trial ($ 3,552,203) by $ 20, the average sales price per pill, and then added the number of pills that were seized (and thus could not have been forfeited). This calculation attributed 177,610 pills to Gonsalves, which resulted in a base offense level of 36. The Court expressly rejected the Government's proposal to attribute 371,327 pills to Gonsalves based on conservative calculations from the testimony of various runners and suppliers about how many pills they trafficked, although such a methodology would have led to the same base offense level. With enhancements for money laundering, possessing a dangerous weapon, serving as an organizer, and involving a minor in the crime, Gonsalves received a total offense level of 43 and a guidelines recommendation of life. Under the statute and guidelines, the \u00a7 924(c) conviction called for a minimum sentence of five years to run consecutively to the sentence imposed for the trafficking offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   During the argument, the Court stated that Gonsalves was \"going to get a non-Guideline sentence.\" Dkt. No. 476 at 24:5-6. Accordingly, the Court sentenced him to a term of twenty-five years of imprisonment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Actually, the government stole my show a little bit because I did think 25 years was what was appropriate here and not 30. I think that's sufficient but not greater than necessary to serve the purposes of punishment -- that is, deterrence -- the gravity of the offense, giving you a proportionate punishment to other people in similar situations in this conspiracy, and also essentially making sure that the deterrence goes out to the community that oxycodone is something that is harmful and that we take seriously.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Even if my criminal Guideline sentencing turns out to be incorrect in some [respect], this is what I think is sufficient but not greater than necessary to serve the purposes of punishment. I think the 851 is irrelevant. There's the 20 years on Count 1 regardless of the 851, and then there's a five-year on and after from the 924(c).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20982\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20982\">\n    at 37:18-38:7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Gonsalves appealed his conviction and sentence to the First Circuit. As relevant here, he argued the Government presented insufficient evidence for the jury to convict him of the \u00a7 924(c) charge.\n   <em>\n    Gonsalves\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276279\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/95/\">\n    859 F.3d at 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Accordingly, the testimony from Doran and Hernon that Gonsalves \"kept the gun behind the couch where he distributed oxycodone pills and counted drug money\" and \"had the rifle for protection in case someone tried to rob him\" was sufficient to establish that he possessed a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276279\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/95/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Gonsalves also challenged his sentence of twenty-five years as procedurally unreasonable because the Court miscalculated the guidelines range by overestimating the quantity of drugs attributable to him.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276279\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/95/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276279\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/95/\">\n    at 112-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The First Circuit reviewed his claim for plain error, as he did not object on this basis during sentencing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276279\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/95/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276279\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/95/\">\n    at 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The First Circuit held that Gonsalves failed to show that the error affected his substantial rights, i.e., that there was a reasonable probability that he would have received a lower sentence without the error,\n   because the Court made clear its sentence was based not on the guidelines range but instead on ensuring proportionality with his co-conspirators' sentences.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276279\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/95/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Gonsalves filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court, which was denied on January 8, 2018.

No one testified that he had ammunition for the rifle or carried it during a drug transaction, Gonsalves explains, and Doran and Hernon stated that he possessed the rifle for only a few weeks. Because there was no testimony that the firearm was loaded or that he ever conducted a drug transaction while carrying the gun, Gonsalves claims his attorneys were ineffective for not arguing in his motion for a directed verdict or on appeal that the Government failed to show \"a sufficient nexus between the firearm and the drug crime such that the firearm advances or promotes the drug crime.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Neither fact is a requirement to convict under \u00a7 924(c).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Gonsalves also notes that Doran testified that he told her he had the rifle because it was cool. A court must \"consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict[ ]\" on challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Pena\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519450\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/910/591/#p597\">\n    910 F.3d 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 597 (1st Cir. 2018), however, and the jury was free to believe, as Hernon reported Gonsalves told him, that he owned the rifle for protection. Without a plausible argument about the sufficiency of the evidence, Gonsalves cannot show a reasonable probability that he would have won a directed verdict or appeal had his attorneys raised this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Calculation of Drug Amount at Sentencing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Gonsalves next claims his appellate attorney was ineffective for failing to argue\n   that the drug amount at sentencing was calculated in a manner forbidden in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Candelaria-Silva\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5866262\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/714/651/\">\n    714 F.3d 651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1st Cir. 2013). The Court determined the drug amount by dividing the gross proceeds the jury attributed to Gonsalves at the forfeiture trial by $ 20, the average sales price per pill, and then adding the number of pills that were seized (and thus could not have been forfeited). The Court should not have relied on the jury's gross proceeds finding, Gonsalves contends, because the Government made exaggerated estimates during its arguments to the jury of the pill amounts carried by various runners and the jury was never told to ignore the 40,000 pills Gonsalves consumed himself. Gonsalves argues that the Court calculated an erroneously high base offense level using the jury's speculative estimate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   This argument fails on both the performance and prejudice prongs. Gonsalves's appellate attorney devoted almost half of the argument section of his opening brief to reasons why the drug quantity the Court used to calculate the sentence was erroneous. In his brief, the attorney made the same arguments Gonsalves raises now concerning the exaggerated estimates of pill amounts and the pills Gonsalves personally consumed. Gonsalves asserts that the arguments his attorney made on appeal concerned the Court's calculation of the drug amount while he now raises issues with the jury's forfeiture calculation. Because the Court based its calculation on the jury's forfeiture amount, this is a distinction without a difference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Even if his appellate attorney provided constitutionally deficient representation, Gonsalves cannot show prejudice. He claims the unlawful calculation of the drug amount caused an increase in his guidelines range. An error in calculating the guidelines range \"most often will\" suffice to show prejudice, \"whether or not the defendant's ultimate sentence falls within the correct range.\"\n   <em>\n    Molina-Martinez v.
