The rules originally were to go into effect in July 2018. But in July 2018, following a change in presidential administrations, the Department promulgated a regulation delaying the effective date of the Distance-Education Rules until July 2020 (\"Delay Rule\") and raised the prospect that it would revise and reconsider the Distance-Education Rules entirely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In the HEA, Congress imposed a statutory requirement on the promulgation of all Title IV regulations. They must be subject to \"negotiated rulemaking\" - a process where the Department selects a committee of experienced individuals nominated by groups involved in student-financial-assistance programs to negotiate proposed rules - unless the Department \"determines that applying such a requirement\n   with respect to given regulations is impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest (within the meaning of section 553(b)(3)(B) of Title 5 [of the Administrative Procedure Act] )[.]\" 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1098a(b)(2). It is undisputed that the Department did not subject the Delay Rule to negotiated rulemaking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The National Education Association (\"NEA\"), the California Teachers Association (\"CTA\"), and individual plaintiffs Shane Heiman, Kwynn Uyehara, and Stephanie Portilla - NEA and CTA members who are enrolled or considering enrolling in online-education programs - filed this case to challenge the Delay Rule. The plaintiffs argue that the Department's failure to submit the Delay Rule to negotiated rulemaking violated the HEA and the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"). They argue that the Delay Rule thus should be vacated and the Distance-Education Rules be allowed to go into effect as originally planned. The Department responds that it had \"good cause\" under Section 553(b)(3)(B) of the APA to forgo negotiated rulemaking because it would have been impracticable to submit a proposed delay rule to negotiated rulemaking, to complete that process, and to promulgate a final delay rule, before the effective date of the Distance-Education Rules. The Department also argues that any failure to engage in negotiated rulemaking was harmless error that does not warrant vacating the Delay Rule. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The supposed insufficient time to promulgate a rule delaying the effective date of the Distance-Education Rules is not good cause to forgo the HEA's statutorily mandated negotiated-rulemaking process. Additionally, the supposed lack of time resulted from the Department's own delay, and an agency's own delay is not good cause. Furthermore, the Department's failure to engage in negotiated rulemaking here was not harmless error. The court grants the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, denies the defendants' motion for cross-summary judgment, and orders the Delay Rule vacated (but stays the vacatur for 30 days from the date of this order).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

Additionally, our organizations believe that licensure-related notifications and disclosures support students' abilities to achieve their academic and career goals. Institutions should be required to dutifully notify enrolled and prospective students participating in educational programs completed solely through distance education or correspondence of all factors relevant to their pursuit of their academic and career goals. These Federal regulations will increase the level of consumer protection to ensure students are not exposed to unscrupulous actions that could impair the student's investment in higher education.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    \u2022 Proof of State Authorization provides transparency.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   In addition to the states' legal requirements for authorization, the ability to tie title IV funds to authorization provides transparency to students about the use of their funding and the ability to participate and complete the academic program that they choose. Students benefit from the clarity due to a federal directive for the institution to supply proof of the completion of state mandated compliance requirements in the states where students are enrolled or receiving services.

I appreciate your interest and willingness to listen to a discussion about critical issues on accreditation and distance education. To follow up on our discussion on state authorization, my colleagues and I respectfully would like to bring to your attention concerns in the higher education distance education community regarding the USDE's rules on state authorization of distance education set to go into effect July 1, 2018 (34 CFR - Sections 600 and 668). Those of us who represent major postsecondary distance education organizations receive many questions about implementing the rules. The institutions we represent clearly desire to comply with the rules, but are struggling with how to prepare to do so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   Compliance with the new rules will be a costly and burdensome effort for most colleges and universities that offer distance\n   education. These institutions need a clear understanding of USDE's expectations. Specifically, the rules require institutions to provide (for each state where students are enrolled in distance education programs) public and individualized disclosures of state authorization status for every state, complaint resolution processes for every state, and details on state licensure eligibility for every discipline that requires a license to enter a profession (e.g., teaching, counseling, dietician, nursing). The rules also require institutions to comply with refund policy requirements for each state where students are enrolled, regardless of membership in the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreements. Clarification is needed on the USDE's desired format for the disclosures. Another area of concern is that issue is that the regulation defines \"residence\" in a way that conflicts with state laws and common practice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   The U. S. House of Representatives' draft of the PROSPER Act would remove those rules and forbid issuing future regulations on the topic. But even if the removal of state authorization is included in future HEA reauthorization legislation, reauthorization is highly unlikely to occur before July 1, 2018, when the rules go into effect. The U.S. Department of Education could (1) delay the rules and submit the issues to additional negotiated rulemaking or (2) issue clarification via a dear colleague letter on USDE's expectations for compliance. A third option would require Congress to take action to delay or suspend implementation. Otherwise, the rules will go into effect, as written, with the potential for broad misunderstandings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   Institutions that know the most about these issues are the most concerned. WCET's State Authorization Network includes 700 institutions. (WCET is an acronym for the WICHE Cooperative for Educational Technologies.) Institutional participation in the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement (SARA) now includes about 1,750 institutions from the current 48 SARA member states (plus the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands). DEAC (the Distance Education Accrediting Commission) accredited institutions are a part of the WCET and SARA communities. Our institutions want to comply with the regulatory environment, but many questions remain.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   Thank you for your consideration.

Here, the time pressures faced by the Department were of its own making. The Department claims that it was prompted to propose delaying the effective date of the Distance-Education Rules because the 2018 ACE Letter and the 2018 WCET Letter raised issues regarding the definition of the term \"resides\" as used in the Rules and regarding how the Rules would apply to states like California that did not have processes in place for reviewing student complaints about out-of-state institutions.

Nor does the Department explain why it took no action (1) after it announced in January 2017 that it intended to take action with respect to the Distance-Education Rules, 82 Fed.

To the extent that the Department claims that it was under time pressure in May 2018 when it issued the Delay-Rule NPRM, that time pressure was due to its\n   own delay in not taking any action before then, and \"[g]ood cause cannot arise as a result of the agency's own delay[.]\"\n   <em>\n    NRDC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517546\" index=\"242\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/894/95/#p114\">\n    894 F.3d at 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   The Department did not have good cause to forgo the negotiated-rulemaking requirements of 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1098a(b)(2).

It involved a budget assessment imposed on almond handlers to pay for pro-almond marketing and public relations.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10525785\" index=\"304\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/14/429/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10525785\" index=\"304\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/14/429/\">\n     at 433\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The assessment was based on a mechanical formula that took into account the California Almond Board's proposed budget and the forecast for almond harvests and reduced them to a \"rate per pound of almonds.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10525785\" index=\"305\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/14/429/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10525785\" index=\"305\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/14/429/\">\n     at 441\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The Board held open meetings in July every year to receive comments and testimony and to gather information relevant to estimating its budget and the resulting assessment rate.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10525785\" index=\"306\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/14/429/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10525785\" index=\"306\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/14/429/\">\n     at 442\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . After deciding on its recommendation, the Board directly notified each almond handler of the proposed assessment rate.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10525785\" index=\"307\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/14/429/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Two groups of almond handlers challenged the assessment rates, arguing that they had not been subject to notice and comment.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10525785\" index=\"308\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/14/429/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10525785\" index=\"308\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/14/429/\">\n     at 440\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The Ninth Circuit agreed that the assessment rates should have been subjected to notice and comment (rejecting an argument that the assessment rates should be excused from notice and comment because they were simply \"mechanical\" results derived from a formula,\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10525785\" index=\"309\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/14/429/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at 441 ), but held that the failure to provide notice and comment was harmless given that almond handlers knew of the July open meetings and the opportunity to provide comment.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10525785\" index=\"310\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/14/429/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10525785\" index=\"310\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/14/429/\">\n     at 442\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . This case does not establish that the Department's failure here to engage in negotiated rulemaking for its delay proposal - a proposal that was not issued pursuant to a regular annual schedule that all stakeholders knew about and did not involve a mechanical formula-derived result - similarly was harmless.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-217\">\n    The Department also cites\n    <em>\n     Sagebrush Rebellion, Inc. v.

In that case, the Department of the Interior issued a notice and invited comment on a proposal to create a conservation area in the Snake River Canyon by legislatively withdrawing the lands from mining laws but did not issue a separate notice on a proposal to administratively withdraw those same lands.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1578831\" index=\"312\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/790/760/#p764\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1578831\" index=\"312\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/790/760/#p764\">\n     at 762, 764\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The two withdrawals would have had \"identical legal effect, with only one exception: whereas the congressional withdrawal would be in perpetuity (subject, of course, to Congress' inherent right to enact legislation to the contrary in the future), ... administrative withdrawals [are limited] to a maximum of twenty years, and [are] subject to congressional review and administrative revocation.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1578831\" index=\"313\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/790/760/#p764\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1578831\" index=\"313\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/790/760/#p764\">\n     at 762\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The Ninth Circuit held that the failure to issue a separate notice regarding administrative withdrawal was harmless given the notice and comment with respect to legislative withdrawal because \"the impact of both actions on all concerned persons would be identical for a substantial period of time at least,\" and hence \"the same public would have responded to a notice of administrative withdrawal as responded to the noticed congressional withdrawal[.]\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1578831\" index=\"314\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/790/760/#p764\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1578831\" index=\"314\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/790/760/#p764\">\n     at 764\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
