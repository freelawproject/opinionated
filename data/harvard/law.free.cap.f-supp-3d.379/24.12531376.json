BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    1.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    The Original Investigation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In March 2012, the Department of Homeland Security's Investigation unit (\"HSI\") in Boston received information from a confidential informant (\"CI\") that individuals in New York were filing false tax returns using Social Security numbers stolen from Puerto Rican residents. The CI informed HSI agents that the people involved in the operation were looking for ways to cash fraudulently-obtained refund checks and, at the direction of HSI and the United States Secret Service, arranged to meet with these individuals to assist in cashing the checks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Between April and May 2012, the CI met with Odalis Castillo-Lopez in South Attleboro, Massachusetts on several occasions to pick up the fraudulently-obtained checks. On two such occasions, the checks were wrapped in a sheet of paper listing the names and Social Security Numbers of the individuals to whom the checks were issued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Through a series of recorded telephone calls, the CI arranged to meet Mr. Castillo-Lopez a fourth time on June 7, 2012 to pick up approximately $ 160,000 in checks in exchange for a payment of $ 80,000. Agents from HSI and the Secret Service planned to arrest Mr. Castillo-Lopez at that meeting. In anticipation of doing so, they established surveillance at the meeting\n   location, a parking lot next to a McDonald's in South Attleboro.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    2.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    The Arrest\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On June 7, 2012, Mr. Castillo-Lopez and another individual, later identified as the Defendant, arrived at the location in a white Volkswagen Passat with New York license plates (\"the vehicle\") just after noon. Mr. Castillo-Lopez was driving; the vehicle was later identified as being owned by a person named Alma Martinez. Agents observed both men exit the car and enter the McDonald's. Special Agents John Soares and Michael Riley of HSI and Special Agent Fred Mitchell of the Secret Service then entered the McDonald's. Agents Soares and Mitchell approached Mr. Castillo-Lopez,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   asked him some questions, and escorted him out of the McDonald's. Mr. Castillo-Lopez was then arrested and taken to the Boston Field Office of HSI for processing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Agent Riley approached Mr. Cruz-Mercedes in the McDonald's and had a brief conversation with him. There is no evidence of record about the content of that conversation, and there is some dispute about what happened next. Both Agent Soares and Agent Mitchell testified that Mr. Cruz-Mercedes was escorted out of the McDonald's by Agent Riley, and that he was eventually questioned outside, near the vehicle, by Special Agent Kevin Cronin of HSI. Agent Soares testified that Agent Riley did not handcuff Mr. Cruz-Mercedes, and that he was not handcuffed until he was subsequently arrested by Agent Cronin. However, Agent Mitchell testified that Mr. Cruz-Mercedes was handcuffed inside the McDonald's, before being escorted out and Agent Cronin testified that Mr. Cruz-Mercedes had been placed in custody before being brought out to the parking lot to talk to him. I am satisfied that, by the time he was brought to the parking lot, Mr. Cruz-Mercedes had been taken into custody, irrespective of whether the initial encounter inside the McDonald's could be characterized as a \"Terry\" investigative stop.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Once he was brought out to the parking lot, Mr. Cruz-Mercedes had a brief conversation with Agent Cronin, during which he initially identified himself as \"Pedro Colon\" and handed over several identification documents, including a Massachusetts driver's license and a Social Security card listing his name as Pedro Colon. Agent Cronin, indicating that he did not believe the Defendant was telling the truth about his identity, pressed Mr. Cruz-Mercedes further, asking him if the documents were, in fact, his. In response to this further investigative inquiry, the Defendant told Agent Cronin that his name was, in fact, Hector Cruz-Mercedes, and that he was a native of the Dominican Republic who had entered the United States unlawfully. Agent Cronin then formally arrested Mr. Cruz-Mercedes for being in the United States unlawfully and conducted a search of the Defendant incident to arrest; that search uncovered two cell phones. The Defendant was transported to the HSI office for processing, at which point he was fingerprinted. At no point during his encounter with law enforcement after being escorted out of the McDonald's was Mr. Cruz-Mercedes advised of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    3.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    The Search of the Vehicle\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After both Mr. Cruz-Mercedes and Mr. Castillo-Lopez were taken away from the parking lot, other agents conducted a cursory search of the vehicle and concluded that the parking lot was not a secure location. The vehicle was impounded and brought to the Government Center Garage in Boston's O'Neill Federal Building. There, the vehicle was searched more thoroughly by Agents Soares and Mitchell, who were looking specifically for the additional Treasury checks that the CI had arranged to pick up from Mr. Castillo-Lopez. The search uncovered an envelope tucked into the headliner above the driver's seat. The envelope contained ten Treasury checks and, as with two of the earlier check deliveries, a list of names, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers corresponding to the payees of the checks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The search also uncovered a bank deposit slip from an account at Bank of America and a personal check made out to Saw Mills Auto Sales. The name on the check was \"Anna Cruz,\" and the check included her associated address. Further investigation indicated that this check was associated with the Bank of America account listed on the deposit slip found in the vehicle. This was one of the bank accounts that Mr. Castillo-Lopez had instructed the CI to use to deposit proceeds from the cashing of the Treasury checks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At some point during the investigation, evidence found in the vehicle was sent to Sergeant John Costa, of the Massachusetts State Police (\"MSP\"), to be tested for fingerprints. Sgt. Costa recovered eight prints, but only one was clear enough to form the basis of an identification. Sgt. Costa subsequently matched the latent print to a known print taken from Mr. Cruz-Mercedes when he was processed by HSI after his June 7, 2012 arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Procedural Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On June 7, 2012, a Criminal Complaint was issued against Mr. Castillo-Lopez for Conversion of Government Property and Money Laundering, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20641\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and \u00a7 1956 respectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On August 9, 2012, a Criminal Complaint was issued against Mr. Cruz-Mercedes\n   for the Deceptive Use of a Social Security Number, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20408\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(7)(B). That Complaint was based on the fact that Mr. Cruz-Mercedes initially identified himself to Agent Cronin as Pedro Colon and produced several identification documents, including a Social Security Card, with the name Pedro Colon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Mr. Cruz-Mercedes was arrested on August 16, 2012\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   in Bronx County, New York and appeared that same day before Magistrate Judge Peck in the Southern District of New York. Judge Peck released Mr. Cruz-Mercedes on a $ 10,000 bond and ordered him to appear in this Court on or before August 24, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Mr. Cruz-Mercedes then fled the country and returned to his native Dominican Republic. Once Mr. Cruz-Mercedes had been located, the Government arranged to extradite him and he made his initial appearance in this Court before Magistrate Judge Cabell on December 1, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In anticipation of trial, Mr. Cruz-Mercedes filed his motion to suppress all evidence seized in connection with his June 7, 2012 arrest, including Treasury checks taken from the vehicle. He argued that his arrest was unlawful because it was unsupported by probable cause and that the complained-of evidence constituted the fruits of an unlawful seizure required to be suppressed under the teachings of\n   <em>\n    Wong Sun\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"450611\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/371/471/\">\n    371 U.S. 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"450611\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/371/471/\">\n    83 S.Ct. 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"450611\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/371/471/\">\n    9 L.Ed.2d 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1963). Mr. Cruz-Mercedes separately filed his\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   motion to exclude the testimony of the Government's fingerprint expert regarding the process of matching his known fingerprints to the fingerprint discovered on the Treasury checks. The government's expert had filed a report opining that Mr. Cruz- Mercedes's fingerprints appeared on at least one Treasury check seized from the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   At an evidentiary hearing on August 29, 2018 regarding both motions, I heard testimony from Agents Soares, Cronin, and Mitchell with respect to the motion to suppress, and from Sergeant John Costa of the MSP and Dr. Alicia Wilcox from Husson University with respect to the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   motion. Ruling from the bench that day, I denied the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   motion, and directed supplemental briefing with respect to the motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On September 11, 2018, I held the final pretrial conference, during which I ruled from the bench with respect to the motion to suppress. As relevant to this Memorandum, I declined to suppress the underlying fingerprint evidence, but did suppress statements made by Mr. Cruz-Mercedes to Agent Cronin beyond his initial self-identification as Pedro Colon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The following day, Mr. Cruz-Mercedes, with assent from the Government, requested that he be permitted to enter a conditional plea of guilty, reserving his right to challenge my determinations regarding the\n   fingerprint evidence. On September 13, 2018, I accepted the conditional guilty plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   By Judgment dated January 9, 2019, I sentenced Mr. Cruz-Mercedes to a term of imprisonment of 36 months and one day, followed by three years of supervised release with standard and special conditions. I also required restitution in the amount of $ 34,8000, and a mandatory special assessment of $ 2,200. At the same time, I signed a judicial order of removal based on the stipulation of the parties that would require Mr. Cruz-Mercedes be deported after his release from Bureau of Prisons custody. On January 15, 2019, Mr. Cruz-Mercedes timely filed his notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    II. THE MOTION TO SUPPRESS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Mr. Cruz-Mercedes's motion [Dkt. No. 57] to suppress was directed at all evidence seized as a result of his June 7, 2012 arrest. He argued that his arrest that day, when effectuated, was unsupported by probable cause and therefore violated the Fourth Amendment. Consequently, he contended the fruits of his arrest - including specifically the envelope containing Treasury checks with any fingerprint alleged to be his on those checks - should be suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   I address this contention in its larger context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Evidence Found in the Vehicle\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In his motion to suppress, Mr. Cruz-Mercedes argued that the impoundment, and subsequent search, of the vehicle without a warrant and without probable cause violated the Fourth Amendment, and that the fruits of that search - including an envelope containing ten fraudulently obtained Treasury checks totaling $ 75,808.14, a hand-written list written on the envelope with the names, Social Security Numbers, and monetary amounts of the checks, a personal check from payee Ana Cruz, and a deposit slip from a Bank of America account - should be suppressed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a preliminary matter, I was not persuaded that Mr. Cruz-Mercedes had standing to object to the impoundment and search of the vehicle.\n   <em>\n    See infra\n   </em>\n   Section II.A.1. Even if he did have standing, I concluded on the merits,\n   <em>\n    see infra\n   </em>\n   Sections II.A.2. and B., that the evidence seized from the vehicle was obtained lawfully because the vehicle search falls within the scope of one or more of several enumerated exceptions to the probable cause and warrant requirements of the Fourth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    1.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Standing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In order to have standing to challenge the admission of evidence seized from the vehicle, Mr. Cruz-Mercedes must be able to demonstrate that he has \"a constitutionally protected reasonable expectation of privacy\" in the vehicle's contents such that a search of the vehicle would be \"presumptively unreasonable in the absence of a search warrant.\"\n   <em>\n    Katz\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11339173\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/389/347/#p360\">\n    389 U.S. 347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 360-61,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11339173\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/389/347/#p360\">\n    88 S.Ct. 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11339173\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/389/347/#p360\">\n    19 L.Ed.2d 576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1967) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Salvucci\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1787633\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/448/83/#p92\">\n    448 U.S. 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 92,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1787633\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/448/83/#p92\">\n    100 S.Ct. 2547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1787633\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/448/83/#p92\">\n    65 L.Ed.2d 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1980) ;\n   <em>\n    Rakas\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Illinois\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11329017\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/439/128/#p143\">\n    439 U.S. 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 143,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11329017\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/439/128/#p143\">\n    99 S.Ct. 421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11329017\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/439/128/#p143\">\n    58 L.Ed.2d 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1979).

The vehicle was owned by Alma Martinez, and Mr. Cruz-Mercedes contends only that he \"had been lent the car\" by his girlfriend, Ms. Martinez's sister. There is no evidence of record that Mr. Cruz-Mercedes had previously borrowed the vehicle or had any ability to control access to the vehicle. Nor is there any record evidence that Ms. Martinez, the record owner of the vehicle, allowed Mr. Cruz-Mercedes to borrow the vehicle: his testimony reflects only that her sister allowed him to use it. More fundamentally, Mr. Cruz-Mercedes was not the driver; he was merely along for the ride.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Consequently, I cannot say that Mr. Cruz-Mercedes had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the vehicle and therefore, that he can object to the introduction of the fruits of that search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    2.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    The Merits\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Even if Mr. Cruz-Mercedes could demonstrate that he does, in fact, have standing\n   to object to the vehicle search, I have independently concluded the search itself was lawful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The parties do not dispute the facts surrounding the search itself. After Mr. Cruz-Mercedes and Mr. Castillo-Lopez\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   were taken into custody, law enforcement agents conducted a cursory search of the vehicle, and then impounded it. Several hours later, Agents Soares and Mitchell searched the vehicle at the O'Neill Federal Building; the evidence seized from the vehicle was discovered during this second search. The agents never obtained a warrant to impound or search the vehicle, though the Government argues it had probable cause to believe the Treasury checks were in the vehicle based on Mr. Castillo-Lopez's previous conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In any event, in the absence of a warrant, the seizure and subsequent search of the vehicle was lawful only if it fell within one of the established exceptions to the warrant requirements of the Fourth Amendment.

Indeed, this was the kind of basic police work that federal agents engaged in throughout their investigation of Mr. Castillo-Lopez and that was ongoing both when Mr. Cruz-Mercedes was initially arrested in June 2012 and subsequently.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Silvestri\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1560530\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/787/736/#p744\">\n    787 F.2d 736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 744 (1st Cir. 1986) (\"[T]here are three basic concerns which surface in an inevitable discovery analysis: are the legal means truly independent; are both the use of the legal means and the discovery by that means truly independent; and does the application of the inevitable discovery exception ... provide an incentive for police misconduct ...?\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   I am satisfied that, by using evidence not subject to suppression, law enforcement would not only inevitably have found Mr. Cruz-Mercedes, but also would have had a properly grounded basis for probable cause to arrest him and obtain his fingerprints even without his unlawful arrest on June 7, 2012.

There is no non-speculative basis for finding he would have had those same phones on his person when he was inevitably arrested by federal agents at a later date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Nevertheless, I am satisfied that federal agents would inevitably have had access to the records independently associated with the phone number (347)-245-2491 (\"the 347 number\"). HSI found the 347 number during a lawful search of the cellphone seized from Mr. Castillo-Lopez as a result of his arrest. Mr. Castillo-Lopez's phone had received numerous text messages from that number relating to his criminal enterprise, and Ms. Sanchez, during an interview with law enforcement, identified the 347 number as belonging to Mr. Cruz-Mercedes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   From there, federal agents could, and did, issue a Grand Jury subpoena to the service provider, who identified the phone as a Blackberry Curve with a specific ID number, who could provide law enforcement with phone records even if the physical Blackberry device had not previously been seized.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Through this altogether predictable, and indeed inevitable path, agents would have discovered the phone records of the Blackberry Curve devices associated with Mr. Cruz-Mercedes, even if they would not have had access to the two phones as physical items themselves. Consequently, I declined to suppress evidence of the phone records associated with the Blackberry Curve devices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Costa and Dr. Wilcox will be helpful to the jury. Mr. Cruz-Mercedes also does not argue that the Analysis, Comparison, Evaluation, and Verification (\"ACE-V\") methodology that Sgt. Costa used is per se unreliable; indeed, courts across the country have found that \"most of the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   factors support admitting latent fingerprint identification evidence obtained pursuant to the ACE-V method.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Pena\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3486009\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/586/105/#p110\">\n    586 F.3d 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 110-11 (1st Cir. 2009) (citing various cases that have found expert testimony on fingerprint identification based on this methodology sufficiently reliable under\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vargas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6045487\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/471/255/#p265\">\n    471 F.3d at 264-65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Mr. Cruz-Mercedes instead argues specifically that Sgt. Costa did not properly analyze the latent fingerprints, as a consequence of which the conclusions he drew were unreliable. To determine whether Sgt. Costa's testimony may be presented to a jury, I conducted an evidentiary hearing on August 29, 2018 during which both experts explained the process of comparing fingerprints using the ACE-V method.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   For his part, Sgt. Costa also testified about the procedure he followed in analyzing the fingerprints at issue here. He testified that the latent prints were difficult, but that there were enough details in one of the latent prints to make a positive comparison to any known print. He testified that he analyzed the latent print alongside the known print, and that at least some of his notes analyzing the latent print were made after he determined that the latent print matched the known print. He also testified that he did not follow the standards for documentation set by the Scientific Working Group on Friction Ridge Analysis Study and Technology\n   (\"SWGFAST\"), but that he did go through all four stages of the ACE-V methodology and documented his procedures according to MSP protocol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Dr. Wilcox, in turn, testified that she believed that none of the latent prints were suitable for comparison because none were sufficiently clear to allow for a positive identification. She also testified that Sgt. Costa's failure to document his thought-process during the analysis stage of his comparison rendered the comparison unreliable because it opened the door to unconscious bias and made it impossible for a third party to evaluate his methodology.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Based on the testimony presented during the evidentiary hearing, I could not find that Sgt. Costa's methodology was so unreliable that it should be kept from the jury. To be sure, Dr. Wilcox's testimony highlighted the importance of documentation to the scientific process, and I did not accept the Government's suggestion that documentation is irrelevant to a determination of reliability. The documentation here was not full and complete, and that affects the credibility of Sgt. Costa's conclusion, even if he properly used the ACE-V procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   While the SWGFAST standards for documentation represent the consensus view on what is appropriate, I was not convinced that Stg. Costa's failure to follow them renders his conclusions so unreliable that his opinion must be kept from the jury entirely. While that failure certainly raised concerns about confirmation bias and opens Stg. Costa's conclusions to robust challenge on cross-examination, the question whether to accept his comparison as accurate is properly left for the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Consequently, I denied the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   For the foregoing reasons:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   (A) The motion [Dkt. No. 57] to suppress, was GRANTED with respect to all statements made by Mr. Cruz-Mercedes to Agent Cronin identifying himself as Hector Cruz-Mercedes, and with respect to the physical cell phones found on his person; the motion to suppress was DENIED with respect to fingerprints, phone records, and other papers seized as a result of the lawful arrest of Mr. Castillo-Lopez, including the search of the vehicle he was driving, and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   (B) The motion [Dkt.

No 96], Mr. Cruz-Mercedes identified the issue for appeal as follows: \"Specifically, Defendant requests that he be permitted to reserve for appellate review the court's adverse determination on his motion to suppress fingerprint evidence.\" This identification of the issues is somewhat ambiguous but fairly and generously read, appears to implicate adverse determinations of certain aspects of two pretrial motions filed by the Defendant to the extent that the evidence said to be the fruits of an allegedly improper automobile search yielded checks that the government would contend were handled by him. Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 11 (a)(2), the Defendant's appeal is thus limited to the government's anticipated fingerprint evidence.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Ramos\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1862976\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/961/1003/#p1005\">\n     961 F.2d 1003\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1005-06 (1st Cir. 1992) (holding that \"[a] defendant is normally deemed to waive arguments that he does not present to the district court....

Although I disposed of both motions in oral rulings from the bench, I take this occasion - before the filing of Defendant-Appellant's brief in the First Circuit - after detailed review of the relevant transcripts (certain of which were not completed and docketed until after Notice of Appeal was filed) to explain more fully the reasoning underlying my disposition of these motions.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    There is some dispute about where Mr. Castillo-Lopez was when this interaction took place.

Despite this broad understanding of the term \"seizure,\" the Supreme Court has declined to extend the full constitutional protections - including the probable cause requirement - afforded to an individual who is placed under arrest to all individuals who are \"seized\" by law enforcement during the investigative process. Instead, it has permitted law enforcement officers to \"stop and briefly detain an individual for investigative purposes if police have a reasonable suspicion that criminal activity is underfoot.\"\n    <em>\n     United States\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Dapolito\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3559850\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/713/141/#p147\">\n     713 F.3d 141\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 147-48 (1st Cir. 2013). When characterizing interactions between law enforcement and individuals, then, these so-called \"Terry\" stops form an intermediate category: they qualify as a seizure under the Fourth Amendment and require at least reasonable suspicion that a particular individual is engaged in wrongdoing. But they are shorter in duration and more limited in scope than an arrest and require something less than probable cause. Nevertheless, they can, with time, mature into a full arrest and trigger the constitutional protections associated with a full arrest.\n    <em>\n     See infra\n    </em>\n    Section II.B.1, n. 8.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    The record is not clear when or why Mr. Cruz-Mercedes was released from Administrative Detention following his arrest by Agent Cronin on June 7, 2012 for being in the country illegally.
