He brings this action against Defendants William P. Barr (Attorney General of the United States), Thomas E. Brandon (Deputy Director and Acting Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives), Christopher A. Wray (Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation), and the United States of America (collectively, the \"Government\"), contending that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional as applied to him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Presently before\n   the Court are the parties' Motions for Summary Judgment, along with numerous responses and replies to the respective motions. For the reasons that follow, Williams' Motion for Summary Judgment is denied, and the Government's Motion for Summary Judgment is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In April 2000, Williams was in State College, Pennsylvania, where he was pulled over, arrested, and charged with DUI based on his blood alcohol content (\"BAC\") being over .10%.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Pl.'s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (\"Pl.'s SUMF\") in Supp. Mot. Summ. J. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 3; Gov't's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (\"Gov't's SUMF\") in Supp. Mot. Summ. J. \u00b6\u00b6 2-3.) Williams entered into Pennsylvania's Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition (\"ARD\") program and was sentenced to twelve months of probation, required alcohol and driver's safety classes, surrender of his driver's license, and payment of court costs. (Pl.'s SUMF \u00b6 4; Gov't's SUMF \u00b6 4.) Acceptance into the ARD program may be construed statutorily as a conviction for purposes of computing sentences on subsequent DUI convictions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%203806\">\n    75 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 3806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In November 2001, Williams was arrested in Philadelphia for DUI. (Gov't's SUMF \u00b6 5.) The charges were dismissed for unknown reasons. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 7, 2004, Williams was once again pulled over in Philadelphia for DUI. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9; Pl.'s SUMF \u00b6 7.) He was arrested, charged, and subsequently found guilty at trial in 2005 of DUI at the highest rate of intoxication in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%203802\">\n    75 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 3802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). (Gov't's SUMF \u00b6 15; Pl.'s SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 7-8.) Although Williams was arrested at approximately 2:00 a.m., a test conducted at 3:20 a.m. indicated his BAC to be .223%. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't's SUMF \u00b6 15;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Gov't's Mem. Law Supp. Mot. Summ. J., Ex. C at MCP-00039.) He was sentenced on June 15, 2006 to ninety days to two years in prison; mandatory attendance at Alcohol Highway Safety School; a $ 1,500 fine, $ 180 in court costs, and a surcharge of $ 100; license suspension for eighteen months; and imposition of an ignition interlock. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't's Mem. Law Supp. Mot. Summ. J., Ex. C at MCP-000016, 000019.) The judge allowed Williams to serve his sentence on passive house arrest until electronic monitoring was available due to Williams' medical condition. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't's Mem. Law Supp. Mot. Summ. J., Ex. C at MCP-000019.) Because Williams' conviction was under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%203802\">\n    75 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 3802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) and he had a prior offense, it was considered a first-degree\n   misdemeanor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%203803\">\n    75 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 3803\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4). First-degree misdemeanors in Pennsylvania carry a maximum sentence of up to five years of imprisonment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20106\">\n    18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(6). Accordingly, federal law disqualified him (and continues to do so) from possessing a firearm under \u00a7 922(g)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Although Williams knew his license to carry a firearm had been revoked due to his 2005 DUI conviction, he continued to own approximately twenty firearms until 2014, including semi-automatic guns, revolvers, and shotguns. (Gov't's SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 19-21.) Further, between 1994 and 2010, he worked as a sales manager, firearms instructor, and range safety officer at a gun store and range called \"Colosimo's.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) During this period, some of which included his federal firearm and ammunition prohibition, Williams physically handled firearms and ammunition every day as part of his job responsibilities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24-25.) As part of his employment, Williams also had the responsibility for ensuring that those who wished to purchase firearms at Colosimo's could do so under federal and state law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.) Additionally, he was responsible for understanding the paperwork that was needed to complete those purchases, such as the Pennsylvania state firearms application. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Nevertheless, Williams in 2007 submitted an application to purchase a Glock-23. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.) In paragraph thirty-two of the Pennsylvania State Police Application/Record of Sale, Williams checked the \"no\" box when asked, \"Are you charged with, or have you ever been convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year? This is the maximum sentence that you 'could have received,' not the actual sentence you did receive.\" (Gov't's SUMF \u00b6 31, Ex. A (\"Williams Dep.\"), Ex. 7.) Williams successfully completed the purchase of the firearm based on his representations in the application. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In December 2014, Williams attempted to obtain a license to carry firearms out of the desire to protect his family and himself in the home. (Pl.'s SUMF \u00b6 14.) He was denied and subsequently submitted a challenge to the Pennsylvania State Police in January 2015. (Gov't's SUMF \u00b6 39.) In his challenge form, Williams checked the \"yes\" boxes when asked whether he had ever been arrested in Pennsylvania and, if so, whether the arrest resulted in a conviction. (Williams Dep., Ex. 6 at 2.) He wrote in the form, however, that his conviction was an ungraded misdemeanor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Williams has worked as a construction manager for the past twenty-five years. (Pl.'s SUMF \u00b6 11.) He has managed numerous projects, including the Curran-Fromhold Correctional Facility, the Pennsylvania Convention Center, the \"SEPTA Railworks Project,\" the Commodore Barry Bridge, and the Interstate 95 and New Jersey Transportation maintenance facilities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.) His job duties include the preparation of day-to-day monitoring of various construction projects in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware; attending project meetings on a monthly basis; and assisting contractors with cost control, project management, scheduling, and \"claims/time impact analysis as needed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Williams filed suit in this Court on June 1, 2017, contending that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional as applied to him pursuant to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Binderup v. Att'y Gen. U.S. of Am.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354472\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/336/\">\n    836 F.3d 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 2016) (en banc). On September 14, 2017, the Government filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. On October 13, 2017, Williams filed a motion for summary judgment. In a series of Orders dated December 1, 2017, the Court denied the Government's motion to dismiss and denied Williams' motion for summary judgment as premature. After a period of discovery, the instant Motions for Summary Judgment followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(a) states that summary judgment is proper \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

(Pl.'s Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 19.) He claims that his sentence of ninety days of passive house arrest was \"in essence, probation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Government contends that Williams' sentence of ninety days to two years of imprisonment was severe. In particular, the Government claims that Williams would have served ninety days in jail if not for his medical condition. (Gov't's Resp. Opp'n Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J. 11.) Additionally, the Government argues that the maximum sentence of two years of imprisonment is probative of the sentencing judge's determination that Williams' offense was serious. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Along with fines and other conditions, Williams was sentenced to ninety days to two years of imprisonment for his violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%203804\">\n    75 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 3804\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). We do not give much weight to the Government's characterization of Williams' sentence being two years, as the sentencing judge specifically noted that Williams was \"[t]o be paroled after completing the minimum sentence without further order of the court.\" (Gov't's Mem. Law Supp. Mot. Summ. J., Ex. C at MCP-000022.) That is, although the judge's split sentence gives a maximum two-year term of imprisonment, the judge effectively sentenced Williams to ninety days. Therefore, we believe ninety days is the relevant sentence term for our consideration of whether Williams' offense was \"serious.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   An added wrinkle is that the sentencing judge allowed Williams to serve the ninety days \"on passive house arrest until electronic monitoring [was] available due to [a] medical condition.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Williams contends his sentence of house arrest shows that the judge did not believe his offense was worthy of any jail time. (Pl.'s Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 19.) The Government, on the other hand, notes that Williams would have served his sentence in jail if not for his medical condition. (Gov't's Resp. Opp'n Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J. 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   We believe Williams' sentence falls in between the\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs' sentences and the\n   <em>\n    Holloway\n   </em>\n   plaintiff's sentence. The\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs respectively received probation and a suspended prison sentence, which the Third Circuit deemed to be \"minor\" due to the lack of jail time. The plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Holloway\n   </em>\n   received a term of actual imprisonment for ninety days with participation in the work release program, meaning he was actually confined to county jail except when he reported to work. Even assuming Williams' sentence of ninety days of house arrest (as opposed to ninety days of imprisonment, as the Government argues) is the operative sentence for the Court to consider, it is certainly more severe than the sentences the plaintiffs received in\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   . Because house arrest is a form of confinement, it seriously restricts an individual's liberty in a way that probation does not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McKenzie v. Att'y Gen. of U.S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4209281\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/452/88/#p90\">\n    452 F.

Pa. 2013) (stating that \"while house arrest is not a prison sentence\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   , it is considered 'confinement' \"). Therefore, we cannot agree with Williams' characterization that ninety days of house arrest is equivalent to probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Williams' sentence is, however, less severe than the plaintiff's sentence in\n   <em>\n    Holloway\n   </em>\n   , a sentence which the court found to be \"relatively minor.\" Nevertheless, we believe the severity of Williams' sentence leans slightly in favor of the Government. Although Williams was given the minimum sentence under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%203804\">\n    75 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 3804\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2), the sentence still restricted his liberty due to its custodial nature. We simply cannot overlook the fact that the Pennsylvania legislature deemed a second DUI at the highest rate of intoxication to be so serious as to mandate a minimum ninety-day term of confinement.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%203804\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because Williams, unlike the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   , received a custodial sentence for his second DUI at the highest rate of intoxication, this factor leans slightly in favor of the Government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The fourth and final factor requires the Court to look to whether there is a cross-jurisdictional consensus regarding the seriousness of Williams' offense. In\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   , one plaintiff was convicted of corrupting a minor, a crime that \"some states treated ... as serious crimes ... but the vast majority of states [did] not.\"\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354472\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/336/\">\n    836 F.3d at 352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Additionally, the conduct \"arguably would have been criminal in a few other states because his 17-year-old sexual partner was his employee, yet it still would have been legal in many states.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354472\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/336/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Regarding the other plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   , who was convicted of carrying a handgun without a license, the court noted that although \"some states punish the unlicensed carrying of a concealed weapon as a serious crime, more than half prescribe a maximum sentence that does not meet the threshold of a traditional felony (more than one year in prison) and others do not even require a specific credential to carry a concealed weapon.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354472\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/336/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   After consideration of the fifty-state surveys the parties have submitted in connection with their Motions, we believe Williams has easily met his burden regarding the cross-jurisdictional analysis. Although all states criminalize DUI, there is no clear consensus among the states regarding the seriousness of Williams' offense. For instance, a second DUI at the BAC that Williams had (.223%) would result in only eleven other states punishing his conduct by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year (the traditional threshold for a felony). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't's Mem. Law Supp. Mot. Summ. J., Ex. R (\"Gov't's DUI Chart\"); Pl.'s Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J., Ex. C (\"Pl.'s DUI Chart\").) Of those eleven states, four would classify the offense as a felony. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't's DUI Chart; Pl.'s DUI Chart.) Accordingly, given that Williams' conduct would meet the traditional definition of a felony in only eleven other states, he has shown that there is no consensus regarding the seriousness of his offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354472\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/336/\">\n    836 F.3d at 352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that one of the challengers' offense was not serious because\n   <em>\n    more than half of the states\n   </em>\n   would prescribe a maximum sentence that would not meet the traditional definition of a felony).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Government attempts to stretch this factor to include states whose maximum sentence for Williams' offense is prescribed at \"\n   <em>\n    approximately\n   </em>\n   one year or more.\" (Gov't's Resp. Opp'n Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J. 13) (emphasis added). The Government argues that 76% of states establish a maximum possible punishment for an offense like Williams' at \"about one year or more.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thus, the Government claims that 76% is clearly a consensus regarding the seriousness of the offense at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   We reject the Government's invitation to extend the cross-jurisdictional analysis to include offenses where the maximum possible punishment approaches one year. In setting forth this factor, the Third Circuit described the states criminalizing Julio Suarez's offense, noting that \"more than half prescribe a maximum sentence\n   that does not meet the threshold of a traditional felony.\"\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354472\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/336/\">\n    836 F. 3d at 352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, when assessing the cross-jurisdictional factor, it is appropriate for the Court to consider (1) the legality of the conduct in the various states, and (2) the number of states that prescribe a maximum sentence that meets the definition of a traditional felony (those offenses that are punishable by\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   than one year in prison).\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354472\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/336/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Third Circuit has set the barometer for the second consideration of this factor at the threshold of a traditional felony, and we do not accept the Government's argument to lower the bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   To summarize, Williams' offense was a misdemeanor, a label that is \"a state legislature's ... powerful expression of its belief that the offense is not serious enough to be disqualifying.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354472\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/336/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354472\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/336/\">\n    at 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although Williams was sentenced to a form of confinement for ninety days (a factor that weighs slightly in favor of the Government), violence was not an element of the offense. Significantly, Williams has provided evidence that only eleven other states would punish his conduct by more than one year in prison, necessitating in the conclusion that there is a general consensus of the nonserious nature of the offense. Despite the maximum punishment, Williams has thus carried his high burden of showing that his misdemeanor was not serious. Accordingly, he has distinguished himself from those persons historically excluded from the right to bear arms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Additional Arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Government makes the additional argument that Williams' post-conviction conduct makes him an \" 'unvirtuous citizen' who is no longer entitled to the Second Amendment's benefits.\" (Gov't's Mem. Law Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 17.) In particular, the Government points to Williams' admissions during his deposition that he continued to own firearms through 2014 and handled them during his employment at a gun store, a time in which he was federally prohibited from doing so; his answer of \"no\" on a Pennsylvania State Police firearms application, where he was asked whether he had been convicted of a crime punishable by over one year of imprisonment or a misdemeanor punishable by over two years of imprisonment; and his notation that he had been convicted of an ungraded misdemeanor when he challenged his eligibility to carry a firearm in 2015. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18.) This string of conduct, the Government contends, \"readily qualifies\" Williams \"as an 'unvirtuous citizen' who is not eligible for Second Amendment protection.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   We must reject the Government's argument, as the Third Circuit expressly stated that the only inquiry at step one of the\n   <em>\n    Marzzarella\n   </em>\n   framework is determining the seriousness of the disqualifying offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354472\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/336/\">\n    836 F.3d at 350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he seriousness of the purportedly disqualifying offense is our sole focus throughout\n   <em>\n    Marzzarella\n   </em>\n   's first step.\"),\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354472\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/336/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"[O]nly the seriousness of the purportedly disqualifying offense determines the constitutional sweep of statutes like \u00a7 922(g)(1) at step one.\"),\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354472\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/336/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 354 n.7 (\"[E]vidence of how individuals have lived their lives since committing crimes is irrelevant under\n   <em>\n    Marzzarella\n   </em>\n   's first step.\").

The last of these opinions is relevant for our purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Dr. Webster describes a study that Dr. Garen Wintemute led that is most relevant to the instant matter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In that study, Dr. Wintemute drew upon data from a random sample of 5,923 persons under the age of fifty \"who purchased a handgun from a licensed retail firearm dealer in California in 1977 and were stratified by whether or not the person had a prior adult (age 18 years and older) criminal history of any kind at the time the handgun was purchased.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In an effort to examine the relationship between prior alcohol-related convictions and the risk of future arrests for crimes involving violence and/or firearms, Dr. Wintemute and his colleagues limited their analysis to 1,272 handgun purchasers with prior alcohol-related convictions (77.8% of whom had DUI/DWI convictions) and 2,794 handgun purchasers with no prior criminal history. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Importantly, follow-up on the sample was done in 1991. Dr. Webster describes in his report that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   [t]he most relevant findings were the most straight-forward[:] 32.8% of handgun purchasers with prior alcohol convictions versus 5.8% of handgun purchasers\n   with no criminal history were arrested for a crime involving violence and/or firearms - a 5.6-fold difference. Those with a prior alcohol offense had a similar disproportionate risk for being arrested for the most serious crimes (FBI Index - murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault), 15.9% versus 2.7% among those with no record of prior offenses.... Regression analysis conducted to control for other risk factors and generate estimates of independent effects indicated that having a history of even a single prior conviction for an alcohol-related crime was associated with a 4-fold increased risk of being arrested for a crime of violence or firearm-related crime.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10.)

In\n   <em>\n    Holloway\n   </em>\n   , the court gave no weight to Dr. Webster's report.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Holloway\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528653\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/349/451/\">\n    349 F.

With respect to Dr. Webster's description of Dr. Wintemute and colleagues' study of California handgun purchasers in 1977 and follow-up in 1991, the court reasoned simply that \"[w]ithout questioning the validity of the study's methodology, we find that this study alone does not adequately establish a substantial fit between Holloway's disarmament and the government's compelling interest in preventing armed mayhem.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528653\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/349/451/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528653\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/349/451/\">\n    at 461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Third Circuit, however, expressly noted that \"[p]arties may use statistics to show that people who commit certain crimes have a high (or low) likelihood of recidivism that warrants (or does not warrant) disarmament, even decades after a conviction.\"\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354472\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/336/\">\n    836 F.3d at 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The problem with the empirical evidence in\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   was that the government's evidence did not contain reliable statistics that individuals with the plaintiffs' backgrounds were more likely \"to misuse firearms or were otherwise irresponsible or dangerous.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354472\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/336/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   We must respectfully disagree with\n   <em>\n    Holloway\n   </em>\n   and conclude that the Government has met its burden of intermediate scrutiny. Dr. Wintemute's study shows that, as compared to individuals with no prior criminal record, there is a significant statistical increase in the likelihood that an individual will be arrested for a crime involving a firearm or violence when that person has an alcohol-related conviction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Webster Report at 9) (citing Garen J. Wintemute et al.,\n   <em>\n    Firearms, Alcohol and Crime: Convictions for Driving Under the Influence (DUI) and Other Alcohol-Related Crimes and Risk for Future Criminal Activity Among Authorised Purchasers of Handguns\n   </em>\n   , Injury Prevention, Vol. 24 at 68-72 (2018) ). Indeed, the study found that 32.8% of handgun purchasers with a prior alcohol-related offense were arrested for a crime involving violence and/or a firearm, versus 5.8% of handgun purchasers with no prior criminal history. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) When regression\n   analysis was conducted to control for other risk factors, it showed that having a single prior conviction for an alcohol-related crime was associated with a four-fold increase in risk of being arrested for a crime of violence or firearm-related crime. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10.) Importantly, these statistics pertain to a fourteen-year period between the handgun purchase in 1977 and the follow-up in 1991.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Unlike the off-point empirical evidence presented in\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   , Williams falls squarely within Dr. Wintemute's study. For purposes of charging and sentencing, Williams' disqualifying offense was his second DUI. At the time he filed this action the conviction was only twelve years old, and it is not even fourteen years old as of the date of this Opinion. Dr. Wintemute's study shows that individuals like Williams, who have been convicted of an alcohol-related offense within the past fourteen years, have a four to five-fold increase of being arrested for a subsequent crime of violence or one involving a firearm. We believe such statistics demonstrate a reasonable fit between Williams' disarmament and the important government interest of preventing armed mayhem.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marzzarella\n   </em>\n   , 614 F.3d at 98 (noting that the \"fit between the challenged regulation and the asserted objective be reasonable, not perfect\"). Accordingly, the Government has carried its burden of demonstrating that \u00a7 922(g)(1) survives intermediate scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   While we have already determined that the Government has satisfied its burden of intermediate scrutiny, we must address some of the parties' additional arguments. First, Williams counters Dr. Webster's expert report with the expert opinion of Robert M. Gordon, Ph.D., ABPP, who is board certified in clinical psychology and psychoanalysis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Pl.'s Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 36-37, Ex. J (\"Dr. Gordon Report\") at 1.) Dr. Gordon performed an in-person clinical examination of Williams and ultimately recommends \"that Mr. Williams be allowed to own, possess, carry, and use a firearm\" and can do so \"without risk to himself or any other person.\" (Dr. Gordon Report at 12.) Dr. Gordon also takes issue with Dr. Webster's expert report, noting that \"[w]hile Dr. Webster presents some valid correlational research on groupings of individuals, it has a relatively small predictive value in generalizing to groups\" and fails to predict the effect of numerous DUI convictions from fourteen to eighteen years ago. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) Dr. Gordon also takes issue with,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , some of Dr. Webster's report being premised on individuals who suffer from alcohol or abuse issues, as there is no evidence Williams suffers from any kind of dependency. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   We reject Dr. Gordon's opinion that Williams should be allowed to own, carry, and possess a firearm because he allegedly poses no risk to himself or others. The Government's burden at step two of the\n   <em>\n    Marzzarella\n   </em>\n   framework is not individualistic, but rather focuses on whether the Government\n   can dispossess a class of people who have been convicted of certain crimes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354472\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/336/\">\n    836 F.3d at 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that the \"[p]arties may use statistics to show that\n   <em>\n    people who commit certain crimes\n   </em>\n   have a high (or low) likelihood of recidivism that warrants (or does not warrant) disarmament....\" and that empirical studies could demonstrate an appropriate fit between the plaintiffs' disarmament and the promotion of public safety \"if they contained reliable statistical evidence that\n   <em>\n    people with the [plaintiffs'] backgrounds\n   </em>\n   were more likely to misuse firearms or were otherwise irresponsible or dangerous\") (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Skoien\n   </em>\n   , 614 F.3d at 641 (\"[S]ome categorical disqualifications are permissible: Congress is not limited to case-by-case exclusions of persons who have been shown to be untrustworthy with weapons, nor need these limits be established by evidence presented in court.\"). And while Dr. Gordon takes issue with some aspects of Dr. Webster's report, he in no way undermines the empirical evidence that individuals with alcohol-related convictions have a four to five-fold increase of being arrested for a crime of violence or firearm-related offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Williams also argues that the Government's prior history of granting relief from federal firearms disabilities undermines the Government's argument at step two of the\n   <em>\n    Marzzarella\n   </em>\n   framework.

Williams points to four individuals granted relief under \u00a7 925(c) who were convicted of crimes that he alleges were similar or more serious than his disqualifying offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Under \u00a7 925(c), federal law allows an individual to make an application to the Attorney General for relief from a federal firearm disability, which is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. However, examples of people who were granted relief under \u00a7 925(c) prior to its defunding are inapposite because, as we explained above,\n   <em>\n    Marzzarella\n   </em>\n   's second prong does not call for an individualized assessment. While Williams might succeed in an application to the Attorney General under \u00a7 925(c) if Congress were to fund it, the fact remains that such evidence plays no role in the analysis that\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   requires. Indeed, the argument Williams presents here is identical to the plaintiff's argument in\n   <em>\n    Holloway\n   </em>\n   , which the court found unpersuasive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Holloway\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528653\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/349/451/\">\n    349 F.Supp.3d at 462\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the examples of individuals who were granted relief under \u00a7 925(c) are irrelevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   We next move to the Government's additional argument concerning part two of the\n   <em>\n    Marzzarella\n   </em>\n   framework. The Government stresses that it satisfies intermediate scrutiny in this case, even in the absence of statistical evidence, because there is evidence in the record that Williams \"\n   <em>\n    has already\n   </em>\n   been engaging in crimes and has been irresponsible since his 2004 DUI conviction.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Gov't's Mem. Law Supp. Mot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Summ. J. 20) (emphasis in original). In\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   , the Third Circuit stated that step two looks to the \"likelihood that the [plaintiff] will commit crimes in the future,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354472\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/336/\">\n    836 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   354 n.7, or whether the plaintiff \"[is] more likely to misuse firearms or [is] otherwise irresponsible or dangerous,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354472\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/336/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354472\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/336/\">\n    at 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Government once again points to the fact that Williams continued to own and possess firearms in his personal and employment capacities when he was federally prohibited from doing so; and allegedly made false representations on a 2007 application to purchase a firearm and a 2015 challenge to a denial of his eligibility to carry a firearm. (Gov't's Mem. Law Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 20-21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Several reasons give the Court concern in considering the Government's argument about Williams' conduct after his disqualifying conviction. First, the Government essentially asks the Court to find criminality in this civil matter. Williams has not been convicted of any charges due to the aforementioned conduct, nor do the parties represent that he has been charged. Thus, it would be inappropriate and unwise for the Court to find criminality in the absence of a criminal adjudicative process. Second,\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   itself lends support for the principle that post-disqualifying convictions, which lack violence or are not firearm-related, play no role in\n   <em>\n    Marzzarella\n   </em>\n   's second step. One of the\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs was convicted of unlawfully carrying a handgun without a license, a disqualifying offense under \u00a7 922(g)(1).\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354472\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/336/\">\n    836 F.3d at 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Eight years later he was convicted of DUI, but that offense was not disqualifying.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354472\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/336/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In detailing the analysis of part two of the\n   <em>\n    Marzzarella\n   </em>\n   framework, the Third Circuit neglected to even mention the subsequent DUI conviction; it played absolutely no role in the court's reasoning. Accordingly, even if Williams had non-disqualifying convictions after his disqualifying offense, it appears consideration of them would be misplaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Section 922(g)(1) is constitutional as applied to Williams. While we find that \u00a7 922(g)(1) burdens Williams' Second Amendment rights because his disqualifying conviction was not \"serious,\" the law is constitutional as applied because the Government has satisfied its burden of intermediate scrutiny. The statistical evidence shows that individuals convicted of an alcohol-related offense have a four to five-fold increase of being arrested for a crime of violence or firearm-related offense, as compared to individuals with no prior criminal history. Therefore, we believe there is a reasonable fit between disarming individuals like Williams, who were convicted of DUI, and the important government interest of preventing armed mayhem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   For the reasons noted above, the Government's Motion for Summary Judgment is granted, and Williams' Motion for Summary Judgment is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   An appropriate Order follows.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 25(d), we have substituted the current Attorney General of the United States, William P.
