Thus, claim 1 requires the performance of the same basic process as claim 2, namely, broadcasting inquiry messages and then adding an additional polling data field to the inquiry messages. Likewise, claim 8 discloses the receipt of an inquiry message with \"an additional data field for polling at least one secondary station.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8:21-22. Therefore, claim 1 requires the performance of the same basic process as claim 8 because claims 1 and 8 both claim appending an additional polling data field on an inquiry message. Moreover, claim 11 also claims \"adding to an inquiry message ... an additional data field for polling at least one secondary station.\" For the same reasons stated above, claims 1 and 11 perform the same basic process of adding an additional polling field onto an inquiry message.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that claims 1 and 8 through 12 cannot be represented by claim 2 because claims 1 and 8 through 12 include the limitation: \"means are provided for determining when an additional data field has been added ... for determining whether [a secondary station] has been polled from the additional data field and for responding to a poll when it has data for transmission.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8:23-27; Opp. at 5. This purported distinction can be simplified to requiring\n   <em>\n    additional\n   </em>\n   polling data.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , '049 Patent at 7:37-40 (\"[D]etermining when an\n   <em>\n    additional data field\n   </em>\n   has been added ... [and] determining whether [a secondary station] has been polled from the\n   <em>\n    additional data field.\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added)). This \"additional polling\" limitation found in claims 1 and 8 through 12 is a distinction without a difference from claim 2's polling limitation. Claim 2's polling limitation already captures the additional polling in claims 1 and 8 through 12 because claim 2 already provides for adding additional polling data to the inquiry message.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7:43-48 (\"[M]eans are provided ... for adding to each inquiry message prior to transmission an\n   <em>\n    additional data field\n   </em>\n   for polling.\" (emphasis added)). Thus, the polling disclosed in claim 2 performs the same basic\n   process as the polling in claims 1 and 8 through 12. There is nothing in the claim language of claims 1 and 8 through 12 that sets apart the type of additional polling that happens in claim 2 from the\n   <em>\n    additional\n   </em>\n   polling in claims 1 and 8 through 12.

Claim 2 describes the purported invention in broad, generic, functional terms but fails to identify\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   those ends are achieved, with the specification being no clearer. Moreover, claim 2 is not directed to a specific improvement to conventional or generic Bluetooth technology. For instance, the mechanism claimed in the Patent is sending inquiry messages containing a polling data field, '049 Patent at 4:15-20, and the Patent admits that the claimed \"mechanism is entirely compatible with\n   <em>\n    conventional\n   </em>\n   Bluetooth systems,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4:19-20 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   First, there is no question that the primary and secondary stations disclosed in claim 2 are generic, conventional computing devices. According to the specification, the \"present invention relates to a communication system and further relates to primary and secondary stations for use in such a system.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1:3-5. A primary station, as disclosed in the abstract, is a master station in a piconet.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at abstract, Fig. 1. A secondary station, as disclosed in the abstract, is the same as a slave station in a piconet.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As the specification explicitly admits, communication stations in a prototypical Bluetooth network \"form ad-hoc networks which are known as piconets, each comprising a master station and up to seven slave stations. All stations are identical and capable of acting as master or slave as required.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1:19-24. The specification describes potential slave stations as \"Human/machine Interface Device[s] (HID) ... such as a keyboard, mouse, games controller, graphics pad or the like.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1:29-31. Nowhere in the Patent does the patentee describe a specialized keyboard, mouse, games controller, or graphics pad that performs any operation beyond that of their ordinary use in technology. Thus, a primary or secondary station merely consists of a generic computing device.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Moreover, claim 2 discloses that a generic computing device has means for broadcasting inquiry messages in the form of a plurality of predetermined data fields. It is conventional under Bluetooth protocols that the generic computing slave station has the means of joining a piconet through \"[i]nquiry[, which] allows a would-be slave to find a base station and issue a request to join the piconet.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1:56-57;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4:11-13 (\"The Bluetooth inquiry procedure allows a would-be slave 101 to find a base station and issue a request to join its piconet\"). Communications between stations occur via the exchange of data \"packets\" over a wireless channel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5:19-20. The specification explains that when \"a Bluetooth unit wants to discover other Bluetooth devices, it enters a so-called inquiry substate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4:23-25. It is during this standard Bluetooth inquiry substate that the primary station \"issues an inquiry message containing a General Inquiry Access Code (GIAC) or a number of optional Dedicated Inquiry Access Codes (DIAC).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4:25. Thus, the inquiry message comprises data fields-the General Inquiry Access Code or Dedicated Inquiry Access Codes-which the Patent does not claim to have invented.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Additionally, Defendants argue, and the Plaintiffs and the Patent concede, that the Patent did not invent the process of broadcasting inquiry messages, or the inquiry messages themselves.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3:30-31 (\"A basic Bluetooth network configuration is illustrated in FIG. 1.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5:12-14 (\"The presence of the extra data field 504 means that the ... space\n   <em>\n    conventionally allowed\n   </em>\n   at the end of a Bluetooth inquiry packet is reduced.\" (emphasis added));\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5:19-20 (\"The\n   <em>\n    standard\n   </em>\n   inquiry packet is an ID packet ... of length 68 bits.\" (emphasis added)); Opp. at 4 (\"The patent described ... a Bluetooth ad hoc network, circa 2000 ....

In other words, the Patent \"recognized that it is possible to piggy-back a broadcast channel on the inquiry messages issued by the master 100. The broadcast channel can be used to poll HIDs at regular intervals.\" '049 Patent at 4:15-18. However, \"piggy-backing\" polling data onto a conventional inquiry message is abstract. Per claim 2, \"means are provided for broadcasting a series of [conventional] inquiry messages, each in the form of a plurality of predetermined data fields.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7:43-45. The process of \"piggy-backing\" polling data onto a conventional inquiry message is therefore a conventional concept because in claim 2, the data inquiry message is already comprised of \"a plurality of predetermined data fields.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Adding an\n   <em>\n    additional\n   </em>\n   data field for polling a secondary station is no different than what is already claimed-a plurality\n   of data fields that comprise the inquiry message. After all, it is \"no less abstract to refer to two [data] packets as it is to refer to one, and a new idea is equally capable of abstraction as an old one.\"\n   <em>\n    Intellectual Ventures II LLC v. JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%201941331\">\n    2015 WL 1941331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 28, 2015). In addition, the Patent specification admits that \"the\n   <em>\n    general invention concept\n   </em>\n   of polling HIDs via a broadcast channel used as part of the inquiry procedure is not restricted to Bluetooth devices and is applicable to other communications arrangements.\" '049 Patent at 3:24-28 (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3:22-24 (\"In the following description we consider particularly a system which utilises [sic] Bluetooth protocols for communication of messages between stations.\"). Moreover, Plaintiffs admit in their opposition that interoperability with conventional Bluetooth functionality was maintained by \" 'appending' to the inquiry message format\n   <em>\n    instead of changing\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    the inquiry message format\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    from the ground up.\n   </em>\n   \" Opp. at 6 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Furthermore, adding an additional data field for polling is no different than what the Court has already determined to be conventional computing activity, namely, sending an inquiry message comprising a \"plurality of predetermined data fields.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7:43-45. In other words, adding an additional polling data field to the data fields already present in the inquiry message is a more specific form of a generic implementation of the inquiry message. Under Federal Circuit law, \"a claim is not patent eligible merely because it applies an abstract idea in a narrow way.\"\n   <em>\n    BSG Tech LLC v.

Here, existing data in the form of a plurality of data fields that comprise the inquiry message is combined with another data set-the additional data field for polling secondary stations-thus organizing the inquiry message in a new form that contains the polling data.

For instance, in discussing \"communication link[s] supported in a [typical] Bluetooth network,\" '049 Patent at 1:40-41, the Patent reveals that the \"slave has to be polled before it can submit a request to leave park mode and become active,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1:40-49, and that the \"[i]nquiry [process] allows a would-be slave to find a base station and issue a request to join the piconet,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1:54-57. Also, the transmission of the inquiry message and method of polling a would-be slave is performed on generic Bluetooth hardware.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3:57-4:10, Fig. 2. Thus, the Patent recites the abstract idea of adding polling data to an inquiry message performed on generic Bluetooth hardware. The '049 Patent fails to show that arrangement of these elements in claim 2 is anything but the conventional arrangement of elements in a typical Bluetooth network.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at Fig. 1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3:30-31 (\"A basic Bluetooth network configuration is illustrated in FIG. 1.\"). As aforementioned, the inquiry process of a typical Bluetooth network requires sending out inquiry messages, and it is conventional Bluetooth protocol that a would-be slave has to be polled before it can become active.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Plaintiff's opposition argues that there are many advantages of the '049 Patent, such as conserving HID battery power and speeding up the process of connecting to a master. Opp. at 4. The United States Supreme Court has held that \"[g]roundbreaking, innovative, or even brilliant discovery does not by itself satisfy the \u00a7 101 inquiry.\n   <em>\n    Ass'n for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697061\" index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/576/#p591\">\n    569 U.S. 576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 591,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697061\" index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/576/#p591\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697061\" index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/576/#p591\">\n    186 L.Ed.2d 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013). In addition, the Federal Circuit has held that \"a patent could not be granted for 'mere naked discovery.' \"\n   <em>\n    In re Beineke\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3504479\" index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/690/1344/#p1349\">\n    690 F.3d 1344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1349 (Fed. Cir. 2012). Thus, simply because Plaintiff claims that the '049 Patent has advantages over the prior art does not render the Patent valid. In light of all the evidence from the\n   '049 Patent that the claimed elements are generic, and the fact that appending a polling inquiry to an inquiry message fails to lift the Patent out of abstractness, Plaintiff's attorney arguments explaining why the Patent features constitute improvements on older technology does not mean that the \u00a7 101 inquiry is met. Furthermore, under Federal Circuit law, the\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   inquiry must focus on the\n   <em>\n    claim language\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Accenture Global Services, GmbH v.

These advantages are not recited in the claim language itself. Thus, the advantages Plaintiff cites to are irrelevant to the\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   inquiry. Therefore, claim 2 of the '049 Patent does not contain an inventive concept.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   As stated above, the Court finds that at\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   step one, claim 2 of the '049 Patent is directed to an abstract idea. At\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   step two, there is no inventive concept sufficient to save the claim. Thus, the Court concludes that the '049 Patent is directed to unpatentable subject matter under \u00a7 101.

However, there are no\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   factual allegations or references to the '049 Patent specification-which might disclose that the invention is an improvement over the prior art-that undergird Plaintiffs' purported fact questions found in Plaintiffs' complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Uniloc USA, Inc. v.

The\n   <em>\n    Uniloc\n   </em>\n   court reasoned that\n   the plaintiff was attempting to \"manufacture a factual question\" by relying on attorney arguments.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"226\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202287675\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, the situation is analogous to that in\n   <em>\n    Uniloc\n   </em>\n   ; Plaintiff's attorney arguments in the second amended complaint do not create a factual dispute precluding disposition of the instant case on a Rule 12 motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Likewise, the\n   <em>\n    Cellspin Soft, Inc. v.

Cal. 2018). Here, Plaintiff's brief and second amended complaint have also failed to transform ideas in the '049 Patent -such as the primary and secondary Bluetooth stations or the inquiry message-into non-generic, inventive concepts. As the Court found above, all such ideas found in the Patent are generic. Therefore, no factual dispute exists that would preclude this Court from finding the '049 Patent invalid based on a Rule 12 motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Furthermore, a genuine dispute of material fact \"requires more than labels and conclusions.\"\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   , 550 U.S. at 555,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, Plaintiffs' second amended complaint features nothing but conclusions by, for instance, calling the '049 Patent \"novel and inventive.\" ECF No. 77 at \u00b6 10. There is no support for such a conclusion in Plaintiffs' second amended complaint. The statement is merely an unsubstantiated conclusion.
