Most relevant here, Section 404 of the First Step Act makes retroactive certain provisions of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (hereinafter \"Fair Sentencing Act\") and empowers district courts to \"impose a reduced sentence\" as if the Fair Sentencing Act had been in effect at the time of the defendant's offense. Under the First Step Act, the district court must first determine a defendant's eligibility for relief and then decide whether a reduced sentence is appropriate. What the district court may appropriately consider when imposing a reduced\n   sentence presents an unsettled question of law. This Court concludes that both Defendants are eligible for relief under the First Step Act and that the Court may appropriately consider post-sentencing factual developments using the framework established in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Had the Fair Sentencing Act been in effect at the time Defendants' sentences were imposed, 50 grams of crack cocaine-the amount for which the jury found each Defendant responsible beyond a reasonable doubt-would have triggered the 5-year minimum, rather than the 10-year minimum.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   That five-year minimum would also have been doubled for these Defendants because they both had a prior felony drug conviction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A)-(B). Thus, for the drug conspiracy count, had Defendants been sentenced after the enactment of the Fair Sentencing Act, their mandatory minimum sentence would have been 10 years, rather than 20. Because the five-year mandatory consecutive sentence for the weapons count would have remained unchanged, Defendants would have faced an aggregate minimum of 15 years under the Fair Sentencing Act, as opposed to 25 years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 2018, Congress passed the First Step Act, which made retroactive the crack cocaine minimums in the Fair Sentencing Act. Pub. L. No. 115-391, \u00a7 404,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=132%20Stat.%205194\">\n    132 Stat. 5194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 5222 (2018). District courts across the country, including within this circuit, have been divided as to defendants' eligibility for relief and the exact nature of the proceedings that sentencing judges should be conducting pursuant to the now-retroactive Fair Sentencing Act, including whether district courts may consider facts that have occurred post-sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendants Rose and Robinson, both of whom are still incarcerated based on their sentences in this case, seek reduced sentences of time served. After Rose filed his motion for relief, the Government initially agreed that he was eligible for a reduced sentence, although it argued that he should not receive any relief because of his post-sentencing disciplinary record. Dkt. 390. Soon thereafter, the Government reversed its position and now argues that Defendants are not eligible for relief because their offense conduct involved more than 1.5 kilograms of crack cocaine.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Section 2 of the Fair Sentencing Act increased the threshold quantities of crack cocaine necessary to trigger mandatory minimum sentences under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). Pursuant to \u00a7 404(b) of the First Step Act, \"[a] court that imposed a sentence for a covered offense may ... impose a reduced sentence as if section[ ] 2 ... of the Fair Sentencing Act ... were in effect at the time the covered offense was committed.\" Section 404(a) defines \"covered offense\" as \"a violation of a Federal criminal statute, the statutory penalties for which were modified by section 2 or 3 of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, that was committed before August 3, 2010.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The parties disagree as to Defendants' eligibility for relief under \u00a7 404(a) but agree that, as to any eligible defendant, this Court should consider factual developments that occurred after the defendant's original sentencing, including post-sentencing disciplinary records and evidence of rehabilitation. As elaborated below, the Court concludes that both Defendants are eligible for relief under the First Step Act and that the Court may appropriately consider\n   all relevant facts as of the date a reduced sentence is imposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Eligibility\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendants are eligible to seek relief under \u00a7 404 of the First Step Act because the penalties associated with their statute of conviction were among those amended by the Fair Sentencing Act. The Government argues that the Court should assess eligibility on the basis of Defendants' actual conduct, rather than the statute of conviction. Under that approach, because Judge Scheindlin found by a preponderance of the evidence that Defendants were responsible for 1.5 kilograms of crack cocaine, an amount which exceeds the revised 280-gram threshold, the \"statutory penalties\" for Defendants' conduct were not \"modified\" by the Fair Sentencing Act. The Government's approach misreads the text of the First Step Act, undermines the purpose of the Act, and is inconsistent with the decisions of the vast majority of courts that have decided this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Government's reading of \u00a7 404(a) depends on two erroneous interpretative choices. First, the Government construes the dependent clause, \"the statutory penalties for which were modified by section 2 or 3 of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010\" (hereinafter \"penalties clause\"), as modifying the noun \"violation,\" rather than modifying the phrase \"Federal criminal statute.\" Next, the Government construes \"violation\" to mean the actual conduct underlying the offense, rather than the elements of the offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   When given its most natural reading, the \"penalties\" clause modifies the adjacent noun phrase, \"Federal criminal statute.\" As a general principle, courts interpret the text of criminal statutes in a manner consist with \"ordinary English grammar\" and rules of usage.\n   <em>\n    Flores-Figueroa v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653462\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/646/#p650\">\n    556 U.S. 646\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 650, 652,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653462\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/646/#p650\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1886\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653462\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/646/#p650\">\n    173 L.Ed.2d 853\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). One such rule is that a modifier is presumed to apply to the noun or pronoun closest to it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lopez v.

Here, the \"penalties\" clause is most naturally read as modifying \"Federal criminal statute,\" the noun phrase immediately next to it.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4032210\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/729/1012/#p1014\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Indeed, Congress appears to have deliberately inserted \"Federal criminal statute\" after the word \"violation\" and added the word \"statutory\" before the word \"penalties\" to achieve this exact result. If the Government's interpretation were correct, Congress could have straightforwardly legislated that result by omitting from \u00a7 404(a) the phrase \"Federal criminal statute,\" which is already implied by the reference to the Fair Sentencing Act, and the adjective \"statutory\" before the noun \"penalties.\" Section 404(a) would then have read: \"the term 'covered offense' means a violation, the penalties for which were modified by section 2 or 3 of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010.\" But that is not what Congress did. Instead, it inserted two otherwise unnecessary references to federal statutes, making clear that eligibility is determined by the statute(s) underlying the defendant's conviction and penalty, not the defendant's offense conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Martin\n   </em>\n   , No. 03-CR-795,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%201558817\">\n    2019 WL 1558817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (E.D.N.Y.

That ambiguity must be resolved in the defendant's favor. Both the Fair Sentencing Act and the First Step Act have the remedial purpose of mitigating the unfairness created by the crack-to-powder cocaine ratio, and the statutes should be construed in favor of broader coverage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Court further notes that the Government's interpretation would dramatically curtail the reach of the First Step Act, limiting eligibility for relief to the narrow class of defendants who were found responsible for distributing more than 50 grams but less than 280 grams of crack cocaine.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Construing \u00a7 404(a) in favor of broader eligibility would also be consistent with the rule of lenity, which is of particular concern here because of the potential unfairness of using offense conduct to exclude defendants from eligibility.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%201877072\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    United States v.

For each of those scenarios, \u00a7 3582(c) specifically directs the sentencing court to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors before ruling on the motion for a reduction. Apart from those three circumstances, Section 3582(c)(1)(B), which some courts have characterized as the \"procedural vehicle\" for First Step Act motions, allows for modifications \"to the extent otherwise expressly permitted by statute or by Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\"\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Unlike the other three sentence modification provisions, however, \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B) merely redirects courts to Rule 35 and any other sources of authority that may exist, without providing any substantive standard of its own.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The principle set forth in\n   <em>\n    Pepper\n   </em>\n   and \u00a7 3661 requires that the district court be able to consider the most recent evidence of a defendant's life and characteristics, which may be the most probative information available, when deciding whether a defendant should continue to be\n   incarcerated or, in some cases, be immediately released.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   While\n   <em>\n    Pepper\n   </em>\n   pertained to the imposition of a new sentence on remand, it is notable that \u00a7 404(b), the operative clause of the First Step Act, uses the construction \"impose a reduced sentence,\" rather than merely \"reduce\" or \"modify.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Section 3553(a) is triggered whenever a district court \"impose[s] a sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (\"The court, in determining the particular sentence to be imposed, shall consider ....\"), 3582(a) (\"The court, in determining whether to impose a term of imprisonment, and, if a term of imprisonment is to be imposed, in determining the length of the term, shall consider the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable.\"). The context surrounding the use of the verb \"impose\" in the First Step Act suggests that the word-choice was not accidental. Indeed, the single sentence that is \u00a7 404(b) uses the verb \"impose\" twice. The first part of \u00a7 404(b) is unequivocal that any motion for relief must be considered by the \"court that imposed a sentence for a covered offense.\" In that instance, \"imposed\" undoubtedly refers to the imposition of the original sentence, rather than any modification or reduction. Therefore, in order to construe \u00a7 404(b) as falling beyond the reach of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), the Court would have to give two different meanings to the verb \"impose\" within the same sentence. Given the proximity of the repetition, the strength of the interpretative principle that \"identical words and phrases within the same statute should normally be given the same meaning\" is at its zenith.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    FCC v.

While the restriction on the district court's ability to impose a lengthier sentence could be a relevant factor, the nature of a sentencing cannot be dictated solely by a statutory limit on the sentencing range. Rather, federal criminal statutes almost invariably contain statutory maximums (and occasionally mandatory minimums) that constrain judicial discretion without divesting a sentencing proceeding of its plenary nature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Moreover, even if consideration of \u00a7 3553(a) factors is not expressly required by the First Step Act, the Court concludes that it is appropriate to use that familiar framework to guide the exercise of discretion conferred by the First Step Act. Importing the standard set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) makes sentencing proceedings\n   under the First Step Act more predictable to the parties, more straightforward for district courts, and more consistently reviewable on appeal. It is unlikely that Congress intended to give district courts unbounded or unreviewable discretion to grant or deny relief, and if \u00a7 3553(a) did not apply, then courts would have to develop new and untried standards to limit judicial discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Christie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3725623\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/736/191/#p196\">\n    736 F.3d 191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 196 (2d Cir. 2013) (\"[T]he need for at least some statement of reasons is fully applicable in the context of a motion for a sentence reduction. Like the initial sentencing decision, resolution of a sentence reduction motion is a discretionary decision regarding the defendant's fundamental liberty interests, which is subject to appellate review.\"). Rather, the more likely scenario is that Congress intended district courts to apply, by default, existing sentencing standards when exercising their discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The application of \u00a7 3553(a) factors to current facts is also more manageable than the alternative, which would require the current sentencing court to reconstruct the original record and to imagine what the original judge would have done had he or she not been bound by the then-applicable mandatory minimum sentence. First, given the length of the sentences at issue in crack-cocaine cases, there is a high degree of likelihood that many of the judges considering the First Step Act motion will not be the original sentencing judge.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%201558817\">\n    2019 WL 1558817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4. The court would, therefore, have to predict how another judge would have ruled more than a decade ago, which may be impossible to do depending on the level of detail in the previous judge's explanation of the original sentence. Second, given the passage of time and changes to record retention methods, the current court may have difficulties re-creating the exact record that was before the original judge. Third, because the original sentences in these cases were largely dictated by the high mandatory minimums, defense counsel may have prioritized or raised different arguments than he or she would have if the defendant had been subject to a lower mandatory minimum sentence or no mandatory minimum at all. In other words, the frozen-in-time approach would require a district court to exercise discretion based on a record that was not created with the current statutory framework in mind.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Pepper\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court considered the fairness\n   <em>\n    vel non\n   </em>\n   of allowing defendants to benefit from renewed consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. In that case, the Supreme Court acknowledged that consideration of post-sentencing rehabilitation \"may result in disparate treatment\" between defendants who receive reconsideration during resentencing and defendants who are only sentenced once. 562 U.S. at 502,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457265,6023823\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/476/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nevertheless, the Supreme Court discounted the significance of that disparity because the disparity did not arise arbitrarily but as a product of \"the ordinary operation of appellate sentencing review.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457265,6023823\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/476/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, to the extent that there is any disparity, it arises from Congress's decision to pass a law that affects only a subset of incarcerated persons. Additionally, consideration of post-sentencing evidence does not always benefit the defendant, as the sentencing court could also consider evidence of bad acts occurring after the defendant was originally sentenced. As such, there is nothing inherently inequitable about considering the full range of the defendant's history and characteristics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   For those reasons, the Court holds that consideration of post-sentencing factual developments is appropriate under \u00a7 404 of the First Step Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Defendants' Motions for Relief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Having determined that Defendants are eligible for relief and having\n   defined the scope of this Court's consideration, all that remains is a decision on the merits of Defendants' motions for relief pursuant to \u00a7 404 of the First Step Act. For the reasons stated at Mr. Rose's hearing on May 13, 2019, in light of his abysmal prison disciplinary record, the Court is holding Mr. Rose's motion in abeyance until September 19, 2019, when Mr. Rose is due to re-appear before this Court. Dkt. 408. As to Mr. Robinson, for the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that he should be sentenced to time served, which, as of the date of this Order, is the equivalent of 15 years, four months, and three days, plus a reasonable number of days (not to exceed ten) needed by the Bureau of Prisons to process his release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Mr. Robinson argues that his imprisonment for the past fifteen-plus years is sufficient punishment for his offenses. Dkt. 409. Defense counsel notes that Mr. Robinson was only 18 when the drug conspiracy began and only 23 when arrested as a relatively low-level (albeit prolific) drug dealer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. Mr. Robinson has now spent the vast majority of his adult life behind bars. While Mr. Robinson has incurred a number of disciplinary infractions, he has incurred none in more than two years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. The Government also acknowledges that most of Mr. Robinson's infractions \"do not appear to be particularly serious\" or violent. Dkt. 412 at 3. Meanwhile, Mr. Robinson has completed courses in real estate, writing, and other subjects and has developed job skills by working in food service and on other job assignments. Dkt. 409 at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Government's only argument against granting relief is that, had the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 been in effect in 2005, the Government \"undoubtedly ... would have charged [Mr. Robinson] with 280 grams of crack, and the jury would have found him responsible\" for over 280 grams of crack cocaine. Dkt. 400 at 5. The Court cannot simply assume that the Government would have been successful in proving an indispensable element of a criminal offense. Moreover, the Government in this case had charged the defendants with conspiring to distribute 1.5 kilograms of crack cocaine, before filing a superseding indictment that charged defendants with conspiracy to distribute only 50 grams.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 82 at 14\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 109 at 3. While the Government can argue that a change in quantity would not have made a difference at trial, one could also hypothesize that the Government did not proceed to trial on a larger quantity because proving a larger quantity would have been more difficult-which is further illustration that historical revisionism is an inappropriate judicial exercise. Granting relief here does not, as the Government contends, create \"unwarranted sentencing disparities,\" Dkt. 400 at 5, because the comparison group consists of other defendants charged with and convicted of distributing or conspiring to distribute 50 grams or more of crack cocaine. Whatever \"disparity\" that results is the remedy that Congress intended when it passed the First Step Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   After reviewing all of the relevant facts in this case, including Mr. Robinson's original and supplemental presentence reports and the parties' submissions, including Mr. Robinson's letter to the Court and the most recent disciplinary, employment, and education records from the Bureau of Prisons, and considering all of the relevant factors set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), the Court finds that an aggregate sentence of time served, amounting to 184 months and three days, plus a reasonable number of days (not to exceed ten) needed by the Bureau of Prisons to process his release, is sufficient and not longer than necessary to achieve the goals of sentencing for Mr. Robinson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Defendant Junior Robinson's motion for a reduced sentence of time served is GRANTED pursuant to \u00a7 404(b) of the First Step Act. The Bureau of Prisons is authorized to delay execution of this Order for up to ten days after its issuance so that the Bureau may make necessary arrangements related to Mr. Robinson's release. The Bureau of Prisons is directed to proceed as expeditiously as possible so as to avoid any unnecessary delay. An amended judgment shall issue forthwith.

Indeed, offenders who are subject to a mandatory minimum sentence, which is most commonly associated with controlled substance offenses, are the \"most likely to receive a non-government sponsored below range sentence.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 11, 47.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Recent statistics show that, in the Southern District of New York, only 21% of defendants in drug trafficking cases receive a sentence that is within or above guideline range; nationally, that figure is higher, but is still only 35%.

Thus, for the vast majority of defendants in drug-trafficking cases, and particularly for those in this district, the Guideline range does not appear to have a significant impact on the eventual sentence. Accordingly, defendants have relatively little incentive to dispute the Government's position regarding the quantity of drugs for which the defendant is responsible and much greater incentive to focus their sentencing arguments on mitigating factors that will result in a sentence as close to the mandatory minimum as possible.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    Some courts have held that the district court's authority under the First Step Act should be narrowly construed because of the language in \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B), which allows modifications to the extent \"expressly permitted by statute.\"\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Applying what would effectively be a clear-statement rule, one could argue that the First Step Act does not authorize consideration of \u00a7 3553(a) factors because \u00a7 404 does not specifically reference \u00a7 3553(a). That reading of \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B), however, is more restrictive than the Second Circuit's interpretation. According to the Second Circuit, \"[r]ather than mandating the use of explicit terms like 'resentencing' or 'correction of a sentence' before a term of imprisonment can be modified, \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B) [should] be read as requiring only that a statute contain an express grant of remedial power, and that this power be broad enough to permit the resentencing in question.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Triestman\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"577829\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/178/624/#p629\">\n     178 F.3d at 629\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
