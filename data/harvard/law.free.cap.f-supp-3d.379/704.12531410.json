For the reasons set forth below, Defendant's motion for summary judgment [43] is granted. Plaintiff is given until April 29, 2019 to file materials relating to the viability of his retaliation claim, as discussed below. Plaintiff's failure to file these materials by that date will result summary judgment being granted in favor of Defendant on Plaintiff's retaliation claim and this civil case being terminated. Defendant is given until May 27, 2019 to file a response to any materials that Plaintiff may file. The Court will set this case for further status hearing after reviewing any materials submitted on the briefing schedule above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant Maryville Academy is a not-for-profit child welfare agency that runs private shelter and residential programs for children and teenagers in Des Plaines, Illinois. [46 (Def.'s Stmt. of Facts), at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 37.] The programs are staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37.]\n   <em>\n    Pro se\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Kahn Dockery was an employee of Defendant. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 1.] After Plaintiff moved back to Chicago from Tennessee in July 2011, he was rehired by Defendant (who previously employed Plaintiff before he moved to Tennessee) as a youth care worker. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2.] When Plaintiff was rehired in July 2011, Plaintiff identified himself as a \"Jew\" on his employee information sheet. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24.] Plaintiff's initial schedule required that he work every other weekend, which Plaintiff testified included Saturday and Sunday. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 3, 5.] Plaintiff's shift was 2:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. [46-1 (Pl.'s Dep. Tr.), at 18:1-5.] During that period, Plaintiff did not indicate that it was against his religion to work weekends. [46 (Def.'s Stmt. of Facts), at \u00b6 4.] Nor did Plaintiff request any accommodation. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] In July 2012, Plaintiff was promoted to the position of evening supervisor at the St. Martin de Porres program at Maryville. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6.] In that position, Plaintiff worked Sunday through Thursday. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7.] However, Plaintiff was on-call for work duties every other weekend. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Being on-call meant that Plaintiff had to be available by cellular phone to assist with any work emergencies\n   and to go to work if necessary. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8.] Although Plaintiff testified that he rarely had to go into the office when he was on-call during the weekend, he acknowledged that it did sometimes happen. [46-1 (Pl.'s Dep. Tr.), at 21:15-18, 22:8-11.] On-call weekend hours were Friday from 3:00 p.m. through Monday at 6:00 a.m. [46 (Def.'s Stmt. of Facts), at \u00b6 9.] Plaintiff occasionally asked for specific days off-such as the Day of Atonement (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Yom Kippur) and other high holidays-but did request a religious accommodation to be relieved of his on-call duties every other weekend. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10; 46-1 (Pl.'s Dep. Tr.), at 22:23-23:5.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Eventually Plaintiff was transferred to the St. George program at Maryville, after the St. Martin de Porres program closed. [46 (Def.'s Stmt. of Facts), at \u00b6 11; 54 (Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Stmt. Add'l Facts), at \u00b6 2.] Plaintiff was informed that his days off in the new program would be Sunday and Monday instead of Friday and Saturday. [46 (Def.'s Stmt. of Facts), at \u00b6 12.] However, Plaintiff contends that the Executive Director Sister Cathy\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ryan and the Division Director Evelyn Smith gave him a verbal guarantee that he would be moved bilaterally to a different program, keeping the same shifts, days off, and employee benefits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   [48 (Plaintiff's Resp. to Def.'s Rule 56.1 Stmt.), at \u00b6 12.] Plaintiff further claims that he did not receive any written documentation from the personnel department relative to the change in his work schedule. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] In his deposition, Plaintiff provided the following account of his reaction to being told that he would have to work Fridays and Saturdays:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Q: When you were told that your days off would now be Sunday and Monday, what, if anything, did you say?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   A: I believe I asked if something can be changed or if Carr and I can switch days, or if there was some kind of way that those off days could continue to be -- if those off days could be respected. I've been used to them for over two years now in the program and I was pretty much set in my lifestyle with those days.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Q: At that time did you specifically indicate that you needed those days off due to your religion?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   A: I believe Ms. Gaston asked for reasons why I would need those days off. I explained to her because of my religious belief system.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Q: What specifically did you tell her?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   A: I told her I've been used to having these days off, and I have become accustomed to having these days off and to be able to worship with my family and do different things with my family around those days off that I've been used to having or following my schedule that I would usually do in life on those days off.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [46-1 (Pl.'s Dep. Tr.), at 40:2-24.] After being told that Sundays and Mondays were his days off, Plaintiff nonetheless reported for duty on a Sunday evening in\n   October of 2014. [54 (Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Stmt. of Add'l Facts), at \u00b6 4.] Plaintiff's immediate supervisor Marikah Carr informed Plaintiff that he could not work on Sundays because it conflicted with his own days off.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6.] Mr. Carr then sent Plaintiff home.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7.] Plaintiff returned to work on Tuesday and worked through Thursday. [48 (Pl.'s Aff.), at 40.] He again reported to work on Sunday, at which time Mr. Carr again sent Plaintiff home. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] This pattern continued for several weeks until a meeting was called by Program Director Sabrina Gaston. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] At that meeting, Plaintiff informed Ms. Gaston that he \"could not accept [having Sunday and Monday off] due to a personal conflict.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] He further explained that he could not revert back to working regularly on Fridays and Saturday due to his religious beliefs. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] According to Plaintiff, Ms. Gaston asked Plaintiff if he would be willing to quit his job because of his religious beliefs. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] After Plaintiff responded in the affirmative, Ms. Gaston instructed Plaintiff to write a statement of resignation citing his religious belief as his cause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Believing there was no other option, Plaintiff drafted such a letter. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] On November 2, 2014, Plaintiff tendered his resignation letter to the then-Director of Human Resources Betty Barnes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Ms. Barnes did not provide any receipt for the letter, nor did she place the letter in Plaintiff's personnel file.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A few days later, Plaintiff was instructed to provide proof of his religious affiliation to the Human Resources Department. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Plaintiff provided Defendant a letter from his brother Reverend Ruben Dockery-Founder and Pastor of Beythel Family Church in Nashville, Tennessee-indicating that Plaintiff was a member of that church.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   [46-3 (Def.'s Ex. 3).] The letter\n   indicated that Plaintiff's \"family teachings and religious practices have been based on the same principles all of his life.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] The letter further indicated that since moving back to Chicago, Plaintiff had \"been in fellowship with a local Sabbath observing group.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Plaintiff's brother ended the letter by noting that he was happy to respond to any further inquiries. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] But the letter did not affirmatively state that Plaintiff's religion requires that he have Fridays and Saturdays off from work.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; 46 (Def.'s Stmt. of Facts), at \u00b6 18.] Plaintiff's brother has been an ordained minister for over 20 years. [54 (Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Stmt. of Add'l Facts), at \u00b6 27.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant submitted an affidavit from Teresa Maganzini, Director of Human Resources and Employee Relations at Maryville Academy, indicating that \"[g]iven the timing of the letter, questions about what, if any relationship the author of the letter had to [Plaintiff], and [her] own knowledge that Plaintiff had worked many Fridays and Saturdays in the past, [she] requested additional information from [Plaintiff] regarding his religious beliefs and his request for a religious accommodation.\" [46-7 (Maganzini Aff.), at \u00b6 14.] On November 14, 2014, Plaintiff was summoned to the office of Ms. Maganzini. [48 (Pl.'s Aff.), at 41.] Ms. Maganzini informed Plaintiff that she had some concerns. First, she told Plaintiff that she needed additional documentation from Plaintiff regarding his requested accommodation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Second, she mentioned a case that Plaintiff was involved in while he lived in Nashville that had no bearing on his request for a religious accommodation. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Plaintiff contends that it then became apparent to him that Defendant would not provide him a religious accommodation, so he filed a complaint with the Equal Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") on November 17, 2014. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] However, Plaintiff continued to work for Defendant. [46-1 (Pl.'s Dep. Tr.), at 54:19-22; 46-5 (Def.'s Ex. E).]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On November 26, 2014, Plaintiff called off work because of illness. [46-1 (Pl.'s Dep. Tr.), at 54:14-18; 46-5 (Def.'s Ex. E).] On December 1, 2014, Ms. Maganzini sent Plaintiff an email purporting to memorialize a November 26, 2014 conversation. [46-4 (Def.'s Ex. D).] In that email, Ms. Maganzini asked that Plaintiff \"provide documentation of the specific belief of Judeo-Christian doctrine with regard to Sabbath observance as well as identifying information\n   for the local Sabbath observing group with which\" Plaintiff was affiliated. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Plaintiff again called off of work on December 2, 2014, again because of illness. [46-1 (Pl.'s Dep. Tr.), at 54:23-55:6; 46-5 (Def.'s Ex. E).] Between December 3, 2014 and December 13, 2014, Plaintiff did not come to work.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   [46 (Def.'s Stmt. of Facts), at \u00b6 22.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On December 19, 2014, Ms. Maganzini sent Plaintiff a letter asking that he contact her no later than Monday, January 5, 2015 to discuss his intentions regarding his continued employment at Maryville Academy. [46-5 (Def.'s Ex. E).] The letter noted that Plaintiff failed to appear to work on nine separate occasions between December 3, 2014 and December 13, 2014, and that Plaintiff had not properly notified his Program Manager or Program Director of his work status. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] The letter also indicated that Plaintiff \"failed to provide documentation regarding [his] request for a religious accommodation of [his] schedule.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Although Defendant contends that Plaintiff failed to provide notice of this failure to appear at work during this period, Plaintiff testified that he attempted to contact his immediate supervisor Mr. Carr, but Plaintiff was unable to reach him. [46-1 (Pl.'s Dep. Tr.), at 55:22-56:10.] The Court credits that testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Still, Plaintiff has not presented any credible evidence establishing that he responded to Ms. Maganzini's December 19, 2014 letter requiring that he contact her. Although Plaintiff testified that he was \"pretty sure\" that he called Ms. Maganzini after he received her December 19, 2014 letter requiring that he contact her, he was unable to recall whether he was able to speak with or whether he left a message. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53:11-54:2.] Nor could Plaintiff recall when he spoke with her. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 54:3-5.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On January 9, 2015, Plaintiff appeared at Maryville Academy at Ms. Maganzini's request. [46-7 (Maganzini Aff.), at \u00b6 19.] Defendant terminated Plaintiff on January 9, 2015. [46 (Def.'s Stmt. of Facts), at \u00b6 41.] Ms. Maganzini submitted an affidavit averring that she terminated Plaintiff because of his continuing failure to report to work. [46-7 (Maganzini Aff.), at \u00b6 19.] The reason for termination listed on the Discharge Action Document was job abandonment. [46-6 (Def.'s Ex. F).] The Discharge Action Document noted that Plaintiff failed to report to work on 30 days from November through January, including January 6-8, 2015, the three days immediately preceding his termination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] The Discharge\n   Action Document further noted that Plaintiff was absent from work for three consecutive days without calling a supervisor. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Plaintiff has not submitted any evidence indicating that he attempted to contact his supervisor or anyone else at Maryville on January 6-8, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The EEOC provided Plaintiff with a right to sue letter on March 22, 2016. [1, at 5.] Plaintiff filed this lawsuit on June 14, 2016. [See 1.] During Plaintiff's deposition, Plaintiff answered numerous questions about his religion and his beliefs. For example, Plaintiff was asked to identify his religion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Q: * * * What religion do you belong to?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   A: I would like to consider it a culture. My family, my mother and father raised me under, I guess general view Judaism. But my family see it as a culture versus a religion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Q: When you say your family views it as a culture versus a religion, is that the way you view it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   A: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   [46-1 (Pl. Dep. Tr.), at 23:16-24:1.] During his deposition Plaintiff was unable to name the high holy days from his claimed religion. [46 (Def.'s Stmt. of Facts), at \u00b6 26.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In his opposition to Defendant's motion for summary judgment, Plaintiff makes reference to a settlement offer made to Plaintiff and the fact that Ms. Maganzini testified that her recollection was that a settlement was made because Defendant just wanted \"to make it go away.\" [51 (Maganzini Dep. Tr.), at 14:7-14.] Although Plaintiff asserts that the offer was made \"[d]uring the time of [Ms.] Maganzini's supervision of\" Plaintiff's request for an accommodation [54 (Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Stmt. of Add'l Facts), at \u00b6 24], Plaintiff has not presented any evidence regarding when the settlement offer was made. The cited deposition testimony does not support Plaintiff's contention that the offer was made \"[d]uring the time of [Ms.] Maganzini's supervision of\" Plaintiff's request for an accommodation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Summary judgment is proper where \"the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Rule 56 makes clear that whether a party asserts that a fact is undisputed or genuinely disputed, the party must support the asserted fact by citing to particular parts of the record, including depositions, documents, or affidavits. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1). A party can also support a fact by showing that the materials cited do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute or that the adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In determining whether summary judgment is appropriate, the Court must construe all facts in a light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw all reasonable inferences in that party's favor (here, Plaintiff).\n   <em>\n    Majors v.

For this reason, the Seventh Circuit has called summary judgment the \"put up or shut up\" moment in a lawsuit-\"when a party must show what evidence it has that would convince a trier of fact to accept its version of events.\" See\n   <em>\n    Steen v.

Still, the Court understands how Defendant lacked (and continues to lack) clarity regarding Plaintiff's claimed religious beliefs. It remains unclear to the Court what religion Plaintiff claims to belong. Some evidence indicates that Plaintiff is Jewish. Plaintiff identified himself as a \"Jew\" on his employee information sheet. Plaintiff refereed to his culture as Judaism during his deposition. Yet Plaintiff also testified that his culture believes that Jesus Christ is the savior. Plaintiff's brother Reverend Ruben Dockery wrote a letter indicating that Plaintiff belonged to a church (not a temple or a synagogue) in Nashville, Tennessee that subscribes to the Judeo-Christian doctrine.

Defendant further argues that Plaintiff's prior conduct demonstrates that it was not against Plaintiff's sincerely held beliefs to work on the Sabbath. When Plaintiff returned to work for Maryville Academy in July 2011, he worked Fridays and Saturdays. [46-1 (Pl.'s Dep. Tr.), at 19:15-21.] Although Plaintiff no longer regularly worked on Fridays and Saturdays after he was promoted to evening supervisor around July 2012 [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20:1-7, 20:23-21:18], Plaintiff still had on-call responsibilities every other weekend. [46-1 (Pl.'s Dep. Tr.), at 20:1-21:11.] Being on call meant that Plaintiff had to have access to his phone during that time. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21:12-14.] Although Plaintiff testified that he rarely had to go into the office when he was on call during the weekend, he testified that it did happen. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21:15-18, 22:8-11.] During that time, Plaintiff would request that he be relieved of his on-call duty for \"High Holy Days\" such as the \"Day of Atonement or Passover services.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22:23-23:5.] There is no indication in the record that any such requests were denied.

However, in that case, there was no evidence that the petitioner previously had acted inconsistently with her claimed religious beliefs.

Still, to the extent that Plaintiff's employer was aware of these facts during the relevant time-frame, Defendant was justified in questioning the sincerity of Plaintiff's religious objection. Although Defendant raises numerous facts that call into question the sincerity of Plaintiff's claimed religious objection to working on the Sabbath, the Court need not determine whether Plaintiff's objection to working on the Sabbath was the product of sincerely held religious beliefs because Plaintiff's Title VII failure to accommodate claim fails for another reason discussed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <em>\n    ii.

Plaintiff does not cite to any cases indicating that an employer may not inquire into the sincerity of an employee's religious beliefs before the duty to accommodate arises. Instead, Plaintiff argues (1) that the letter from his brother was sufficient to establish the sincerity of his beliefs, and (2) that it was unclear what additional information Defendant wanted. With respect to the first point, the letter provided by Plaintiff's brother did not establish that it was against Plaintiff's sincerely held beliefs to work on Friday and Saturday. The letter does not explicitly say so. Although the letter indicated that Plaintiff belonged to a local Sabbath observing group [46-3 (Def.'s Ex. C) ], it did not identify the group.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   That brings the Court to Plaintiff's second point. Although Plaintiff asserts that it was unclear to him what additional information Defendant wanted, Defendant's December 1, 2014 email to Plaintiff (which Plaintiff admits he received) specifically asked for \"documentation of the specific belief of Judeo-Christian doctrine with regard to Sabbath observance\" and \"identifying information for the local Sabbath observing group\" with which Plaintiff is\n   affiliated. [46-4 (Def.'s Ex.

Specifically, Defendant has identified evidence showing that it terminated Plaintiff because of his absenteeism. Ms. Maganzini submitted an affidavit averring that she terminated Plaintiff because of his continuing failure to report to work. [46-7 (Maganzini Aff.), at \u00b6\u00b6 2, 19.] The reason for termination listed on the Discharge Action Document was job abandonment. [46-6 (Def.'s Ex. F).] The Discharge Action Document noted that Plaintiff failed to report to work on 30 days from November through January, including January 6-8, 2015, the three days immediately preceding his termination. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] The Discharge Action Document further noted that Plaintiff was absent from work for three consecutive days without calling a supervisor. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Plaintiff does not contend that he showed up to work on the days listed on the Discharge Action Document. Nor does he offer\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   explanation for these absences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The Court recognizes that Plaintiff submitted his resignation on November 2, 2014. [48, at 24.] But Plaintiff does not argue that he was constructively discharged. Nor could he, given that the undisputed evidence establishes that Defendant did not accept Plaintiff's resignation. In fact, Plaintiff continued to work for Defendant after he submitted his resignation letter. [46-1 (Pl.'s Dep. Tr.), at 44:24-45:10.] Plaintiff \"called off\" work on November 26, 2014 because of illness, not because he had resigned or because his request for an accommodation was still pending. [46-5 (Def.'s Ex. E); 46-1 (Pl.'s Dep. Tr.), at 54:14-18.] He again called on sick on December 2, 2014. [46-5 (Def.'s Ex. E); 46-1 (Pl.'s Dep. Tr.), at 54:23-55:6.] Plaintiff has not offered any explanation for his failure to return to work after December 2, 2014. Although Plaintiff has presented evidence indicating that he was unable to get a hold of his immediate supervisor regarding his absences in December, Plaintiff has not presented evidence showing that he attempted to contact him regarding his unexcused absences in January. Furthermore, although Plaintiff testified that he was \"pretty sure\" that he called Ms. Maganzini after he received her December 19, 2014 letter requiring that he contact her, he could not actually recall reaching out to her. Finally, Plaintiff does not dispute that he was terminated on January 9, 2015. [46 (Def.'s Stmt. of Facts), at \u00b6 41.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Given that Plaintiff's request for a religious accommodation was still pending, Plaintiff arguably was justified in missing work on Fridays and Saturdays (although that proposition is highly questionable in light of Plaintiff's continued failure to provide additional information as requested by Defendant). Still, although some of the challenged absences were on Fridays and Saturdays (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , on the Sabbath as Plaintiff views it), twenty of the challenged absences were on other days of the week. Plaintiff's absenteeism is a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for terminating Plaintiff's employment.\n   <em>\n    Lindemann v. Mobil Oil Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3415803\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/940/189/#p196\">\n    940 F.Supp. 189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 196 (N.D.

However, Plaintiff has not identified evidence-beyond mere speculation-that would support that conclusion. Furthermore, the Court notes that even if Plaintiff had provided Defendant with sufficient documentation of his religious objection to working on the Sabbath, this would not mean that Defendant legally would have been required to provide Plaintiff with his requested schedule to the detriment of his supervisor. \"Title VII does not require an employer to interfere with a valid seniority system in the interests of religious accommodation.\"\n   <em>\n    Rose v.

The Court therefore finds it implausible that Defendant would fabricate a pretextual justification for terminating Plaintiff's employment on that basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Plaintiff also argues that a reasonable jury could find that \"[Ms.] Maganzini intervened in the matter by removing Ms. Barnes from her position as Human Resources Director, then assuming her title and engaging in a conspiracy to,\" in her own words, \"make it go away.\" [49 (Pl.'s Mem.), at 6.] However, as discussed above, Plaintiff has not identified any evidence showing that Ms. Barnes's change in position was in any way connected to Plaintiff's request for an accommodation. To the contrary, Ms. Barnes testified that she was not demoted and that her position changed because there was a restructuring of the department that went into effect once the union went into effect. [53 (Barnes Dep. Tr.), at 10:16-20.] Furthermore, to the extent that Plaintiff relies on Ms. Maganzini's statement that Defendant made a settlement offer to Plaintiff to \"make it go away,\" Plaintiff has not presented any evidence regarding when the settlement offer was made. A post-termination settlement offer to make the prospect of costly litigation go away does not undermine Defendant's contention-supported by documentary evidence-that Plaintiff was terminated because of his absenteeism. Accordingly, the Court grants Defendant's motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff's Title VII religious discrimination claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

For example, it could be true that Plaintiff sincerely believes that his religion prohibits him from working on the Sabbath and also true that the Beythel Family Church allows members to attend worship services on Fridays, Saturdays or Sundays. The Court therefore finds these facts of limited usefulness.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    Plaintiff disputes this fact. However, in so doing, Plaintiff recognizes that any \"specific reference to 'requirements of off days' were not addressed.\" [48 (Plaintiff's Resp. to Def.'s Stmt. of Facts), at \u00b6 18.] Plaintiff contends that this is because Defendant never identified what information they needed. Given that Plaintiff was seeking an accommodation based on his claimed religious belief that he cannot work on the Sabbath, however, it is unclear why such information would not be included.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    In his response to Defendant's statement of facts, Plaintiff repeatedly asserts that \"a specific request for details in writing to Teresa A.

However, Plaintiff does not cite to any evidence indicating that he went to work on these dates. Furthermore, in his deposition, Plaintiff contested whether he attempted to contact his supervisor regarding these absences but did not contest that he failed to appear for work during this period. [46-1 (Pl.'s Dep. Tr.), at 55:7-56:1.]\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    Plaintiff also provided phone records which the Court believes Plaintiff submitted to show that he called his direct supervisor. [48, at 25-32.] It is likely that these are the phone records referenced in Plaintiff's deposition. However, Plaintiff does not provide any sort of explanation or authentication of the phone records. Still, for the purposes of Defendant's motion for summary judgment, the Court credits Plaintiff's testimony on this issue.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    Defendant's statement of facts indicates that Plaintiff did not report to work for a total of 31 days between November 3, 2014 and January 8, 2015. [46 (Def.'s Stmt. of Facts), at \u00b6 23.] The difference between 30 days and 31 days is not outcome determinative. Plaintiff disputes that he did not report to work for a total of 31 days during this time period, not based on the number of days identified, but based on the fact that he was unjustly sent home when he reported to work on a Sunday in October and the fact that he was forced to resign. The Court considers the impact of those facts on the arguments addressed below. However, those facts do not contradict Defendant's assertion that Plaintiff did not appear for work on the identified dates.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    Plaintiff relies on\n    <em>\n     Frazee\n    </em>\n    in support of his argument that he has identified sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that his religious objection to working on the Sabbath was sincere. In that case, the Supreme Court held that it violated the appellant's First Amendment rights to deny him unemployment benefits because he denied a position that required him to work on Sunday because of his religious beliefs even though his objection to working on Sunday was \"not claimed to represent a tenet of a religious organization of which he was a member.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12033670\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/829/#p831\">\n     489 U.S. at 835\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12033670\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/829/#p831\">\n     109 S.Ct. 1514\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
