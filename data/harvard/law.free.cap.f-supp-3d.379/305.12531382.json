The rest of the motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    A. \"subsets of baseband frequencies allocated to each remote location being mutually exclusive\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Court has construed \"subsets of baseband frequencies allocated to each remote location being mutually exclusive,\" as \"for any given time slot, no individual baseband frequency is allocated to more\n   than one location.\" (D.I. 95). Sprint makes two noninfringement arguments. First, Sprint addresses the base station as a whole. Each base station in Sprint's LTE network is divided into three sectors. Sprint argues that baseband frequencies are not \"mutually exclusive\" across all three sectors. (D.I. 258 at 10-13). Second, Sprint focuses on the individual base station sectors. Sprint argues that baseband frequencies are also not \"mutually exclusive\" within each sector due to the frequencies on the Physical Uplink Control Channel (\"PUCCH\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Frequencies Across Base Station Sectors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   For the following reasons, Sprint's motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   with respect to frequencies across base station sectors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   It is undisputed that, viewing all three sectors together, a base station does not meet the \"mutually exclusive\" limitation, because different sectors may simultaneously allocate the same baseband frequency to different locations. (D.I. 258 at 10; D.I. 293 at 5-7). The key issue is whether infringement should be determined based on the sectors together or individually.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The preamble of both claims states, \"A method for enabling a plurality of remote locations to transmit data to a\n   <em>\n    central location\n   </em>\n   comprising the steps of ....\" '488 patent at 10:47-48, 11:12-13 (emphasis added). The Court has not construed \"central location.\" (D.I. 95). Sprint asserts that it is undisputed that the \"central location\" is an entire base station in Sprint's LTE network. (D.I. 304 at 4). I disagree. TC Tech's expert, Mr. Bates, makes clear that he believes each individual base station sector may be a \"central location\" as required by the '488 patent. (D.I. 294, Ex. 5 \u00b6 31-32 (opining that Sprint meets the \"mutually exclusive\" limitation by \"using its network on a sector-by-sector basis, not collectively across sectors as [Sprint's expert, Mr. Proctor,] would require\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Sprint argues that to view the \"central location\" as a single sector, rather than the entire base station, would improperly limit the term. (D.I. 258 at 11-12). I think what constitutes a \"central location\" is a question of fact. The '488 patent does not give any special meaning to \"central location.\" The specification merely provides, \"At the central location, data is received from a plurality of remote locations,\" and, \"The central location keeps track of which baseband frequencies are allocated to which remote locations.\" '488 patent at 4:1-7. The '488 patent does not consider sectorization like that in Sprint's LTE network.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   I do not think this is a claim construction issue. The parties do not dispute the meaning of \"central location,\" but whether certain parts of Sprint's LTE network meet the limitation. Based on the parties' expert testimony, whether an individual base station sector in Sprint's LTE network can be considered a \"central location\" such that it meets the \"mutually exclusive\" limitation is a disputed question of fact. Sprint's noninfringement theory assumes that an individual sector cannot be a \"central location.\" Therefore, Sprint fails to meet its burden on summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    2. PUCCH Frequencies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   For the following reasons, Sprint's motion, as related to the PUCCH, is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   with respect to literal noninfringement, and\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   with respect to noninfringement under the doctrine of equivalents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Sprint's LTE network allocates frequencies on several channels. The two relevant channels are the Physical Uplink Shared Channel (\"PUSCH\") and the Physical Uplink Control Channel (\"PUCCH\"). (D.I. 268, Ex. 1, Ex. A \u00b6 117; D.I. 294, Ex. 2 \u00b6 86). Sprint argues that it does not infringe\n   because the PUCCH does not allocate \"mutually exclusive\" frequencies, even within a single base station sector. (D.I. 258 at 13-20). TC Tech argues that it is only asserting infringement with respect to the PUSCH frequencies, and regardless, the PUCCH frequencies meet the \"mutually exclusive\" limitation literally and under the doctrine of equivalents. (D.I. 293 at 7-10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Sprint's noninfringement theory requires the PUCCH frequencies to be considered when determining whether its LTE network meets the \"mutually exclusive\" limitation. Sprint argues that to exclude the PUCCH frequencies, TC Tech improperly limits the claim term \"data\" to \"data other than the control data sent over the PUCCH.\" (D.I. 258 at 14). TC Tech argues, however, that the claims do not require the PUSCH and PUCCH frequencies to be considered together. Rather, the PUCCH frequencies are a set of frequencies distinct from the \"set of orthogonal baseband frequencies\" from which the \"mutually exclusive\" allocations are made on the PUSCH. (D.I. 293 at 8; D.I. 294 \u00b6 86). Therefore, the \"mutually exclusive\" limitation can be met by the PUSCH frequencies alone. (D.I. 293 at 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   This appears to be a factual dispute over whether certain elements of Sprint's LTE network meet the \"mutually exclusive\" limitation. Specifically, whether the frequencies on the PUSCH alone can meet the \"mutually exclusive\" limitation. Sprint's noninfringement theory assumes that the limitation must be met by both the PUSCH and PUCCH frequencies. Because Sprint has failed to show that the limitation must be met by the PUCCH frequencies, it has failed to meet its burden on summary judgment with respect to literal infringement. Thus, I do not need to address TC Tech's argument that the PUCCH frequencies literally meet the \"mutually exclusive\" limitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   I will address, however, Sprint's argument that TC Tech has provided insufficient evidence for its theory under the doctrine of equivalents. (D.I. 258 at 18-20). TC Tech asserts that to the extent the \"mutually exclusive\" limitation is not literally satisfied, it is satisfied under the doctrine of equivalents. (D.I. 294, Ex. 9 \u00b6\u00b6 168-169). \"A finding of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents requires a showing that the difference between the claimed invention and the accused product was insubstantial.\"\n   <em>\n    Stumbo v.

TC Tech relies solely on Mr. Bates' testimony, which states in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   [A] person having ordinary skill in the art would have considered any differences between the claim language of \"the subsets of baseband frequencies allocated to each remote location being mutually exclusive\" and the features of Sprint's LTE [network system], to be insubstantial and would have found that the two perform substantially the same function and work in substantially the same way to achieve substantially the same result as required by the claim language.... [T]he vast majority of uplink transmission in an LTE network occurs in the PUSCH channel.... Variations in the implementation of the PUCCH channel, which consists of certain types of control information I have identified ..., amount to at best an insubstantial difference in the overall uplink transmission of an LTE network. This is both because the fraction of data that is PUCCH data is small,... and because the purpose of an uplink LTE system is to transmit user data, at high rates, which is conveyed in the PUSCH, not to implement any particular control\n   structure in PUCCH for implementation's sake.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   (D.I. 294, Ex. 9 \u00b6 169). The bulk of Mr. Bates' testimony is conclusory. The non-conclusory testimony essentially says, meeting the \"mutually exclusive\" limitation with the PUSCH frequencies is equivalent to meeting the limitation with both the PUSCH and PUCCH frequencies, because the \"vast majority\" of data is transmitted on the PUSCH.

Although the asserted claims do not have a \"transmitting\" limitation, they clearly involve the movement of data from a \"remote location\" to a \"central location.\" Both claims require \"at each remote location, utilizing a modulator to modulate ... time domain data onto a carrier signal for transmission to [a] central location,\" and \"receiving at said central location from one or more of said remote locations ... time domain data modulated on ... carrier signals.\" '488 patent at 10:63-65, 11:1-3, 12:1-3, 12:7-9.

(D.I. 267 at 9-10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   TC Tech is correct that \u00a7 102(e) governs the use of patents as prior art.

In\n   <em>\n    Sonos\n   </em>\n   , the Court followed\n   <em>\n    Sun Studs\n   </em>\n   to find that a patent (\"the Rietschel patent\") could not be asserted as \u00a7 102(g) prior art.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7 (applying post-amendment \u00a7 102(g)(2) ). The Rietschel patent was filed too late to be prior art under \u00a7 102(e). Instead, D&amp;M argued that its product (\"the Exstreamer\") was a prior invention invalidating the asserted patents under \u00a7 102(g). But D&amp;M could not prove that the Exstreamer reflected a reduction to practice of the inventions claimed in the asserted patents. Therefore, D&amp;M argued that the Exstreamer was an embodiment of the Rietschel patent and the disclosures of the Rietschel patent could be asserted as prior art under \u00a7 102(g).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <em>\n    Sonos\n   </em>\n   does not help TC Tech. D&amp;M was attempting to use \u00a7 102(g) to circumvent \u00a7 102(e). Under D&amp;M's theory, the Rietschel patent could be backdated under \u00a7 102(g) to qualify as prior art despite not being prior art under \u00a7 102(e). The Court rejected that theory as improperly distorting the \u00a7 102(g) analysis-the proper inquiry was \"not whether the Exstreamer is an embodiment of the Rietschel patent, but whether the Exstreamer itself invalidates the [asserted] patents.\"\n   <em>\n    Sonos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204969330\">\n    2017 WL 4969330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6-7. Unlike D&amp;M, Sprint is not using \u00a7 102(g) to backdate patents that are not otherwise prior art. The patents Sprint seeks to rely on for reduction to practice under \u00a7 102(g) are also independently asserted as prior art under \u00a7 102(e). TC Tech does not dispute that the patents qualify as prior art under \u00a7 102(e). (D.I. 288 at 11; D.I. 306 at 2-4; D.I. 352 at 3; Oral Argument at 76:15-18).

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-16). Second, TC Tech argues that three of the eight references-the ICC Paper, the NCTA Paper, and the Amati Contribution-fail to disclose modulation onto a carrier signal as required by both claims 1 and 2 of the '488 patent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

TC Tech argues that the limitation arises from the use of \"in-phase\" and \"quadrature\" signals, which together make up a complex signal. (D.I. 267 at 4; D.I. 268, Ex. 3 \u00b6 63). The relevant portion of claim 2 states,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   Using a demodulator, multiplying ... time domain data with in-phase and quadrature carrier signals to obtain in-phase and quadrature baseband signals, converting said in-phase and quadrature baseband signals to digital form, and ... performing ... orthogonal transform using said in-phase and quadrature baseband signals as real and imaginary values, respectively, to demodulate ... time domain data from the carrier frequency signal ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   '488 patent at 12:11-19.

The parties' experts clearly disagree over how the claimed in-phase and quadrature signals operate. TC Tech asserts that a quadrature signal is not a real signal and thus not disclosed by the Asserted References. (D.I. 267 at 13-15; D.I. 268, Ex. 3 \u00b6\u00b6 63, 83). Sprint asserts that both in-phase and quadrature signals are real signals and thus disclosed by the Asserted References. (D.I. 288 at 16; D.I. 289 \u00b6\u00b6 8-12).

Sprint's expert, Dr. Jacobsen, argues that the ICC Paper, the NCTA Paper, and the Amati Contribution each inherently discloses the required modulation onto a carrier through disclosure of simulated systems that transmit signals in a bandwidth from 30-36 MHz. Dr. Jacobsen explains, \"[A] skilled artisan would not have understood there to be any other way, other than by modulation onto a carrier, for the [disclosed signals] to reside between 30 and 36 MHz.\" (D.I. 289, Ex. 1 \u00b6 290 (discussing the ICC Paper);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 328, 400).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   TC Tech argues, based on Mr. Bates' expert testimony, that Dr. Jacobsen's theory fails because there are multiple ways to transmit a signal in the 30-36 MHz range that do not require modulating onto a carrier.

The CableLabs Agreements, in relevant part, provide:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   CableLabs hereby grants to Licensor and its Affiliates a nontransferable, worldwide, nonexclusive, royalty-free license under CableLabs' patents and copyrights\n   <em>\n    which are essential for compliance with the Specifications\n   </em>\n   and a nontransferable, worldwide, nonexclusive, royalty-free sublicense under all patents and copyrights to which CableLabs may have or hereafter acquires the right to sublicense, through other [DOCSIS] Licenses Agreements,\n   <em>\n    which are essential for compliance with the Specifications to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell and import products which conform to the Specifications\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   (D.I. 269, Ex. 19 \u00a7 2.3 (emphasis added)). \"Specifications\" means \"any and all specifications designated by CableLabs ... as part of the [DOCSIS] ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1.5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Sprint argues that the '488 patent was a CableLabs patent \"essential for compliance with [DOCSIS],\" and thus, its vendors had a license to the patent through the CableLabs Agreements. (D.I. 288 at 19). TC Tech argues that Sprint has failed to provide any evidence that (1) the '488 patent was an \"essential\" patent, and (2) the CableLabs Agreements covered use of the licensed patents for LTE cellular products or services. (D.I. 267 at 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   To support its view that the '488 patent is \"essential\" and thus licensed by the CableLabs Agreements, Sprint argues that DOCSIS requires the use of orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (\"OFDMA\"), which is the same technology allegedly covered by the '488 patent. (D.I. 288 at 19 (citing DOCSIS (D.I. 290, Ex. 5 \u00a7 7.3.2))). Sprint asserts that this was confirmed by Thomas Williams, a named inventor of the '488 patent, and Judson Cary, a VP and Deputy General Counsel of CableLabs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Mr. Williams stated during deposition that the term \"OFDMA\" post-dated the '488 patent. (D.I. 290, Ex. 6 at 220:23-24). However, he agreed that DOCSIS requires use of OFDMA (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 220:13-16), and that he believed \"[e]lements in OFDMA ... are included in the 488 Patent\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 221:1-2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 51:21-52:14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Mr. Cary stated, in a pre-suit email while preparing to sell CableLabs patents, that he had \"tentatively identified 5 of the\n   patents for sale/license, mostly in the DOCSIS area.\" (D.I. 290, Ex. 13 at IAG000191). He listed the '488 patent as one of the five but added that CableLabs would \"need to noodle over how to make potential buyer/licensees aware of the exclusions [CableLabs would] need for [its] members and licensees (e.g., under the DOCSIS patent pool, but limited to that use for DOCSIS).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). During deposition, Mr. Cary clarified that he meant (1) whoever bought the patents would need to grant a reciprocal license back to CableLabs and its members, and (2) any patents \"essential\" to DOCSIS would be licensed pursuant to an existing agreement. (D.I. 269, Ex. 18 at 37:6-24). Notably, he added that CableLabs has \"never made any determination whether any of [the identified patents] are essential.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37:24-38:1). Sprint also asserts, and TC Tech does not dispute, that Mr. Cary provided a list of licenses to the patent broker including the CableLabs Agreements. (D.I. 288 at 20; D.I. 306 at 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   I do not think Sprint has provided sufficient evidence to support a finding that the '488 patent is \"essential\" to DOCSIS and thus covered by the CableLabs Agreements. At most, Mr. Williams and Mr. Cary have indicated that they believe the '488 patent has some overlapping elements with DOCSIS. First, I do not think having some overlapping elements is equivalent to being \"essential.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, both Mr. Williams and Mr. Cary made conclusory statements-neither articulated\n   <em>\n    why\n   </em>\n   the '488 patent should be considered \"essential\" to DOCSIS. Mr. Cary admitted that CableLabs never conducted an analysis. (D.I. 269, Ex. 18 at 37:24-38:1). Mr. Williams based his testimony on OFDMA yet was unable to define the term. (D.I. 290, Ex. 6 at 52:3-10 (\"[W]hat even does OFDMA constitute? ... [A] lot of questions that need to be answered.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Therefore, TC Tech has met its burden on summary judgment of showing that there is no dispute of material fact concerning the defenses of license and patent exhaustion based on the CableLabs Agreements. Because I find Sprint cannot show the '488 patent was licensed under the CableLabs Agreement, I do not reach TC Tech's second argument that even licensed patents cannot be used for LTE products and services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Prosecution History Estoppel and Disclaimer\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   For the following reasons, TC Tech's motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   with respect to Sprint's prosecution history estoppel defense. I also find that Sprint's related prosecution disclaimer arguments fail as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   TC Tech only moves for summary judgment on prosecution history estoppel, but I believe the parties' arguments may be better suited for prosecution disclaimer. (D.I. 288 at 22-23; D.I. 306 at 10-11). The Federal Circuit explained the distinction:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   Prosecution history estoppel applies as part of an infringement analysis to prevent a patentee from using the doctrine of equivalents to recapture subject matter surrendered from the literal scope of a claim during prosecution. Prosecution disclaimer, on the other hand, affects claim construction and applies where an applicant's actions during prosecution prospectively narrow the literal scope of an otherwise more expansive claim limitation. Though distinct, both doctrines serve to constrain the enforceable scope\n   of patent claims commensurate with any subject matter surrendered during prosecution to obtain the patent, and a single action during prosecution can engender both a prosecution disclaimer and prosecution history estoppel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <em>\n    Trading Techs.

(D.I. 288 at 23-24; D.I. 290, Ex. 8). First, the claimed \"central location\" must refer to Sprint's LTE network base station. (D.I. 288 at 23). Second, the claimed \"remote locations\" must use the same carrier frequency, which Sprint's \"remote locations\" do not do. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Prosecution History Estoppel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Prosecution history estoppel is a multi-step inquiry. First, a court must find \"an amendment filed in the [USPTO] has narrowed the literal scope of a claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Festo v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"781059\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/344/1359/#p1366\">\n    344 F.3d 1359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2003). Second, the reason for that narrowing amendment must be \"a substantial one relating to patentability.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"781059\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/344/1359/#p1366\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"781059\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/344/1359/#p1366\">\n    at 1366-67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Third, the subject matter surrendered by the narrowing amendment must include the particular equivalent in question.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"781059\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/344/1359/#p1366\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"781059\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/344/1359/#p1366\">\n    at 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Sprint has failed to identify a narrowing amendment, let alone a particular equivalent surrendered by that narrowing amendment. In fact, the only evidence that Sprint relies on are TC Tech's IPR statements, which are unrelated to any claim amendment. (D.I. 288 at 23-24). Those statements, if relevant, go towards prosecution disclaimer, not prosecution history estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Prosecution Disclaimer\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Prosecution disclaimer requires that \"the alleged disavowing actions or statements made during prosecution be both clear and unmistakable.\"\n   <em>\n    Omega Eng'g, Inc. v. Raytek Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1530191\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/334/1314/#p1325\">\n    334 F.3d 1314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1325-26 (Fed. Cir. 2003). Statements made during an IPR proceeding, before or after an institution decision, can support a finding of prosecution disclaimer.\n   <em>\n    Aylus Networks, Inc. v.

Cir. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   First, Sprint argues that TC Tech has disclaimed any construction of \"central location\" that excludes Sprint's LTE network base station, because TC Tech has indicated that a base station may be a \"central location.\" (D.I. 288 at 23). Sprint points to TC Tech's IPR response describing the '488 patent ed invention as a method \"for multiple remote units (such as cellular phones) to communicate with a\n   <em>\n    central unit (such as a base station)\n   </em>\n   \" (D.I. 290, Ex. 8 at 1), \"providing an efficient multiple access-scheme to transfer data from multiple remotes to\n   <em>\n    a single base station\n   </em>\n   \" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), and addressing \"signaling sent from multiple remote locations (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , cellular phones) towards\n   <em>\n    a central location (e.g., cellular base stations)\n   </em>\n   \" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5). Therefore, Sprint argues that TC Tech cannot now assert infringement based on a \"central location\" being an individual sector in Sprint's LTE base station, as opposed to the entire base station. (D.I. 288 at 23-24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   As discussed regarding Sprint's motion for summary judgment, whether an individual sector in Sprint's LTE base station can be considered a \"central location\" is a disputed question of fact.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 III. A. 1. Although TC Tech indicated in its IPR response that a generic \"base station\" may be a \"central location,\" that does not necessarily mean that Sprint's particular LTE network base station is also a \"central location.\" Prosecution disclaimer thus does not apply to limit \"central location.\" Therefore, TC Tech is not barred from\n   asserting its infringement theory based on Sprint's individual base station sectors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Second, Sprint argues that prosecution disclaimer bars TC Tech from asserting that Sprint's LTE network meets the \"same carrier frequency\" limitation in the '488 patent. (D.I. 288 at 24). Sprint relies on TC Tech's IPR argument that the prior art did not teach the \"same carrier frequency\" limitation because the disclosed technology \"could transmit on different carriers at the same time.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting D.I. 290, Ex. 8 at 21-22)). Sprint argues that it is undisputed that the remote locations in Sprint's LTE network \"could transmit [and do transmit] on different carriers at the same time,\" and thus do not meet the \"same carrier frequency\" limitation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Sprint makes a noninfringement argument under the guise of prosecution disclaimer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The cited portion of TC Tech's IPR response merely indicates that the claimed invention requires transmission on the \"same carrier frequency,\" which is not disputed. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 290, Ex. 8 at 21-22). Therefore, as prosecution disclaimer does not apply, TC Tech is not barred from asserting that Sprint's LTE network meets the \"same carrier frequency\" limitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
