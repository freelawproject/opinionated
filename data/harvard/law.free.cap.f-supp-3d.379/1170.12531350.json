Furthermore, Plaintiffs' evidence demonstrates that, Defendants having shown no inclination to modify any of their policies, the administrative remedy\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   \"inadequate.\" Indeed, the thrust of that evidence (regarding the lack of either an automatic verbatim record or mandatory written findings at the time of ruling) is that the current practices negatively impact their ability to\n   <em>\n    effectively\n   </em>\n   appeal and it would be futile to continue to pursue the administrative remedy in the face of Defendants' ongoing refusal to alter the procedural framework.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In attempting to argue that Plaintiffs have no constitutional right to a verbatim record or automatic written findings, Defendants again turn to the argument that there is not even a guaranteed right to verbatim record in criminal proceedings.

The Court finds that a timeline of seven days from the date of the bond hearing request is consistent with both Congressional intent and judicial precedent and represents a procedural safeguard providing the value of an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time regarding this fundamental interest possessed by the class members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The probable value of the other safeguards (the burden of proof borne by the government, an automatic contemporaneous recording of the proceedings, and written findings at the time of decision) required by this injunction has been mentioned\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   and may be summarized as: (1) the burden of proof being borne by the party which has traditionally been responsible for it and which has the greater resources to elicit the necessary facts; and (2) the provision to these class members of a meaningful opportunity to decide whether to appeal an adverse determination and to prepare a sufficiently detailed notice of appeal that the process may go forward with a complete representation of their position. Generally speaking, the \"probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards\" is the increased likelihood that Plaintiffs will be deprived of their fundamental liberty interest only where absolutely necessary, and for no longer than necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    The Government's interest\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \"The government has legitimate interests in protecting the public and in ensuring\n   that non-citizens in removal proceedings appear for hearings....\"\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266713\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/976/#p986\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266713\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/976/#p986\">\n    at 990\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Defendants present their interests primarily in terms of the burden on their resources that implementing additional procedural safeguards (and a mandated timeline) will impose; i.e., \"available resources and docketing realities.\" (Response at 12.) While those concerns are certainly within the scope of a\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   balancing test (this third factor is described as \"the Government's interest, including the function involved and\n   <em>\n    the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail\n   </em>\n   \"), the Court will not exalt expense over fundamental rights to liberty. As the Ninth Circuit has stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   [T]he government has no legitimate interest in detaining individuals who have been determined not to be a danger to the community and whose appearance at future immigration proceedings can be reasonably ensured....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266713\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/976/#p986\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266713\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/976/#p986\">\n    at 994\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Court finds that the\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   balancing test favors the Plaintiffs' position in terms of a finding of \"likelihood of success on the merits\" - Plaintiffs have established the existence of a fundamental liberty interest, the risk of erroneous deprivation of that interest, and the value of additional procedural safeguards. The Government interest, while hardly nonexistent, is not sufficient to outweigh the other factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Irreparable harm\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Court finds that Plaintiffs have provided solid evidentiary and jurisprudential proof of the multiple layers of irreparable injury occasioned by Defendants' policies and practices. The Court's analysis begins by noting again that the courts of the United States recognize that \"any deprivation of constitutional rights 'unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.' \"\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 995 (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Next, the analysis turns to the more concrete types of harm inflicted by prolonged detention, including physical and psychological trauma (e.g., malnutrition, poor medical care, depression;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   declarations of Plaintiffs and counsel at Dkt. Nos. 46, 48, 51, 54-58). Plaintiffs attach to their opening brief a series of declarations establishing the spectrum of harms attendant upon prolonged detention (including panic attacks, depression, and exacerbation of pre-existing trauma). (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Opening Brief at 23.) Additionally, the Ninth Circuit has cited with approval an amicus brief from the American Bar Association in\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   which\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   describes evidence of subpar medical and psychiatric care in ICE detention facilities, the economic burdens imposed on detainees and their families as a result of detention, and the collateral harms to children of detainees whose parents are detained.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266713\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/976/#p986\">\n    872 F.3d at 994\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Secondarily, prolonged indefinite detention negatively impacts detainees who are required to bear the burden of proof of their eligibility for release. Detention poses \"serious obstacles in demonstrating eligibility for release at a bond hearing, including impediments to gathering evidence, communicating with potential witnesses or attorneys ... or accessing documents that immigration officials have confiscated.\" (Opening Brief at 24;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   declarations of immigration counsel at Dkt. Nos. 46-52, 54, 59.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Furthermore, there is the impact of the procedural deficiencies alleged by Plaintiffs on their ability to effectively appeal any adverse determinations. If the detainee does not know the grounds on which the bond request was denied, how is the detainee-or the detainee's counsel-supposed to know whether an appeal would be well-taken? As one counsel declared: \"It is\n   near impossible to advise a client on his or her chances of appeal if I have little to no idea of what the [IJ]'s reasoning was for denying bond in the first place.\" (Dkt. No. 51, Decl. of Jong at \u00b6 11;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 50, Decl. of Inlender at \u00b6 15 (\"Once an appeal is filed, the lack of a transcript means that there is no verifiable way to relay what happened before the immigration judge and, in some cases, to articulate specific errors requiring reversal.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Finally, there is the incalculable harm to those class members who, facing an uncertain length of time in custody and an arduous and obstacle-strewn road to establishing their right to release (to say nothing of their right to asylum), simply abandon their claim and accept deportation back to countries where, as it has already been established to the Government's satisfaction, they face persecution, torture, and possibly death. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 46-47, 50-53, 55, 57-60.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Defendants' arguments to the contrary are not persuasive. They claim that there are no allegations of prolonged detention awaiting a bond hearing, but Plaintiffs' declaratory evidence is replete with assertions of waiting times of weeks and months prior to a bond hearing. (E.g., Dkt. Nos. 46, 47, 57, 61.) They argue that claims of prolonged detention \"could be addressed in the ordinary course of habeas litigation when they are ripe\" (Response at 24) - apparently entirely missing the grim irony of Plaintiffs being forced to undergo a\n   <em>\n    further\n   </em>\n   delay in detention for an entirely separate legal proceeding. Even in the face of over a dozen declarations documenting excessive delays and its effects on the class members, Defendants insist that the injuries are \"speculative,\" lacking any proof that they are \"likely.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Plaintiffs have succeeded in establishing irreparable harm from the complained-of practices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <em>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Balance of equities/Public interest\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   When the Government is a party to the case, the public interest and balance of equities factors \"merge.\"\n   <em>\n    Drakes Bay Oyster Co. v. Jewell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4178991\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/747/1073/#p1092\">\n    747 F.3d 1073\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1092 (9th Cir. 2014). The equities on Plaintiffs' side consist of the deprivation of a fundamental constitutional right, with accompanying harms that range from physical, emotional and psychological damage to unnecessarily prolonged separation from their families to denial of due process. The equities on Defendants' side are primarily concerned with the agencies' right to control their dockets and to allocate what are unquestionably limited resources as they see fit. This is not a close call.
