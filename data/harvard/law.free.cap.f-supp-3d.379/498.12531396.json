(\"Plaintiff\"), with the assistance of counsel, brought this action seeking judicial review of the final decision of the Acting Commissioner of the Social Security Administration (\"Commissioner\") denying her claims for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income. The case was referred to a United States Magistrate Judge, pursuant to the provisions of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(B) &amp; (C) and Rule 72(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, as well as Rule 72 of the Local Rules of this Court, for a Report and Recommendation (\"R &amp; R\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   On January 23, 2019, the Magistrate Judge assigned to this case issued a detailed R &amp; R recommending that Plaintiff's second motion for summary judgment be\n   denied, and that the Commissioner's cross-motion for summary judgment be granted. ECF No. 39. By copy of the R &amp; R, each party was advised of the right to file written objections, and on February 6, 2019, the Court received Plaintiff's Objections to the R &amp; R. ECF No. 40. After obtaining a briefing extension, the Commissioner filed its response on March 6, 2019. ECF No. 43. As set forth below, after reviewing relevant portions of the record and performing a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of all objected-to portions of the R &amp; R, and after performing a \"clear error\" review of all other portions of the R &amp; R, the Court\n   <strong>\n    ADOPTS\n   </strong>\n   the findings and recommendations set forth in the Magistrate Judge's detailed and well-reasoned R &amp; R.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Briefly addressing Plaintiff's objections, the majority of the first subpart of Plaintiff's first objection is not really an \"objection\" because it argues,\n   <em>\n    consistent with\n   </em>\n   the Magistrate Judge's ruling, that \"issue exhaustion\" in a Social Security case is not mandated by statute or regulation.

While this Court acknowledges that the rationale for issue exhaustion is less compelling in non-adversarial proceedings, when balancing all relevant considerations, including the multiple Social Security regulations indicating that a claimant \"should\" or \"must\" raise issues before the ALJ as soon as practicable, as well as efficiency interests, this Court agrees with the findings in the R &amp; R, and countless prior and subsequent federal district court decisions, holding that court-imposed issue exhaustion is appropriate in the Social Security context,\n   <em>\n    at least with respect to appointments clause challenges\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 39, at 524-25 (citing cases);\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Bennett v.

Va. Mar. 8, 2019). In this Court's view, Plaintiff's arguments focusing on the non-adversarial nature of Social Security proceedings are undercut in large part by the fact that a challenge to the ALJ's capacity, at least in the form at issue here, is a matter that the ALJ has no occasion to identify as part of his or her role\n   <em>\n    investigating the merits-facts\n   </em>\n   . Moreover: (1) Social Security regulations provide an express procedure for challenging, at the earliest opportunity, the assigned ALJ; and (2) \"[t]he Supreme Court has never indicated that [appointment] challenges must be heard regardless of [forfeiture],\" but instead \"the Court has proceeded on a case-by-case basis, determining whether the circumstances of the particular case warrant excusing the failure to timely object.\"\n   <em>\n    In re DBC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3857945\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/545/1373/#p1380\">\n    545 F.3d 1373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1380 (Fed.

As argued by the Commissioner, Def.'s Mem. 19-20, and as discussed in\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   , the \"[e]fficiency interests\" served by the rule requiring exhaustion also strongly favor a different result here.\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   , slip op. at 13.

In\n   <em>\n    Hopkins v. Berryhill\n   </em>\n   , the court relied on\n   <em>\n    Sims\n   </em>\n   and rejected the assertion that a claimant \"waived his right to challenge the ALJ's failure to include additional restrictions in the RFC assessment because his counsel failed to object to the ALJ's hypothetical questions to the VE or to present alternative hypothetical questions that accounted for the restrictions.\"\n   <em>\n    Hopkins v.

Dec. 12, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The Court declines to do so for several reasons. First,\n   <em>\n    Hopkins\n   </em>\n   did not involve an Appointments Clause challenge, which could have been identified and presented to either the ALJ or the Appeals Council before a final agency decision. Second, as discussed in\n   <em>\n    Hopkins\n   </em>\n   , the claimant there testified before the ALJ concerning, and the record contained substantial other evidence about, his mental health impairments that the ALJ failed to adequately consider at steps two and four.\n   <em>\n    Hopkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206398181\">\n    2017 WL 6398181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11, 17-20. By doing so, and unlike plaintiff, the claimant arguably preserved arguments about his mental health impairments and capacity to perform relevant mental functions. Having done so prior to the issuance of the ALJ's decision, his claim for falling within the scope of\n   <em>\n    Sims\n   </em>\n   ' rationale was stronger than plaintiff's. Third,\n   <em>\n    Hopkins\n   </em>\n   in no way addressed waiver in the context of\n   <em>\n    Lucia's\n   </em>\n   insistence upon the timely assertion of claims like plaintiff's, challenging the constitutional validity of an officer's appointment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lucia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612807\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2044/#p2055\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 2055\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court further determined that, regardless of whether Eldridge exhausted agency review, he need not have presented his constitutional claim to the agency because it was \"unrealistic to expect that the Secretary would consider substantial changes in the current administrative review system at the behest of a single aid recipient raising a constitutional challenge in an adjudicatory context.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 329 n.10, 330,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/\">\n    96 S.Ct. 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This is so because the ALJ's classification of the \"neck disorder\" as a severe impairment fully encompassed plaintiff's cervical radiculopathy, along with its resulting symptoms. Just as the ALJ's classification of plaintiff's \"back disorder\" as a severe impairment, R. 19, encompassed her treating provider's diagnosis of \"lumbar radiculopathy,\" R. 715, so too did the ALJ's finding of a neck disorder cover plaintiff's cervical radiculopathy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   R. 19, 474;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burnside v.

The medical evidence of record relating to plaintiff's neck problems, although limited, linked them to her reported hand/arm problems, R. 389, 474, 614, 739, and plaintiff acknowledges this connection. Pl.'s Mem. 21 (\"cervical radiculopathy is a single impairment that causes both symptoms\"). The existence of such a connection here is also supported by the absence of evidence of other impairments potentially causing the hand/finger pain about which plaintiff complained.

The ALJ noted, for example, plaintiff's \"conservative treatment\" history, including the absence of surgical intervention, her use of ibuprofen over prescription pain medications, her abandonment of physical therapy, her failure to return to the neurological and spine clinic for two and one-half years after briefly treating there in 2013, and her disregard of Dr. Salvant's treatment recommendations, including to lose weight, take anti-inflammatory medications, and return, if needed, for steroidal injections.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-22 (noting that \"noncompliance with prescribed treatment supports a finding that her symptoms were not as severe and limiting as she alleged\"). Indeed, the medical evidence shows that plaintiff only sought or received treatment for neck problems briefly in the fall of 2013, had a single x-ray in 2014 without any ensuing treatment, and returned for one final visit to the neurological and spine clinic in 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   In contrast, the ALJ also reviewed evidence demonstrating that, while regularly seeking treatment for other medical problems, examination of plaintiff's neck, upper extremities, and neurological status failed to reveal evidence of problems corresponding with plaintiff's testimony, such as abnormal examination findings for range of motion, motor strength, grip/arm strength, reflex or sensory deficits or tenderness, focal neurological deficits, and upper extremity problems.

Further, other than as noted above, when seeking treatment for other medical issues, plaintiff generally voiced no complaints about her neck and related problems in her hands and arms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   The ALJ may have been justified, based on this record, in entirely excluding functional limitations allegedly resulting from plaintiff's neck disorder, but he did not do so.

Like plaintiff's treating physician and the state agency physicians, R. 72-73, 80-81, 715-16, the ALJ identified no applicable manipulative limitations that were needed. The omission of any such limitations was also consistent with the ALJ's notation that, while living on her own and mostly independent of the aid of others, plaintiff retained the abilities to clean, cook, do laundry, wash dishes, and hold stair rails when walking and climbing.

The ALJ specifically discussed the requirements of SSR 02-1p, relative to steps two through four, and noted generally how obesity \"may have an adverse impact upon the medical severity of co-existing impairments\" and how it \"may limit [one's] ability to sustain activity\" regularly and continuously during a typical work day and week.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20.

The ALJ discussed: (1) the\n   findings of her May 3, 2014 knee x-rays revealing arthritic, degenerative changes in both knees, R. 23, 584-85, 587-88 (noting \"ambulating without assistance, driving self\" upon discharge); (2) the findings of hip x-rays that revealed mild to moderate osteoarthritis in the S1 joints bilaterally, as well as the absence of significant treatment for hip pain, R. 23, 615; (3) the absence of evidence of lumbar spinal nerve root compression or stenosis in an August 26, 2013 MRI of plaintiff's back, R. 21, 381-82; (4) that, when examined on September 23, 2013, in spite of plaintiff's subjective complaints (including leg pain), she presented with \"no signs of motor, reflex, or sensory deficit[s],\" R. 21-22, 389-90; (5) how, during a November 4, 2013, follow-up appointment for back and neck pain, plaintiff presented with a \"slow, antalgic gait,\" R. 22, 392; (5) how, on March 20, 2014 when living in a second story apartment, plaintiff sought ER treatment for back pain and, after also complaining about having trouble walking, was \"observed to walk without any apparent difficulty,\" R. 22, 580; (6) that, on July 3, 2014, plaintiff presented with bilateral knee tenderness and swelling and reported that taking Neurontin and Celebrex helped with her knee pain, while not fully resolving it, R. 23, 773-75; (7) how, when treated on September 22, 2015 for back (and knee) pain, plaintiff was directed to take ibuprofen, R. 22, 753-54; and (8) how, when treated for back and neck pain on April 7, 2016, Dr. Salvant observed normal strength and reflex activity bilaterally, without loss of sensation, but also discomfort with weight bearing on the right knee due to \"bad\" arthritis and noted plaintiff's refusal of a knee injection and anti-inflammatories, R. 22, 739, 741. Thus, the ALJ reviewed all relevant medical evidence, including that arguably at odds with his final conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Having reviewed plaintiff's statements and testimony, as well as the medical record, the ALJ found the record of plaintiff's treatment for knee pain to be both \"infrequent\" and \"conservative.\" R. 23. The former finding is, of course, inconsistent with the requirement that an inability to ambulate exist on a sustained basis for one year.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, \u00a7 1.00(B)(2)(a). The ALJ also noted that, instead of needing surgery, plaintiff was directed \"to lose weight in order to improve joint mobility\" and to take non-narcotic painkillers, such as ibuprofen, and anti-inflammatories. R. 23. Such treatment directives, which notably nowhere prescribe use of any assistive devices, are inconsistent with the existence of an extreme limitation on the ability to walk as required by listing 1.02(A). As noted by the ALJ, plaintiff did not use one, let alone two, assistive devices, such as canes, crutches, or walkers, as typically found in one whose walking abilities are extremely limited.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 254, 256-57 (reporting by plaintiff that she does not use a cane or other assistive device and could walk 200 feet before needing to stop and rest); R. 716 (treating physician source statement indicating plaintiff could stand/walk for about two hours and sit for at least six hours in a workday). Finally, the ALJ noted that plaintiff lived alone and remained mostly independent with respect to activities of daily living. R. 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   Further, in light of the treatment notes and history discussed above, the ALJ's credibility determination about plaintiff's overstatement of the intensity, persistence, and limiting effects of her symptoms applies with equal force here. The same is true for the ALJ's observations about plaintiff's noncompliance with her providers' treatment recommendations. In noting plaintiff's testimony about pain and the existence of some walking limitations and the existence of some corroboration for her complaints in the treatment records, however, the ALJ judiciously decided not to wholly discount them. Instead, having classified\n   plaintiff's obesity and orthopedic impairments (including arthritic knees) as severe, the ALJ also took them into account in assessing her RFC. These conclusions are supported by the ALJ's rejection of the conclusion of state agency physicians that plaintiff could perform light work. Rather than agreeing that plaintiff could perform work entailing a \"good deal of walking,\" the ALJ decided that plaintiff could only perform sedentary work, with only occasional walking and standing. R. 21; see\n   <extracted-citation index=\"297\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20404.1567\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), (b), 416.967(a), (b).
