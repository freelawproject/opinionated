DuPont does not dispute that for decades it released into the water around its Washington Works plant a synthetic perfluorinated carboxylic acid and fluorosurfactant also known as perfluorooctoanoic acid or ammonium perfluorooctanoate (\"C-8\"). Mrs. Swartz alleges that the C-8 released from DuPont's Washington Works Plant caused her to develop kidney cancer. Under a contractual agreement between DuPont and a group of individuals who drank water contaminated with C-8, DuPont agreed not to contest whether C-8 is capable of causing Mrs. Swartz's kidney cancer (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , general causation), and retained the right to contest whether C-8 actually caused her cancer (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , specific causation).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mrs. Swartz alleges that the C-8 \"[r]eleases have made and/or continue to make Plaintiff and other exposed individuals physically ill and otherwise physically harmed, and/or have caused and continue to cause associated emotional and mental stress, anxiety, and fear of current and future illnesses, including but not limited to, fear of significantly increased risk of cancer and other disease, among Plaintiffs and the other class members.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 52, ECF No. 15.) Mrs. Swartz brings claims for relief for negligence, malicious/reckless indifference, and loss of consortium.

This latter form of pain and suffering has been referred to throughout this trial as cancerphobia. To recover for cancerphobia, [Plaintiff] must have established by the greater weight of the evidence that he is aware that he in fact possesses an increased statistical likelihood of developing cancer, and that from this knowledge springs a reasonable apprehension which manifests itself in emotional distress. It is for you to decide whether [Plaintiff]'s claimed apprehension or fear of developing cancer is reasonable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   From these you will determine what sum will compensate the plaintiff for the injury to date. In this case, you may not consider lost wages, salaries, or other compensation when determining damages because [Plaintiff] has not asserted a claim for those types of damages.

In\n   <em>\n    Hanna\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff prisoner \"alleges that his psychiatric problems, including bipolar disorder, require medication. Because he was not provided psychotropic medication in jail, Plaintiff alleges he suffered a 'recurrence of suicidality' \" which resulted in three serious suicide attempts, the last resulting in \"anoxic brain damage, causing him permanent and severe physical and mental disabilities requiring total care for all his daily needs for the rest of his life.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1, 3,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%20159569\">\n    2015 U.S. Dist.

Thus, unlike the instant action, there was \"some reason for the examination other than the fact that a party's mental or physical condition is at issue,\" namely, a reasonably-based belief that the examination would reveal information about the plaintiff's condition which is adverse to conclusions reached by other examining physicians.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   With regard to the ability to obtain the information by other means, DuPont offers no argument as to why it cannot obtain the information it seeks from other means. Instead, DuPont merely states that \"Plaintiff is wrong in arguing, without reference to any on-point authority, that DuPont does not have 'good cause' for an IME because DuPont has sought information related to the Plaintiff's mental state through other means of discovery, including Plaintiff's deposition.\" (Def's Reply at 10.) However, even if Plaintiff is incorrect that obtaining the information through discovery does not suffice to show that the information can be obtained through another means - that does nothing to help DuPont make its affirmative showing that it cannot obtain the information from some other source.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Accordingly, DuPont has failed to meet its burden to \"affirmatively demonstrate good cause\" to be permitted to subject Mrs. Swartz to a Rule 35 mental examination.\n   <em>\n    Schlagenhauf v.
