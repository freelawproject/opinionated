ECF No. 1. On March 19, 2019, the Court rejected the parties' Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement, granted Flett's oral motion to withdraw his guilty plea, and scheduled a pretrial conference and trial. ECF No. 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Court held a pretrial conference on May 21, 2019. Before the Court was Flett's motion to dismiss count two and response to the Government's notice of prior convictions, ECF No. 54 ; Flett's motion to bifurcate or sever counts and response to the Government's notice of prior convictions, ECF No. 50 ; Flett's objections to anticipated expert testimony, ECF No. 49 ; and Flett's motions\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 48. The Court ruled orally on each of Flett's motions and objections. This Order memorializes and supplements the Court's oral rulings, which are incorporated herein. The Court addresses each of Flett's motions and objections in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

ECF No. 1 at 2. Flett moves to dismiss count two, arguing insufficient evidence supports it because his criminal history does not contain the two predicate convictions required. ECF No. 54 at 4-8. For the jury to find Flett guilty of count two, the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that, on or about July 12, 2018, he \"ha[d] a final conviction on at least 2 separate prior occasions in Federal, State, or Indian tribal court proceedings for offenses that would be, if subject to Federal jurisdiction ... any assault, sexual abuse, or serious violent felony against a[n] ... intimate partner.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20117\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Flett argues he has only one predicate conviction because his prior state and tribal convictions do not qualify as the second predicate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Applying the categorical approach, Flett argues his prior state and tribal convictions are overbroad because they require a lesser mens rea than the federal generic offenses, which require intent.

ECF No. 61 at 4-5. But the Government relies most heavily on Flett's 2006 and 2008 Spokane Tribal Court convictions for second degree assault and battery.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. Under the Spokane tribal code, \"[a]ny person who shall willfully and knowingly use force or violence on another person shall be guilty of assault and battery in the second degree when he willfully and unlawfully touches, strikes or otherwise harms the person or body of another.\" SPOKANE TRIBE OF INDIANS, REV. LAW &amp; ORDER CODE \u00a7 8-2.02(a) (2013),\n   <em>\n    available at\n   </em>\n   http://spokane tribe.com/userfiles/file/SLOC% 2005-14-2013% 20% 28Final% 29% 281% 29.pdf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The plain language of this statute-specifically the words \"willfully and knowingly\" and \"willfully and unlawfully\"-requires that the defendant commit the act \"intentionally\" within the common law meaning outlined above. Specifically, this statute requires a volitional and voluntary act. Flett's argument that \"willfully\" is a lower mens rea than \"intentionally,\" ECF No. 54 at 8, is mistaken because the words are synonymous in this context.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, Flett's argument that this statute extends to nonbodily harm,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , ignores the corporal focus of its plain language, which proscribes \"us[ing] force or violence on another\n   person\" by \"touch[ing], strik[ing] or otherwise harm[ing] the person or body of another.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Therefore, Flett's 2006 and 2008 Spokane Tribal Court convictions for second degree assault and battery did not require a lesser mens rea than, and are no broader than, the federal generic offenses of simple assault and simple battery. The victims involved in those tribal convictions appear to have been Flett's intimate partners.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 44 at 5 ; ECF No. 61 at 4. As a matter of law, either of those tribal convictions could qualify as Flett's second predicate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   From this evidence, a rational jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that Flett had the two required predicate convictions on or about July 12, 2018. In sum, it appears the Government may present sufficient evidence to prove Flett \"ha[d] a final conviction on at least 2 separate prior occasions in Federal ... or Indian tribal court proceedings for offenses that would be, if subject to Federal jurisdiction ... any assault ... against a[n] ... intimate partner.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20117\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 at 2.

They all involved different\n   victims and are mostly remote in time because they were adjudicated between six and nineteen years ago (six, seven, seven, nine, ten, eleven, thirteen, seventeen, and nineteen years ago, respectively).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 44 at 4-6 ; ECF No. 61 at 2, 4-5, 23-24. More importantly, Flett's prior domestic assault convictions are not sufficiently relevant to a material issue in count one and would be used only to show his propensity-that on this occasion he acted in conformity with his drunken, violent character toward his intimate partners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Government makes several arguments, none of which is persuasive. The Government argues these convictions show an intentional wounding with intent to do bodily harm. ECF No. 44 at 4-7, 8 n.1. But \"[a] showing of intent to assault on an earlier occasion proves little, if anything, about an intent to assault at some later time.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Bettencourt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1401533\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/614/214/#p217\">\n    614 F.2d 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 217 (9th Cir. 1980). The Government argues these convictions show an absence of mistake or lack of accident. ECF No. 44 at 4, 6, 8 n.1. But Flett disavows any case theory involving mistake or accident. ECF No. 50 at 11 ; ECF No. 66 at 10. The Government argues these convictions rebut a self-defense claim. ECF No 61 at 25. But Flett represents that he will not claim self-defense. ECF No. 66 at 10. The Government argues these convictions show modus operandi. ECF No. 44 at 4-5, 7. But far from establishing a distinctive criminal signature, Flett's pattern of drunken violence toward his prior intimate partners merely suggests bad character. The Government argues these convictions show motive through some form of provocation. ECF No. 56 at 5 ; ECF No 61 at 25. But this can be established on the facts of this case without reference to how Flett's prior intimate partners may or may not have provoked his assaults in past episodes. Additionally, the Government argues these convictions show identity. ECF No. 44 at 8 n.1 ; ECF No. 56 at 5 ; ECF No. 61 at 25. This argument is puzzling because Flett simply has not placed identity in issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Government's strongest argument is that these convictions rebut a voluntary-intoxication defense. ECF No. 44 at 6. But it is uncertain whether Flett will raise such a defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 50 at 11-12. Besides, rebutting such a defense is the same as proving specific intent and, as noted above, \"[a] showing of intent to assault on an earlier occasion proves little, if anything, about an intent to assault at some later time.\"\n   <em>\n    Bettencourt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1401533\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/614/214/#p217\">\n    614 F.2d at 217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Regardless, as to count one, Flett's prior domestic assault convictions are inadmissible under Rule 403. Their probative value is substantially outweighed by several dangers, including (1) unfair prejudice to Flett by suggesting he is guilty because he is a bad person, (2) confusing the issues the jury must decide and misleading the jury into a trial-within-a-trial by focusing on up to nine other victims and events long before the crime charged, (3) unduly delaying the proceedings and wasting time with testimony on matters unconnected to the present allegations, and (4) needlessly presenting cumulative evidence of Flett's various misdeeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Considering all, Flett's prior domestic assault convictions are inadmissible as to count one, though necessary to count two. In a joint trial on all elements, Flett would face \" 'a high risk of undue prejudice' \" to his defense on count one because of \"[t]he danger that a jury will infer present guilt from prior convictions.\"\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1560613\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/787/1318/#p1321\">\n    787 F.2d at 1321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Daniels\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3601117,332839\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/770/1111/\">\n    770 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1116 ).

To save time and resources, the Court elects bifurcation over severance. Flett's motion to bifurcate trial proceedings is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   and his alternative motion to sever counts for trial is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED AS MOOT\n   </strong>\n   . Count two's final element, and corresponding evidence of Flett's prior domestic assault convictions, shall be withheld unless and until the jury finds the Government has proven all other elements of count two beyond a reasonable doubt. If the jury finds the Government has proven all other elements of count two beyond a reasonable doubt, the Court will reopen trial for the limited purpose of determining whether Flett committed the assault after having a final conviction on at least two separate prior occasions in federal, state, or Indian tribal court proceedings for offenses that would be, if subject to federal jurisdiction, any assault, sexual abuse, or serious violent felony against an intimate partner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

The Government argues the statements, which describe the source of physical injuries, fit a hearsay exception because they were made either (1) for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment, or (2) to describe a then-existing physical condition. ECF No. 57 at 2-3 (citing Fed. R. Evid. 803(3), (4) ). Further, the Government argues the statements are not testimonial because their primary purpose was to receive medical assistance, not to assist prosecution.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-5 (citing\n   <em>\n    Michigan v.

ECF No. 56 at 3 ; ECF No. 65 at 3-4. The Government opposes the motion, arguing such evidence is admissible to establish motive. ECF No. 56 at 2-4.
