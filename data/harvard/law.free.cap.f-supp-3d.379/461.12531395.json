Moreover, the undisputed evidence establishes that Defendants were required to, but did not, follow the APA's notice and comment requirements issuing the August 2017 Guidance, and therefore Defendants violated the APA by issuing it. Accordingly, I will grant Plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration and reopen the parties' cross-motions.

For example, JUUL, currently one of the most popular e-cigarettes among school-aged youth, has not gone through the premarket review process. If it did, it would have to provide information to FDA about its contents and their effects, and FDA would make that information public if it approved JUUL.

Aug. 2017 Guidance 8, GAR 429, ECF No. 48-1, at 721.

But, this factor still weighs in favor of finality under the circumstances, as the effects (welcomed by the manufacturers) on the regulated entities were \"immediate and significant.\" And, the agency action does impose a burden; it simply is on Plaintiffs, rather than the regulated agencies. Further, the August 2017 Guidance marked the culmination of the FDA's decision-making process, as it served as a definitive statement that immediately brought a number of new tobacco products into compliance.

Instead of addressing public health concerns associated with tobacco use by minors and others, the August 2017 Guidance exacerbates the situation by stating, in essence, that manufacturers can continue to advertise and sell products that are addictive and that target a youth market, like the \"Apple Juice\" e-cigarette discussed in Plaintiffs' Complaint, at a time when minors' use of tobacco products like e-cigarettes is at an epidemic level and rising. Arguably, the five-year compliance safe-harbor has allowed the manufacturers enough time to attract new, young users and get them addicted to nicotine before any of their products, labels, or flavors are pulled from the market, at which time the youth are likely to switch to one of the other thousands of tobacco products that already are approved-results entirely contrary to the express purpose of the Tobacco Control Act.

Simply put, an agency may decide whether to exercise its enforcement discretion as to one or more discrete violations, in light of the circumstances surrounding a particular violation and considering other responsibilities and resources that the agency has at that time. But this bears no relation to a decision to hold in abeyance enforcement of mandatory provisions of a statute that Congress viewed as integral to address public health dangers that the agency itself acknowledges are alarming for five or more years while it tries to figure out how it will implement the statute, all the while affording those manufacturers responsible for the public harm a holiday from meeting the obligations of the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Chaney\n   </em>\n   Court also observed that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-172\">\n   an agency's refusal to institute proceedings shares to some extent the characteristics of the decision of a prosecutor\n   in the Executive Branch not to indict-a decision which has long been regarded as the special province of the Executive Branch, inasmuch as it is the Executive who is charged by the Constitution to \"take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.\" U.S. Const., Art.

The revised 2014 Guidance Document merely requests some additional metrics to ensure the drug's bioequivalence, as the prior metrics may not adequately capture the bioequivalence and efficacy of the drug in the later phases of the twelve-hour dose. The additional metrics requested by FDA fall within the normal range of evidence and measures that FDA may request as part of its process of assessing bioequivalence. Accordingly, FDA's 2014 Guidance Document is not irreconcilable with nor does it repudiate FDA's regulations on bioequivalence or FDA's prior 2012 Guidance Document.

Certainly, its requirements are\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   favorable to manufacturers than the Tobacco Control Act, essentially lifting statutory prohibitions for five or more years and imposing obligations across a longer timeframe. Nevertheless, the language used in the August 2017 Guidance includes commands, requirements, and order: It tells manufacturers when they must submit their applications, reports, and requests for new tobacco products. More fundamentally, these requirements cannot be reconciled with the Tobacco Control Act, as they \"run[ ] 180 degrees counter to the plain meaning of the [statute],\" which set much more stringent deadlines.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Family Planning\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10513344,3502604\" index=\"383\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/979/227/\">\n    979 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   235 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mallinckrodt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"384\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%2013091366\">\n    2015 WL 13091366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *12 ;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   <em>\n    Berlex\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7651417\" index=\"385\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/942/19/#p26\">\n    942 F.Supp. at 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Any Guidance providing for a compliance period will, of course, have to adhere to the notice and comment requirements of the APA. Even so, manufacturers long have been on notice that they will have to file premarket approval applications, substantial equivalence reports, and exemption requests, and if they have chosen to delay their preparations to do so, then any hardship occasioned by their now having to comply is of their own making. And, in adopting new Guidance, the APA can propose that the deadlines can be set sufficiently soon beyond the end of the notice and comment period to afford relief to Plaintiffs and to attempt to combat the epidemic-level use of new tobacco products like e-cigarettes, especially by teenagers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   A separate order will issue.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-206\">\n    These electronic nicotine products are more accurately-and ironically-called \"ENDS\"- \"electronic nicotine delivery systems.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Stmt. of FBA Commissioner, ECF No. 43-2.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-207\">\n    Alex M.
