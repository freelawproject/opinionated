BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The City of Oakland has enacted ordinances recognizing \"that a shelter crisis exists due to a 'significant number of persons ... without the ability to obtain shelter, resulting in a threat to their health and safety.' \" ECF No. 1-2 (February 13, 2019 memo from City Council President Rebecca Kaplan) at 1. As part of its response to this crisis, the City's Public Works Department has a Standard Operating Procedure (\"S.O.P.\") regarding the removal of homeless encampments from public rights-of-way, parks, and City-owned property. ECF No. 1-2 at 10. The S.O.P. contemplates that sometimes the belongings of occupants will be removed when encampments are cleared, and states that the S.O.P.'s \"guidelines must be followed to protect the constitutional rights of persons whose personal property remains at these locations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As relevant here, the required procedures include the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \u2022 A Notice to Vacate will be posted \"in multiple visible locations at the area\" at least 72 hours prior to the closure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u2022 \"City personnel shall not prevent occupants from retrieving their belongings\n   before vacating the encampment site.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 \"City personnel shall not confiscate or remove belongings from site when the occupant is present, absent a reasonable belief that the belongings are an immediate threat to public health and safety or are evidence of a crime or contraband.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 \"[The Public Works Agency] shall itemize the belongings collected and include the location, date, and time of collection on the itemization form.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 There is an exception to the previous paragraph for \"belongings that are considered to be clearly trash or are unsafe for storage, such as food or food wrappers, soiled items, or used personal hygiene items.\" Public works employees are directed to \"immediately dispose of\" such items.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 \"A 'Notice of Collected Property' will be posted where the original 'Notice to Vacate' was previously posted, and will contain the [Public Works Agency] Call Center telephone number.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 Public Works will store the collected belongings at a Public Works facility for at least ninety (90) days.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   ECF No. 14-2 at 16-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The S.O.P. governs both permanent encampment closures and temporary \"clean and clear\" operations, after which encampment residents are permitted to return to living at the site. ECF No. 14-1 at 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs Shipp and De Guzman are currently unhoused and live in an encampment located at East 12th Street and 16th Avenue in the City of Oakland. They have lived in encampments in other locations in the City from which they were evicted and their belongings seized. They allege that the City violates its own policy by disposing of unhoused persons' belongings improperly. They \"want the City of Oakland to follow their so called policy and stop throwing away people's belongings ... [and] do the job they are paid to do &amp; bag, tag and &amp; store our belongings for 90 days.\" ECF No. 1 at 5. They contend that the City's actions violate their constitutional rights under the Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On March 29, 2019, the Department of Public Works posted a notice that public works crews would \"temporarily close the encampment\" in the median on East 12th Street from 14th to 19th Avenues \"between the hours of 8 AM and 4 PM\" on Wednesday, April 3, 2019, or on the next business day, \"to clean the site thoroughly.\" ECF No. 3 at 3. The notice further cautioned that \"[a]ny property left at this site at the time of cleanup will be removed from the site and stored by Public Works. Property that is unsafe or hazardous to store will be discarded immediately.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs filed this pro se action on April 2, 2019, and immediately moved for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction to prevent this temporary closure. ECF Nos. 1, 3, 7. Given the imminence of the closure, the Court issued a temporary restraining order on an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   basis that evening, enjoining the City from vacating Plaintiffs' encampment for 14 days. ECF No. 11 at 5. The Court further ordered the City to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not issue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6. The City filed its response on April 8, 2019, ECF No. 14, and Plaintiffs did not file a reply. At the hearing on April 16, 2019, Plaintiff De Guzman appeared on his own behalf and offered testimony and argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Applying this principle to a pair of ordinances that \"criminalize[d] the simple act of sleeping outside on public property\" anywhere in the city of Boise, the Ninth Circuit explained that, \"as long as there is no option of sleeping indoors, the government cannot criminalize indigent, homeless people for sleeping outdoors, on public property, on the false premise they had a choice in the matter.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 617. In so doing, the Ninth Circuit emphasized that its holding was \"a narrow one\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Naturally, our holding does not cover individuals who\n   <em>\n    do\n   </em>\n   have access to adequate temporary shelter, whether because they have the means to pay for it or because it is realistically available to them for free, but who choose not to use it. Nor do we suggest that a jurisdiction with insufficient shelter can never criminalize the act of sleeping outside. Even where shelter is unavailable, an ordinance prohibiting sitting, lying, or sleeping outside at particular times or in particular locations might well be constitutionally permissible. So, too, might an ordinance barring the obstruction of public rights of way or the erection of certain structures. Whether some other ordinance is consistent with the Eighth Amendment will depend, as here, on whether it punishes a person for lacking the means to live out the \"universal and\n   unavoidable consequences of being human\" in the way the ordinance prescribes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 617 n.8 (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   's holding does not extend to the situation here. First, the City's decision to require Plaintiffs to temporarily vacate their encampment does not, by itself, implicate any criminal sanctions that would trigger Eighth Amendment protections. Nothing in the notice of temporary closure or elsewhere in the record suggests that the City intends to issue criminal sanctions as part of the temporary closure operation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Rather, it appears from Plaintiffs' motion that the criminal sanction they fear is a citation or arrest for failing to vacate the encampment. ECF No. 7 at 4-5. The Court notes that there is no evidence in the record that the City has previously enforced temporary enclosures via citations or arrests. However, even assuming (as Plaintiffs do) that this might occur, remaining at a particular encampment on public property is not conduct protected by\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   , especially where the closure is temporary in nature. The Ninth Circuit was clear: \"[W]e in no way dictate to the City that it must provide sufficient shelter for the homeless, or allow anyone who wishes to sit, lie, or sleep on the streets ... at any time and at any place.\"\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520710\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/920/584/#p603\">\n    920 F.3d at 617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alteration in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5322325\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/444/1118/#p1135\">\n    444 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1138 ). This is not a case where \"homeless plaintiffs do not have a single place where they can lawfully be\" within the City.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5322325\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/444/1118/#p1135\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Pottinger v.

It is equally possible that the items in question were properly seized and destroyed because they were unsafe, hazardous to store, or a threat to public health or safety, as it is that they were not.
