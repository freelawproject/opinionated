We conclude that <em>Johnson</em> has no application to Smith's Section 924(c) conviction and sentence. Accordingly, we will deny Smith's motion.</p><p id=\"p-8\"><strong>I. <em>Factual Background &amp; Procedural History</em></strong></p><p id=\"p-9\">This matter was initiated by way of criminal complaint against Smith filed on September 4, 2012. A grand jury thereafter returned a two-count indictment charging Smith with carjacking in violation of <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202119\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2119</extracted-citation> (Count 1) and using, carrying, and brandishing a firearm-specifically, a .44 caliber Ruger Super Red Hawk revolver-in furtherance of the carjacking offense in violation of <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924</extracted-citation>(c)(1)(A) (Count 2). The grand jury returned a superseding indictment on May 9, 2013, retaining the original counts but correcting the firearm in Count 2 to a .22 caliber Colt Frontier Scout revolver, identifying it by serial number, and noting that the firearm was loaded with six .22 caliber rounds. On June 13, 2013, the grand jury returned a second superseding indictment, adding a charge against Smith for possession of a stolen firearm in violation of <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922</extracted-citation>(j) (Count 3). The case proceeded to a jury trial on August 5, 2013. After three days of evidence, the jury found Smith guilty on all counts.</p><p id=\"p-10\">The court sentenced Smith to an aggregate term of 171 months' imprisonment, consisting of a term of 87 months on each of Counts 1 and 3, to be served concurrently, followed by a statutorily mandated, consecutive term of 84 months on Count 2. (Doc. 116); <em>see</em> <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924</extracted-citation>(c)(1)(A)(ii). Smith appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, and the Third Circuit affirmed Smith's conviction and sentence on July 22, 2014, <em>see</em> <em>United States v. Smith</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203661\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/767/187/\">767 F.3d 187</extracted-citation> (3d Cir. 2014).</p><p id=\"p-11\">Smith filed the instant motion (Doc. 127) to vacate and correct his sentence on May 18, 2016, through appointed counsel. After the motion was fully briefed, we stayed its disposition at the request of Smith's counsel, pending several Third Circuit and Supreme Court decisions which had the potential to directly impact Smith's arguments. On May 8, 2018, we lifted the stay and ordered supplemental briefing. Smith's motion is now ripe for disposition.</p><p id=\"p-12\"><strong>II. <em>Standard of Review</em></strong></p><p id=\"p-13\">Under Section 2255, a federal prisoner may move the sentencing court to vacate, set aside, or correct the prisoner's sentence. <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255</extracted-citation>.

The Third Circuit, however, charted a different course, concluding that the categorical approach is inapplicable when the predicate offense and the Section 924(c) offense are \"contemporaneous and tried to the same jury.\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175092\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/844/137/#p140\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> The panel reasoned that, in such cases, \"all necessary facts are before the district court,\" rendering the \"remedial effect of the 'categorical' approach\" unnecessary. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175092\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/844/137/#p140\">Id.</extracted-citation></em></p><p id=\"p-19\">The <em>Robinson</em> court thus held that the proper inquiry is not whether Hobbs Act robbery, in isolation, is a qualifying crime of violence, but whether \"Hobbs Act robbery <em>committed while brandishing a firearm</em> \" is a crime of violence. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175092\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/844/137/#p140\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175092\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/844/137/#p140\"> at 144</extracted-citation>. The answer, the court said, \"must be yes.\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175092\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/844/137/#p140\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> The court identified the elements of Hobbs Act robbery, specifically the requirement that the defendant take property \"by means of actual or threatened force, or violence, or fear of injury, immediate or future.\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175092\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/844/137/#p140\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175092\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/844/137/#p140\"> at 143-44</extracted-citation> (quoting <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201951\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951</extracted-citation>(b)(1) ). The court then underscored the definition of \"brandish,\" to wit: \"when all or part of the firearm is displayed or made known to another person in order to intimidate that person.\" <em><extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201951\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201951\"> at 144</extracted-citation> (quoting <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924</extracted-citation>(c)(4) ). Analyzing the convictions under these statutes in tandem, the court observed that the jury necessarily found that the defendant, in committing Hobbs Act robbery, \"used or threatened force, violence, or injury to person or property,\" and \"used a firearm in order to intimidate a person.\" <em><extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> The court concluded that this combination of convictions demonstrates that the defendant's commission of Hobbs Act robbery was a crime of violence under the elements clause. <em><extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\"> at 141, 144</extracted-citation>.</p><p id=\"p-20\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"360\" href=\"#p360\" id=\"p360\">*360</a><em>Robinson</em> mandates the same outcome here.

Moreover, carjacking includes the added element that the defendant act \"<em>with the intent to cause death or serious bodily harm.</em> \" <em><extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202119\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> (emphasis added). Like <em>Robinson</em>, the jury's verdict against Smith on the Section 924(c)(1)(A)(ii) brandishing charge \"shed[s] light on the means by which the predicate offense was committed.\" <em>Robinson</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175092\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/844/137/#p140\">844 F.3d at 143</extracted-citation>. In finding Smith guilty of these contemporaneous offenses, the jury necessarily concluded that Smith committed carjacking (1) by force or violence, or by intimidation, and (2) displayed a firearm to intimidate a person. Under <em>Robinson</em>, Smith's conviction for carjacking while brandishing a firearm is categorically a crime of violence under the elements clause of Section 924(c)(3).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-21\"><strong>IV. <em>Conclusion</em></strong></p><p id=\"p-22\">We conclude that Smith is not entitled to Section 2255 relief based on the Supreme Court's decision in <em>Johnson</em>.
