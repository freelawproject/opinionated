Defendant argues Count III should be dismissed because Plaintiff fails to plead factual matter showing any statements were made \"with respect to the rental of a dwelling.\" As explained below, Plaintiff adequately states a Section 760.23(3) claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   First, oral statements are actionable under Section 3604(c).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Richards\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%201065141\">\n    2005 WL 1065141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (sustaining Section 3604(c) claim premised on orally expressed sexually harassing statements);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20100.75\">\n    24 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (\"The prohibitions in this section shall apply to all written or\n   oral notices or statements by a person engaged in\" renting a dwelling).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Second, the Court disagrees with Defendant's argument that the alleged statements were \"\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      unrelated\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   to the decisional process to rent the property to Plaintiff.\" (D.E. 9 at 5 (emphasis in original).) By its terms, the alleged communication-\"that if Plaintiff refused to be his girlfriend, then Plaintiff wouldn't be allowed to renew her lease when it expired\" (D.E. 1 at \u00b6 16(e) )-could not be more directly related to the decisional process about whether to renew Plaintiff's lease in the future (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   \"with respect to the rental of [the] dwelling\"). As alleged, Defendant's statement imposed a condition-that Plaintiff be Defendant's girlfriend-upon Plaintiff renewing her lease on the dwelling she rented from Defendant at the time of the alleged statement. This conclusion is buttressed by several other alleged instances of Defendant's sexually harassing behavior toward Plaintiff (some of which were directly rebuffed by Plaintiff), which are all sewn together by Plaintiff's allegation that \"Defendant folio wed-through with his threat to not renew Plaintiff's lease agreement when it became expired in March 2017.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17.) Taken as true, the reasonable inference is that Defendant declined renewing the lease because Plaintiff would not have sexual relations or enter into a relationship with Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Next, Defendant argues Plaintiff fails to state a claim because his statements \"occurred\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      after\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   Defendant already rented the property to Plaintiff.\" (D.E. 9 at 5 (emphasis in original).)

By analogy here, it would be anomalous to say Defendant was prohibited from conditioning Plaintiff's first lease agreement on being Defendant's girlfriend, but Defendant would not be prohibited from conditioning a lease renewal upon the same condition. Imposing such conditions on continued occupancy of a rental property is undoubtedly the kind of sexual harassment the Florida Fair Housing Act prohibits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7 (sustaining Section 3604(c) claim alleging \"submission to [defendant's] sexual advances was a condition of continued occupancy\"). In short, the reasonable inference is Defendant's statement was directed toward his decision to decline renewing the lease. Thus, the second element is adequately pleaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Third, as discussed above, Plaintiff's allegations of several instances of sexually harassing conduct by Defendant are sufficient to plead discriminatory animus.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Sec. III.A.1.c. And these allegations are cap-stoned by the allegation Defendant followed through with his threat not to renew Plaintiff's lease upon expiration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Accordingly, the Complaint adequately pleads the final Section 760.23(3) claim element: that Defendant discriminated against Plaintiff on the basis of sex in his decision not to renew Plaintiff's lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Finally, Defendant argues \"it is implausible that Plaintiff wished to remain in this allegedly 'hostile environment' for another year\" and that the implausibility of Plaintiff's claim is highlighted by Plaintiff's failure \"to even allege that she attempted to renew the lease but was refused.\" (D.E. 9 at 5.) This argument is amiss. The plausibility standard applies to the elements of a claim-that is, Plaintiff must plead \"sufficient factual matter\" to make her Section 760.23(3) claim \"plausible on its face.\"\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But Plaintiff is not required to plead that she intended, or even took action toward renewing her lease to state a claim under Section 760.23(3) because this provision imposes liability for the discriminatory \"\n   <em>\n    mak[ing], print[ing], or publish[ing] ...

Reviewing the Complaint, the Court finds no allegation that Plaintiff was \"ready, willing, and able\" to continue occupancy when the lease expired. Plaintiff alleges she \"was current on rent at th[e] time\" Defendant verbally informed her that he \"wanted Plaintiff to vacate the Premises once the lease expired.\" (D.E. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 44-45.)

Section 760.23(2) targets narrower and different behavior than Section 760.23(3) : the\n    <em>\n     former\n    </em>\n    targets only the discriminatory nature of the \"terms\" and \"conditions\" of the\n    <em>\n     transaction\n    </em>\n    to sell or rent a dwelling, while the\n    <em>\n     latter\n    </em>\n    targets broader conduct, namely, discriminatory \"notice[s], statement[s], or advertisement[s]\" made in the\n    <em>\n     management\n    </em>\n    of selling or renting a dwelling.\n    <em>\n     Compare\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20760.23\">\n     Fla.

This is why being \"ready, willing, and able\" is a required element of a Section 760.23(2) claim, but not a Section 760.23(3) claim. This is also consistent with the Court's Section 3617 analysis concerning\n    <em>\n     quid pro quo\n    </em>\n    harassment. Section 3617 protects against unlawful \"coerc[ion], intimidat[ion], threat[s to], or interfer[ence with]\" fair housing rights. So, Defendant could still interfere with Plaintiff's housing rights through sexually harassing behavior and conditioning a future lease renewal on sexual relations, even without Plaintiff alleging she was \"ready, willing, and able\" to renew the lease.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
