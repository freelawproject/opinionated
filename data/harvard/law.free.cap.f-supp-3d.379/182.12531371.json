For the reasons set forth below, the Court denies Defendant's request for a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing and finds that suppression of the items recovered from the search of Unit #632 is not warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The background of this matter is set forth in detail in the Court's Decision and Order entered October 5, 2018 (Dkt. 127) (the \"October 5th Decision and Order\"), familiarity with which is assumed for purposes of this Decision and Order. The Court will summarize the relevant factual and procedural background as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A search warrant authorizing the search of Unit #632 was signed by Erie County Court Judge Kenneth F. Case on or about May 17, 2017. (Dkt. 35-2 at 9). Two days earlier (the date of Defendant's arrest), Judge Case signed a search warrant authorizing a search of Room #113 at the Comfort Inn and Suites Buffalo Airport Hotel (hereinafter referred to as \"the Comfort Suites\"). (Dkt. 44-1 at 5-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Judge Case's notes for the search warrant issued for Room #113 reference Dominic Daniels meeting with Defendant, described as a \"known cocaine dealer,\" in Room #113 at the Comfort Suites and purchasing a large quantity of cocaine. (Def. Ex. 11 A\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ). The notes further reference Mr. Daniels' arrest with a \u00bd kilogram of cocaine, Defendant's possession of the key to Room #113 at the time of his arrest, and, the Erie County Sheriff's Department (\"ECSD\") having confirmed with the hotel that Defendant had rented Room #113. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The notes also reference Defendant's arrest after fleeing from law enforcement at the Comfort Suites. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On May 17, 2017, Detective Timothy Donovan of the ECSD swore out an affidavit in support of the warrant to search the storage locker. (Govt. Ex.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   28). In that affidavit, Detective Donovan stated that\n   Defendant had a rental agreement for Unit #632, and at the time of his arrest two days earlier, Defendant had in his possession two storage keys. Detective Donovan also stated that on May 17, 2017, \"Apollo,\" an ECSD narcotics dog, positively indicated on Unit #632. A separate affidavit signed by Apollo's handler, Deputy Robert Galbraith of the ECSD, confirmed the positive indication for a narcotic odor on Unit #632 and set forth Apollo's training and certifications. (Govt. Ex. 45). In addition, Judge Case's notes generated in connection with the search warrant for the storage locker stated, in addition to the foregoing, that the keys possessed by Defendant at the time of his arrest fit into the lock on Unit #632, Defendant had a significant history of cocaine dealing, and that the prior affidavits were relevant and incorporated into the warrant application for the storage unit. (Dkt. 124).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On December 5, 2017, Defendant filed an omnibus pretrial motion seeking several forms of relief, including suppression of the storage locker evidence. (Dkt. 35-1 at 13). On October 5, 2018, the Court denied Defendant's suppression motion as to the evidence recovered from Unit #632. (Dkt. 127 at 43-45 (rejecting Defendant's arguments that storage locker evidence should be suppressed on grounds that underlying arrest and seizure was unlawful, and that dog sniff in curtilage of locker violated Defendant's Fourth Amendment rights)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On November 6, 2018, one day before Defendant's trial was originally scheduled to begin, Defendant filed the instant motion. (Dkt. 154). Defendant argued that newly discovered evidence indicates that the day prior to the issuance of the search warrant for Unit # 632, a different narcotics dog did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   alert on it, and that this newly discovered evidence requires a hearing pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   (Dkt. 154 at 3). Because of the then-pending trial, the Government filed its opposition to Defendant's motion the same day. (Dkt. 158). For reasons unrelated to the instant motion, Defendant's trial was subsequently adjourned to May 14, 2019. (Dkt. 161; Dkt. 168; Dkt. 189).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On May 7, 2019, the Court held an evidentiary hearing. (Dkt. 203). The Government presented testimony from Brian Krull, area manager of operations for Life Storage, Deputy Galbraith, Detective Donovan, and Detective Timothy Carney of the ECSD. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Defendant presented testimony from Shrell Sheppard, the mother of one of his children. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Court heard oral argument of Defendant's motion on May 9, 2019. (Dkt. 206). Defendant also filed a letter in advance of the oral argument outlining relevant case law and some of his arguments. (Dkt. 205). At the time of oral argument, the Court reserved decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant argues that the new information about the dog sniff (namely, that a day prior to the search warrant for Unit #632 being issued a different dog did not alert on it) requires the Court to hold a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing and ultimately to suppress the evidence recovered from Unit #632.

In support of this argument, the Government presented evidence that Defendant entered into a rental agreement for Unit #632 on July 15, 2016. (Govt. Ex. 26). The rental agreement was month-to-month and required Defendant to pay $ 236.00 by the first day of each calendar month. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The rental agreement further provided that the owner of the storage unit shall have a lien on all personal property stored at the facility and that in the event of a failure to pay rent, the owner would take \"any or all of the following actions\": (1) terminate or not renew the rental agreement; (2) after five days of default, overlock the storage unit and deny the customer the right of access; (3) after the fifth day of the month, assess a $ 15.00\n   late charge; (4) after the twentieth day of the month, assess a $ 25.00 late charge; (5) after 30 days of default, enforce the lien, including by cutting the customer's lock and removing and selling the personal property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Mr. Krull, the area manager of operations for Life Storage, testified that if a customer failed to timely make payment on the first of the month, a late fee of $ 15.00 would be assessed, an overlock would be placed on the storage unit, and the electronic access code allowing the customer to enter the facility would be deactivated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   He further testified, and Life Storage's records confirmed, that Defendant did not timely pay his rent on May 1, 2017, and that the rent remained past due on May 17, 2017, when the search of Unit #632 was conducted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Government contends that, on these facts, Defendant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in Unit #632.

Life Storage's records establish that Defendant had, on other occasions, fallen comparably behind in his rent and subsequently caught up on his payments without interference with his property. Indeed, the proof at the evidentiary hearing established that Defendant did just that after execution of the search warrant. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Govt.

Moreover, based on Defendant's prior dealings with Life Storage and the express terms of his rental agreement, he had no reason to believe that falling two weeks behind in rent would have repercussions regarding his continued possession of the personal property he had stored in Unit #632.

At that appearance, defense counsel implied that it was improper for the Court, in assessing the validity of the search warrant, to take into account the information set forth in Judge Case's notes. Although Defendant failed to make this argument in his moving papers, and although Defendant was the party who initially sought to have Judge Case's notes produced and has cited them in support of his arguments, the Court has nonetheless conducted its own research and concludes that Judge Case's notes are relevant and may be considered in the Court's analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Detective Donovan appeared before Judge Case and provided sworn testimony in support of the application for a warrant to search Unit #632.

In this case, there is no question that Apollo was adequately and appropriately trained. Moreover, Deputy Galbraith credibly testified that nothing about the conditions on May 17, 2017, caused him to have any concerns about the reliability of Apollo's alert on Unit #632. The Court thus easily concludes that, as with the dog in\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   Apollo's \"sniff\" was \"up to snuff.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407425\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/237/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407425\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/237/\">\n    at 248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407425\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/237/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1050\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Apollo's positive alert was accordingly sufficient to support a finding of probable cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The other evidence in front of Judge Case, considered in connection with Apollo's positive alert, amply supported the existence of probable cause. As the Court explained in the October 5th Decision and Order, Judge Case was aware at the time he issued the search warrant that Defendant had a rental agreement for Unit #632, that he possessed the keys to Unit #632 at the time of his arrest, that he had a known history of drug-trafficking, and that he had fled from law enforcement at the Comfort Suites where Mr. Daniels had been observed before he was subsequently apprehended with a large quantity of cocaine.

Moreover, and as the Court has noted, there was additional information before Judge Case to support his ultimate probable cause determination. Under these circumstances, the Court finds that even had Detective Donovan included information about the earlier negative dog sniff in his affidavit, it would not have altered the probable cause determination.
