The Court reserves ruling on all other issues and claims not discussed below (including all claims advanced by the Automotive Recycler Plaintiffs). For the reasons discussed below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART\n   </strong>\n   the Defendants' Motions to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs are consumers of Defendants' vehicles that are equipped with Takata airbags containing the propellant ammonium nitrate. Plaintiffs allege ammonium nitrate is an innately volatile and unstable propellant that imposes an unreasonable risk of serious foreseeable harm or death\n   upon drivers of Defendants' vehicles. The crux of Plaintiffs' legal claims is that Defendants knew or should have known of these defects prior to installing the Takata airbags in their vehicles, and that Defendants concealed from, or failed to notify, the Plaintiffs and the general public of the full and complete nature of the defect, despite being aware of problems arising during the design and testing process, and through various rupture incidents and recalls. Defendants vigorously contest the sufficiency of Plaintiffs' allegations, and the constitutional bases for this Court to exercise personal jurisdiction over Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On March 14, 2018, Plaintiffs commenced this litigation against Defendants by simultaneously filing four complaints in district courts where the Defendants are incorporated, or hold their principal places of business, and by filing three complaints directly in this MDL proceeding. The four complaints filed in transferor district courts (collectively, the \"Transferor Complaints\") include:\n   <em>\n    Brugaletta, et. al., v. General Motors Company, et al.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 2:18-cv-10852-PDB-DRG (E.D. Mich. Mar. 14, 2018) (\"\n   <em>\n    Brugaletta\n   </em>\n   \");\n   <em>\n    Dwinnells, et. al., v. FCA US LLC\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 2:18-cv-10848-BAF-APP (E.D. Mich. Mar. 14, 2018) (\"\n   <em>\n    Dwinnells\n   </em>\n   \");\n   <em>\n    Maestri, et. al., v. Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC, et. al.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 1:18-cv-01070-WSD (N.D. Ga. Mar. 14, 2018) (\"\n   <em>\n    Maestri\n   </em>\n   \"); and\n   <em>\n    McBride v. Audi of America, LLC, et al.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 1:18-cv-00284-LO-MSN (E.D. Va. Mar. 14, 2018) (\"\n   <em>\n    McBride\n   </em>\n   \").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The same day Plaintiffs filed the Transferor Complaints, they also filed in the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation's (\"JPML\") docket a notice of potential tag-along actions concerning these four complaints.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Takata Airbag Litigation\n   </em>\n   , MDL No. 2599, D.E. 962 (J.P.M.L. Mar. 14, 2018). This Court later accepted the JPML's transfer of\n   <em>\n    Brugaletta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Dwinnells\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    McBride\n   </em>\n   into this MDL in April 2018 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   D.E. 2467, 2532-33, 2644), and accepted transfer of\n   <em>\n    Maestri\n   </em>\n   in June 2018 (D.E. 2881).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The same day the Transferor Complaints were filed, Plaintiffs directly filed three complaints in this MDL proceeding:\n   <em>\n    Boyd\n   </em>\n   (D.E. 2429);\n   <em>\n    Whitaker\n   </em>\n   (D.E. 2428); and\n   <em>\n    Puhalla\n   </em>\n   (D.E. 2430) (collectively, the \"Consolidated Class Action Complaints\"). In May 2018, Plaintiffs amended each of the Consolidated Class Action Complaints, pursuant to Court Order, to excluded claims asserted by the so-called \"Recycler Plaintiffs.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.E. 2651.) It is these \"Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaints\" (collectively, the \"Direct File Complaints\"), that Defendants' Motions seek to dismiss in their entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. SUBSTANCE OF UNDERLYING COMPLAINTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Direct File Complaints are not simply consolidations of the Transferor Complaints. The Direct File Complaints include several new plaintiffs who are not named in the Transferor Complaints and who have not separately filed lawsuits in any other federal district court: the\n   <em>\n    Boyd\n   </em>\n   Complaint includes one new plaintiff, Victor Khoury of Florida, who does not appear in\n   the\n   <em>\n    Dwinnells\n   </em>\n   Complaint; the\n   <em>\n    Whitaker\n   </em>\n   Complaint includes one new plaintiff, David Whitaker of Florida, who does not appear in the\n   <em>\n    Brugaletta\n   </em>\n   Complaint; and the\n   <em>\n    Puhalla\n   </em>\n   Complaint includes 23 new plaintiffs\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   who never appear in the\n   <em>\n    Alters\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    McBride\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Krmpotic\n   </em>\n   , or\n   <em>\n    Maestri\n   </em>\n   Complaints.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Furthermore, while the Transferor Complaints assert common-law claims for negligence, fraud, and/or unjust enrichment, in addition to claims for violations of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act and the deceptive trade practices statutes of the states where each Transferor Complaint was filed, the Direct File Complaints add a litany of new claims-on behalf of the new plaintiffs and the plaintiffs originating in the Transferor Complaints-including nationwide RICO class action claims, statewide class action claims arising under numerous state deceptive trade practices statutes, claims for breach of the implied warranty of merchantability under the laws of several states, and in some cases, new common-law claims. In this Order, the plaintiffs originating in the Transferor Complaints are referred to as the \"Transferor Plaintiffs,\" and the new plaintiffs originating in the Direct File Complaints are referred to as the \"Direct File Plaintiffs.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   It is true that the Direct File Complaints subsumed the claims advanced in the Transferor Complaints, but to be clear, Plaintiffs did not simply consolidate two separate legal actions. Instead of filing separate lawsuits in the Southern District of Florida, seeking intra-district transfer of these cases into the MDL proceeding, and then consolidating the locally filed actions with the Transferor Complaints-as the MDL procedural scheme anticipates-Plaintiffs filed the \"Consolidated\" Class Action Complaints directly in this Court's MDL docket. These complaints directly add the Direct File Plaintiffs and their respective claims, while also adding new claims on behalf of the Transferor Plaintiffs. To this extent, the Direct File Plaintiffs and their claims, and the new claims asserted by the Transferor Plaintiffs, are \"direct-filed\" here in this MDL proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"A pleading that states a claim for relief must contain ... a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Fed.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendants separately move to dismiss with prejudice each of the Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaints under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2) for lack of personal jurisdiction. Defendants argue\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   : (1) the Court lacks general personal jurisdiction under the MDL statute, 28 U.S.C. Section 1407, because the Plaintiffs direct-filed the Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaints in the MDL proceeding, and because none of the Defendants are \"at home\" in Florida; and (2) the Court lacks specific personal jurisdiction under the RICO statute's nationwide service of process provision, 18 U.S.C. Section 1965(d), because Plaintiffs fail to state a plausible RICO claim. In response, Plaintiffs argue the Court can exercise personal jurisdiction over all Defendants pursuant to its authority as an MDL transferee court under Section 1407, and under the RICO statute's nationwide service of process provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The personal jurisdiction issues before the Court are unusual because Plaintiffs filed. complaints directly in this MDL proceeding, while also separately transferring related, but significantly different complaints, into the MDL proceeding through the JPML, from district courts where many of the Defendants are jurisdictionally \"at home.\" The complexity of the personal jurisdiction issues are further heightened by Plaintiffs' attempt to invoke personal jurisdiction over German parent corporations. Defendants zealously oppose Plaintiffs' filing strategy and the asserted bases for personal jurisdiction. The Court addresses the Defendants' challenges in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    A. CHALLENGES TO DIRECT FILING\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendants lodge numerous jurisdictional attacks from several angles based on the Plaintiffs' decision to file the Direct File Complaints. The Court notes that direct filing complaints in MDL proceedings is not uncommon, nor is it\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   impermissible under the MDL statute, the JPML Rules of Procedure, or interpretive case law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.P.M.L. R. 7.2(a) (\"Potential tag-along actions filed in the transferee district do not require Panel action.

Here, Defendants did not stipulate to waiving personal jurisdiction. And indeed, Defendants are well within their rights to raise such challenges. Accordingly, the Court must resolve the claim splitting, personal jurisdiction, and other related challenges within the context of Plaintiffs' strategic decision to simultaneously file the Transferor Complaints and the related, but significantly different, Direct File Complaints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    B. CHALLENGES TO AMENDMENTS TO COMPLAINTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Multiple Defendants take issue with Plaintiffs asserting several new claims-particularly nationwide RICO class action claims-for the first time in the Direct File Complaints. But Plaintiffs' decision to add new claims on behalf of the Transferor Plaintiffs directly in the MDL proceeding is procedurally permissible, and does not by itself strip this Court of jurisdiction. Allowing MDL plaintiffs to amend their pleadings is consistent with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(2)'s directive that district courts \"should freely give leave [to amend] when justice so requires,\" and \"the general rule that, in multidistrict litigation, a transferee judge can handle all types of pretrial matters that otherwise would have been handled by the transferor court,\"\n   <em>\n    In re Korean Air Lines Co., Ltd., Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3384759\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/642/685/#p699\">\n    642 F.3d 685\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 699 (9th Cir. 2011). Indeed, many MDL transferee courts have allowed plaintiffs to amend a transferred-in complaint to add new causes of action at early stages in the proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Nelson v.

CHALLENGES TO TIMING OF THE JPML'S TRANSFER OF THE TRANSFEROR COMPLAINTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   FCA challenges the timing of the Transferor Complaints being transferred into this MDL proceeding. Specifically, FCA argues the Direct File Complaints should be dismissed with prejudice for lack of general personal jurisdiction because even though the Transferor Complaints\n   were \"transferred into the MDL, this occurred\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs filed the [Direct File Complaints].\" (D.E. 2983 at 29 n.10 (emphasis in original).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   This Court confronted-and rejected-a similar argument in another multidistrict litigation case.

Specifically, the Direct File Complaints add numerous new plaintiffs asserting a myriad of new claims for the first time, and, while the Direct File Complaints were originally stylized as\n   <em>\n    Consolidated\n   </em>\n   Class Action complaints, in reality, the Direct File Complaints also amended the Transferor Complaints by asserting new claims on behalf of the Transferor Plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Sec.I.B. As the Supreme Court has recognized, \"[n]ormally, an amended complaint supersedes the original complaint,\"\n   <em>\n    Pac. Bell Tel. Co. v.

For these reasons, the significant substantive amendments strongly suggest, if not direct, the Court to treat the Direct File Complaints as legally operative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Second, it appears Plaintiffs intended for the Direct File Complaints to be legally operative. During oral argument, counsel for FCA suggested the Court treat the Transferor Complaints and Direct File Complaints separately at the motion to dismiss stage. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.E. 3201 at 105:6-106:20.) Counsel for Plaintiffs strenuously opposed this suggestion, and argued it: \"doesn't make any sense\" because \"the claims ... are the same as to all the plaintiffs,\" and it would be \"contrary ... to, number one, MDL practice, which is to consolidate all the claims because they all share the same sort of issues, facts\" and \"[n]umber two ... we've got RICO claims here that encompass not simply Florida plaintiffs, but also non-Florida plaintiffs, so this belongs\n   <em>\n    in one Complaint\n   </em>\n   .\" (D.E. 3201 at 106:21-23, 107:7-8, 12-18 (emphasis added).) Furthermore, Plaintiffs stylized the Direct File Complaints as\n   <em>\n    Consolidated\n   </em>\n   Class Action Complaints, which-in contrast to stylizing them as an \"administrative summary\" of all claims by all plaintiffs-suggests the Direct File Complaints were \"meant to have legal effect.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Refrigerant Compressors Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049309\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/731/586/#p591\">\n    731 F.3d 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 591 (6th Cir. 2013). These reasons also warrant treating the Direct File Complaints as legally operative.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049309\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/731/586/#p591\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049309\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/731/586/#p591\">\n    at 588-92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (determining legally operative complaint based in part on the plaintiffs stylizing their complaint as \"consolidated amended complaint,\" and noting that the court's \"holding rest[ed] on the\n   <em>\n    plaintiffs'\n   </em>\n   decision to file a\n   <em>\n    legally operative\n   </em>\n   combined complaint\") (emphases in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Finally, the Court notes that Defendants waived service of the Direct File Complaints (D.E. 2840), and all the parties' moving papers address only the Direct File Complaints. These factors also warrant treating the Direct File Complaints as legally operative.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Refrigerant Compressors Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049309\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/731/586/#p591\">\n    731 F.3d at 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (treating \"consolidated amended complaint\" as legally operative in part because the parties' moving papers and the district court's order only addressed the consolidated complaint, and because the plaintiffs served the consolidated complaint on defendants, instead of serving individual complaints).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Because the Direct File Complaints supersede the Transferor Complaints,\n   <em>\n    Pac.

CLAIM SPLITTING CHALLENGE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Treating the Direct File Complaints as legally operative indirectly resolves Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen's claim splitting challenge. Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen argue that the Transferor Complaints and Direct File Complaints are \"duplicative lawsuits,\" and that by filing them both, Plaintiffs have \"violated the prohibition against claim splitting in a transparent attempt to simultaneously circumvent Defendants' rights to a jury trial in the transferor courts where Plaintiffs originally filed their actions and to manufacture jurisdiction before this Court where none exists.\" (D.E. 2988 at 34.) They further argue the \"appropriate remedy\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   is dismissal of the\n   <em>\n    Puhalla\n   </em>\n   Complaint because failure to do so \"would unfairly allow Plaintiffs to have it both ways: [i]f they fail to establish jurisdiction, they will merely seek to fall back on [the Transferor Complaints]. If they succeed, they will have circumvented Defendants' right to a jury trial in the transferor courts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   While the Court appreciates Defendants' concern that Plaintiffs may be getting \"two bites at the apple,\" the Defendants need not worry that Plaintiffs will \"have it both ways\" because the Transferor Complaints are dismissed. As such, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen's Motion to Dismiss on claim splitting grounds is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   -to the extent there are no longer multiple legally operative complaints against them. To be clear, Plaintiffs still must meet their burden of establishing the Court can exercise personal jurisdiction over Defendants based on the allegations and claims set forth in the Direct File Complaints. To the extent Plaintiffs cannot satisfy their burden, those claims will be dismissed, and Plaintiffs cannot then litigate those claims elsewhere; and to the extent Plaintiffs establish personal jurisdiction, the Court will resolve all pretrial matters and remand the appropriate legal actions for trial to the appropriate district courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Because this Court \"likes to think ahead, but also address[ ] the issues before it\" (D.E. 3201 at 118:16-17), it is ideal to address the issue of remand before resolving jurisdictional challenges because, as noted above, direct-file complaints in MDL proceedings create \"oddit[ies] when cases are eventually transferred to the plaintiffs' home districts for trial, [because] the traditional 'transferor'/'transferee' roles will be reversed.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Vioxx Prods.

It is also ideal to discuss remand at this time because at the heart of the claim splitting challenge is Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen's concern regarding where Plaintiffs' legal actions will be tried.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    F.

SEVERANCE OF CLAIMS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The parties frame the general personal jurisdiction issues as \"all or nothing.\" Defendants contend the Court entirely lacks general personal jurisdiction over them under Section 1407 because there are no transferor courts in this action, as reflected by the Direct File Complaints. (D.E. 2983 at 28-29; D.E. 2988 at 37-38; D.E. 3103 at 19.) Defendants thus seek to treat all legal actions as directly filed in the MDL proceeding. But this is not totally accurate. The Transferor Plaintiffs assert several claims in the Transferor Complaints filed in other district courts, which were later transferred into this MDL proceeding by the JPML-which all Defendants concede in footnote in their moving papers. (D.E. 2981 at 32 n.4 (noting\n   <em>\n    Brugaletta\n   </em>\n   was \"separately-filed ... in the Eastern District of Michigan\" and \"has been transferred into this MDL\"); D.E. 2983 at 29 n.10 (\n   <em>\n    \"Dwinnells\n   </em>\n   was transferred into the MDL ....\"); D.E. 2988 at 37 n.14 (referring to\n   <em>\n    Alters\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    McBride\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Krmpotic\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Maestri\n   </em>\n   as \"\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   transferred in cases\") (emphasis in original).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   On the other hand, Plaintiffs assert the Court can exercise general personal jurisdiction \"over all Plaintiffs' claims against Defendants\" pursuant to its authority as an MDL transferee court under Section 1407. (D.E. 3034 at 50.) Plaintiffs thus seek to treat all legal actions as filed in the transferor district courts. But this too does not present a full picture. As demonstrated above, the Direct File Complaints include several new plaintiffs and a myriad of new claims that were never separately filed in the Southern District of Florida or any other federal district court.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Sec.I.B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Court disagrees with the parties that the legal actions asserted should be treated as either \"all transferred-in\" or \"all direct-filed.\" Section 1407(a) is clear:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \"[e]ach\n   <em>\n    action\n   </em>\n   so transferred shall be remanded by the panel at or before the conclusion of such pretrial proceedings to the district from which it was transferred ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201407\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (emphasis added). Here, it is clear to the Court that based on Plaintiffs' filing strategy, and consistent with Section 1407(a), there are two types of legal actions: the Transferor Plaintiffs' legal actions and the Direct File Plaintiffs' legal actions. Even though the Transferor Plaintiffs' legal actions were amended by the Direct File Complaints to add nationwide-class RICO claims and statewide-class state consumer protection statute claims, these amendments do not magically transform the legal actions initiated by the Transferor Plaintiffs in transferor district courts, such that the new claims escape Section 1407(a) remand to the appropriate transferor courts for trial. Simply put, because the Transferor Plaintiffs' legal actions were commenced in transferor district courts, these legal actions-even though they were amended in this MDL proceeding-must be remanded back to the appropriate transferor district court under Section 1407(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   At oral argument, counsel for Plaintiffs suggested that a nationwide RICO class action could be tried in this Court: \"[w]hen you're talking about a national class action under RICO or a Federal statute, I think this Court has jurisdiction to try that class assuming it's got Florida plaintiffs and Florida class members, which this Court has a lot of.\" (D.E. 3201 at 109:18-22.) In response to Plaintiffs' suggestion, the Court expressed serious doubts that as an MDL transferee court, it could try a nationwide RICO class action simply because Plaintiffs direct-filed RICO claims once the Transferor Complaints were transferred into this MDL proceeding by the JPML. The Court explained that Plaintiffs' theory would mean that, \"in essence, if you [direct] file a class action and include RICO, you've gotten rid of\n   <em>\n    Lexecon\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201407\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201407\">\n    at 109:23-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   After fully considering oral argument and carefully reviewing the moving papers, the Court confirms its previously expressed doubts: permitting Plaintiffs to obtain a jury trial in an MDL transferee court simply by direct-filing nationwide class action claims under the RICO statute-which grants federal district courts nationwide jurisdiction under a nationwide service of process provision-\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the JPML\n   <em>\n    completes transfer\n   </em>\n   of the legal actions commencing the litigation, would not only thwart the entire purpose of the MDL statute, but it would also turn the Supreme Court's ruling in\n   <em>\n    Lexecon\n   </em>\n   on its head. To permit this practice would also allow Plaintiffs to obtain a jury trial in this MDL transferee court over all remaining claims-including newly asserted common-law and statewide class action claims-under the doctrine of pendant personal jurisdiction, which provides that \"where a federal statute authorizes nationwide service of process and the federal and state claims 'derive from a common nucleus of operative facts ... the district court may assert personal jurisdiction over the parties to the related state law claims even if personal jurisdiction is not otherwise available.' \"\n   <em>\n    Azalp LLC v.

This Order does not bar Plaintiffs from getting the nationwide RICO class action trial they seek. Rather, this Order makes clear that if any of the underlying legal actions go to trial, they will do so in the appropriate MDL transferor court-which is consistent with\n   <em>\n    Lexecon\n   </em>\n   , and required by Section 1407(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In short, the Transferor Plaintiffs commenced their legal actions in transferor district courts; and the Direct File Plaintiffs commenced their legal actions directly in this MDL proceeding. Pursuant to Section 1407(a), these are separate legal actions and they must be remanded accordingly. Therefore, when pretrial proceedings end, the Court will sever (or recommend that the JPML sever) any remaining claims asserted by the Transferor Plaintiffs-including any claims amended directly in this MDL proceeding.
