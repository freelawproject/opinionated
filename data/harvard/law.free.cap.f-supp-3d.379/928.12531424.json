ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In the pending motion, Plaintiffs seek to enjoin Defendants from using certain diverted federal funds and resources for border barrier construction. Specifically, Plaintiffs move to enjoin Defendants from: (1) invoking Section 8005's reprogramming authority to channel funds into DoD's drug interdiction fund, (2) invoking Section 284 to divert monies from DoD's drug interdiction fund for border barrier construction on the southern border of New Mexico, (3) invoking Section 9705 to divert monies from the Treasury Forfeiture Fund for border barrier construction,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (4) taking any further action related to border barrier construction until Defendants comply with NEPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendants oppose each basis for injunctive relief. Defendants further contend that (1) the Plaintiffs lack standing to bring their Sections 8005 and 9705 claims, and (2) the Court is not the proper venue to challenge border barrier construction in New Mexico.

In other words, where a plaintiff seeks to vindicate a right protected by a statutory provision, the plaintiff must demonstrate that it arguably falls within the zone of interests Congress meant to protect by enacting that provision.

Any other interpretation would lead to absurd results. The very nature of an\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   action posits that an executive officer has gone beyond what the statute permits, and thus beyond what Congress contemplated. It would not make sense to demand that Plaintiffs-who otherwise have standing-establish that Congress contemplated that the statutes allegedly violated would protect Plaintiffs' interests.

In their view, \"the item\" for which funds are requested, for present purposes, is counterdrug activities under Section 284.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20.

In its\n   <em>\n    amicus\n   </em>\n   brief, the House recounts legislative history that provides critical context for the Court's interpretative task. The House explains that the \"denied by the Congress\" restriction was imposed on DoD's transfer authority in 1974 to \"tighten congressional control of the reprogramming process.\" Dkt.

The House committee report on the appropriations bill from that year explained that \"[n]ot frequently, but on some occasions, the Department ha[d] requested that funds which have been specifically deleted in the legislative process be restored through the reprogramming process,\" and that \"[t]he Committee believe[d] that to concur in such actions would place committees in the position of undoing the work of the Congress.\" H.R.

But in the Court's view, that reading of those sections is likely wrong, when the reality is that Congress was presented with-and declined to grant-a $ 5.7 billion request for border barrier construction. Border barrier construction, expressly, is the item Defendants now seek to fund via the Section 8005 transfer, and Congress denied the requested funds for that item.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202214\">\n    10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (explaining that transfer authority \"may not be used if\n   <em>\n    the item to which the funds would be transferred\n   </em>\n   is an item for which Congress has denied funds\") (emphasis added).

As the House notes in its\n   <em>\n    amicus\n   </em>\n   brief, DoD has used this authority in the past to transfer funds based on unanticipated circumstances (such as hurricane and typhoon damage to military bases) justifying a departure from the scope of spending previously authorized by Congress. House Br. at 9 (citing Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), DoD Serial No. FY 04-37 PA, Reprogramming Action (Sept. 3, 2004)). Here, however, Defendants claim that what was \"unforeseen\" was \"[t]he need for DoD to exercise its [Section] 284 authority to provide support for counter-drug activities,\" which \"did not arise until February 2019, when DHS requested support from DoD to construct fencing in drug trafficking corridors.\" Opp. at 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Defendants' argument that the need for the requested border barrier construction funding was \"unforeseen\" cannot logically be squared with the Administration's multiple requests for funding for exactly that purpose dating back to at least early 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Citizen Groups Ex.

No. 89-12, at 14 (testimony of Defendant Shanahan before the House Armed Services Committee explaining that the Administration discussed unilateral reprogramming \"prior to the declaration of a national emergency\"). Further, even the purported need for DoD to provide DHS with support for border security has similarly been long asserted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   States RJN Ex. 27 (April 4, 2018 presidential memorandum directing the Secretary of Defense to support DHS \"in securing the southern border and taking other necessary actions\" due to \"[t]he crisis at our southern border\"). Defendants' suggestion that by not specifically seeking border barrier funding under Section 284 by name, the Administration can later contend that as far as DoD is concerned, need for such funding is \"unforeseen,\" is not likely to withstand scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Interpreting \"unforeseen\" to refer to the request for DoD assistance, as opposed to the underlying \"requirement\" at issue, also is not reasonable. By Defendants' logic,\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   request for Section 284 support would be for an \"unforeseen military requirement,\" because only once the request was made would the \"need to exercise authority\" under the statute be foreseen. There is no logical reason to stretch the definition of \"unforeseen military requirement\" from requirements that the government as a whole plainly cannot predict (like the need to repair hurricane damage) to requirements that plainly\n   <em>\n    were\n   </em>\n   foreseen by the government as a whole (even if DoD did not realize that it would be asked to pay for them until after Congress declined to appropriate funds requested by another agency). Nothing presented by the Defendants suggests that its interpretation is what Congress had in mind when it imposed the \"unforeseen\" limitation, especially where, as here, multiple agencies are openly coordinating in an effort to build a project that Congress declined to fund. The Court thus finds it likely that Plaintiffs will succeed on this claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    iii.

Defendants' interpretation of Section 8005 is inconsistent with these principles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   While Defendants argue that the text and history of Section 284 suggest that their proposed transfer and use of the funds are within the scope of what Congress has permitted previously, Opp. at 21, that argument only highlights the serious constitutional questions that accepting their position would create. First, Defendants note that in the past DoD has completed what they characterize as \"large-scale\n   fencing projects\" with Congress's approval. Opp. at 21 (citing H.R. Rep. No. 103-200, at 330-31 (1993)). But Congress's past approval of relatively small expenditures, that were well within the total amount allocated by Congress to DoD under Section 284's predecessor, speaks not at all to Defendants' current claim that the Acting Secretary has authority to redirect sums over a hundred orders of magnitude greater to that account in the face of Congress's appropriations judgment in the CAA. Similarly, whether or not Section 284 formally \"limits\" the Secretary to \"small scale construction\" (defined in Section 284(i)(3) as \"construction at a cost not to exceed $ 750,000 for any project\"), reading the statute to suggest that Congress requires reporting of tiny projects but nonetheless has delegated authority to DoD to conduct the massive funnel-and-spend project proposed here is implausible, and likely would raise serious questions as to the constitutionality of such an interpretation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Whitman v. Am. Trucking Ass'ns\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505769\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/457/#p468\">\n    531 U.S. 457\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 468,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505769\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/457/#p468\">\n    121 S.Ct. 903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505769\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/457/#p468\">\n    149 L.Ed.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001) (noting that Congress \"does not, one might say, hide elephants in mouseholes\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Similarly, if \"unforeseen\" has the meaning that Defendants claim, Section 8005 would give the agency making a request for assistance under Section 284 complete control over whether that condition is met, simply by virtue of the timing of the request. As here, DHS could wait and see whether Congress granted a requested appropriation, then turn to DoD if Congress declined, and DoD could always characterize the resulting request as raising an \"unforeseen\" requirement because it did not come earlier. Under this interpretation, DoD could in essence make a de facto appropriation to DHS, evading congressional control entirely. The Court finds that this interpretation likely would pose serious problems under the Appropriations Clause, by ceding essentially boundless appropriations judgment to the executive agencies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Finally, the Court has serious concerns with Defendants' theory of appropriations law, which presumes that the Executive Branch can exercise spending authority unless Congress explicitly restricts such authority by statute. Counsel for Defendants advanced this theory at the hearing on this motion, arguing that when Congress passed the recent DoD appropriations act containing Section 8005, it \"could have\" expressly \"restrict[ed] that authority\" to preclude reprogramming funds for border barrier construction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 159 at 76:16-77:3. According to Defendants: \"If Congress had wanted to deny DOD this specific use of that [reprogramming] authority, that's something it needed to actually do in an explicit way in the appropriations process. And it didn't.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 77:21-24. But it is not Congress's burden to prohibit the Executive from spending the Nation's funds: it is the Executive's burden to show that its desired use of those funds was \"affirmatively approved by Congress.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    FLRA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3862881,3767998\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/665/1339/\">\n    665 F.3d at 1348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A]ll uses of appropriated funds must be affirmatively approved by Congress,\" and \"the mere absence of a prohibition is not sufficient.\").

Defendants appeared to argue at the hearing on this motion that\n   <em>\n    McIntosh\n   </em>\n   stands for the principle that the Executive enjoys unfettered spending power\n   unless Congress crafts an appropriations rider cabining such authority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 159 at 75:5- 10. As counsel for Defendants put it, \"[Plaintiffs] want to say that something was denied by Congress if it wasn't funded by Congress....But that is just not how these statutes are written and that's not how [\n   <em>\n    McIntosh\n   </em>\n   ] tells us we interpret the appropriations statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 75:13-20. But Defendants overlook that no party in\n   <em>\n    McIntosh\n   </em>\n   disputed that the government's use of funds was authorized but for the appropriations rider at issue in that case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350591\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/833/1163/#p1175\">\n    833 F.3d at 1175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The parties dispute whether the government's spending money on their prosecutions violates [the appropriations rider].\"). It is thus unremarkable that when faced with a dispute exclusively concerning whether the government's otherwise-authorized spending of money violated an appropriations rider, the Ninth Circuit held that \"[i]t is a fundamental principle of appropriations law that we may only consider the text of an appropriations rider.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350591\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/833/1163/#p1175\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1178 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

Whether Congress gives authority in the first place is not the same issue as whether Congress later restricts that authority. And it cannot be the case that Congress must draft an appropriations rider to breathe life into the internal limitations in Section 8005 establishing that the Executive may only reprogram money based on unforeseen military requirements, and may not do so where the item for which funds are requested has been denied by Congress. To adopt Defendants' position would read out these limitations entirely, which the Court cannot do.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Life Techs. Corp. v.

Plaintiffs contend that a $ 601 million diversion \"undermines the continued viability of TFF\" moving forward and \"jeopardizes the States' ability to collect their pending equitable share claims of millions of dollars that they are entitled to receive after dedicating time and resources to participating in joint law enforcement efforts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32.

Farley, who manages the TFF.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Farley Decl. \u00b6 2. Mr. Farley acknowledges that equitable sharing payments to state and local enforcement agencies are \"mandatory\" TFF expenses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. Mr. Farley explains, however, that \"Strategic Support is an amount of unobligated funds at the end of the fiscal year, after accounting for equitable sharing and other mandatory expenses...[which] may be used in connection with the law enforcement activities of\n   any Federal agency.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. He adds that TEOAF works with TFF member agencies \"to track anticipated and current forfeiture cases and liabilities that may be associated with such cases,\" which \"enables the program to accurately estimate its revenue and liabilities.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5, 9.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   In this capacity, the \"TFF has remained financially solvent and maintained adequate funds in its accounts to meet all of its expenses\" since its inception in 1992.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Because Strategic Support funding at the end of any fiscal year has already taken account of current fiscal year mandatory expenses and anticipated liabilities for the following fiscal year, Mr. Farley provides that \"the decision to make Strategic Support funding available in fiscal year 2019 will have no impact on the amount of money state and local entities receive through equitable sharing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13, 23. And the Treasury predicts that following the diversion of $ 601 million in strategic support payments to DHS, the \"projected unobligated balance carry-over to fiscal year 2020 will be approximately $ 507 million.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Given Mr. Farley's representations, Defendants argue that there is no risk of irreparable harm to Plaintiffs from the diversion of TFF funds: \"Because Treasury's Strategic Support payments to DHS do not pose any threat to the solvency of the TFF or diminish the equitable sharing payments to which the States may be entitled under [ Section] 9705, the States have not established a likelihood of irreparable injury.\" Opp. at 31. Plaintiffs' substantive response to the Farley declaration is to characterize it as a \"self-serving declaration\" that must be disregarded. But Plaintiffs' support for this proposition-\n   <em>\n    Nigro v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   -stands for the exact opposite proposition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180474\" index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/784/495/#p497\">\n    784 F.3d 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 497 (9th Cir. 2015) (\"Although the source of the evidence may have some bearing on its credibility and on the weight it may be given by a trier of fact, the district court may not disregard a piece of evidence at the summary judgment stage solely based on its self-serving nature.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   At the hearing on this motion, Plaintiffs shifted their criticism of Mr. Farley to his TFF balance calculation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

Plaintiffs argued that Mr. Farley failed to consider contingent liabilities and noted that the TFF could theoretically be underwater based on such liabilities and other data contained in TEOAF's fiscal year 2020 budget.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180474\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/784/495/#p497\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 136 Ex. 55, at 6-7. It does not appear warranted, though, to discount the TFF balance calculation by the entire contingent liability entry, given that such liabilities \"are significant because remission payments from multiple years are recorded and carried forward.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 136 Ex. 55, at 6. Nothing indicates that the Treasury would pay out all contingent liabilities in the next fiscal year. And even accepting Plaintiffs' argument as true, they have not explained why the TFF's existence alone manifests an entitlement to future equitable sharing payments. Further, Plaintiffs fail to consider that the amount of potential future equitable sharing payments is tethered to future seizures or forfeitures for which a given state or local law enforcement agency participates in the seizure or forfeiture, and is capped by the value of the seized or forfeited property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209705\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 9705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(g), (b)(2), (h)(1)(B)(ii).

Plaintiffs have not met their burden. Plaintiffs alleged there was some risk that Defendants' diversion of $ 601 million would undermine the continued viability of TFF and/or jeopardize their ability to collect \"pending\" equitable share claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. at 31-32. Defendants responded with a sworn declaration demonstrating that no pending equitable share claims are at risk and that the TEOAF has taken account of future needs to prevent any threat to TFF's continued viability. The Court cannot ignore this declaration just because it makes it more difficult for Plaintiffs to meet their burden to demonstrate that irreparable injury is likely in the absence of an injunction. And the Court also cannot ignore that Plaintiffs failed to consider important relevant factors, such as the nature of equitable sharing payments. Thus, even though Plaintiffs have shown that they have standing as to this claim, they have not shown an entitlement to the \"extraordinary\" remedy of a preliminary injunction on this basis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    3.
