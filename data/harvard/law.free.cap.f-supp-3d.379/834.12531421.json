As an example, WeRide identifies its HD mapping algorithms as its second trade secret. WeRide specifies that it is not referring to HD mapping algorithms generally, but to \"the unique algorithms used by WeRide's autonomous vehicles to create HD Maps.\" Walter Ex. B at 5-6. WeRide then provides\n   the factors a developer must consider in generating such maps, and describes the process WeRide uses to create the algorithms. The Court finds that WeRide has identified its alleged trade secrets with reasonable particularity. Because WeRide has met this requirement, the Court does not consider whether section 2019.210 applies to claims under the DTSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Existence of the Trade Secrets\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   To show that the identified source code meets the definition of a trade secret, WeRide must show that it derives value from not being generally known and that it took reasonable efforts to maintain its secrecy. Courts have found that source code can receive trade secret protection.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Tolat II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12395005\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/675/700/#p703\">\n    675 F.

WeRide represents that many engineers developed the source code over 18 months with investments of over $ 45 million. Li Decl. \u00b6 11. The investment and development make the source code confidential and proprietary to WeRide, giving it an advantage over competitors. The source code has value. Huang asserts during WeRide's \"earlier startup days,\" it derived much of its source code from open source code, but this does not mean that the source code allegedly misappropriated a year later was not confidential. Huang Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Huang cites several articles that describe the general functionality WeRide references to its alleged trade secrets to argue that the alleged trade secrets are readily available in the public. Similarly, ZZX and AllRide argue that third parties have developed code that performs the same function as WeRide's alleged trade secrets. Both arguments miss the mark. WeRide is not claiming that the functionalities of its code are trade secret, but that the source code itself comprises its trade secrets. ZZX and AllRide assert that WeRide made no effort to show that its source code would not be readily available to others. But this argument overlooks that Walter opines that WeRide's specific trade secrets are \"are neither common knowledge in the industry, nor reflected in publicly available code.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Walter Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 68, 72.

WeRide employs various measures to maintain the confidentiality of its alleged trade secrets. WeRide restricts access to its code base to employees who are either on-site or have logged into the WeRide network through a VPN-which requires a unique username and password. Liu Decl. \u00b6 9. The source code itself is encrypted, and decryption requires a unique username, password, and token.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-8. Finally, WeRide requires all of its employees to sign the PIIA, which includes provisions protecting WeRide's confidential information. Zhang Ex. B. \u00b6 4. The Court finds that WeRide is likely to succeed at showing the alleged trade secrets meet the definition of \"trade secrets.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The Copyright Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In just two sentences, ZZX and AllRide assert with no argument that the federal Copyright Act pre-empts the claim under the CUTSA and refer the Court to its Motion to Dismiss for the actual argument. Their request violates the page limitations imposed on opposition briefs by Civil Local Rule 7-3(a). Because this argument is not properly before the Court, the Court declines to consider it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Trade Secret Misappropriation Claims Against Huang\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   WeRide has shown that it is likely to succeed on the merits of its trade secret misappropriation claims against Huang. To begin, Huang understood that he was under a duty to maintain the secrecy of WeRide's confidential information. He signed the PIIA and told Han that taking WeRide's confidential information would be \"unethical.\" Zhang Ex. B; Huang Decl. \u00b6 13. While he argues in his brief (Huang O'ppn. at 19)-and his attorney represented at oral argument-that he denies misusing WeRide's confidential information or trade secrets, these arguments misconstrue his declarations. Huang's original declaration merely describes his comments to Han. Huang Decl. \u00b6 13. In the declaration to his sur-reply, he states that he did not use the specific confidential information or trade secrets identified in Yan Li's reply declaration, and that he did not consider using the '566 Device to misappropriate trade secrets. Huang Suppl. Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 7. He never actually denies taking or using WeRide's identified trade secrets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Second, he began downloading increased amounts of data around the same time that he began considering other employment. Liu Decl. \u00b6 22; Huang Decl. \u00b6 11. During the four months prior to May 6, 2018, Huang downloaded more than 400 MB on only a single day. Liu Decl. \u00b6 22; Liu Ex. A. But in the three months from May to July, he downloaded more than 400 MB on at least four separate days. Liu Decl. \u00b6 24; Liu Ex. A. Huang had access to WeRide's source code as part of his job and he freely admits that he has downloaded WeRide's source code. Huang Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 13, 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Third, Huang does not dispute that he copied WeRide's confidential information to the '566 Device after he decided to leave WeRide. Kunkel Decl. \u00b6 8; Li Reply Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 20-27. Huang contests the value of some of these files, and states that to the best of his recollection he did not access any of the identified files after leaving WeRide. Huang Sur-Reply. Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-6. He points out that WeRide's analysis of the '566 Device has not revealed any of the identified trade secrets. Sur-Reply at 3. But he does not dispute that the files are confidential to WeRide or that he copied them to a personal storage device.

Cal. July 8, 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Taken together, these facts show that WeRide is likely to succeed on its trade secret misappropriation claims against Huang. While Huang maintains that WeRide has not directly shown that he copied and took away any of the identified trade secrets, \"direct evidence of misappropriation is rare.\"\n   <em>\n    BladeRoom Grp.

Cal. 2018). At the preliminary injunction stage, WeRide must meet the high standard of showing it is likely to succeed on the merits, but it is not required\n   to prove its case. WeRide has met the first prong of the preliminary injunction test as to its trade secret misappropriation claims against Huang.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Trade Secret Misappropriation Claims Against ZZX and AllRide\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   WeRide has also shown it is likely to succeed on the merits of its trade secret misappropriation claims against ZZX and AllRide. As an initial matter, the Court examines the relationship between ZZX and AllRide. WeRide contends that the two companies are closely related if they are not, in fact, the same company. Mot. at 7. ZZX and AllRide do not deny it. Huang has noted that his current employer is ZZX, not AllRide. Dkt. 18-1. But given ZZX's ownership of www.allride.ai and the date of AllRide.AI, Inc.'s incorporation, the Court finds that for the purposes of this Motion, WeRide has shown a sufficient nexus between the entities to treat them as closely related for this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Four pieces of evidence taken together show that that WeRide has, at least, met the substantial questions requirement regarding ZZX and AllRide. First, Huang plays a senior role in the development of ZZX and AllRide's autonomous vehicle technology. His title at ZZX is the Vice President of Technology. Dkt. No. 18-1 \u00b6 1. At the October 22, 2018 recruiting event, he was identified as the \"Tech Lead of AllRide's Silicon Valley Office, Self-driving Software &amp; Hardware Specialist, Architect of Self-driving Vehicles.\" Zhang Decl. \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Second, the video shown at that event depicts an autonomous car performing Advanced Capabilities, such as detecting a pedestrian about to cross the street at a cross walk and passing a slower vehicle. Walter Decl. \u00b6 27-62. Walter opines that it would have been impossible to independently develop the technology for those capabilities in the 10 weeks between Huang's last day at WeRide and the recruitment event.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. The implausibly fast development of technology can contribute to finding misappropriation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    GTAT Corp. v.

ZZX and AllRide contest this point, arguing that WeRide does not know when such development began and that it\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   have started some 19 weeks prior to the recruitment event. AllRide and ZZX presumably know when they began developing autonomous vehicle technology, but they offer no evidence in support of their argument. So, the Court is not persuaded.\n   <em>\n    Cota v. Maxwell-Jolly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5751462\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/688/980/\">\n    688 F.

They then argue that WeRide's website indicates that it performed driverless testing just five to six weeks after its founding. But, WeRide submits evidence that the testing referenced on its website was not comparable to the Advanced Capabilities. Li Reply Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 17-19. Huang argues that at ZZX he joined an existing team of engineers who were already working on the technology. But, he also does not provide any further evidence-such as the number of other engineers or how long they had been working on the technology. Moreover, Walter accounted for the possibility that Huang was joining a \"fully equipped research staff\" when he offered this opinion. Walter Decl. \u00b6 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Third, AllRide and ZZX place the radar component on the front center of the roofs of its vehicles-just like WeRide. Walter Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4, 115-18; Zhang Ex. J. Walter opines that this placement is not typical, as most designs for autonomous cars place the radar at the front bumper and/or the rearview mirror. Walter Decl. \u00b6 115. Walter notes that that this placement is consistent with the use of WeRide's source code-WeRide's perception-related code would only be useful if the radar component\n   was located in that same location. Walter Decl. \u00b6 117. Walter further opines that there is nothing inherently beneficial about that placement of the radar component.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 116. AllRide and ZZX respond by filing a depiction of one of Waymo's autonomous vehicles that places the radar component in the center of the roof. AllRide RJN Ex. 2 at 3. But, Waymo does not place its radar component in the same location as WeRide. Waymo locates its further back from the front than WeRide. Walter Reply Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 33-36. AllRide and ZZX's placement of the radar component in the same location as WeRide is evidence of misappropriation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Waymo,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LLC v.

Cal. May 15, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Finally, Huang's senior role in ZZX and AllRide's technology development and the team of engineers predating his start make it likely that WeRide will be able to show that ZZX and AllRide knew, or had reason to know, that Huang misappropriated WeRide's trade secrets.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Extreme Reach, Inc. v. Spotgenie Partners, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%2012081182\">\n    2013 WL 12081182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 22, 2013). Walter opines that AllRide and ZZX would not have been able to develop the Advanced Capabilities in just 10 weeks (Walter Decl. \u00b6 121), so ZZX and AllRide's other engineers should have realized that Huang had brought outside technology with him when he started. Taken together, this evidence is sufficient to show that WeRide is likely to succeed on its trade secret misappropriation claims against ZZX and AllRide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    6. Trade Secret Misappropriation Claims Against Wang\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Court finds that WeRide has not shown that it is likely to succeed on the merits of its trade secret misappropriation claims against Wang. WeRide does not allege that Wang himself improperly took any of the trade secrets when he left WeRide, so it must show that he is liable through some connection to AllRide and ZZX. It has not done so. WeRide contends that Huang recruited a WeRide employee to Wang's \"new company,\" that Chinese media have reported Wang controls AllRide and ZZX, that Wang now runs a venture fund that invests in autonomous vehicles, and that Wang admits to advising the founders of ZZX. Wang, though, denies receiving any payment for his consulting with ZZX or AllRide (Wang Decl. \u00b6 27), denies having anything to do ZZX's product development or technical work (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29), or denies calls media reports that he controls ZZX \"inaccurate\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37), and he denies encouraging Huang to leave WeRide for ZZX (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Defamation and Intentional Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage Claims Against Wang\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Court declines to find that WeRide is likely to succeed on the merits of its defamation claim against Wang. Defamation is \"the intentional publication of a statement of fact which is false, unprivileged, and has a natural tendency to injure or which causes special damage.\"\n   <em>\n    Ringler Assocs.

WeRide relies on second or third-hand reports of Wang making the allegedly disparaging statements. Wang, though, denies making the statements. Wang Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 33-24. WeRide correctly notes that the Court may rely on hearsay at the preliminary injunction phase, but even so, the Court finds that these accounts-without more-are insufficient to satisfy the first of the\n   <em>\n    Winter\n   </em>\n   factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   To succeed on a claim for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, a plaintiff must show \"intentional acts on the part of the defendant designed to disrupt\" the economically\n   advantageous relationship between the plaintiff and a third party.\n   <em>\n    Korea Supply Co. v.

Mot. at 20; Lu Ex. B \u00b6\u00b6 4, 5; Lu Ex. C \u00b6 12. For the same reasons that the Court finds that WeRide has not adequately shown Wang made the allegedly defamatory statements, the Court finds that WeRide has not adequately shown that Wang breached Paragraph 12 of the separation agreement. During oral argument, WeRide's counsel argued that Wang admitted to breaching Paragraph 12 by conceding that he discouraged potential investors away from WeRide. The Motion, though, relies on the alleged defamation to support the claim for breach of Paragraph 12. Mot. at 20;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Reply at 13-17.

For the same reasons that the Court finds that WeRide has not sufficiently shown that Wang misappropriated WeRide's trade secrets, the Court finds that WeRide has not adequately shown that Wang breached Paragraph 4 the PIIA.

Irreparable Harm\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   WeRide has shown that it is likely to suffer irreparable harm from Huang, ZZX, and AllRide's misappropriation of its trade secrets. First, AllRide and ZZX's use of WeRide's trade secrets gives them an unfair advantage in the nascent autonomous vehicle industry.\n   <em>\n    Waymo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202123560\">\n    2017 WL 2123560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11 ; Walter Decl. \u00b6 21. Even before the technology has been fully realized, the industry is crowded with competitors. Huang Decl. \u00b6 6. Thus ZZX and AllRide's use of the trade secrets \"to accelerate their own progress ... would improve their ability to attract investors and talented engineers away from competitors-including [WeRide] itself.\"\n   <em>\n    Waymo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202123560\">\n    2017 WL 2123560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11. Without an injunction, WeRide is likely to have its market position set back as AllRide and ZZX receive an unfair boost. In trade secret cases, injunctions are appropriate to prevent this sort of unfair advantage.\n   <em>\n    Lamb-Weston, Inc. v. McCain Foods, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11720197\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/941/970/#p974\">\n    941 F.2d 970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 974 (9th Cir. 1991).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Second, disclosure of the trade secrets among Huang, AllRide, and ZZX increases the risk of their broader disclosure. Huang represented to the Court that he works with a team of engineers at ZZX and AllRide has represented that it planned to hire 100 engineers in 2018. Huang Decl. \u00b6 25; Zhang Decl. \u00b6 29. Without an injunction, WeRide's trade secrets could be widely disclosed. \"A trade secret once lost is, of course, lost forever.\"\n   <em>\n    FMC Corp. v. Taiwan Tainan Giant Indus.

The Balance of Hardships\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The Court finds that that the balance of hardships weighs heavily in WeRide's favor. WeRide has demonstrated that it faces serious harms absent an injunction. WeRide argues that an injunction preventing ZZX, AllRide, and Huang from using its trade secrets would not impose any hardship on them. It is no burden for them to do what the law already requires.\n   <em>\n    Henry Schein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12139385\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/191/1072/#p1077\">\n    191 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1077 ;\n   <em>\n    Pyro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3992918\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/861/1079/#p1087\">\n    861 F.Supp.2d at 1092\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In their briefing, ZZX, AllRide, and Huang fail to identify any burden than an injunction would cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Huang repeats his arguments as to trade secret misappropriation, the specificity of WeRide's trade secret identification, and the secrecy of the trade. The Court has already considered and disposed these arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   AllRide and ZZX first argue that compelling them to produce their source code would not preserve the status quo but would affirmatively alter it. Not so. The production of source code to WeRide's outside counsel and experts-pursuant to the Protective Order (Dkt. No. 54)-is essentially an early discovery request. The Protective Order allows the parties to designate source code so that it is subject to stringent protection.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3992918\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/861/1079/#p1087\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 7.3-7.4, 9. Their source code would not be revealed to WeRide and it would not alter the status quo. Next, they argue that being forced to produce its source code would force ZZX to violate Chinese secrecy laws. The Court is mindful that foreign companies may face some burden arising from discovery in U.S. litigation, but ZZX and AllRide have not explained why an injunction requiring ZZX to produce source code on an expedited timeline would impose a greater burden than they would face fulfilling their discovery obligations at a later date.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Richmark Corp. v. Timber Falling Consultants\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10524342\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/959/1468/#p1475\">\n    959 F.2d 1468\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1475 (9th Cir. 1992). Nonetheless, the Court can address this concern by narrowly tailoring the injunctive relief to be granted. \"When deciding whether to issue a narrowly tailored injunction, district courts must assess the harms pertaining to injunctive relief in the context of that narrow injunction.\"\n   <em>\n    Sierra Forest Legacy v. Rey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4042023\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/577/1015/#p1022\">\n    577 F.3d 1015\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1022 (9th Cir. 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    VII. The Public Interest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The Court agrees with WeRide that an injunction would be in the public interest. Courts often find that the public has a strong interest in protecting intellectual property rights.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Comet Techs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201990226\">\n    2018 WL 1990226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 ;\n   <em>\n    Waymo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202123560\">\n    2017 WL 2123560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11-12.

ZZX again raises concerns about obtaining discovery from China, but the Court can\n   address those concerns in its order. They do not show a prejudice to ZZX that outweighs the need for the discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    IX. Conclusion and Order\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The Court concludes that WeRide has shown (1) that it is likely to succeed on the merits of its claims for trade secret misappropriation, breach of contract, and breach of fiduciary duty as to Huang, and on to the merits of its trade secret misappropriation claims against ZZX and AllRide; (2) that WeRide will suffer harm in the absence of an injunction; (3) that the balance of hardships weighs heavily in WeRide's favor, and (4) that the public interest will be served by an injunction.
