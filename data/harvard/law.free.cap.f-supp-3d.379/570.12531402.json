Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2014, J.M. met eligibility for special education services as a student with Other Health Impairment (\"OHI\") based on Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (\"ADHD\") and as a student with a Specific Learning Disability (\"SLD\") in the areas of basic reading and reading comprehension. Respondent's Exhibit 3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Riesel Independent School District (the \"District\") added \"co-occurring dyslexia\" to the SLD classification on the basis of a July 24, 2014 private evaluation, which identified J.M. as a student with dyslexia. R. 38. J.M.'s Admission Review and Dismissal (\"ARD\") committee met on June 2, 2016 to review J.M.'s educational program, discuss his schedule for the upcoming 2016-17 school year, conduct transition planning, review the decision of the hearing officer in a prior case involving J.M., consider J.M.'s needs for Extended School Year (\"ESY\") services, and discuss upcoming summer evaluations. Joint Exhibit 1, at 21, 25.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   J.M.'s parents attended the ARD meeting.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21. J.M. was invited to the ARD meeting but did not attend.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The June 2016 ARD committee meeting addressed J.M.'s present levels of academic achievement and functional performance (\"PLAAFP\") in the following areas: physical, behavioral, discipline, functional, and academic.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At the June 2016 ARD committee meeting, it was discussed that J.M. did not meet the state standard on the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness (\"STAAR\") for End of Course (\"EOC\") exams for Biology, Algebra I, and English I.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21.

J.M.'s mother also expressed she did not want J.M. to take vocational or career education classes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After conducting these evaluations, the District provided J.M.'s parents with information from local colleges, the Texas Department of Assistive and Rehabilitative Services, and a college preparation checklist.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the June 2016 meeting, the ARD committee proposed conducting evaluations for math achievement and speech in order to collect more information to determine J.M.'s needs. J.2 at 1. J.M.'s mother consented to the proposed assessments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The ARD committee also discussed the passing standards required to participate in the Universal Intercollegiate League (\"UIL\") extracurricular activities. In the ninth grade, J.M. was not allowed to participate in an event at the county fair because of his failing grades. J.1 at 25. The District agreed to contact the UIL to determine whether the ARD committee could modify eligibility standards in response to J.M.'s mother's inquiry.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The ARD committee confirmed that J.M. was under the care of a physician because of his Crohn's disease at the June 2016 meeting. J.1 at 2. The ARD committee provided J.M.'s mother with another OHI form to consider adding Crohn's disease to J.M.'s OHI eligibility.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The ARD committee also reviewed an Individualized Healthcare Plan (\"IHP\"), which addressed J.M.'s medical needs related to Crohn's disease.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-5. J.M.'s teachers reviewed the IHP with the school nurse-the nurse was available to any teacher or staff who needed clarification on the IHP.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. J.M.'s mother also provided the ARD committee with a list of recommended accommodations related to J.M.'s medical condition.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   These proposed recommendations were to be reviewed and considered at the August 2016 ARD meeting before the start of the 2016-17 school year.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The June 2016 ARD documents included a Prior Written Notice (\"PWN\") page explaining the decisions of the ARD, the basis for those decisions, the options considered and why they were rejected or not, the evaluation procedures, tests, records, and reports used as the basis for their decisions, and any other relevant factors that were considered when making their decisions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25-26. The PWN included a procedural safeguards statement with the name and phone number of the Co-Op Directors as the parental contact for questions or other information to assist J.M.'s parents in understanding the procedural safeguards.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The District completed a Full Individual Evaluation (\"FIE\") about two weeks after the June 2, 2016 ARD meeting. J.3 at 1. The purpose of the June 2016 FIE was to conduct testing in the areas of math and articulation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The FIE was conducted by a speech/language pathologist and an educational diagnosticiation-a special education\n   and general education teacher were also members of the FIE multi-disciplinary team.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The FIE was conducted in English, which is J.M.'s primary language.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The assessment instruments used were: (i) selected and administered so as not to be discriminatory; (ii) administered in the form most likely to yield accurate information as to J.M.'s academic, developmental, and functional performance; (iii) used for the purposes of which they were valid and reasonable; (iv) administered by trained and knowledgeable personnel; and (v) administered in accordance with instructions by the assessments' producers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. These instruments were also tailored to assess J.M.'s specific areas of educational need in math and speech/language and selected and administered to accurately reflect J.M.'s aptitude or achievement level.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   J.M. was assessed in all areas of suspected disability identified by the June 2016 ARD.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The June 2016 FIE showed that J.M.'s receptive and expressive language, pragmatic language, articulation, voice, and fluency were age appropriate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. J.M. scored below what was expected for his age on the math component of the June 2016 FIE.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, this was likely because he was prohibited from using a calculator on the test, and J.M. was accustomed to using a calculator for math on a daily basis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The June 2016 FIE confirmed J.M.'s continued eligibility for special education as a student with OHI and a SLD in basic reading skills and reading comprehension.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6. However, the June 2016 FIE also found that J.M. no longer met eligibility criteria as a student with a Speech Impairment (\"SI\") because his articulation and speech/language skills were age appropriate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The District provided J.M. with dyslexia compensatory services in the summer of 2016. R.32 at 2. The dyslexia teacher implemented the Dyslexia Intervention Program (\"DIP\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. The teacher was trained in the DIP and qualified to teach students with dyslexia in Texas. A.R. at 3802. J.M. was cooperative in his sessions and willingly did what he was told to do.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3824-25. Although J.M. struggled with letter sounds and decoding at the start of the summer, he showed improvement in these skills by the end of the summer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   J.M.'s ARD committee convened on August 18, 2016. J.4 at 1. At parental request, the District sent a set of proposed IEPs for the 2016-17 school year to J.M,'s parents on August 17, 2016. R.6 at 1. Two ARD meeting notices were also sent to J.M.'s parents-the notices identified the purposes of the ARD, the set of evaluation procedures, and the test records and reports to be reviewed and discussed. J.4 at 25-27. The purpose of the August 2016 ARD was to review the results of the summer 2016 testing and review proposed IEPs for the 2016-17 school year.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22. J.M.'s parents attended the meeting.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The ARD committee found that the June 2016 FIE confirmed J.M.'s eligibility for special education.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, J.M.'s parents disagreed with the FIE's conclusion that their son no longer needed speech services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The ARD committee proposed measurable annual IEP goals and objectives for the 2016-17 school year-these included goals and objectives for English, Math, Dyslexia Services, and Behavior.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A PLAAFP statement was included for each set of goals and objectives.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The ARD committee reviewed J.M.'s STARR results, report cards, and teachers' input in developing the PLAAFPs for the English, Math, and behavior goals.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3, 5, 9-10. The ARD committee reviewed the results of testing conducted in February 2014 and March 2016 in developing J.M.'s dyslexia goals.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. The IEP also included accommodations J.M. needed in each of his classes to accomplish his goals and objectives.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. The ARD committee also included an IHP that related to medical issues that might arise at school related to J.M.'s Crohn's disease, including a list of medical accommodations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-16. The IHP and its accommodations were shared with the school nurse and reviewed with J.M.'s teachers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The ARD committee finalized J.M.'s class schedule for his tenth grade year at the August 2016 meeting. R.8 at 9, 48. He was placed in all general education classes with instruction provided by a general education teacher and by a dyslexia specialist in the Dyslexia class.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   J.M. was also placed in an Advisory class and was to be provided 15 minutes of special education consult once every six weeks. J.4 at 17, 19, 24. The ARD committee also readdressed J.M.'s mother's inquiry regarding participation in UIL activities and agreed to modify the passing grade standard in core academic classes so that J.M. could participate in UIL activities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24. The IEP discussed and reviewed at this August 2016 meeting was implemented during the 2016-17 school year.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A PWN was included in the August 2016 ARD documents. The PWN included a description of the ARD decisions, why those decisions were made, the options considered and why they were or were not rejected, the evaluation procedures, tests, records, or reports used as the basis for their decisions, and any other relevant factors that were considered when making their decisions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24. The PWN included a procedural safeguard statements statement with the name and phone number of the Co-Op director as the parental contact for questions or more information to assist J.M.'s parents in understanding the procedural safeguards.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The District assigned Tammy Bush, a special education teacher, to serve as J.M.'s case manager during the 2016-17 school year. A.R. at 3893-95. Ms. Bush was responsible for preparing portions of J.M.'s IEP and the ARD paperwork, monitoring his progress in classes, and communicating with his teachers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ms. Bush also provided the special education consult services for the 2016-17 school year.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3895. In providing such services, Ms. Bush consulted with J.M.'s teachers either in person or by e-mail.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ms. Bush did not believe a change in the level of consult services in J.M.'s IEP was needed because the allotted time for consult services was sufficient to monitor J.M.'s progress in his classes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3920-22. Ms. Bush also measured J.M.'s progress towards meeting IEP goals by conferring with teachers, observing him in the classroom, and reviewing teacher gradebooks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3896-99, 3931-35. Ms. Bush would follow up with J.M.'s teachers if she needed more information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3899. Ms. Bush also served as J.M.'s advisory teacher during the 2016-17 school year.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3893-95.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The District also provided J.M. with one-on-one compensatory dyslexia services during the 2016-17 school year.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3826-27. The services were provided by the same teacher who provided the compensatory dyslexia services during the summer of 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3817. The services were provided in two sessions-one in the morning and one in the afternoon.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3825-26. The afternoon session was omitted following a discussion and subsequent\n   agreement between J.M.'s mother and the high school principal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3828-31. J.M. also received dyslexia reading instruction during the school day in addition to his one-on-one compensatory dyslexia services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, it became confusing with one teacher beginning a lesson and the other teacher attempting to pick up where the former left off; therefore, the teachers adjusted how they would teach J.M.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   They decided that the teacher providing the compensatory dyslexia services would reinforce the concepts and lessons taught in the dyslexia class using material from high school textbooks or current events from a website.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   J.M.'s ability to decode words independently improved by the end of the 2016-17 school year.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3833-35.

J.M.'s mother was provided with an OHI form so that J.M.'s doctor could confirm J.M.'s eligibility as a student with OHI.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The ARD also planned to conduct additional vocational and aptitude assessments and identify J.M.'s post-secondary areas of strength and need.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   J.M.'s mother conveyed to the ARD J.M.'s expressed interest in programs at Texas State Technical College (\"TSTC\") and McClennan Community College.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   J.M.'s mother also provided consent for the proposed assessments and to invite outside agencies, such as the Texas Workforce Commission (\"TWC\"), to future ARD meetings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In preparation for J.M.'s ARD in May 2017, three of J.M.'s teachers provided feedback to Ms. Bush regarding his performance in their classes. His teachers complimented his attitude in class and noted he completed his work even if he sometimes required reminders to stay on task. R.7 at 1-3. His Spanish and Science teachers stated there was little to no difference in his classroom performance after breaks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1, 3. In English, J.M. worked very hard and even passed the 2017 STAAR English I EOC with a very decent score after failing the summer and fall 2016 STAAR English I EOC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.

J.M. was generally successful in the classroom as he passed each six weeks with at least average grades-these grades were consistent with the teacher reports to Ms. Bush as J.M.'s case manager. R.8 at 7; A.R. at 3900. J.M. completed the same assignments as his classmates, kept up with his classmates academically, and earned the grades he received. A.R. at 3901, 3968-69, 3976-78. J.M. did not receive a grade below an 80 for the 2016-17 school year. R.8 at 7-8.

This process requires a school district to identify what secondary and postsecondary environments the child wishes to be a part of and what accommodations, services, support, and technology will help the child achieve his or her goals. The IDEA does not elaborate on what constitutes a sufficient \"transition assessment.\" Accordingly, it appears school districts are free to choose the means for conducting a transition assessment so long as it achieves the overall purpose of such an assessment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The overall purpose of a transition assessment is to identify the child's basic needs and post-school goals, which should help drive the transition requirements in the IEP process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   With the purpose of the transition assessment and transition services in mind, the Court finds the District performed a transition assessment. The District did conduct an assessment to identify J.M.'s strengths, preferences and interests so that appropriate transition services could be created. At the District's request, (1) J.M. completed a Vocational Assessment Student Interview form; (2) his mother completed a Vocational Assessment-Parent\n   Interview form; and (3) his teacher completed a Vocational Assessment-Teacher Interview form. J.1 at 8-10. The District continued to conduct such interviews and continually assessed whether J.M.'s interests, goals, and academic needs had changed. R.8 at 11-16; R.9 at 12; R.12 at 13. The District used these interviews and their assessment of these interviews to determine J.M. was interested in pursuing a career in welding or auctioneering and that he was interested in attending TSTC. J.1 at 9-10; R.8 at 12-13. Based off this evidence, the Court finds the District did conduct a transition evaluation and determined J.M.'s strengths, preferences, and interests so that the District could create adequate transition services. Because of the reasons above, the Court finds the District did conduct a transition assessment; therefore, the SEHO did not ignore the lack of a transition assessment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    iv.

First, Plaintiffs fail to cite any authority suggesting the IDEA required the District to affirmatively disclose such minute details as the identity of the person who chose 15 minutes every six weeks or 2.5 minutes of indirect special education help for J.M. in order for J.M.'s parents to be meaningful participants in the development of his IEP. In fact, the Fifth Circuit has expressly recognized the fact that \"not every conversation about a child is a statutorily-defined meeting in which the parents must participate.\"\n   <em>\n    R.P. ex. rel. R.P. v. Alamo Heights Indep. Sch. Dist.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5870370\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/703/801/#p810\">\n    703 F.3d 801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 810-12 (5th Cir. 2012) (finding parents were not denied meaningful participation despite fact that some decisions about the\n   student's IEPs were made prior to the ARD meetings where the parents were present and had the opportunity to voice their thoughts at ARD meetings and the school district incorporated changes proposed by the parents into the student's IEPs). Second, Plaintiffs similarly provide no authority suggesting that J.M.'s IEPs had to be projected on a screen in order for J.M.'s parents to be meaningful participants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Third, \u00a7 1415(b)(3) requires that prior written notice be given to a student's parents \"whenever the local education agency-(A) proposes to initiate or change; or (B) refuses to initiate or change, the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of a free public education to the child.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3). Contrary to Plaintiffs' argument, the Administrative Record shows that prior written notice was issued for the June 2016, August 2016, March 2017, May 2017, August 2017, and November 2017 ARD committee meetings. J.1 at 25-26; J.4 at 24; J.5 at 8; R.8 at 56-57; R.11 at 32-33; R.17 at 16. Additionally, J.M.'s parents attended the majority of J.M.'s ARD committee meetings and were given the opportunity to voice any concerns.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , J.1 at 8; J.5 at 6; R.8 at 53. Accordingly, the District complied with the IDEA's prior written notice requirement regarding transition services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Fourth, the deposition testimony of J.M.'s mother contains no indication that she did not understand the vocational assessment form she filled out at the June 2016 ARD or that she was confused about the answers she provided. AR at 3606-07, 3619-3620. She does suggest that she might have answered the questions differently had she been given more time to think about her answers; however, she gave almost identical answers to the same questions almost one year later at the May 2017 ARD. J.1 at 11; R.8 at 14. It was important that she intelligently answer the vocational assessment questions because those answers would be used to help create J.M.'s transition plan. Because it appears that J.M.'s mother understood how to intelligently answer the questions asked on those forms, the Court finds that the confusion, if any, of J.M.'s mother in filling out the aforementioned forms does not show she was prevented from meaningfully participating in the development of J.M.'s IEP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Finally, the sole case cited by Plaintiffs in support of these contentions,\n   <em>\n    Caldwell I.S.D. v. L.P.\n   </em>\n   , is so clearly distinguishable from the present litigation as to be inapplicable to its resolution.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4065834\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/994/811/\">\n    994 F. Supp. 2d 811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (W.D. Tex. 2012). Contrary to\n   <em>\n    Caldwell\n   </em>\n   , the Administrative Record in the present case is not \"replete with instances\" of a \"deplorable breakdown\" between the District and J.M.'s parents.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4065834\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/994/811/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4065834\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/994/811/\">\n    at 819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Unlike the school district in\n   <em>\n    Caldwell\n   </em>\n   , there is no evidence that the District attempted to block J.M.'s parents from collaborating in the development or implementation of J.M.'s IEP.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4065834\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/994/811/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (the student's social studies teacher did not notify the student's parent that the student was failing the social studies class because the teacher had been instructed by the school district to not to talk to the parent due to the pending dispute).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   As outlined in Section I of this Order, the District went to great lengths to communicate with J.M.'s parents and involve them in the IEP development process. For example, the District (1) would transmit proposed IEPs to J.M.'s parents when requested; (2) would make J.M.'s parents aware of ARD meetings and what issues would be discussed at such meetings; (3) agreed to a modified passing grade standard for J.M. so that he could participate in UIL activities in response to J.M.'s mother's request; and (4) showed a willingness\n   to compromise and work with J.M.'s parents when disagreements arose. R.6 at 1; J.4 at 25-27; J.1 at 21; J.4 at 22, 24; A.R. at 3764-766. In short, the relationship between the District and J.M.'s parents was far from being distrustful or confrontational-instead, it was collaborative with both sides working towards doing what was best for J.M. For these reasons, the Court finds that the District complied with the IDEA's procedural mandates regarding parental involvement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    v.

The primary contention of Plaintiffs' argument can be summed up as follows: the transition goals provided by the District were not measurable because they lacked specificity and objectivity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Alternatively, the transition goals were not measurable because they failed to provide a present level of performance or baseline so that progress could be measured.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The IDEA requires an IEP to include transition services that are \"designed to facilitate the child's movement from school to post-school activities, including post-secondary education, vocational education, integrated employment ... independent living, or community participation.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.43\">\n    34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

However, Plaintiffs fail to explain and provide no support for why J.M.'s progress reports could not serve as a baseline to objectively evaluate J.M.'s progress with respect to his transition goals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The Court instead finds that J.M. was provided with sufficiently measurable transition goals. J.M.'s parents and the District collaborated on the development of J.M.'s IEP, including the creation of J.M.'s transition goals. J.1 at 8; J.5 at 6; R.8 at 53. J.M.'s transition goals attempted to engage his future principal employment interests in welding and auctioneering. J.1 at 9; R.8 at 11. J.M. was also enrolled in\n   classes geared toward graduation from high school, which was required for J.M. to achieve his transition goals of enrolling in postsecondary institutions. R.5 at 4; R.11 at 23. He was also placed in two Agriculture classes to foster his interest in auctioneering and welding and help him achieve his goals. R.11 at 23. The District further provided J.M.'s parents with a variety of information and opportunities to explore enrollment in institutions relevant to J.M.'s desired postsecondary education. J.1 at 21. Additionally, the District planned a full day field trip to see MCC and TSTC to visit the disability officers and learn about their postsecondary programs. A.R. at 3777-78, 3912-13. This trip included a visit to certificate programs at TSTC, including their program on welding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3912.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Further, J.M.'s aforementioned transition goals clearly targeted the requisite areas of \"training, education, and employment.\" 300.320(b). As discussed above in Sections I and III(A)(vi) of this Order, J.M.'s IEP contained transition goals geared toward enrollment in higher education, his vocational interests in auctioneering and welding, and seeking future employment. J.1 at 8-10; R.8 at 12. For example, J.M.'s IEP included the following transition goals: (1) Training: \"[u]pon graduation from high school, [J.M.] will enroll in an institution of higher learning to pursue training in the field of welding\"; (2) Education: \"[u]pon graduation from high school, [J.M.] will enroll in an institution of higher learning to pursue a welding certification\"; (3) Employment: \"[u]pon completion of certification/degree, [J.M.] will seek to obtain employment in order to live independently and support himself financially.\" J.1 at 8. Although J.M.'s IEP did not contain any transition goals regarding independent living skills, such goals were determined as unnecessary by the ARD committee because J.M. was already demonstrating independent living skills at home.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8; R.8 at 11;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.320\">\n    34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) (transition goals related to independent living skills required only \"where appropriate\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Because of the above, the Court finds that the District provided J.M. measurable transition goals and sufficient transition services to help him achieve those goals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coleman v.

The SEHO correctly conducted the hearing.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Plaintiffs allege the SEHO did not correctly conduct the hearing because the SEHO: (1) repeatedly permitted subjective hearsay evidence to be admitted; (2) did not give Plaintiffs' expert witnesses the opportunity to observe all of Defendants' purported witnesses; (3) failed to rule on a request that one of Plaintiffs' witnesses be deemed an expert; and (4) refused to permit an offer of proof. Pls.' Mot. Summ. J. at 24. The Court addresses each allegation in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   First, the Court cannot make a ruling on whether the SEHO permitted subjective hearsay evidence because Plaintiffs fail to point out which statements are impermissible hearsay in the first place.\n   <em>\n    U.S. v.

It is not the Court's job to find contested evidence and then make an argument for why it should be excluded-that job is for Plaintiffs, and they have failed to do so here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Second, the Court cannot make a ruling on whether the SEHO erred in (1) failing to allow Plaintiffs' expert witnesses the opportunity to observe all of Defendants' purported witnesses; or (2) failing to rule on a request that one of Plaintiffs' witnesses be deemed an expert. The Court cannot make a ruling on either objection because Plaintiffs fail to explain why either alleged failure was improper. Plaintiffs merely make conclusory allegations without relying on any authority that would compel a ruling in their favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Finally, the SEHO did not refuse to permit an offer of proof as Plaintiffs allege-the SEHO explicitly told Plaintiffs to make their offer of proof at a later time. A.R. at 3486-487. Despite the SEHO's invitation, Plaintiffs never attempted to make their offer of proof again. Accordingly, Plaintiffs failed to adequately preserve error.\n   <em>\n    Sw.

The SEHO's decision is not contrary to standard legal practice.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Plaintiffs argue the SEHO's decision is contrary to standard legal practice because the SEHO: (1) ignored two of Plaintiffs' expert witnesses; (2) misapplied the evidentiary standard; (3) erred on the AT issue; and (4) failed to rule on extended school year services. The Court addresses each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   First, it is incorrect to allege the SEHO ignored two of Plaintiffs' expert witnesses merely because the SEHO did not reference\n   them in her decision. Defendants are correct in asserting that the lack of reference to these two expert witnesses means, at most, that the SEHO did not find their testimony credible or that it did not warrant discussion. In short, the Administrative Record shows the SEHO made a credibility determination, which she was free to do.\n   <em>\n    McAllister v. Dist. of Columbia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3971497\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/45/72/#p76\">\n    45 F.Supp.3d 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 76-77 (D.D.C. 2014) (finding that a SEHO's credibility determinations are entitled to deference absent \"non-testimonial, extrinsic evidence in the record that would justify a contrary conclusion.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Second, Plaintiffs support their allegation that the SEHO misapplied the evidentiary standard by cherry-picking statements made by the SEHO. As stated before, a procedural violation does not give rise to an actionable violation of the IDEA unless a plaintiff can show that the procedural violation (i) impeded the child's right to a FAPE; (ii) significantly impeded the parents' opportunity to participate in the decision-making process regarding the provision of a FAPE; or (iii) caused a deprivation of educational benefits.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(3)(E)(ii). Here, the SEHO did make some statements that could be interpreted as finding a procedural violation; however, each of these statements was followed by an explanation for why Plaintiffs failed to prove one of the requirements for a procedural violation under \u00a7 1415(f)(3)(E)(ii). For example, even though the SEHO stated it appeared no AT evaluation was completed, she found that J.M.'s \"IEPs nevertheless addressed [his] academic needs with appropriate instructional accommodations as support.\" A.R. at 43. Additionally, even though the SEHO found some evidence that teachers were not informed which IEP was in place, she found that the evidence as a whole suggested the services were provided in a coordinated, collaborative manner by the key stakeholders.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n    at 43-45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In sum, even assuming the SEHO's statements indicated there was a procedural violation, the SEHO found that Plaintiffs failed to prove one of the requirements for a procedural violation under \u00a7 1415(f)(3)(E)(ii). Because of this, the SEHO did not misapply the required evidentiary standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Third, the SEHO did not err on the AT issue. Plaintiffs appear to believe the SEHO erred on the AT issue because no technology evaluation was completed. Pls.' Mot. Summ. J. at 26. Under the IDEA, an IEP team must \"[c]onsider whether the child needs assistive technology devices and services.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201414\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(3)(B)(v) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.324\">\n    34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(v). \"Assistive technology service\" means \"any service that directly assists a child with a disability in the selection, acquisition, or use of an assistive technology device.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201401\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2).

This may include an evaluation of the needs of a child, but a school district may also do what the District did here. Here, the District discussed J.M.'s AT needs at his ARD committee meeting on May 27, 2017 and determined that no action was necessary because he already had access to an iPad for note taking and written assignments. R.8 at 56. Additionally, the ARD committee made available an individual to review\n   the iPad's applications and software programs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.324\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The individual was to follow-up with J.M. every three weeks.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.324\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Based off this evidence, the District did consider whether J.M. needed AT and decided providing him an iPad and extra instruction with that iPad was the best solution for J.M.'s circumstances.

If a school district finds that \"the benefits accrued to the child during the regular school year will be significantly jeopardized if he is not provided an educational program during the summer months,\" then the child may be entitled to ESY.\n   <em>\n    Alamo Heights Indep. Sch. Dist. v.

Here, the District did just that. The ADR committee explicitly considered ESY services on at least three occasions. R.4 at 14 (\"[J.M.] does not exhibit a need for Extended School Year services through special education.\"); R.8 at 53 (\"If state assessment standards are not met, [J.M.] may be required to attend summer school through general education.\"); R.11 at 29. Based on these discussions, the ADR committee concluded that ESY services were unnecessary because they did not believe J.M. would experience severe or substantial regression during the summer months. R.11 at 29 (\"Information and feedback from [J.M.'s] teachers indicates that he does not show regression over breaks, he is able to maintain passing grades, and has positive progress reports, therefore ESY is not warranted.\"). Accordingly, the District did consider whether J.M. needed ESY services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Regardless, the ESY services issue was subsumed within Plaintiffs' general contention that the District failed to provide J.M. with an appropriate IEP. A.R. at 196, 380. As a result, by finding that the District did provide J.M. with an appropriate IEP, the SEHO implicitly ruled that the ESY services issue had a negligible impact on Plaintiffs' broader contention. Because of the reasons above, the Court finds (1) the District did consider ESY services; and (2) that the SEHO did not fail to rule on ESY services.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    B.
