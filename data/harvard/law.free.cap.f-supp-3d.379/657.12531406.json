The Court has been advised, having reviewed the record, the parties' briefs, and the applicable law. For the reasons set forth below, the motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Stipulated Facts and Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The stipulated facts\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   1. In the three-year period preceding the filing of the Class and Collective Action Complaint (ECF No. 1 ), Defendants Avalon Holdings Corporation, The Avalon Resort and Spa LLC, Avalon Golf and Country Club, Inc., Avalon Country Club at Sharon, Inc., and Ronald Klingle (collectively, \"Defendants\") employed approximately 242 people as banquet servers, banquet bartenders, and banquet bussers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   2. Plaintiff Jessica Matusky worked for Defendants as a banquet server, a banquet bartender, and as a set-up person from October 2014 to April 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   3. While working as a banquet server, Matusky was paid at a rate of $ 6.50 per hour and Defendants used a tip credit to make up the difference between that rate and the minimum wage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   4. While working as a banquet bartender, Matusky was paid at a rate of $ 4.05 or $ 4.08 per hour, depending upon the Ohio minimum wage then in effect, during the time she worked for Defendants and Defendants used a tip credit to make up the difference between this rate and the minimum wage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   5. Plaintiff John Stahl worked for Defendants as a banquet server or busser\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and a set-up person from May, 2015 to May, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   6. While working as a banquet server, Stahl was paid at a rate of $ 6.50 per hour and Defendants used a tip credit to make\n   up the difference between that rate and the minimum wage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   7. Plaintiff Zackary Kerr worked for Defendants in various positions, including banquet server and banquet bartender from November, 2014 to present.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiffs base their Amended Collective Action Complaint (ECF No. 31-1 ) on the fact that, as banquet employees, they were required to perform final preparatory work prior to and clean up after events held at Defendants' resorts and Defendants took a tip credit on their wages for this time. As admitted by Plaintiffs, restaurants are very different from banquet halls. Deposition of Jessica Matusky (ECF No. 27-1 ) at PageID #: 168, Pg. 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   There are fundamental differences between the banquet setting and the restaurant setting. In a restaurant, the tables and chairs are in place before the customer arrives for the first time and are usually set with napkins, glasses, and silverware. Declaration of Ronald Klingle (ECF No. 39-1 ) at PageID #: 513-14, \u00b6\u00b6 4-5. The set-up of the restaurant is the same day to day. ECF No. 39-1 at PageID #: 514, \u00b6 6. The restaurant server provides the customer with a menu, takes an order for food and drinks, serves the food and drinks to the customer, clears any dirty dishes or glasses, and provides the customer with a final bill. ECF No. 39-1 at PageID #: 514, \u00b6 7. The final bill includes a charge for each order of food and each drink and the applicable state tax. ECF No. 39-1 at PageID #: 514, \u00b6 8. The customer pays the bill and adds a tip on top of the total amount. The tip is based on a percentage of the total bill, which is usually between 10 to 20 percent. ECF No. 39-1 at PageID #: 514, \u00b6 9. The amount of tips a restaurant server receives can increase based on the number of customers they serve and the amount of food and drink each customer orders. ECF No. 39-1 at PageID #: 514, \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In the banquet setting, the party host chooses a banquet facility months in advance of the event when the room where the event is to take place is generally empty of any chairs, tables, or decorations. The bar in the room is not stocked with liquor, glasses or fruit. ECF No. 39-1 at PageID #: 514, \u00b6 11. The party host makes selections regarding the set-up of the room and the decorations for the room, including the chairs, the linens for the table, the place-settings, the types of tables, the type of liquor and drinks to be served at the event, how the food is served, and, in some cases, special requests such as a stage or a dance floor. ECF No. 39-1 at PageID #: 514-15, \u00b6 12. The customer determines the amount of food and drinks based on the total number of guests, so the menu for the event is set early. ECF No. 39-1 at PageID #: 515, \u00b6 13. Because every event has a different number of guests and different needs to cater to, the set-up for each event is significantly different. As a result, the rooms do not remain set between events but are torn down and then re-set for the next event. ECF No. 39-1 at PageID #: 515, \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Recognizing this process is necessary for every event, Defendants charge the customer for the set-up work that must be completed before the event and the clean-up after the event. ECF No. 39-1 at PageID #: 515, \u00b6\u00b6 15-16, 19. At the end of the event, the customer,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the party host, is presented with a bill that contains all of the charges for the event. These charges include a charge for each food item, a charge for each drink, a charge for set-up, a charge for the room rental, and a charge for any special requests, including valets, attendants, DJs or stages. No part of the event is free and everything is charged back to the customer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   ECF No. 39-1 at PageID #: 515, \u00b6 16. The bill for the customer includes a total charge and a line to include an optional tip. ECF No. 39-1 at PageID #: 515, \u00b6 17; Sample Receipts of Banquet Events (ECF No. 39-2 ; Supplemental Declaration of Ronald Klingle (ECF No. 44-1 ) at PageID #: 629-30, \u00b6\u00b6 4-5; Sample Final Bills for Banquet Events (ECF No. 44-1 ). When a customer leaves a tip, it is based on a percentage of the total charge, which is usually ten to twenty percent of the total. This tip is then divided among the tipped banquet employees,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the banquet servers and bartenders. ECF No. 39-1 at PageID #: 515, \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On occasion, the party host does not provide a tip or the tip that is provided is insufficient to cover Defendants' tip credit. In those instances, Defendants pay the employee an additional amount to ensure that each banquet employee is paid at least the minimum wage for all hours worked in a workweek. Thus, no banquet employee makes less than minimum wage for all hours worked. ECF No. 39-1 at PageID #: 516, \u00b6 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Unlike restaurant employees, a banquet employee's tip does not come from the individual guests attending the event, but from the party host. The amount of the food is preselected, so the guests cannot increase the bill by ordering more food. As a result, a banquet server's tips do not increase based on the amount of food or guests she serves. ECF No. 39-1 at PageID #: 516, \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   One exception to this is banquet bartenders, who may be able to increase tips based on the amount of drinks and guests served, if a tip jar is allowed. If there is a tip jar, individual guests can tip the bartenders based on the number of drinks they order. At the end of the event, bartenders are given the option of adding the tip jar amount to the total tip and receiving a portion of the total tip or dividing the tip jar amount amongst themselves. ECF No. 39-1 at PageID #: 516, \u00b6 22. In most cases, banquet bartenders decide to split the tip jar amongst themselves and do not participate in the overall tip because it results in more money for each of them. ECF No. 39-1 at PageID #: 516, \u00b6 23. If a tip jar is not allowed, the customer includes a tip of $ 75 per bartender in the total, which is provided to the bartender as a tip.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF No. 39-1 at PageID #: 517, \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Matusky, Stahl, and Kerr were all hired by Defendants to work in tipped occupations for which Defendants took a tip credit on their wages. ECF No. 27-1 at PageID #: 167-68, Pgs. 8-9; Deposition of John Stahl (ECF No. 27-2 ) at PageID #: 221, Pgs. 9-11; PageID #: 222-23, Pgs. 15-17; and, Deposition of Zackary Kerr (ECF No. 27-3 ) at PageID #: 273-74, Pgs. 11-13. As banquet servers, Matusky and Stahl were paid a pay rate of $ 6.50 per hour and Defendants used a tip credit to cover the difference between this pay rate and the applicable minimum wage rate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF No. 27-1 at PageID #: 167-68, Pgs. 8-9; ECF No. 27-2 at PageID #: 223-24, Pgs. 20-22. Matusky and Kerr were paid between\n   $ 4.05 and $ 4.08 per hour as banquet bartenders and Defendants used a tip credit to cover the minimum wage difference. ECF No. 27-1 at PageID #: 167-68, Pgs. 8-9; ECF No. 27-3 at PageID #: 286-87, Pgs. 61-66.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   During the period covered by this litigation, all three Plaintiffs made at or above the minimum wage in every workweek they worked for Defendants. ECF No. 39-1 at PageID #: 518, \u00b6 33. In the case of Matusky, her average hourly rate was $ 11.44 and that rate increased to $ 12.94 per hour when factoring in only her tipped work. ECF No. 39-1 at PageID #: at 518, \u00b6 35. Similarly, Stahl's average hourly rate was $ 11.06 and that rate increased to $ 12.28 per hour when factoring in only work for which Defendants took a tip credit. ECF No. 39-1 at PageID #: at 518, \u00b6 36. And, in the case of Kerr, his average hourly rate was $ 12.80 and that rate increased to $ 15.87 when factoring in only his tipped work. ECF No. 39-1 at PageID #: 518, \u00b6 37.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As banquet servers and bartenders, Plaintiffs would work at catered events at Defendants' different locations. ECF No. 27-2 at PageID #: 221, Pgs. 9-10. Such events included corporate parties, weddings, baby/bridal showers, and anniversary parties. While the events would generally last from four to six hours, Plaintiffs would typically be scheduled to work two hours prior to the actual start of the event. ECF No. 27-1 at PageID #: 172-73, Pgs. 28-30; PageID #: 175, Pgs. 38-39; PageID #: 184-85, Pgs. 74-77; PageID #: 186-87, Pgs. 82-85; ECF No. 27-2 at PageID #: 225-26, Pgs. 28-30; and, ECF No. 27-3 at PageID #: 274-75, Pgs. 16-18. When they arrived prior to the event, they would clock-in under the appropriate tipped occupation on the time clock. ECF No. 27-1 at PageID #: 182-83, Pgs. 68-69. During the time prior to the start of the event, banquet servers, including Matusky and Stahl, would perform final preparatory work for the party, including setting up glassware, filling glasses with water, putting out china, installing decorations, preparing the cake and cookie tables, preparing the coffee stations, and general cleaning. ECF No. 27-1 at PageID #: 173-75, Pgs. 30-38; PageID #: 178-80, Pgs. 49-57; and ECF No. 27-2 at PageID #: 221-22, Pgs. 12-14; PageID #: 226, Pgs. 30-32. As banquet bartenders, Matusky and Kerr would clean and set up glasses, stock the bar with liquor, cut fruit for drinks, retrieve ice for the bar, set-up a pop-up bar if requested, prepare the tip jar, napkin caddies and bottle openers, and clean the bar area prior to the start of the event. ECF No. 27-1 at PageID #: 173-75, Pgs. 30-38; PageID #: 178-80, Pgs. 49-57; and ECF No. 27-3 at PageID #: 275-78, Pgs. 18-29. After the event, Plaintiffs would remove decorations, tear down the table and chairs, take out any trash, and clean up the event area. ECF No. 27-1 at PageID #: 178-79, Pgs. 52-53; PageID #: 184-85, Pgs. 74-77; ECF No. 27-2 at PageID #: 225-226, Pgs. 28-30; and, ECF No. 27-3 at PageID #: 278, Pgs. 30-32. For work performed on the same day both before and after the event, Defendants took a tip credit on Plaintiffs' wages. ECF No. 27-3 at PageID #: 274-75, Pgs. 16-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   All banquet employees are paid minimum wage for set-up work performed the\n   day before and the day after an event. ECF No. 39-1 at PageID #: 518, \u00b6 38. Defendants have a category in their timekeeping system for set-up and pay employees minimum wage for time spent clocked-in under this category. Matusky Timesheet (ECF No. 29-4 ); Matusky Minimum Wage Calculation Sheet (ECF No. 29-3 ) (showing regular minimum wage of $ 8.10 paid for \"Setup -Banquet\"); Stahl Timesheets (ECF Nos. 29-8, 29-11, and 29-14); and, Stahl Minimum Wage Calculation Sheets (ECF Nos. 29-7, 29-10, and 29-13 (showing regular minimum wage of $ 8.10 paid for \"Setup -Banquet\"). Events hosted at Defendants' facilities are not only set-up the day of the event. ECF No. 44-1 at PageID #: 630, \u00b66. Rather, employees are often scheduled days before the event to set-up tables and chairs in the banquet hall. ECF No. 44-1 at PageID #: 630, \u00b67. When employees are scheduled on these days, they are required to clock-in under set-up and are paid the minimum wage. ECF No. 44-1 at PageID #: 630, \u00b6 8. Defendants do not take a tip-credit for this time. ECF No. 44-1 at PageID #: 631, \u00b6 11. Defendants do this for administrative purposes. ECF No. 44-1 at PageID #: 630, \u00b6 8. The payment of minimum wage for some set-up work does not transform a tipped duty into a non-tipped duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In July 2017, Plaintiff Jessica Matusky brought this (1) collective action under the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   ., for minimum wage pay and (2) class action under the Ohio Minimum Fair Wage Standards Act and Pennsylvania Minimum Wage Act for minimum wage pay. ECF No. 1. An Amended Collective Action Complaint (ECF No. 31-1 ), which added Opt-in Plaintiffs John Stahl and Zackary Kerr, was deemed served and filed as of February 22, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order (ECF No. 36 ). The Amended Collective Action Complaint (ECF No. 31-1 ) alleges additional facts obtained through discovery. The amended pleading also reduced the number of allegations and claims at issue by removing the Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 class action allegations entirely. It narrows the focus of the case at bar to tip credit violations, already alleged in the Class and Collective Action Complaint (ECF No. 1 ), for both regular and overtime hours.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   It further restricts the class definition to the tipped banquet servers at Defendants' four banquet facilities in Ohio and Pennsylvania based on the testimony of Avalon Holding's designated Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6) representative that there are other tipped employees employed elsewhere in Defendants' organization. Plaintiffs' FLSA claims are based on their allegations that Defendants improperly take a tip credit the day of an event for work they perform before and after the banquet or party. Plaintiffs assert that, during those times, the duties they perform are non-tipped duties and that work takes up more than 20 percent of their workweek. ECF No. 31-1 at PageID #: 440, \u00b6 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriately granted when the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show \"that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

The FLSA tip-credit exemption applies to tipped employees. The FLSA defines a \"tipped employee\" as \"any employee engaged in an\n   <em>\n    occupation\n   </em>\n   in which he customarily and regularly receives more than $ 30 a month in tips.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20203\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (t) (emphasis added). The DOL regulations define \"tip\" as \"a sum presented by a customer as a gift or gratuity in recognition of some service performed for him.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20531.52\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Section 531.56(e), 29 C.F.R. explains how this definition applies to employees working \"dual jobs\" --workers who engage in both tipped and non-tipped work:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (e) Dual jobs. In some situations an employee is employed in a dual job, as\n   for example, where a maintenance man in a hotel also serves as a waiter. In such a situation the employee, if he customarily and regularly receives at least $ 30 a month in tips for his work as a waiter, is a tipped employee only with respect to his employment as a waiter. He is employed in two\n   <em>\n    occupations\n   </em>\n   , and no tip credit can be taken for his hours of employment in his\n   <em>\n    occupation\n   </em>\n   of maintenance man. Such a situation is distinguishable from that of a waitress who spends part of her time cleaning and setting tables, toasting bread, making coffee and occasionally washing dishes or glasses. It is likewise distinguishable from the counterman who also prepares his own short orders or who, as part of a group of countermen, takes a turn as a short order cook for the group. Such related duties in an\n   <em>\n    occupation\n   </em>\n   that is a tipped\n   <em>\n    occupation\n   </em>\n   need not by themselves be directed toward producing tips.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Under\n   <em>\n    Auer v.

They cite to \u00a7 30d00(f) of the Field Operations Handbook (\"FOH\"), created by the Department of Labor (\"DOL\") in 1988, to support their argument that a tip credit cannot be taken for time spent on non-tipped duties in the banquet setting:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (2) 29 CFR 531.56(e) permits the employer to take a tip credit for time spent in duties related to the tipped occupation of an employee, even though such duties are not by themselves directed toward producing tips, provided such related duties are incidental to the regular duties of the tipped employees and are generally assigned to the tipped employee. For example, duties related to the tipped occupation may include a server who does preparatory or closing activities, rolls silverware and fills salt and pepper shakers while the restaurant is open, cleans and sets tables, makes coffee, and occa\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (3) However, where the facts indicate that tipped employees spend a substantial amount of time (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , in excess of 20 percent of the hours worked in the tipped occupation in the workweek) performing such related duties, no tip credit may be taken for the time spent in those duties. All related duties count toward the 20 percent tolerance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FOH (ECF No. 40-2 ) at PageID #: 557.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The 1988 FOH's interpretation contemplates a two-step process for an employee to prove that an employer is in violation of the law. First, the employee must prove that the duties complained of are not tip-producing. After the employee clears the hurdle of showing that the duties are non-tipped duties, the employee then must prove that more than 20 percent of her workweek was spent performing these non-tipped duties and the employer took a tip credit for that time. If the employee can provide sufficient evidence on both\n   steps, then the employer has allegedly violated the FLSA. In their Memorandum in Opposition (ECF No. 43-1 ), Plaintiffs focus on the second step and how much time they spend on alleged non-tipped duties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   In doing so, they skip the first step of the analysis that requires them to show that these duties are not tip-producing duties. Rather, Plaintiffs simply assume that the duties they allege they spend more than 20 percent of their time performing are non-tipped duties without any evidence or analysis. This assumption stems from their belief that if a duty is not tip-producing for a restaurant server or bartender, then it is also not tip-producing for a banquet server or bartender. This not only ignores the inherent differences between a restaurant and a banquet hall, but also ignores how a tip-producing duty is determined. Because of the difference in the way the work is billed at a banquet hall as opposed to a restaurant, whether a duty is tipped or non-tipped has to be evaluated differently for the banquet setting than for the restaurant setting, even though the duties of a banquet employee and a restaurant employee may overlap.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On November 8, 2018, however, the DOL issued an opinion letter. Wage and Hour Division (\"WHD\") of the DOL, Opinion Letter FLSA2018-27 (Nov. 8, 2018). Under the 2018 interpretation, employers are instructed to consult the \"Tasks\" section of the Occupational Information Network (\"O*NET\"), an online job duty database.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   If a duty is listed as \"core\" or \"supplemental\" to the tipped occupation in this database, then it \"shall be considered directly related to the tip-producing duties of that occupation\" and \"[n]o limitation shall be placed on the amount of these duties that may be performed whether or not they involve direct customer service, as long as they are performed contemporaneously with the duties involving direct service to customers or for a reasonable time immediately before or after performing such direct-service duties.\" Employers may not take a tip credit for tasks not listed on the O*NET task list.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Section 30d00(f) of the FOH currently reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   (2) 29 CFR 531.56(e) permits the employer to take a tip credit for any time the employee spends in duties related to the tipped occupation, even though such duties are not themselves directed toward producing tips.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   (3) WHD staff will consult the Occupational Information Network (O*NET), an online source of occupational information, and 29 CFR 531.56(e) to determine whether duties are related or unrelated to the tip-producing occupation. Duties will be considered related to the tipped occupation when listed as \"core\" or \"supplemental\" under the \"Tasks\" section of the \"Details\" tab for the appropriate tip-producing occupation in O*NET.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   a. An employer may take a tip credit for any amount of time that an\n   employee spends on related, non-tipped duties performed contemporaneously with the tipped duties -- or for a reasonable time immediately before or after performing the tipped duties --regardless whether those duties involve direct customer service.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   WHD Opinion Letter WH-502 (March 28, 1980), which concludes that a server's time spent performing related duties (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , vacuuming) after restaurant closing is subject to a tip credit. For example, the core tasks currently listed in O*NET for waiters and waitresses (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   the O*NET Summary Report for waiters and waitresses) include: cleaning tables or counters after patrons have finished dining; preparing tables for meals, which encompasses setting up items such as linens, silverware, and glassware; and stocking service areas with supplies such as coffee, food, tableware, and linens. In addition, O*NET lists garnishing and decorating dishes in preparation for serving as a supplemental task for waiters and waitresses. An employer may take a tip credit for any amount of time a waiter or waitress who is a tipped employee spends performing these related duties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   b. The WHD recognizes that there will be unique or newly emerging occupations that qualify as tipped occupations under the FLSA for which there is no O*NET description.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , WHD Opinion Letter FLSA2008-18 (December 19, 2008) regarding itamae-sushi chefs and teppanyaki chefs. For such tipped occupations, the duties usually and customarily performed by employees in that specific occupation shall be considered related duties as long as they are consistent with the related duties performed in similar O*NET occupations. For example, in the case of unique occupations such as teppanyaki chefs, the related duties would be those that are included in the tasks set out in O*NET for counter attendants in the restaurant industry.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Defendants cite the DOL's O*NET listing of tasks for servers and bartenders to demonstrate that the duties Plaintiffs argue are non-tipped are all related to Plaintiffs' tipped occupations as banquet servers and/or bartenders. The Summary Report for Waiters and Waitresses covers the job title \"banquet server\" and sets forth a list of 25 \"tasks\" related to that occupation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   O*NET OnLine Summary Report for 35-3031.00 - Waiters and Waitresses, https://www.onetonline.org/link/summary/35-3031.00 (last visited March 28, 2019).

The duties Plaintiffs' argue are non-tipped are all related to Plaintiffs' tipped occupations as banquet servers and/or bartenders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Plaintiffs' claim that the duties they perform before and after the event on the day of the event are not tipped duties and that they should be paid at the minimum wage for those duties. Plaintiffs' claims fail as a matter of law because all of the duties they were required to perform, particularly on the day of an event, are tip-producing duties in the context of a banquet setting. Plaintiffs admit in their depositions that all of the alleged non-tipped duties that they performed were related to their tipped occupation and would become tipped work once the first guest arrived at the event.

Whether a duty is tipped work has to be determined based on the context of the work performed and whether the customer provides a tip for the service. Plaintiffs' claims fail because the tip that Plaintiffs receive is based on the bill for the entire event, including charges for the final preparation beforehand and the clean-up after on the day of the event. Accordingly, these duties are tip-producing and Defendants can take a tip credit for this work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Court recognizes that the Sixth Circuit has not afforded the FOH any type of deference or binding effect in relation to its interpretation of the FLSA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stein v.
