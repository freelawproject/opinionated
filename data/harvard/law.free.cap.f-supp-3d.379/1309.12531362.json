(D.E. 51.) This case was originally assigned to United States District Judge Kenneth L. Ryskamp.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 30, 2006, the Government filed and served upon Defendant an Information pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20851\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   stating that it intended to seek an enhanced statutory penalty under Section 841 based upon six prior state court convictions for felony drug offenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (D.E. 101.) Defendant later filed a response to the Information challenging the Section 851 enhancement. (D.E. 115.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 1, 2006, a jury found Defendant guilty of Counts One, Two, and Three. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jury Verdict, D.E. 110; Trial Tr., Feb. 1, 2006 at 601:10-21.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The jury further found that the offense charged in Count Two involved at least 50 grams of crack cocaine, and that the offense charged in Count Three involved at least 5 grams of crack cocaine. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jury Verdict at 1; Trial Tr., Feb. 1, 2006 at 601:10-21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Prior to sentencing, the United States Probation Office prepared a revised Presentence\n   Investigation Report (\"PSR\") finding that Defendant's offenses involved 142.2 grams of crack cocaine. (PSR \u00b6\u00b6 15, 23.) Relevant here, the PSR found that the offense charged in Count Two involved 100.2 grams of crack cocaine, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-11), and the offense charged in Count Three involved 10 grams of crack cocaine, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9). Based on the 142.2 grams of crack cocaine, Defendant's base offense level was 32 pursuant to the drug quantity tables in United States Sentencing Guideline (\"U.S.S.G.\") 2D1.1(a)(3) (2005), which provides that an offense involving at least 50 grams but less than 150 grams of cocaine base has an offense level of 32. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The PSR further found that because Defendant was over eighteen years old and had at least two prior convictions for controlled substance offenses,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   he qualified as a Career Offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) As to Counts Two and Three, because the statutory maximum penalty under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A) &amp; (B) with the Section 851 enhancement was life imprisonment, pursuant to Section 4B1.1(b)(1) Defendant's offense level was 37. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29, 98.) Because his career offender offense level under Section 4B1.1 was greater than his drug quantity offense level under Section 2D1.1, the career offender offense level applied. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29 (citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) The PSR further found that because Defendant had 18 criminal history points, he had a criminal history category of VI. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64.) Based on a total offense level of 37 and a criminal history category of VI, Defendant's guideline imprisonment range was 360 months to life. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 99.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   However, as to Count Two, Defendant was subject to a statutory mandatory minimum life sentence based upon the Section 851 enhancement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Specifically, as to Count Two, Defendant was sentenced under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A), which provides, in pertinent part: \"If any person commits a violation of this subparagraph ... after two or more prior convictions for a felony drug offense have become final, such person shall be sentenced to a mandatory term of life imprisonment without release and fined in accordance with the preceding sentence.\" Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1(c)(2), the Court may impose a sentence \"at any point within the applicable guideline range, provided that the sentence ... is not less than any statutorily required minimum sentence.\" Because Count Two carried a statutorily-required minimum sentence of life, Defendant's guideline imprisonment range was life. (PSR \u00b6 99.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On April 14, 2006, Judge Ryskamp adopted the revised PSR and imposed a sentence of life imprisonment, consisting of concurrent terms of 240 months as to Count One, life imprisonment as to Count Two, and 360 months as to Count Three. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sentencing Hr'g Tr. at 8:1, 10:9-23; Judgment, D.E. 119 at 2.) Judge Ryskamp also imposed a total term of ten years' supervised release, consisting of concurrent terms of three years as to Count One, ten years as to Count Two, and eight years as to Count Three. (Judgment at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant appealed his convictions asserting arguments not relevant here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   On\n   September 28, 2008, the Eleventh Circuit issued its Mandate affirming the Defendant's convictions and sentence.

(D.E. 144.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On July 22, 2011, Defendant filed a Motion for Modification of Sentence under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203582\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2). (D.E. 145.) Therein, he sought a reduction of sentence pursuant to Amendments 748 and 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which lowered the base offense levels for particular crack cocaine quantities listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c), pursuant to the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Pub.

App. C, Amends. 748, 750. On December 1, 2011, Judge Ryskamp denied the motion. (D.E. 151.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant filed an application for executive clemency, which President Barack Obama granted on October 6, 2016. (D.E. 152.) The Clemency Order commuted Defendant's sentence to a total of 360 months' imprisonment, leaving intact the terms of supervised release and all other conditions imposed by Judge Ryskamp. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Am.

(D.E. 154.) On May 1, 2019, the Court denied that Motion. (D.E. 160.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On April 18, 2019, Defendant filed the instant Motion to Reduce Sentence under the First Step Act and Motion for Appointment as Counsel. (D.E. 158.)

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.)

(Resp. at 6 (quoting Executive Grant of Clemency at 3).) It argues that the First Step Act permits a court to reduce only a judicially-imposed sentence based upon the applicable statutory penalties, not a presidentially-imposed \"total sentence\" that commuted a statutorily mandated sentence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) It further argues that even if the Court had discretion to reduce Movant's commuted sentences in Counts Two and Three under the First Step Act, the Act does not give the Court authority to reduce the sentence for Count One because it was not based upon an offense for which the statutory penalties were modified by the Fair Sentencing Act; and because Defendant's commuted sentence of 360 months applies equally to Count One, the Court has no authority to modify the 360-month \"total sentence\" imposed as to that Count. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Alternatively, the Government argues that Defendant is ineligible for a sentence reduction because nothing in the First Step Act alters his status as a Career Offender and, therefore, Defendant would still have faced a statutory maximum sentence of life imprisonment under Count Two if the Fair Sentencing Act had been in effect when he was sentenced. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.) As such, his base offense level still would have been 37 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(b)(A), and his Criminal History Category would have remained at VI. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Consequently, he would still be facing a maximum statutory penalty of life imprisonment as to Count Two, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 cmt. 2)), and his guideline sentencing range would still be 360 months to life, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10). Finally, the Government argues that even if Defendant would otherwise be eligible for a sentence reduction, the Court should exercise its discretion to deny one because, inter alia, Defendant has not been a \"model inmate.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11.) The Government attached to\n   its Response a copy of Defendant's prison disciplinary record, which reveals three violations for possessing alcohol, drugs, or intoxicants. (D.E. 161-1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Probation Office submits that Defendant is not eligible for relief because \"his revised offense level computations provide for an advisory guideline range equal to and potentially greater than his commuted sentence. The First Step Act of 2018 does not further reduce the guideline imprisonment range.\" (Prob. Resp. at 3.) It asserts that the retroactive statutory term of imprisonment is 10 years to life as to Count Two, and 0 to 30 years as to Count Three. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) However, because Defendant is a Career Offender, he still has an offense level of 37 and a criminal history category of VI, which equates to a guideline imprisonment range of 360 months to life. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) Because Defendant is serving a commuted sentence at the bottom of the new advisory guideline range, the Probation Office submits that Defendant is not eligible for relief. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Probation Office also notes that Defendant has been sanctioned three times while incarcerated for possessing intoxicants and/or using drugs/alcohol.

For the same reasons, the Court rejects the Government's alternative argument that because Defendant's commuted sentence of 360 months applies equally to Count One, the Court has no authority to modify the 360-month \"total sentence\" imposed as to that Count. Judge Ryskamp sentenced Defendant to 240 months' imprisonment as to Count One. (Judgment at 2.) President Obama did not \"impose\" a new, 360-month sentence as to Count One-he had no authority to do so. As Defendant observes in his Reply, \"[s]uch argument - that a commutation of a life sentence on one count may somehow also serve to increase a sentence on another count to 10 years above the statutory maximum - is not only contrary to law, it violates the separations of powers, and is simply not persuasive.\" (Reply at 7.)

As stated previously, Section 2 of the Fair Sentencing Act expressly increased the amount of crack cocaine necessary to invoke the mandatory minimum sentences and the statutory maximum sentences under Section 841(b) ; Section 3 eliminated the mandatory minimum sentence for simple possession of crack cocaine.

Applying Section 2 of the Fair Sentencing Act retroactively, Defendant's conviction in Count Two would now fall under Section 841(b)(1)(B) because he is accountable for 28 grams or more of crack cocaine but less than 280 grams.

Here, Count Two carries the greatest offense statutory maximum. Because the maximum statutory term of imprisonment for Count Two remains life imprisonment, as a Career Offender the Defendant's offense level is still 37, his criminal history remains at Criminal History Category VI, resulting in the guideline range of 360 months to life imprisonment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1.
