According to IMS,\n   \" 'There needs to be some facts alleged that articulate why it is plausible that the other party's product infringes that patent claim -- not just the patentee asserting, in conclusory fashion, that it is so.' \" (D.I. 9 at 6) (quoting\n   <em>\n    North Star Innovations, Inc. v.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 9 at 7; D.I. 19 at 2, n.2) \" '( Section 271 (e)(2)(A) defines the filing of an ANDA as an act of infringement, but it does not alter the underlying patent infringement analysis.' \") (quoting\n   <em>\n    Bayer Schering Pharma AG v.

Further, meeting this requirement means complying with the \"mandate[ ]\" of the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   to include in a complaint \" 'factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.' \" (D.I. 19 at 3) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) To Defendant, \"Supreme Court precedent is clear, and given Belcher's full access to all the documents it needs to allege infringement, Belcher's fact-free Complaint should be dismissed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff responds that only the asserted claims and the artificial act of infringement need be pled, \"because 'Congress defined infringement in a special way to create an 'artificial' act of infringement under \u00a7 271(e)(2) : submitting an ANDA.' \" (D.I. 15 at 5-6) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers Squibb Company v.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6) The Complaint also references Plaintiff's pre-Complaint review of Defendant's NDA and Paragraph IV notice letter, from which it may be reasonably inferred that Plaintiff's holds a good faith belief in its ability to prove actual infringement.

A plaintiff in receipt of a paragraph IV certification has an extremely limited time, just 45 days, in which to decide whether (and, if so, where and against whom), to file suit, if it is to obtain the benefit of the automatic stay of FDA approval.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   It will not always be reasonable to expect a plaintiff in such a position to develop the level of specificity Defendant asks the Court to impose. Relatedly, although in this case the parties negotiated Plaintiff's pre-Complaint confidential access to Defendant's NDA filing, such an accommodation will not always occur, and it is not a requirement of the Hatch-Waxman Act. For this reason, as well, Plaintiff may not know much about the details of a\n   proposed product and may, again, not be able to plead infringement with specificity. Nor, of course, may the plaintiff go out and purchase the accused product and test it for itself since, in these cases, the product does not yet actually exist (and if samples have been created, they cannot, by law, be available for purchase). Finally, because the defendant in these cases actually triggers the litigation - by giving notice to the plaintiff that defendant has applied for regulatory approval of a drug that is similar to a drug that the plaintiff listed in the Orange Book as being covered by the asserted patent - the defendant already knows at least some of the reason why the plaintiff may plausibly believe that its patent also covers defendant's proposed product.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers Squibb\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203980155\">\n    2017 WL 3980155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7-8 (\"Congress created this particularized framework in order to trigger expedited patent litigation between branded and generic drug manufacturers before the generic drug is launched into the market to compete with the branded drug....

The parties have not drawn the Court's attention to any case (nor has the Court itself found one) that says that what is required for\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     pleading\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   infringement in the Hatch-Waxman context is also the same as in any other infringement suit. Hence, Plaintiff's allegations that Defendant committed an artificial act of infringement by filing its paper NDA, and that Defendant's proposed drug product will infringe Claims 6 and 7 of the '197 patent (an Orange Book-listed patent), are sufficient to survive Defendant's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Finally, the Court is unpersuaded by Defendant's suggestion that the reason for the lack of specificity in Plaintiff's Complaint - and the futility that would mar any amended complaint the Court might contemplate permitting Plaintiff to file - is that Plaintiff knows and understands that \"any theory of infringement would necessarily invalidate the '197 patent.\" (D.I. 9 at 1) Defendant asserts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   If IMS's manufacture and sale of injectable epinephrine formulations would infringe the patent, then what Belcher claims to be its invention is simply not new. Any arguments that Belcher makes regarding how IMS's NDA products infringe the '197 patent would actually be admissions that the '197 patent is invalid in view of IMS's manufacture and sale of injectable epinephrine formulations since at least 2010, long before the 2014 patent filing date.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Court, of course, is not in a position to evaluate the merits of Defendant's invalidity defense at the motion to dismiss stage. As Plaintiff explains, many\n   of the premises of Defendant's argument implicate factual disputes. For example:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendant's 2010 epinephrine formulation documentation ... has not been shown to be the formulation used in Defendant's NDA Product because Defendant's only evidence proffering such arguments includes a blank batch record as well as a package insert that does not show the manufacturing details of the formulation ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   ... [Nor] has [it] been shown that the 2010 Formulation was the subject of a commercial offer for sale or that it was ready for patenting.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Lastly, Defendant has not shown by clear and convincing evidence that the 2010 Formulation would render the '197 Patent invalid as obvious [for reasons including secondary considerations of nonobviousness].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   (D.I. 15 at 2-3)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, application of the Court's claim construction decision from a related case,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Belcher Pharm., LLC v.

Unlike an ANDA [under 505(j) ], a 505(b)(2) application is necessarily different by statute, and it requires additional clinical studies to confirm that the product is safe and effective.\" (D.I. 19 at 4) The Court disagrees, concluding instead that the same pleading standard applies to both 505(j) and 505(b)(2) suits. Both are statutorily-created artificial acts of infringement, and both serve the same purpose of facilitating the speedy and cost-effective market-entry of a generic drug, while at the same time protecting valuable patent rights, by providing a mechanism for relatively expeditious pre-launch resolution of patent disputes.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Almost without exception, the NDA or ANDA filings are quite lengthy - here, Defendant's ANDA was more than 4,000 pages.

Additionally, it is not uncommon for multiple ANDAs to be filed on the same patent at the same time, putting a plaintiff in the position of having to make decisions about launching multiple litigations, all within the same (or substantially the same) 45-day window.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    The defenses asserted here by IMS are different than those asserted in the cases to which IMS compares the instant case.
