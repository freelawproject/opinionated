In the instant case, the named insureds effectively lowered the UM/UIM benefits for their four vehicles under an automobile insurance policy with the defendant by executing a form request for lower UM/UIM coverage in September 2001. The named insureds later dropped their fourth vehicle from the policy, only to add another fourth vehicle a few months later. When they added the new fourth vehicle, the vehicle would have had UM/UIM coverage equal to the bodily injury limits unless the named insureds executed another document requesting lower limits on this vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In March 2003, the named insureds signed a form provided by the defendant wherein they unequivocally requested lower UM/UIM limits for this fourth vehicle. This form, however, also listed the other three vehicles covered by the policy, and the named insureds did not check any boxes indicating a selection of lower UM/UIM limits for these vehicles. At the top of the form, there is language indicating that the policy will carry UM/UIM limits equal to the bodily injury liability limits unless the first named insured selects a lower limit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In this action, the daughter of the named insureds was injured in an accident while driving a covered vehicle. The named insureds had reduced the UM/UIM coverage for this vehicle in September 2001, but they did not check any box for lower limits on the form request for lower UM/UIM limits in March 2003. The daughter has brought an action against her parents' insurer seeking,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , UIM coverage equal to the bodily injury liability limits by\n   essentially claiming that her parents' decision not to check any box for lower UM/UIM coverage in March 2003 resulted in the default UM/UIM coverage when a named insured has not affirmatively selected lower limits. The insurance company contends that the available UM/UIM coverage for the daughter is the lower coverage that the named insureds selected in September 2001. The insurer argues that the parents' failure to check any box for lower UM/UIM limits on the March 2003 form for three of their four covered vehicles does not and cannot result in higher UM/UIM coverage because the named insured has previously reduced the coverage for these vehicles and took no affirmative steps thereafter to change or increase the coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Both parties have moved for summary judgment on the plaintiff's cause of action seeking a declaratory judgment. After reviewing the record, the court finds that the March 2003 reduction form was intended to reduce the UM/UIM limits for the fourth vehicle (thus bringing it into line with their UM/UIM coverage on their three other vehicles) and did not otherwise operate to increase the UM/UIM limits on the other three vehicles to the bodily injury liability limits. As such, the court will deny the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and grant the insurance company's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The plaintiff, Pietra Limandri (\"Plaintiff\"), commenced this action by filing a complaint against the defendant, Allstate Insurance Company (\"Allstate\"), in the Court of Common Pleas of Lehigh County on June 3, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice for Removal of Civil Action from State Court, Ex. A, Compl., Doc. No. 1-1. In the complaint, Plaintiff alleges that in September 2013, she was involved in a motor vehicle accident caused by another motorist unlawfully proceeding through a stop sign.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. at 1. Plaintiff suffered numerous injuries from the accident, \"including but not limited to, cervical disc herniation, acute cervical strain and spasms, [a] strained left shoulder, severe migraines, and decreased range of motion in the neck[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Due to her injuries, she \"underwent an anterior cervical discectomy fusion surgery at C5-6 with graft plating and bone marrow aspiration.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff first attempted to recover damages for those injuries by suing the tortfeasor.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. This lawsuit resulted in Plaintiff entering into a settlement with the tortfeasor's insurance carrier for the applicable bodily injury liability limits,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   $ 15,000.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   At Plaintiff's request, Allstate, which had insured the vehicle Plaintiff was driving at the time of the accident, consented to the settlement with the tortfeasor in October 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The tortfeasor's bodily injury policy limits were allegedly inadequate to compensate Plaintiff for her injuries, so she notified Allstate of her intent to seek UIM coverage under an automobile insurance policy with Allstate.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 3, 5. Plaintiff sought $ 200,000 (representing a bodily injury limit of $ 100,000, stacked for two vehicles) from Allstate.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. Allstate responded to Plaintiff's UIM benefits claim by notifying her that it believed that she was entitled to a maximum of $ 30,000 in UIM coverage under the applicable policy.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. Then, in September 2015, Allstate offered Plaintiff $ 10,000 for her UIM claim.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff provided Allstate with additional documentation showing that her injuries and economic damages well exceed the $ 10,000 offer, yet Allstate did not increase its offer even\n   after having enough time to review the documents.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Based on these allegations, Plaintiff asserts three causes of action in the complaint.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-13. The first cause of action is a claim for declaratory relief seeking a declaration that the applicable insurance policy provides for UIM coverage equal to the bodily injury coverage under the policy, $ 100,000 stacked for two vehicles, for a total of $ 200,000.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-9. The second cause of action is a breach of contract claim.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-11. The final cause of action is a bad faith claim under Pennsylvania's Bad Faith Statute, 42 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 8371.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Allstate removed the action from the Court of Common Pleas to this court on June 27, 2016, and it was originally assigned to the Honorable Lawrence F. Stengel, now retired.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 1. After receiving an extension, Allstate filed an answer and affirmative defenses to the complaint on July 27, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 7.

Plaintiff filed a response in opposition to Allstate's summary judgment motion on March 7, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 19. Allstate filed its response in opposition to Plaintiff's summary judgment motion on March 9, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 20.

First, Plaintiff contends that the plain language of the March 2003 Form supports her claim for $ 200,000 of UIM coverage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. In this regard, Plaintiff points out that the March 2003 Form does not expressly designate the amount of UM/UIM coverage for Vehicles 1 through 3, except for the language on the form stating: \"If the first named insured has not rejected [UM/UIM Insurance, the UM/UIM] limits will be included in your policy at limits equal to your Bodily Injury Liability ... limits unless the first named insured selects lower limits.\".\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl., Ex. D. Plaintiff asserts that the March 2003 Form did not inform the Limandris that the failure to make a specific election (by checking one of the boxes on the form) would result in the prior election remaining in effect.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff notes that Collard testified during her deposition that a request for lower UM/UIM limits stays in effect until there is a new election on a new form.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Collard Dep. at 24, 47-48). Thus, the March 2003 Form superseded any prior elections for UM/UIM coverage, and \"[g]iven the strict requirements for waiving or reducing UM/UIM Coverage and the policy reasons for the same, it is clear that the Limandris did not effectively reduce their UM/UIM Coverage for vehicles one (1) through three (3).\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Plaintiff's second argument is that the March 2003 Form is ambiguous and, pursuant to Pennsylvania law, must be interpreted against Allstate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16. As already mentioned, Plaintiff contends this form, read in isolation, provides that UM/UIM coverage will be equal to the bodily injury liability limits unless the named insured specifically requests lower limits, and it does not state that it will be\n   read in conjunction with prior requests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16. In addition, she asserts that both the September 2001 Form and the March 2003 Form listed each of the four vehicles and seemingly required the Limandris to make an UM/UIM coverage election for each vehicle, with the failure to make such an election defaulting the UM/UIM coverage to the bodily injury limits.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff also points out that (1) Ramos did not know why the March 2003 Form was only checked for Vehicle 4, and (2) Ramos testified that after 2003, Allstate changed the form so the request to lower limits would identify only the new vehicle for which the insured needed to elect coverage and it even preselected the coverages for the client.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17 (citing Ramos Dep. at 33-34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   For her final argument, Plaintiff argues that the bi-annual renewals and the payments of lower premiums over an approximately ten-year period are irrelevant in this court's determination of the amount of coverage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 17. She notes that \"the presumption that the insured has notice of available UM/UIM Coverage options when provided with the statutorily-mandated notice does not relieve the insurer of providing UM/UIM limits equal to third-party liability coverage absent the insured's written request for lower coverage limits.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Brethren Mut.

Nonetheless, the initial focal point in resolving the competing motions for summary judgment must be the March 2003 Form itself. This form, which is identical to the September 2001 Form (other than the information entered into the form), contains the following language near the top of the form (with respect to UIM coverage): \"If the first named insured has not rejected [UIM] Coverage, limits will be included in your policy at limits equal to your Bodily Injury Liability ... limits unless the first named insured selects lower limits.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pl.'s Br., Ex.

Unfortunately, despite this language and the Limandris' lack of marking on the checkboxes next to the UM/UIM limits for Vehicles 1 through 3 being the primary focus of Plaintiffs' arguments, Allstate has (as best the court can discern) devoted no part of its brief in support of its motion for summary judgment or its brief in opposition to Plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment to discussing how the court should interpret this language in relation to the rest of the form.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Despite Allstate not addressing the above language in its briefs, the court agrees with Allstate that Plaintiff is only entitled to $ 15,000/$ 30,000 stacked UM/UIM under the Policy. Mr. Limandri unequivocally signed-down the UM/UIM coverage limits to $ 15,000/$ 30,000 on all four of the Limandris' vehicles in September 2001.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   The September 2001 Form provided that those \"limits ... will apply to all future renewals, continuations, and changes in your policy unless you contact your Allstate agent or we notify you otherwise.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Facts, Ex. E at ECF p. 3, Doc. No. 16-14. At some point prior to March 2003, the Limandris dropped one of their vehicles, so the Policy covered only three vehicles for a brief period until the Limandris again added a fourth vehicle\n   (not as a replacement vehicle), the 2001 Pontiac Sunfire, in March 2003. Once added to the Policy, the Limandris paid premiums including a premium for UM/UIM coverage limits equal to the bodily injury liability limits until they executed a written reduction of the available UM/UIM limits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Limandris then executed a new request form in March 2003, which only affirmatively provides information about this new fourth vehicle; namely, that the Limandris were electing lower UM/UIM limits in the amounts of $ 15,000/$ 30,000 for \"Vehicle 4.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The question presented here is whether the Limandris could change the UM/UIM limits for Vehicles 1 through 3 by failing to check any box for a lower limit for those vehicles on the March 2003 Form and then relying on the statement at the top of the form providing that unless the first named insured selects a lower limit, the UM/UIM limits will equal the bodily injury liability limits. Plaintiff would have the court find that their silence combined with the language at the top of the form constitutes an election for UM/UIM coverage commensurate with the bodily injury liability limits. Allstate argues that the Limandris needed to take an affirmative action. The court agrees with Allstate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   It would be an unreasonable interpretation of the March 2003 Form if the court would conclude that the Limandris, by failing to check any of the boxes for an UM/UIM limit for Vehicles 1 through 3, changed their September 2001 election of UM/UIM limits of $ 15,000/$ 30,000 for those vehicles. As Allstate noted, when Mr. Limandri chose the lower UM/UIM limits in September 2001, the form explained that these choices would apply to all future renewals, continuations, and changes in the Policy until they contacted their Allstate agent or Allstate told them otherwise. Leaving the check boxes blank for Vehicles 1 through 3 on the March 2003 Form is not affirmative evidence of a choice to increase UM/UIM coverages, as there is no indication that they purposefully decided not to check off one of the limit boxes to increase their UM/UIM coverage for those three vehicles. In addition, the language at the top of the form about not choosing a lower limit resulting in the higher coverage is inapplicable because the Limandris chose lower limits in September 2001 and the March 2003 Form did not affirmatively indicate that they were changing those limits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Moreover, the title of the form is \"REQUEST FOR LOWER LIMITS OF COVERAGE FOR UNINSURED AND UNDERINSURED MOTORIST INSURANCE.\" By March 10, 2003, the date of the execution of the March 2003 Form, the Limandris had already elected to have three of their vehicles with the lowest possible UM/UIM limit (out of the specifically identified limits). The only vehicle with a higher limit was Vehicle 4. A much more plausible interpretation of the\n   March 2003 Form is that the Limandris did not check any of the boxes for Vehicles 1 through 3 because they were not choosing a \"lower\" limit for any vehicle other than Vehicle 4 (which would have been at the bodily injury liability levels before the sign-down in March 2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   To the extent that there is an ambiguity with ascertaining the parties' intent through the form, the overwhelming record evidence supports the court's conclusion that the Limandris intended to keep the $ 15,000/$ 30,000 UM/UIM limits on Vehicles 1 through 3 and reduce the UM/UIM limits for Vehicle 4. Mrs. Limandri testified that she intended her coverages for all vehicles to be uniform; thus, it is much more probable and plausible that the Limandris intended this March 2003 sign-down to match Vehicle 4 with the reduced UM/UIM limits for their other three vehicles. There is no evidence in the record (other than Plaintiff's interpretation of the March 2003 Form) showing that the Limandris ever expressed any intention of increasing the UM/UIM limits on Vehicles 1 through 3 when they executed the March 2003 Request Form.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mrs. Limandri did not state as such during her deposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In addition, as noted by Plaintiff, there are restrictions with the court considering the applicability of the information provided in the renewals that Allstate provided to the Limandris every six months for ten years and even the fact that they paid premiums based in part on them carrying $ 15,000/$ 30,000 UM/UIM limits on their vehicles. Plaintiffs' arguments are based on a request that the court find that the March 2003 Form was not a valid waiver of UM/UIM coverage. Plaintiffs' arguments are misplaced, however, because the March 2003 Form has no effect on the Limandris' reduction in UM/UIM benefits whatsoever. The valid election of reduced UM/UIM coverage limits occurred in September 2001 and, for Vehicles 1 through 3, those limits continued through the March 2003 Form when the Limandris did not affirmatively change them on the form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Further, from all indications, the Limandris intended to maintain the $ 15,000/$ 30,000 in UM/UIM limits on their vehicles. While the court recognizes that Mrs. Limandri stated that she never read the renewal forms, the Limandris received renewal forms every six months for approximately ten years in which the declarations page showed that the UM/UIM coverage for their vehicles was $ 15,000/$ 30,000 and not $ 100,000/$ 300,000. The Limandris do not assert that they ever contested these numbers by claiming that they sought higher coverage by complaining to Allstate. In addition, the Limandris paid premiums reflecting the lower UM/UIM coverages for approximately ten years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   Again, if they had sought higher\n   UM/UIM coverages by not checking any of the limitation boxes on the March 2003 Form, common sense dictates that they would have contacted Ramos or someone else at Allstate about their coverage when they realized they were not getting the coverage they requested. There is nothing in the record stating that the Limandris ever complained about their coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The Limandris executed a valid reduction of their UM/UIM coverage for their four covered vehicles in September 2001 when they signed and returned the September 2001 Form. The March 2003 Form did not affirmatively change this reduction in limits, and the record contains no evidence of the Limandris' intent to increase the UM/UIM coverage in the three vehicles. Accordingly, at the time of Plaintiff's accident in 2013, where there were two covered vehicles under the Policy, Plaintiff was entitled to seek no more than the $ 15,000/$ 30,000 UM/UIM limits stacked by two vehicles. As such, the court will grant Allstate's motion for summary judgment (insofar as it seeks judgment in Allstate's favor on Plaintiff's declaratory judgment claim) and deny Plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment on her declaratory judgment claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The court will enter a separate order.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    As discussed in more detail later in this memorandum opinion, Plaintiff's mother owned the vehicle Plaintiff was driving at the time of the accident.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Compl. at 2.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    Per the scheduling order entered on September 19, 2016, Judge Stengel bifurcated the declaratory judgment action from the remaining causes of action, and the parties were to conduct discovery regarding only the cause of action for declaratory relief and complete said discovery by January 23, 2017.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Order at 1, Doc.
