Martin (\"Plaintiff\") brought this products liability claim against Tricam Industries, Inc., Home Depot Supply, Inc. and Home Depot USA, Inc. (\"Defendants\") after a ladder he was standing on collapsed, causing severe injuries. Defendants moved for summary judgment on all claims because they believe that Plaintiff's deposition testimony has undermined his theories of defect and causation. (Docket No. 33). Defendants have also moved for sanctions. (Docket No. 36). For the reasons stated below, Defendants' motions are\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      denied\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Background\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In September 2014, Plaintiff was standing on a ladder to remove a tree limb. The ladder is manufactured by Tricam and exclusively sold by Home Depot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In his Complaint, Plaintiff asserted that while he was standing on the ladder, a \"limb fell from the tree, bounced off the ground, and made contact with the ladder.\" (Docket No. 1-1 \u00b6 15). According to Plaintiff, \"[d]ue to negligent design and manufacture of the ladder, the rivets used to hold the movable joints in place failed to keep the ladder locked in place and the ladder fell out from underneath Mr. Martin, causing him to fall.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. Plaintiff alleged in his Complaint that the ladder was therefore negligently designed because it could not withstand minor and foreseeable impacts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At his deposition, however, Plaintiff claimed that he did not witness the branch fall because, immediately after he cut the branch, the \"ladder was just gone.\" Martin Dep. 27:20-24. Further, Plaintiff said that he never claimed that the branch struck the ladder.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   28:6-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Standard of Review\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that the court shall grant summary judgment if the moving party shows, based on the materials in the record, \"that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

In\n   <em>\n    Torres-Rios v. LPS Labs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the complaint asserted a product liability claim through facts demonstrating that the product was defective because its warnings were inadequate.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11707011\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/152/11/#p12\">\n    152 F.3d 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 12-15 (1st Cir. 1998). In opposing summary judgement, the plaintiffs then tried to rely on a new theory, that the product was defectively designed, and argued that the theory was implicitly pled in their complaint.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11707011\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/152/11/#p12\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11707011\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/152/11/#p12\">\n    at 15-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The First Circuit affirmed the district court's refusal to allow the plaintiffs to rely on the new theory because allowing such a change after discovery was completed \"unquestionably would prejudice defendant, whose focus until that time had been on the adequacy of the warning labels and not on the costs and benefits of the product itself.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11707011\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/152/11/#p12\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11707011\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/152/11/#p12\">\n    at 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Martinez v. Petrenko\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff asserted the defendant violated the Fair Labor Standards Act for failure\n   to pay overtime. In a FLSA claim, \"the nexus to commerce is an element of the claim, without which there is no entitlement to recovery, and Martinez sought to change entirely the theory of establishing a nexus.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055367\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/792/173/#p180\">\n    792 F.3d 173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 180 (1st Cir. 2015). The First Circuit held that this \"belated change of the facts Martinez would use to establish that nexus implicates precisely the type of unfair misdirection at issue in cases such as\n   <em>\n    Torres-Rios\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055367\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/792/173/#p180\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This was especially appropriate where \"all of the facts upon which Martinez belatedly sought to demonstrate [the new theory of establishing a nexus] were known to him before he filed his complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055367\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/792/173/#p180\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As noted above, in his Complaint, Plaintiff asserted that a \"limb fell from the tree, bounced off the ground, and made contact with the ladder.\" (Docket No. 1-1, \u00b6 15). However, Plaintiff additionally claimed that, \"[d]ue to the negligent design and manufacture of the ladder, the rivets used to hold the movable joints in place failed to keep the ladder locked in place and the ladder fell out from underneath Mr. Martin, causing him to fall.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. At his deposition Plaintiff claimed that he did not witness the branch fall because after he cut the branch, the \"ladder was just gone.\" Martin Dep. 27:20-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   This admission does not preclude finding causation or a defective product as Defendants suggest. Indeed, the ladder giving out without the tree hitting it may even support a finding that the product was defective. In addition, two witnesses supplied affidavits testifying that \"the ladder collapsed from underneath Mr. Martin suddenly and without warning ... as if the ladder simply exploded underneath him\" and that nothing touched the ladder before it collapsed. (Docket No. 41-4 \u00b6\u00b6 5-7);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 41-5. Finally, based on his review of the affidavits and his examination of the ladder, Plaintiff's expert concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Based on my review the ladder was defective and unreasonable dangerous because the rivet used to attach the spreader to the left front rail of the ladder failed. The shop head on the rivet\n   <strong>\n    sheared\n   </strong>\n   in the normal course of use, the ladder became unstable and collapsed. The rivet was used to attach critical components that provide stability while persons are working aloft on the ladder. The ladder becoming unstable and collapsing as a result of the failed rivet is foreseeable by the manufacturer since the ANSI A14.5 require stability test [sic] on fully assembled stepladders to be satisfactory. The manufacturer failed to design the ladder rivet system in way of the spreader connection - left front rail free of defects. The failure of rivet shop head is covered by national consensus standards, industry practices and is therefore foreseeable making the ladder unreasonable dangerous and unsafe.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (Docket No. 41-3, at 30) (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Thus, Defendants' claims that Plaintiff cannot prove defects or causation is incorrect. The evidence to support his claims is perhaps slightly different than what was foreshadowed by the pleadings. However, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Torres-Rios\n   </em>\n   where the plaintiff attempted to switch from an inadequate warning to defective design theory of liability, Plaintiff has continuously asserted that the ladder was defectively designed because the sheared rivet failed to support him.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055367\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/792/173/#p180\">\n    792 F.3d at 180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Martinez sought to\n   <em>\n    change entirely\n   </em>\n   the theory of establishing a nexus.\" (emphasis added)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Because Plaintiff has not sought to change his central theory of liability and causation, I also note that the purpose of confining a plaintiff to the claims in his\n   complaint is not undermined. The spirit of that rule is to protect a defendant's right to know the nature of the claims asserted against him.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055367\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/792/173/#p180\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (noting that defendants cannot be forced to \"engage in discovery based not on what was pleaded but also on what might have been pleaded\"). Here, I find that Defendants had ample notice of the claims asserted against them.
