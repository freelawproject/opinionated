In\n   <em>\n    Sun Life\n   </em>\n   , the insurer refused to pay the policy's death benefit and filed suit against the investor, seeking a declaration that the policy was a STOLI policy and therefore void under Delaware's insurable interest law.\n   <em>\n    Sun Life\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20161598\">\n    2016 WL 161598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8-9,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%204732\">\n    2016 U.S. Dist.

Here, by contrast, the insurer paid out the policy's $ 4-million death benefit to Wells Fargo, which was acting as a securities intermediary for Berkshire. Thus, it is Ms. Malkin's Estate that brings this suit against Berkshire and Wells Fargo, seeking to recover the policy's death benefit under a separate provision of the same Delaware law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Del.%20Code%20Ann.%20tit.%2018%2C%20%C2%A7%202704\">\n    Del.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   All three Parties have moved for summary judgment. The Estate, in its motion, argues that the Court should apply Delaware law in interpreting the Policy, and that under Delaware law the Policy is void\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   as a STOLI policy-in other words, that the Policy was an illegal wager on the life of Phyllis Malkin.\n   <em>\n    Estate's Mot. for Summ. J.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 138, at pp. 4-5. The Estate therefore argues that it is entitled to recover the Policy's death benefit under subsection (b) of Delaware's insurable interest statute.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 5. According to the Estate, that statute \"precludes-\n   <em>\n    without exception and as a matter of public policy\n   </em>\n   -STOLI investors from retaining the death benefit of a life insurance policy manufactured through a STOLI scheme.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Berkshire asserts an array of defenses in its own motion for summary judgment. \"First and foremost,\" Berkshire contends that it is \"immunized from this suit\" as a bona fide purchaser for value under the Uniform Commercial Code (\"UCC\").\n   <em>\n    Berkshire's Mot. for Summ. J.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 133, at pp. 1-2. Second, Berkshire argues that\n   the Estate's claim against it under the insurable interest statute is barred by Delaware's three-year statute of limitations for statutory claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 2. Third, Berkshire argues that Ms. Malkin relinquished any right her Estate had to the Policy's death benefit, both under the Policy itself and under the insurable interest statute.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 2, 14-17. Fourth, Berkshire denies that the Policy here was a STOLI policy at all.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 2. Finally, Berkshire argues that the Estate's alternative claim of unjust enrichment fails because the Estate did not \"confer[ ] any direct benefit on Berkshire, which is a required element of that claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Wells Fargo, for its part, has filed two motions for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In those motions, Wells Fargo adopts each of the Berkshire defenses outlined above, apart from the statute of limitations defense.\n   <em>\n    Wells Fargo's 2d Mot. for Summ. J.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 136, at pp. 1-2. Wells Fargo also asserts an additional defense of its own-namely, that Wells Fargo enjoys further protection from suit under the UCC, due to its \"ministerial role\" as a securities intermediary.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 3-4;\n   <em>\n    Wells Fargo's 1st Mot. for Summ. J.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 77, at p. 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, the Court rules on the Parties' motions as follows: 1) the Estate's principal claim against Berkshire and Wells Fargo, brought under a Delaware statute, is governed by Delaware law; 2) the Policy in this case, like the one in\n   <em>\n    Sun Life\n   </em>\n   , is a STOLI policy; 3) Ms. Malkin did not relinquish her Estate's statutory right to the Policy's proceeds; 4) Berkshire and Wells Fargo's affirmative defenses based on the UCC fail as a matter of law; 5) the Estate's statutory claim is not time-barred; 6) the Estate is entitled to recover the Policy's proceeds; and 7) the Estate's alternative claim of unjust enrichment fails because an adequate legal remedy is available.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Estate's statutory claim is governed by Delaware law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   As I have noted, the facts of this case and of\n   <em>\n    Sun Life\n   </em>\n   are virtually the same, with both cases involving insurance policies taken out on the life of Phyllis Malkin during a one-month period in 2006.\n   <em>\n    ESOF\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 115-18. Both cases also share the same \"critical,\" core issue: whether their respective policies were STOLI policies and therefore void under Delaware law.\n   <em>\n    Sun Life\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20161598\">\n    2016 WL 161598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8-9,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%204732\">\n    2016 U.S. Dist.

The types of claims brought by the plaintiffs in the two cases are distinct, as a result of the divergent courses of action taken by the two insurers after Ms. Malkin passed away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Sun Life\n   </em>\n   , the insurance company refused to pay the Sun Life Policy's $ 5-million death benefit to the policy's owner, U.S. Bank.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20161598\">\n    2016 WL 161598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8-9,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%204732\">\n    2016 U.S. Dist.

Instead, the insurer brought suit, seeking (and obtaining) a declaration that the Sun Life Policy violated Delaware's insurable interest statute and was therefore void.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%204732\">\n    2016 U.S. Dist.

Here, by contrast, the insurance company that issued the Policy is not a party to this suit-AIG paid out the Policy's $ 4-million death benefit to the Policy's owner Berkshire, evidently without a fight.\n   <em>\n    ESOF\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 146-48. Instead, it is Ms. Malkin's Estate that brings suit, seeking to recover the\n   death benefit from Berkshire under subsection (b) of the insurable interest statute, which creates a right of action under these circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In short, while the plaintiff-insurer's claim in\n   <em>\n    Sun Life\n   </em>\n   was \"unequivocally\" a contract claim, the Estate's claim in this case is just as clearly a\n   <em>\n    statutory\n   </em>\n   one, brought under a specific provision of the Delaware Code.\n   <em>\n    Sun Life\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20161598\">\n    2016 WL 161598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9-10,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%204732\">\n    2016 U.S. Dist.

For the most part, however, the Parties have briefed this case as one sounding in contracts, and they urge the Court to conduct a choice-of-law inquiry on that basis, just as Judge Bloom did in\n   <em>\n    Sun\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Life\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 3;\n   <em>\n    Estate's Mot. for Summ.

Simply put, this is not a contract case to be governed by the law of one state or another, depending on where the contract was executed. For one thing, the Estate does not claim here that it has any contractual rights under the Policy. Nor could it-if the Estate's claim is correct, \"there is no contract at all.\"\n   <em>\n    PHL Variable Ins. Co. v. Price Dawe 2006 Ins.

But that is not surprising, given that the section has been uniformly adopted across multiple states.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   note 3. Far more significant, in the Court's view, is the fact that Delaware's insurable interest statute takes no notice of the UCC, and makes no exception for bona fide purchasers. As the Estate contends, the statute appears on its face to \"preclude[ ]-\n   <em>\n    without exception and as a matter of public policy\n   </em>\n   -STOLI investors from retaining the death benefit of a life insurance policy manufactured through a STOLI scheme.\"\n   <em>\n    Estate's Mot. for Summ. J.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 138, at p. 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Nevertheless, Berkshire and Wells Fargo argue that the text of the insurable interest statute implies that it is intended to give way to defenses like those embodied in the UCC. Specifically, Berkshire and Wells Fargo rely on the statute's provision that \"an insured (or his executor or administrator) '\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   ' bring an action ... to recover the death benefits\" under a STOLI policy.\n   <em>\n    Berkshire's Resp. to Estate's Mot. for Summ. J.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 145, at pp. 23-24 (emphasis added). The use of the word \"may,\" according to this reading, means that recovery under the statute is \"not automatic\" but \"subject to all defenses available to the defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   There are two problems with this reading. First, it places too much weight on a single word. After all, as the Estate points out, one can hardly imagine the statute saying that the insured or her estate \"must\" bring suit.\n   <em>\n    See Estate's Resp. to Berkshire's Mot. for Summ. J.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 147, at p. 18 n.10 (\"[T]he vast majority of STOLI schemes and policies go uncovered, so of course the statute could not\n   <em>\n    require\n   </em>\n   that an insurer or an estate bring a claim.\" (emphasis added) ). Even more importantly, Berkshire and Wells Fargo's reading would gut the statute's effectiveness. All that would be required for STOLI policies to yield profits to investors would be for the policies' procurers to bundle them and sell them wholesale to third-parties, who could then disclaim any awareness of the policies' origins-in other words, precisely what happened here.\n   <em>\n    See ESOF\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 136-38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The Court also takes guidance here from the Delaware Supreme Court's landmark decision in\n   <em>\n    Price Dawe\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .

That remedy is plain, certain, efficient and adequate. Indeed, subsection (b) does more than establish a remedy for the Estate-it creates the Estate's right itself. As has been noted, the Estate can claim no contractual rights under a Policy that is \"void as against public policy and thus never c[ame] into force.\"\n   <em>\n    Price Dawe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7281779\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/28/1059/#p1065\">\n    28 A.3d at 1065\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, were it not for subsection (b), Ms. Malkin's Estate would have no right to the Policy's proceeds, in contract, in equity or otherwise. Nevertheless, the Estate does have subsection (b), and that is enough.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   For all of these reasons, the Estate's alternative claim of unjust enrichment must be dismissed.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tillman ex rel.

Indeed, in that one filing alone, Berkshire insists that \" 'Coventry' is not a legal entity\" nearly three dozen times. Berkshire suggests that such use of shorthand constitutes an improper application of the \"group pleading doctrine\" or of an \"alter ego theory\" of corporate standing.\n    <em>\n     See Berkshire's Resp. to Estate's Mot. for Summ. J.\n    </em>\n    , ECF No. 145, at p. 12 n.8. Of course, those doctrines have nothing to do with this case.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Sides v.

To take just one example, the Estate asserts that \"[o]n October 29, 2014, Wells Fargo credited the full amount of the death benefit [equaling $ 4,013,976.47] to an account it maintained on behalf of Berkshire.\"\n    <em>\n     ESOF\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6 147.

By reflexively denying almost every factual assertion made by the Estate, Berkshire has done nothing more than transfer to the Court the \"laborious process [of] attempt[ing] to determine what is actually disputed.\"\n    <em>\n     Gomez v.
