Urbanski, Chief United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Otis Antonio Smith, represented by counsel, filed a motion to reduce his sentence pursuant to Section 404(b) of the First Step Act of 2018. ECF No. 826. He asks the court to reduce his current sentence of 262 months to 135 months, but not less than time served, which will result in his immediate release. The government asserts that Smith is ineligible for consideration of a reduction in his sentence, and in the alternative, that if he is eligible for consideration, a further reduction of his sentence is not warranted. In the event the court determines that Smith is entitled to a reduction in his sentence, the government argues that the sentence should not be less than the guideline range of 188-235 months followed by a 4-year term of supervised release. For the reasons set forth below, the court will\n   <strong>\n    GRANT\n   </strong>\n   Smith's request in part and modify his sentence to 188 months, but not less than time served, to be followed by a 4-year term of supervised release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On October 1, 2004, Smith entered into a plea agreement in which he pleaded guilty to conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of a mixture containing a detectable amount of cocaine base, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20846\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In exchange, the government agreed to dismiss the remaining counts. ECF No. 206. On October 18, 2004, Smith pleaded guilty in accordance with the plea agreement. ECF Nos. 216, 217. The government had filed a notice of enhancement pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20851\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , but withdrew the notice pursuant to the plea agreement. ECF Nos. 187, 268.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A) (2002), Smith faced a statutory sentencing range of 10 years to life on the conspiracy charge. According to the PSR, Smith was responsible for between 500 grams and 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base. ECF No. 827. Under the sentencing guidelines, that drug quantity resulted in a base offense level of 36. He received a 2-point increase for possessing a firearm during his drug trafficking activities and a 3-point increase for his role in the offense. He also received a 3-point decrease for acceptance of responsibility, for a subtotal offense level of 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   However, because Smith had two prior felony drug convictions which made him a career offender, his base offense level was 37. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(a). When the 3-point decrease for acceptance of responsibility was applied, his subtotal offense level was 34. Nevertheless, because the subtotal offense level based on drug weight was 38, his total offense level was 38. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(b). Coupled with a criminal history category of VI, Smith's guideline sentencing range was 360 months to life. U.S.S.G. Ch. 5, Pt. A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 7, 2005, Smith was sentenced to a 360-month term of imprisonment to be followed by a 5-year term of supervised\n   release. ECF No. 381. In 2008, Smith's sentence was reduced to 292 months as a result of Amendments 706, 711, and 715 to the sentencing guidelines. In 2011 it was reduced to 262 months as a result of Amendment 750 to the guidelines. ECF No. 828. Smith has served 176 months and his current projected release date is June 30, 2024.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Smith seeks relief under the First Step Act. He argues that because his prior felony drug convictions were dismissed, he is no longer a career offender, which results in a guideline range of 135-168 months. In the alternative, he argues that even with the career offender designation, his new guideline range is 188-235 months and he asks the court to modify his sentence to 188 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I. First Step Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the time Smith was sentenced, a violation of \u00a7 841(a)(1) carried a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years and a maximum sentence of life imprisonment if the offense involved more than 50 grams of cocaine base, and a penalty range of 5 to 40 years if the offense involved more than 5 grams of cocaine base.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A) and (B) (2002). In 2010, the Fair Sentencing Act was passed, and Section 2 of the Act reduced penalties for offenses involving cocaine base by increasing the threshold drug quantities required to trigger mandatory minimum sentences under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-220, \u00a7 2,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=124%20Stat.%202372\">\n    124 Stat. 2372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). Currently, in order to trigger the 10-years-to-life-sentencing range, the offense must involve more than 280 grams of cocaine base, and to trigger the 5-to-40-year sentencing range, the offense must involve more than 28 grams of cocaine base.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The First Step Act was passed on December 21, 2018. Section 404 of the act permits a court, upon motion of the defendant or the government, or upon its own motion, to impose a reduced sentence for certain offenses in accordance with the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, if such a reduction was not previously granted. Offenses qualify for the reduction if they were committed before August 3, 2010 and carry the statutory penalties which were modified by section 2 or 3 of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010. First Step Act of 2018, Pub. L. No. 115-015,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=132%20Stat.%20015\">\n    132 Stat. 015\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The government argues that even though Smith was sentenced prior to enactment of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, and even though his offenses carry the statutory penalties which were modified by Section 2 or 3 of the Fair Sentencing Act, he does not qualify for a sentence reduction. The government asserts that it is the drug weight for which a defendant is held responsible and not the drug weight for which he was convicted that determines eligibility for First Step Act relief and that Smith's drug quantity in the Presentence Investigation Report (PSR) makes him ineligible. In the alternative, the government contends that even if Smith is eligible for a modification of his sentence, the court should exercise its discretion and decline to reduce the sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Drug Weight\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The government asserts that whether a defendant is entitled to relief under the First Step Act depends on the amount of cocaine base for which he was found responsible in the PSR, rather than the amount for which he was indicted and convicted. Because Smith was found responsible for between 500 grams and 1.5 kilograms on the conspiracy charge, which would make him subject to the\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A) penalties, the government argues that he is not entitled to relief under the First Step Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Smith responds that the drug weight is an element of the offense and that any fact that increases a mandatory minimum penalty is an element that must be charged in an indictment and proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, citing\n   <em>\n    Apprendi v. New Jersey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    530 U.S. 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    147 L.Ed.2d 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000) and\n   <em>\n    Alleyne v.

Under those two cases, if Smith were sentenced today, his sentence would be based on distributing 50 grams or more of cocaine base, and not 500 grams to 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution requires that any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum, other than the fact of a prior conviction, must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. In\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   , the Court applied\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   to the federal mandatory minimum and maximum sentencing scheme and held that because mandatory minimum sentences increase the penalty for a crime, any fact that increases the mandatory minimum is an element of the crime that must be submitted to the jury.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12699057\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/99/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12699057\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/99/\">\n    at 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12699057\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/99/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (overruling\n   <em>\n    Harris v.

The government then argues that for a period of time after\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   was decided, including before passage of the Fair Sentencing Act in 2010, the jury ordinarily made a finding regarding the threshold penalty, but the court could and did impose statutory-minimum penalties regardless of any jury finding. That practice was authorized by\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   did not overrule\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   until three years later, and three years after the Fair Sentencing Act was enacted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The government contends that nothing in the First Step Act suggests that Congress intended to adopt a different methodology, and that the act only directs the court to examine a sentence as if Sections 2 and 3 of the Fair Sentencing Act were in effect at the time, and not to change the manner of determining quantity. In essence, the government is asking the court to apply the holding in\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   and disregard\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   when examining Smith's sentence. However, Congress, when drafting the First Step Act in 2018, surely did not intend for courts to disregard the last six years of Supreme Court federal sentencing jurisprudence and this court declines to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   made clear that in order to preserve a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial, any fact that increases the statutory mandatory minimum sentence is an element of the crime which must be submitted to the jury.\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12699057\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/99/\">\n    570 U.S. at 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12699057\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/99/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Smith pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine base. Under\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   , this court is not free to ignore that finding and impose a penalty based on the 500 grams to 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base referenced in the PSR. Thus, although\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   are not retroactively applicable on collateral review, this court joins other courts in finding that their holdings are applicable in the context of the First Step Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

While it is possible that the government would have proceeded against Smith under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A), it also is possible that it would have decided not to do so. The government could have determined that evidence was insufficient to prove the quantity beyond a reasonable doubt, or if it did indict him on that amount, the parties might have entered\n   into a plea agreement involving less than 280 grams of cocaine base. The retroactive assumption suggested by the government simply is too speculative a basis on which to determine Smith's eligibility for a sentence reduction. Thus, this court declines to assume that Smith would have been charged and convicted of possessing more than 280 grams of cocaine base if the Fair Sentencing Act had been in effect at the time he was convicted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The government further argues that a reduction in Smith's sentence would constitute an unjustified windfall to him based upon the date of his prosecution and offends the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among similarly situated offenders. This argument is based on the government's previous argument that in cases brought after the passage of the Fair Sentencing Act but prior to\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   , juries were asked to make quantity determinations based on that act's new thresholds for purposes of establishing applicable statutory maximums, and courts could and did impose higher statutory minimums based on their own conclusions regarding drug quantity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The government appears to be arguing that this court should ignore both the plain language of the First Step Act regarding who is eligible for a sentence reduction as well as the holding in\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   , because other defendants sentenced within that three-year window may have been subject to longer statutory minimum sentences. While the court is aware of the need for consistent sentences among defendants, it is not free to ignore either the law or constitutional precedent. As discussed above, this court finds that the First Step Act applies to Smith and finds that it is compelled by\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   to look only at the amount of drugs for which Smith was indicted and found guilty when determining whether he is entitled to a sentence reduction. Accordingly, this court will not refrain from modifying Smith's sentence under the First Step Act because other defendants may have been sentenced differently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Career Offender Guideline\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Smith's designation as a career offender is based on two prior felony convictions for possessing a controlled deadly substance within 1,000 feet of school property with the intent to distribute, and distribution of a controlled deadly substance within 1,000 feet of school property. ECF No. 827 at \u00b6\u00b6 82, 90, 91, 94. Smith submitted evidence that on October 28, 2010, the charges in those cases were dismissed. ECF No. 826-1. Thus, he argues that he should no longer be considered a career offender and that his sentence should be adjusted accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The government contends that despite the documentation showing the charges were dismissed, Smith had pleaded guilty to the charges and then absconded. ECF No. 828 at 6. The government further contends that Smith remains a career offender because the First Step Act does not authorize the court to reexamine the career offender guideline or conduct a full resentencing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The court finds it unnecessary to resolve the issue of whether Smith is still considered a career offender for purposes of modifying his sentence under the First Step Act. The parties agree that if Smith is still considered a career offender, and if the guideline range is calculated based on 50 grams of cocaine base, his statutory mandatory minimum sentence would be 10 years and his sentencing guideline range is 188-235 months.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   If Smith is not considered a career offender, his guideline range is 135-168 months.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because Smith has served approximately 176 months, modification of Smith's sentence to the bottom of either guideline range results in his immediate release when his good conduct time is factored into his sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The court finds that it has authority under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203582\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)(B) to modify Smith's sentence, taking into account the considerations set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Had Smith been sentenced after passage of the Fair Sentencing Act, an appropriate sentence would have been 188 months, followed by a 4-year term of supervised release. A sentence of 188 months is the bottom of the sentencing range and corresponds to the 360-month sentence which was the bottom of his original sentencing range.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The court has reviewed Smith's PSR, the addendum to the PSR, and the arguments of the parties and finds that under the current Sentencing Guidelines and the\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   factors, a sentence of 188 months, but not less than time served, is warranted. The court finds that a sentence of 188 months is sufficient, but not greater than necessary, and accounts for the sentencing factors the court must consider pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), specifically deterrence, protection of the public, and respect for the law. Accordingly, the court GRANTS in part Smith's motion under the First Step Act, ECF No. 826, and reduces his sentence to 188 months, but not less than time served.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   An appropriate Order and amended judgment will be entered. The order will be stayed for 10 days to give the Bureau of Prisons an opportunity to process Smith's release.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    The government argues that a full resentencing is foreclosed by\n    <em>\n     Dillon v.
