Plaintiff Sentry Data Systems, Inc. (\"Sentry\" or \"Plaintiff\") filed a response, ECF No. [139] (\"Response\"), to which Defendants filed a reply, ECF No. [147] (\"Reply\"). The Court has carefully considered the Motion, all opposing and supporting submissions, the record in this case and the applicable law, and is otherwise\n   fully advised.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons set forth below, the Motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court set forth a detailed factual background in its previous Order on Defendants' first Motion to Dismiss, ECF No. [115] (\"Order\"). For purposes of the instant Motion, the relevant facts are set forth below. Plaintiff is a developer and provider of information technology systems that assist certain hospitals and hospital-like entities-which the parties refer to as \"covered entities\"-in monitoring compliance with a federal drug pricing program, the 340B Program. ECF No [121] \u00b6 1\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Public Health Services Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 256b.

Sentry's products further help covered entities comply with self-auditing requirements of the 340B Program, as well as respond to reporting inquiries from the Health Resources and Services Administration (\"HRSA\"). This case arises as a result of CVS's acquisition of Wellpartner, one of Sentry's competitors, and the subsequent announcement by CVS that all covered entities seeking to maintain CVS as a contract pharmacy generally, whether for retail or specialty drugs, must use Wellpartner for their 340B tracking and program administration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the initial Complaint, ECF No. [1], Sentry asserted nine causes of action: unlawful tying in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Count I); violation of Florida's Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (\"FDUTPA\") (Count II); breach of contract (Count III); tortious interference with contract (Count IV); tortious interference with business relationships (Count V); misappropriation of trade secrets in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201836\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20688.002\">\n    Fla.

Unlawful tying\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As previously stated, the Court dismissed Plaintiff's original Sherman Act claim because it failed to articulate a relevant geographic market. While the Court previously noted that Plaintiff was not alleging a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   tying claim in its original complaint, Plaintiff now contends that Defendants' conduct constitutes a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   unlawful tying arrangement or, in the alternative, is unlawful under the rule of reason. ECF No. [121] \u00b6 107. Regardless, under either theory, Plaintiff must sufficiently allege market power in a relevant geographic market. In the Motion, Defendants argue that the Amended Complaint lacks sufficient factual allegations to plausibly show that CVS has market power in a properly defined relevant geographic market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"A tying arrangement is an agreement by a party to sell one product but only on the condition that the buyer also purchases a different (or tied) product, or at least agrees that he will not purchase that product from any other supplier.\"\n   <em>\n    Eastman Kodak Co. v.

Nevertheless, the alleged competitive advantages that CVS enjoys from its national presence in retail, pharmacy benefits management, provision of contract pharmacy services for specialty pharmaceuticals to covered entities located across the country, and CVS's contracts for provision of pharmacy services across state lines with generally applicable price and service terms, serve to knit the alleged local markets together into a relevant national market.

In response, Plaintiff contends that the Amended Complaint alleges direct evidence of CVS's market power as a contract pharmacy nationally and locally, demonstrated by Plaintiff's allegations regarding specific customers who felt they were forced to purchase the tied product, 340B solutions provider services, from Defendants to gain access to the tying product, contract pharmacy services.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [121] \u00b6\u00b6 94-95, 108-11, 120-21.

With respect to market power, Plaintiff alleges that CVS is the second largest contract pharmacy and has increased its contract pharmacy locations by 281% since 2013. ECF No. [121] \u00b6 34. Plaintiff alleges further that CVS is a dominant firm in the 340B contract pharmacy market due to its leading position in three related markets-retail pharmacy, specialty pharmacy, and pharmacy benefits manager (\"PBM\") markets.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36. According to Plaintiff, CVS held approximately 23.8% of the United States retail pharmacy market,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37, and CVS's dominance in the dispensing of specialty pharmaceuticals is growing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40. Plaintiff then provides numerous allegations regarding CVS's status as a preferred or exclusive provider of specialty pharmaceuticals for various insurers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 44-61. Furthermore, Plaintiff attaches a list of 365 covered entities, that as of September 2018, are dependent upon CVS for 30% or more of their contract pharmacy network, and states that CVS has market power over each one listed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65; Exhibit A, ECF No. [121-1]. Thus, the inference Plaintiff would have the Court draw from the allegations is that because of CVS's\n   position in the retail pharmacy, specialty pharmacy, and pharmacy benefits manager (\"PBM\") markets, it necessarily possesses requisite market power in the contract pharmacy services market nationally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   However, the inference is belied by other allegations in the Amended Complaint. Plaintiff alleges that CVS competes on a national level to offer 340B contract pharmacy services with other national chain pharmacies,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 112, and acknowledges that six retail pharmacy chains, including CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, Rite Aid, Kroger, and Albertsons collectively account for two thirds of 340B contract pharmacy locations. ECF No. [121] \u00b6 34. In addition, Plaintiff concedes that Walgreens \"is the single largest contract pharmacy\" and that covered entities view Walgreens, in addition to CVS, as a \"must have\" 340B contract pharmacy services provider.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34-35. These affirmative allegations conflict with Plaintiff's contention that CVS wields superior market power in the contract pharmacy market nationally. Indeed, the Amended Complaint contains no allegations giving rise to any plausible barriers to entry given that five other pharmacy chains, along with CVS, dominate a total of two-thirds of the relevant market nationally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In addition, Plaintiff's reliance on Exhibit A does not lead to the plausible inference that CVS possesses the requisite market share specifically in a national 340B contract pharmacy services market. Exhibit A to the Amended Complaint does not inform whether CVS holds a significant share of the relevant market-merely because CVS possesses a large proportion of contract pharmacy locations in a contract pharmacy network in any given locality, especially where there are no allegations that 340B contract pharmacy services are provided on an exclusive basis. Indeed, Plaintiff affirmatively alleges that more than 6,000 covered entities participated in the 340B program in 2017,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [121] \u00b6 12, but the information in Exhibit A pertains to only 365 covered entities nationwide, or a little over 6% of covered entities participating in the 340B program, which belies Plaintiff's assertion that CVS possesses market power nationally.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jefferson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6193309\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/2/#p12\">\n    466 U.S. at 26-29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6193309\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/2/#p12\">\n    104 S.Ct. 1551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding 30% market share to be insufficient).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Similarly, considering the disparate allegations in the aggregate do not plausibly allege national market power. For example, while CVS may enjoy a dominant position in the specialty pharmaceutical business, the allegations in the Amended Complaint acknowledge that four of its competitors also have access to significant numbers of FDA-approved limited distribution drugs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Market power can also exist where sellers possess unique products that competitors are unable to offer.\n   <em>\n    Jefferson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6193309\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/2/#p12\">\n    466 U.S. at 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6193309\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/2/#p12\">\n    104 S.Ct. 1551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But, for similar reasons, the allegations regarding CVS's unique position in the market that allows CVS to offer contract pharmacy services that rivals cannot offer are not sufficient to allege the requisite market power in a national market. The \"question is whether the seller has some advantage not shared by his competitors in the market for the tying product. Without any such advantage differentiating his product from that of his competitors, the seller's product does not have the kind of uniqueness considered relevant....\"\n   <em>\n    United States Steel Corp. v.

While Plaintiff alleges CVS's superior market power in three related markets, the inference Plaintiff would have the Court draw regarding a national market relevant to its antitrust claim is undercut by Plaintiff's affirmative allegations with respect to the other pharmacy\n   chains specifically in the context of contract pharmacy services. Thus, the Amended Complaint fails to plausibly allege that CVS possesses the requisite market power in a national market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Nevertheless, the Court finds that at this juncture, the allegations regarding market power in the local contract pharmacy services markets are sufficient. Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that in the twenty-two CBSAs identified in the Amended Complaint, CVS possesses at least 30% of the 340B contract pharmacies. ECF No. [121] \u00b6 114. In addition, Plaintiff alleges that covered entities draw from local markets that are limited by their patients' desire to access healthcare in proximity to their homes and workplaces, and therefore contract with contract pharmacies that can serve local patient populations, and more specifically, that covered entities within the CBSAs draw a substantial majority of their patients from within a thirty-mile radius.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 114-15. Moreover, Plaintiff asserts that even though covered entities may also deal with contract pharmacies across the country, these services are not a substitute for the local contract pharmacy services, and therefore covered entities need contract pharmacies in close proximity to their patient populations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 115. Collectively, these allegations are sufficient to plausibly state that CVS possesses market power in the twenty-two local markets identified in the Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Tortious interference\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Finally, Defendants argue that Plaintiff's claims for tortious interference asserted in Counts IV and V should be dismissed for failure to state a claim because tortious interference claims cannot be based on the same conduct underlying a failed antitrust claim,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that Count V is preempted by FUTSA to the extent that it is based upon the alleged theft of confidential information. Defendants previously sought dismissal of Plaintiff's tortious interference claims for failure to state a claim, which the Court rejected. The Court expressly held that because the claims of tortious interference are not comprised of allegations of trade secret misappropriation alone, they are not preempted by FUTSA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [115]. Similarly, in the Amended Complaint, the tortious interference claims are not premised solely upon Defendants' purported violations of antitrust law, and in any event, the antitrust claim here survives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As such, Defendants' Motion improperly raises arguments which the Court has already considered and rejected, and Defendants' arguments on this point are not well-taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

However, because the Court previously heard argument on Defendants' first motion to dismiss, further argument on the issues involved is not necessary.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    With leave of Court, Plaintiff filed an unredacted version of the Amended Complaint under seal. ECF No. [123].\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    The Court previously dismissed Plaintiff's claims asserted in Counts II, VIII, and IX based on preemption, and therefore, Plaintiff does not reassert those claims in the Amended Complaint.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Order, ECF No. [115].\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    The Court notes that Defendants' challenge to the sufficiency of the allegations regarding market power appears to relate to the third element of an unlawful tying claim, while Plaintiff appears to understand the challenge as one relating to the fourth element. However, analysis of both elements requires a showing of market power. As such, the distinction is without a difference for purposes of the instant Motion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    The Court acknowledges that it accepted Defendants' argument at oral argument on the first motion to dismiss that the tortious interference claim rises and falls on the tying claim,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    ECF No. [112] at 20; however, the Court did not base its ruling upon this argument, and therefore did not address it in its previous order, ECF No. [115].\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
