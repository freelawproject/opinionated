DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant argues that the Complaint should be dismissed because the collection letter lists Emergency Physicians of Tidewater as the only creditor, and therefore the letter properly discloses the creditor and is not misleading. ECF No. 6 at 5-7. Plaintiff's Complaint does not allege that the current creditor is some other entity besides the Emergency Physicians of Tidewater. Rather Plaintiff's theory is that the absence of the words \"current creditor\" from the letter means there\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   be another creditor, and the existence of more than one interpretation of the collection letter violates the FDCPA.

The letter lists the Emergency Physicians of Tidewater twice; once as the \"Original Creditor\" in the top right corner and again with no label in the lower left-hand corner. ECF No. 1-1 at 2. Reading Defendant's debt collection letter through the lens of the least sophisticated consumer, the use of the words \"Original Creditor\" suggest that Emergency Physicians of Tidewater are no longer Plaintiff's current creditor, but rather some other entity currently owns the debt, possibly even Defendant itself.\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.
