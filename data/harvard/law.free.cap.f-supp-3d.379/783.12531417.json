The Court now considers Plaintiffs Gilma Geanette Melgar and Aurelia Concepcion Martinez's (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") First Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 23) and Defendants William P.

For the reasons discussed below, the Court holds that they are. Consequently, the Court grants Plaintiffs' First Motion for Summary Judgment and denies Defendants' Motion to Dismiss or, in the alternative, Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment. The Court remands the matter to United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\") for adjudication consistent with this Memorandum Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   There is no dispute as to the facts asserted in Plaintiffs' Complaint. (Doc. No. 1.) Plaintiffs are each TPS beneficiaries whose applications for status adjustment to LPR were denied by USCIS. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 55, 69.) Plaintiff Gilma Geanette Melgar. (\"Melgar\") is a citizen of El Salvador who entered the United States unlawfully without inspection in February 1992. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 46.) Plaintiff Aurelia Concepcion Martinez (\"Martinez\") is a citizen of Honduras who entered the United States unlawfully without inspection in November 1996. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 60.) The Attorney General designated both El Salvador (March 9, 2001) and Honduras (January 5, 1999) as TPS countries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 38, 41.) Following the corresponding designations, Plaintiffs each timely applied to USCIS for TPS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48, 62.) Plaintiffs both disclosed to USCIS that they entered the United States without inspection. (Doc. Nos. 26 \u00b6 3, 27 \u00b6 2.) Plaintiffs were each approved for TPS and subsequent extensions by USCIS. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 49-50, 63-64.) In early 2018, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, terminated TPS for El Salvador and Honduras effective September 9, 2019 and January 5, 2020, respectively. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39, 42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In December 2016, Melgar's adult daughter, who is a United States citizen, petitioned for an immigrant visa for Melgar as an immediate relative. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.) Likewise, on August 27, 2017, Martinez's adult daughter, who is a United States citizen, petitioned for an immigrant visa for Martinez as an immediate relative. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65.) Plaintiffs also applied for family-based status adjustment to LPR in conjunction with their daughters' petitions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 51, 65.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In response, USCIS issued a request for evidence of lawful admission or parole into the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 52, 66.) Plaintiffs each timely responded to the request with documentation of their TPS and a copy of\n   <em>\n    Bonilla v.

USCIS nonetheless denied Plaintiffs' applications for adjustment of status, asserting that a grant of TPS is not an admission.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 55-56, 69-70.)

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-21.) Defendants argue that USCIS properly denied Plaintiffs' applications because they entered the United States illegally. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that the plain language of \u00a7 1254a(f)(4) clearly indicates that it applies to the entirety \u00a7 1255, and that Congress intended for individuals in Plaintiffs' position to be eligible to adjust status despite an unlawful entry. (Plaintiffs' Memo. at 33.) Specifically, Plaintiffs contend that exclusion of a reference to subsection 1255(c)(2) and inclusion of the word \"nonimmigrant\" in \u00a7 1254a(f)(4) clearly indicate that TPS beneficiaries are\n   nonimmigrants who are deemed inspected and admitted or paroled for the purposes of adjustment under \u00a7 1255. (Doc. No. 32 (\"Plaintiffs' Reply\") at 2.) The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Court interprets \u00a7 1254a(f)(4) exactly as written and finds that it clearly and unambiguously allows Plaintiffs to be considered as being in lawful status as nonimmigrants for purposes of adjustment of status under \u00a7 1255. Because the statute is clear and unambiguous, the Court need not consider the agency's interpretation under step two of the\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Several other courts presented with this question have similarly concluded that a full and plain reading of the immigration laws requires courts to view a grant of TPS as satisfying inspection and admission.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ramirez v.

No. 31. (\"Defs.' Reply\") at 10.) The Court is unpersuaded. First, it is unnecessary to specify when the intent is to apply to the entire section. Here, Congress chose to state that the benefit applies to \"section 1255,\" clearly indicating that it applies to the entire section. Second, use of the word \"nonimmigrant\" negates the need for any additional clarification that the beneficiary is deemed admitted for the purposes of section 1255. Whether or not there is a proposed bill to change the wording does not impact the clear and unambiguous language of the statute as it currently reads.\n    <em>\n     N.L.R.B. v.
