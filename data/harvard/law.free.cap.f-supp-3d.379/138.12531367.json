Defendant, a 27-year-old Guyanese citizen, has no criminal history. She had only a minor role in a larger scheme to traffic cocaine into the United States. She grew up in an impoverished household with an absent mother and a stepfather who repeatedly sexually abused her. Now a single mother to two young girls, she has dedicated her life to her children and her younger siblings. A sentence of time-served (five months incarceration) is sufficient and will allow her to promptly return home to continue providing for her family.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.
