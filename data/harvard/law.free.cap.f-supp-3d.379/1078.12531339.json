ECF No. 11. Strojnik, an attorney who has been suspended from practicing law in Arizona, alleges that Law Defendants threatened him by suggesting that they would contact the Arizona State Bar regarding Strojnik's communications with Law Defendants and Law Defendants' client. Based on this alleged threat, Strojnik asserts a claim of interference, coercion, and intimidation under the Americans with Disabilities Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012101\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , et seq.

The court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Strojnik's claim against Law Defendants is based solely on their alleged \"threat to file charges against Plaintiff with the Arizona State Bar for Plaintiff's exercise of his rights under the ADA.\" ECF No. 1, PageID # 14. No such threat is included in the correspondence attached to the Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In his letter of February 8, 2019, Rand stated, \"We believe the State Bar of Arizona will be interested to learn of your attempt to continue in other states the same activity that you were suspended for in Arizona.\" ECF No. 1, PageID # 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   This statement was part of Law Defendants' response to Strojnik's threat that he would file suit against KLC if KLC and Law Defendants did not settle Strojnik's claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 11-5, PageID # 154. Law Defendants' letter does not threaten the filing of charges against Strojnik unless he drops his ADA claims against KLC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   More importantly, Strojnik does not identify any \"distinct and palpable injury\" as a result of Law Defendants' alleged threat. As stated in\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   , an injury underlying a \u00a7 12203 claim \"could consist of either the giving up of [his] ADA rights, or some other injury which resulted from [his] refusal to give up [his] rights, or from the threat itself.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1537754\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/336/1181/#p1191\">\n    336 F.3d at 1193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As Law Defendants point out, \"Plaintiff does not claim that he was forced to forgo his rights under the ADA or suffered an injury because he refused to forgo those rights.\" ECF No. 11-1, PageID # 103. Law Defendants did not tie any contact with the Arizona State Bar to Strojnik's filing of his Complaint or to any other right under the ADA. The language in the letter suggests that Law Defendants would contact the Arizona State Bar regardless of whether Strojnik proceeded with or voluntarily dismissed his ADA claims against KLC. Further, Strojnik does not dispute that he was suspended from the practice of law by the Arizona State Bar for his filing of numerous ADA cases. Nor does he allege that, if Law Defendants did in fact contact the Arizona State Bar, any additional injury might result or has resulted. The Complaint is devoid of any indication of any injury flowing from Law Defendants' statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Strojnik responds that he \"has been, at least temporarily, forced to forgo his right to bring suit against another of Law Defendants' clients, HKVC LLC dba Honua Kai Resort &amp; Spa.\" ECF No. 17, PageID # 172. This alleged injury, even if Strojnik could tie it to this case, is implausible. Honua Kai Resort is mentioned in the correspondence attached to the Complaint, but the Complaint itself does not mention HKVC LCC or Honua Kai Resort &amp; Spa. Strojnik's claim against Law Defendants establishes that he is far from deterred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Complaint does not allege a \u00a7 12203 injury. The court therefore dismisses Strojnik's claim against Law Defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Law Defendants ask that the claim be dismissed with prejudice. ECF No. 11-1, PageID # 104. In the usual case, this court freely grants leave to file amended complaints that cure deficiencies. Leave to amend may be denied when further amendment would be futile.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Leadsinger, Inc. v.
