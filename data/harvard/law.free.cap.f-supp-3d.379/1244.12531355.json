The Court addresses each of these issues in detail below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Lack of Signatures and Plaintiff's Right to Revoke\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The parties have not signed the Agreement and General Release. (Doc. 34-1 at 4). Until such time as the parties sign and are bound by the terms of the settlement-subject ultimately to court approval, of course-the Undersigned is unable to find or to recommend that the proposed settlement is fair and reasonable. Otherwise, there is nothing to preclude the parties from either (1) further modifying the Agreement and General Release before it is fully executed without seeking further court approval or (2) returning to the Court with successive motions to approve further modifications to the Agreement and General Release. Either result would run contrary to the requirements of\n   <em>\n    Lynn's Food Stores\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"553243\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/679/1350/#p1355\">\n    679 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1355 and its progeny, and undermine judicial economy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Further, the Agreement and General Release permits Plaintiff up to twenty-one (21) days in which to sign and then affords Plaintiff an additional seven (7) calendar days thereafter to revoke his agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 \u00b6 17). As long as the proposed settlement remains unexecuted and subject to the Plaintiff's right to revoke, there is no actual agreement in place for the Court to review and approve with any assurance of finality. Moreover, upon approval of the settlement by the presiding United States District Judge, the Court would typically dismiss the action pursuant to the settlement. Any delay in executing the Agreement and General Release or any exercise by the Plaintiff of his right to revoke his agreement to the settlement threatens to create procedural and logistical challenges for the Court and for the parties to re-open the case. Considerations of judicial economy weigh very heavily against premature judicial review and approval of a proposed settlement agreement that is not fully executed by the relevant parties or that is subject to any right by a party to revoke the agreement after judicial approval is given. Therefore, the Undersigned finds that the inclusion of a delayed execution provision and a revocation period-even one that facially inures to the benefit of the Plaintiff-precludes a finding of fairness and reasonableness at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Amount Originally Claimed Versus the Amount of the Settlement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In Plaintiff's Answers to Court Interrogatories, Plaintiff stated under oath that he claimed \"Total: $ 92,030.40 (unliquidated) and $ 184,060.80 (liquidated)\" in damages. (Doc. 22-1 at 2). In the Agreement and General Release, the parties agree to settle this action for a \"total lump sum amount equal to\" $ 33,500.00. (Doc. 34-1 at 1 \u00b6 2). The parties fail to explain the enormous discrepancy between Plaintiff's original claim for $ 92,030.40 in \"unliquidated\" damages and $ 184,060.80 in liquidated damages, and the proposed settlement amount of $ 33,500.00. Without an explanation, the Undersigned cannot adequately review the proposed settlement for fairness and reasonableness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Allocation of Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In the Agreement and General Release, Defendant agrees to pay Plaintiff a total lump sum of $ 33,500.00 without allocating any portion of that amount to unpaid wages and liquidated damages. Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20216\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), \"[a]ny employer who violated the provisions of ... section 207 of this title shall be liable to the employee or employees affected in the amount of ... their unpaid overtime compensation ... and in an additional equal amount as liquidated damages.\" (Emphasis added). A court may - in its discretion - reduce or deny liquidated damages if the\n   employer shows to the satisfaction of the court that the act or omission of failing to pay appropriate wages was in good faith and that the employer had a good faith belief that the act or omission was not in violation of the FLSA.\n   <em>\n    Morgan v. Family Dollar Stores, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5752440\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/551/1233/#p1282\">\n    551 F.3d 1233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1282 (11th Cir. 2008). Thus, when a settlement occurs in a FLSA case, the Court must review the amount of unpaid wages paid and the amount of liquidated damages paid, if any, for reasonableness and fairness. If liquidated damages are not included, then the Court must be informed of and review the proffered reasons why.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Here, the parties failed to indicate what portion of this amount is allocated to unpaid wages and what portion, if any, is allocated to liquidated damages. For this Court to approve any proposed settlement, the parties must directly address the issue of liquidated damages. Otherwise, the Court can only speculate as to the parties' intentions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   If the payment amount to Plaintiff of $ 33,500.00 is not equally divided between unpaid wages and liquidated damages, then the parties must provide justification for the Court to waive the requirement of liquidated damages under the FLSA. Until the parties have addressed these issues, the Undersigned finds that the Court cannot adequately review the proposed settlement for fairness and reasonableness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Consideration for Concessions and the Mutual General Release\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In the Agreement and General Release, Plaintiff agrees: (1) to a mutual general release; (2) not to apply for employment with Defendant; (3) to relieve Defendant of any obligation to re-hire him; and (4) to receive a neutral reference. (Doc. 34-1 at 2-3 \u00b6 10). The Undersigned considers each of these concessions below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Lynn's Food Stores\n   </em>\n   analysis necessitates a review of the proposed consideration as to each term and condition of the settlement, including foregone or released claims.\n   <em>\n    Shearer v.

As further consideration, the County has also agreed to a mutual general release against Ashworth.\" (Doc. 34 at 2). However, the parties do not explain or allocate any specific amount of the settlement proceeds for consideration for the release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   This Court has found that general releases in FLSA cases are often unfair to plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moreno\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4201688\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/729/1346/#p1350\">\n    729 F.

Mar. 20, 2012). Notwithstanding this line of cases, other jurists in this District have approved non-cash concessions in FLSA settlement agreements where they have been negotiated for separate consideration or where there is a reciprocal agreement that benefits all parties.\n   <em>\n    Bell v.

Sept. 21, 2016) ;\n   <em>\n    Smith v. Aramark Corp.\n   </em>\n   , No. 6:14-cv-409-Orl-22KRS,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%205690488\">\n    2014 WL 5690488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (M.D. Fla. Nov. 4, 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Here, Plaintiff agrees \"not to apply for ... or accept employment with\" Defendant, that Defendant is not \"under any obligation to employ or contract with [Plaintiff],\" that Defendant \"shall not have any obligation to process that application or to hire or contract with [Plaintiff],\" and that all employment references will be directed to Defendant's Human Resources Director who \"shall confirm Ashworth's position and dates of employment.\" (Doc. 34-1 at 2-3 \u00b6 10). The parties fail to explain whether these provisions were negotiated for separate consideration. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 34). Because the parties' briefing does not address the issue of consideration for these non-cash concessions, the Court cannot determine whether their inclusion in the settlement is fair and reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Attorney's Fees Provisions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In the Joint Motion, the parties state, \"[t]he attorney's fees and costs were negotiated and agreed upon separately from the amount Plaintiff is receiving.\" (Doc. 34 at 2). In the Agreement and General Release, the parties agree that \"each [shall] be responsible for payment of their own respective attorneys' fees and legal costs.\" (Doc. 34-1 at 1 \u00b6 4). The parties have not attempted to reconcile these apparently contradictory statements. Thus, the Court cannot determine whether the settlement of the attorney's fees represents a fair and reasonable resolution of the fees issues in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. Retaliation Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiff also brought a retaliation claim in Count II of the Complaint (Doc. 2) that the presiding trial judge dismissed with prejudice. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 15 at 6). Plaintiff states in the Joint Motion that he \"may still appeal the dismissal of his retaliation claim.\" (Doc. 34 at 1 \u00b6 3). In the Agreement and General Release, however, Plaintiff states that he \"expressly acknowledges and affirms that he has not been retaliated against for any actions taken during his employment with the County.\" (Doc. 34-1 at 2 \u00b6 9). Further, Plaintiff agrees to a general release of claims with no reservations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2 \u00b6\u00b6 5, 6, 7). The parties failed to explain the discrepancy between these\n   contradictory statements. Thus, the Court cannot determine the fairness or reasonableness of the proposed settlement as it relates to the retaliation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, this Court cannot make the requisite determination under\n   <em>\n    Lynn's Food Stores\n   </em>\n   as to the fairness and reasonableness of the proposed settlement in this case based upon the existing record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Accordingly, it is\n   <strong>\n    RESPECTFULLY RECOMMENDED\n   </strong>\n   that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   1) The Joint Stipulation for Dismissal With Prejudice (Doc. 32) and the Joint Motion for Approval of Settlement Agreement (Doc. 34) be\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   without prejudice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   2) The parties be ordered to elect one of the following options\n   <strong>\n    no later than May 30, 2019\n   </strong>\n   :\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   a.

Prepare the case for trial pursuant to July 13, 2018 Case Management and Scheduling Order (Doc. 30).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Respectfully recommended in Chambers in Ft. Myers, Florida on April 18, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     NOTICE TO PARTIES\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   A party has fourteen days from this date to file written objections to the Report and Recommendation's factual findings and legal conclusions. A party's failure to file written objections waives that party's right to challenge on appeal any unobjected-to factual finding or legal conclusion the district judge adopts from the Report and Recommendation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   11th Cir. R. 3-1.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    In the Complaint (Doc. 2), Plaintiff also brings a claim in Count II for \"Unlawful Retaliation in Violation of Section 92.57, Florida Statutes.\" (Doc. 2 at 7). On December 12, 2017, the presiding trial judge entered an Opinion and Order dismissing Count II with prejudice. (Doc. 15 at 6).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    This proposed deadline takes into account (1) the possibility that one or both parties may file objections to this Report and Recommendation and (2) a reasonable period of time for the presiding District Judge to resolve any objections.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
