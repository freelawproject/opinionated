Thus, the Court conducts its step one inquiry by first identifying what the \"character as a whole\" of claim 1 of the '541 Patent is \"directed to,\" and then discussing whether\n   this is an abstract idea. In distilling the character of a claim, the Court is careful not to express the claim's focus at an unduly \"high level of abstraction ... untethered from the language of the claims,\" but rather at a level consonant with the level of generality or abstraction expressed in the claims themselves.\n   <em>\n    Enfish\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4282681\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/822/1327/#p1334\">\n    822 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1337 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thales Visionix\n   </em>\n   , 850 F.3d at 1347 (\"We must therefore ensure at step one that we articulate what the claims are directed to with enough specificity to ensure the step one inquiry is meaningful.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The Court finds that claim 1 of the '541 Patent is directed to the abstract idea of transmitting and retrieving data. Claim 1 is straight-forward. It discloses (1) storing data at the mobile customer premises equipment (\"CPE\"); (2) formatting the data stored at the CPE; (3) transmitting the data with a user ID from the CPE across a mobile network to a server; (4) retrieving data stored in the server in response to either an expiration of time or a request from the CPE; and (5) transmitting the data to the CPE in multiple sequentially-numbered information signals.

The specification does not describe a new telephone, a new server, or a new physical combination of the two. The specification fails to provide any technical details for the tangible components, but instead predominantly describes the system and methods in purely functional terms. For example, the \"telephone unit\" of the claims is described as having \"the standard features of a telephone unit\" .... Likewise, the server is described simply in terms of performing generic computer functions such as storing, receiving, and extracting data.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5923224\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/823/607/#p611\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In essence, the\n   <em>\n    TLI\n   </em>\n   court found that because the\n   <em>\n    TLI\n   </em>\n   patent's specification failed to provide technical details for the components, but instead described the system and methods \"in purely functional terms,\" functions that were generic to a computer, the\n   <em>\n    TLI\n   </em>\n   patent claim failed step one of\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5923224\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/823/607/#p611\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The '541 Patent's specification concedes that the methods, which are described in purely functional terms, are generic to a computer. Moreover, what little tangible components are disclosed in claim 1 are entirely generic computing components.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   First, the disclosed CPE is a generic computer. The specification gives examples of CPEs: \"mobile devices such as cell\n   phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), iPods\u2122 and MP3\u2122 digital recorders (collectively known as CPEs).\" '541 Patent at 2:64-66. In the background of the invention, the Patent discloses \"cell phones, iPods, MP3 players, pagers, personal digital assistants (PDA), even personal computers\" as devices well known in the prior art as they have become more \"personalized\" over time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1:19-22. The specification provides no additional detail as to whether the CPEs are customized or specialized computing devices. Rather, the specification uses a cellphone as an example of a CPE without ever specifying whether the cellphone is a specialized computing device.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3:1-2 (\"A CPE [ ] such as a cell phone is part of a mobile communications network [ ].\"). Thus, like the\n   <em>\n    TLI\n   </em>\n   patent, the '541 Patent fails to provide technical details for the tangible components of the claim, such as the CPE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Second, the process of formatting the data stored at the CPE invokes generic computing devices. The specification admits that \"[f]ormatting is performed by [the] CPE,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5:50-51, and as discussed above, the CPE is a generic computing device. Moreover, the process of formatting the data is conventional and well-known in the art. Claim 1 discloses that the process of formatting the data consists of \"tagging\" data that \"correspond to a respective data field.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10:57-59. However, the patent specification concedes that as \"\n   <em>\n    known in the art\n   </em>\n   , the structure of the data may identify each element type by using unique\n   <em>\n    tags\n   </em>\n   for the different record types.... By utilizing a unified tag and data structure, the methodology and system enables different types of CPE to interpret the data structure accordingly.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3:34-42 (emphasis added). Thus, the Patent itself concedes that the process of tagging data that correspond to a respective data field was known in the art, and thus conventional. Claims that are \"directed to the use of conventional or generic technology\" are abstract.\n   <em>\n    TLI\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5923224\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/823/607/#p611\">\n    823 F.3d at 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Third, the process of transmitting the data with a user ID from the CPE across a mobile network to a server is known in the art and generic. The specification admits that \"communication methods,\n   <em>\n    as known in the art\n   </em>\n   , may be utilized to transmit the data between CPE 101 and server 104.\" '541 Patent at 3:45-47 (emphasis added). Further, use of a user ID in conjunction with the transmission of data is hardly a specific improvement on computer functionality or a nongeneralized computer activity. The specification vaguely and generally defines user ID as \"an identifier ... to identify the device for which data is being backed up.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3:24-25. Per the\n   <em>\n    Content Extraction\n   </em>\n   court, the \"concept of data collection,\n   <em>\n    recognition\n   </em>\n   , and storage is undisputedly well-known.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6892926\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/776/1343/#p1345\">\n    776 F.3d at 1347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Moreover, the mobile network is generic, as disclosed in the specification. '541 Patent at 3:2-3 (\"As is known in the art, mobile network 102 has an access point at a switch 103.\"). The Patent neither adds any more specificity nor discloses any improvement on the mobile network to render it a non-generic mobile network. Furthermore, the server is also a generic server.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2:1-2 (\"The remote server receives data from the CPE for remote storage by the server.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2:20-21 (\"The server collects the data and stores it.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5:10-13 (\"[S]erver 104 could easily be another CPE, either inside or outside of network 102, or a server located within network 102 communicating with the target CPE across a mobile network.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    TLI\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5923224\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/823/607/#p611\">\n    823 F.3d at 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (recitation of a generic \"server\" \"merely provide[d] a generic environment in which to carry out the abstract idea\"). Plaintiff even admits in the opposition that servers \"may have been known\" in the prior art. Opp. at 19. Thus, though the server is a tangible element of the claim,\n   its conventional and generic nature does not lift the claim out of abstractness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Fourth, claim 1 proceeds to claim retrieving data stored in the server in response to either an expiration of time or a request from the CPE. The data is then transmitted to the CPE in multiple sequentially-numbered information signals. The concept of data retrieval from a server is generalized computer activity. Courts have held that the \"abstract ideas ... of collecting, storing, and retrieving data [have been] found patent-ineligible in several recent cases.\"\n   <em>\n    Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc. v. Dickstein Shapiro LLP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5759773\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/128/103/#p112\">\n    128 F.Supp.3d 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 112 (D.D.C. 2015) (citing\n   <em>\n    Content Extraction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6892926\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/776/1343/#p1345\">\n    776 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1347 );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    buySAFE\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4186028\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/765/1350/#p1353\">\n    765 F.3d at 1355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[R]eceiv[ing] and send[ing] information over a network ... is not even arguably inventive.\"). For instance, in\n   <em>\n    Content Extraction\n   </em>\n   , the Federal Circuit invalidated patent claims \"drawn to the abstract idea of 1) collecting data, 2) recognizing certain data within the collected data set, and 3) storing that recognized data in a memory\" because \"[t]he concept of data collection, recognition, and storage is indisputably well-known.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6892926\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/776/1343/#p1345\">\n    776 F.3d at 1347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Moreover, in\n   <em>\n    West View Research, LLC v. Audi AG\n   </em>\n   , the Federal Circuit held that claims that \"do not go beyond receiving or collecting data queries, analyzing the data query,\n   <em>\n    retrieving and processing the information constituting a response to the initial data query\n   </em>\n   , and generating a visual or audio response to the initial data query\" were directed to the abstract idea of collecting and analyzing information. 685 Fed. App'x 923, 926 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (emphasis added). Furthermore, according to the Patent's specification, the idea of using a timer to control data retrieval is conventional. Specifically, the generic \"server 104 stores time periods.\" '541 Patent at 7:29-30. The \"timer may be ... on a daily basis, weekly basis or monthly basis as preferred by the user/subscriber.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7:33-35. Similarly, the Federal Circuit has also held as invalid claims directed to \"sending information back and forth,\n   <em>\n    at specified time intervals\n   </em>\n   or in sequence.\"\n   <em>\n    Dealertrack, Inc. v. Huber\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3748297\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/674/1315/#p1332\">\n    674 F.3d 1315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1332-33 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (emphasis added). Furthermore, the '541 Patent specification describes as conventional the process of initiating the data retrieval process as a request from the CPE. The specification discloses that when a CPE initiates a request for data retrieval, it can take the form of \"more\n   <em>\n    conventional\n   </em>\n   methods such as the dialing of a 1-800 call center number or logging on to a website.... This request may come directly from utilizing the CPE\n   <em>\n    as is known in the art\n   </em>\n   or may come from the user's own\n   <em>\n    conventional\n   </em>\n   computer or\n   <em>\n    conventional\n   </em>\n   telephone or any other third party telephone.\" '541 Patent at 9:9-18 (emphasis added). Lastly, the transmission of data in multiple sequentially-numbered signals is a known process. The specification discloses that the data to be transmitted \"in connection with IP protocol transfer, [can be] portioned into packets for transmission\" and then these packets \"are transported in one or more info signals.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4:14-22. However, the specification expressly acknowledges that data transfer via IP protocol was known in the art: \"Depending on the type of device, communications methods,\n   <em>\n    as known in the art\n   </em>\n   , may be utilized to transmit the data between CPE 101 and server 104. For example, ... internet protocol connection[s may be used]....\n   <em>\n    As is known in the art\n   </em>\n   , these techniques may be used to send any type of data request or data signal.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3:45-55 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Claim 1 is similar to other claims the Federal Circuit has found to be directed to abstract ideas. For instance, in\n   <em>\n    Two-Way Media Ltd. v. Comcast Cable Communications, LLC\n   </em>\n   , the claim in question was directed to \"first processing the data, then\n   routing it, [and] controlling it.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267251\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/874/1329/#p1339\">\n    874 F.3d 1329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1339 (Fed.

This was done in the context of \"transmitting message packets over a communications network.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267251\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/874/1329/#p1339\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267251\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/874/1329/#p1339\">\n    at 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, claim 1 discloses a similar structure to the\n   <em>\n    Two-Way Media\n   </em>\n   claim. First, data is\n   <em>\n    processed\n   </em>\n   by formatting the data stored at the CPE. Then, data is\n   <em>\n    routed\n   </em>\n   by transmitting the data from the CPE across a mobile network to a server. Lastly, data is\n   <em>\n    controlled\n   </em>\n   by retrieving data from the server and transmitting it to the CPE, a process controlled by either an expiration of time or a request from the CPE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   In addition, claim 1 is similar to the claims in\n   <em>\n    Intellectual Ventures I LLC v.

Del. 2017),\n   <em>\n    aff'd\n   </em>\n   , 725 Fed. App'x 976 (Fed. Cir. 2018). In\n   <em>\n    Symantec\n   </em>\n   , the claims were directed to \"copying data from one location to another several times and sending a confirmation that the data has been received.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268369\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/234/601/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268369\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/234/601/\">\n    at 607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Instead of merely sending a confirmation signal when data is received at the remote location as the\n   <em>\n    Symantec\n   </em>\n   claims recite, the server can send data back to the CPE in the data retrieval process. The\n   <em>\n    Symantec\n   </em>\n   court found the claims to be abstract because \"the focus of the claims is the abstract idea of backing up data.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268369\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/234/601/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   According to\n   <em>\n    Symantec\n   </em>\n   , it is \"undisputed that institutions have long backed up data in general.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268369\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/234/601/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   In Plaintiff's opposition, Plaintiff argues that the Federal Circuit has \"confirmed that improvements to data storage and computer memory systems ... are patent eligible.\" Opp. at 18.

The human mind essentially acts as the server, a central clearinghouse for data that stores data from a CPE to be retrieved and transmitted to a CPE.

Claim 1 discloses: (1) storing data at the mobile customer premises equipment (\"CPE\"); (2) formatting the data stored at the CPE; (3) transmitting the data with a user ID from the CPE across a mobile network to a server; (4) retrieving data stored in the server in response to either an expiration of time or a request from the CPE; and (5) transmitting the data to the CPE in multiple sequentially-numbered information signals. '541 Patent at 10:52-11:4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   As discussed above, none of claim 1's elements are unique to the '541 Patent. In fact, the patent specification confirms that the '541 Patent did not invent the limitations found in claim 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   For instance, the specification acknowledges that the Patent did not invent CPEs. The specification gives examples of conventional CPEs: \"mobile devices such as cell phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), iPods\u2122 and MP3\u2122 digital recorders (collectively known as CPEs).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2:64-66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Moreover, the specification confirms that the process of formatting the data stored at the CPE was known in the art. The specification admits that \"[f]ormatting is performed by [the] CPE,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5:50-51, and as discussed above, the CPE is a generic computing device. Also, claim 1 discloses that the process of formatting the data consists of \"tagging\" data that \"correspond to a respective data field.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10:57-59. However, the patent specification concedes that \"[\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    s known in the art\n   </em>\n   , the structure of the data may identify each element type by using unique\n   <em>\n    tags\n   </em>\n   for the different record types.... By utilizing a unified tag and data structure, the methodology and system enables different types of CPE to interpret the data structure accordingly.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3:34-42 (emphasis added). Thus, the Patent itself concedes that the process of tagging data that correspond to a respective data field was known in the art, and thus conventional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Furthermore, transmitting data with a user ID, which is vaguely defined in the specification as \"an identifier ... to identify the device for which data is being backed up,\" is hardly anything more than well-understood, routine, conventional activity. Use of an identifier in conjunction with data transfer is routine. Per the\n   <em>\n    Content Extraction\n   </em>\n   court, the \"concept of data collection,\n   <em>\n    recognition\n   </em>\n   , and storage is undisputedly well-known.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6892926\" index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/776/1343/#p1345\">\n    776 F.3d at 1347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). The specification also admits that \"communication methods,\n   <em>\n    as known in the art\n   </em>\n   , may be utilized to transmit the data between CPE 101 and server 104.\" '541 Patent at 3:45-47 (emphasis added). In addition, the server is also a standard, well-known server.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2:1-2 (\"The remote server receives data from the CPE for remote storage by the server.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2:20-21 (\"The server collects the data and stores it.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5:10-13 (\"[S]erver 104 could easily be another CPE, either inside or outside of network 102, or a server located within network 102 communicating with the target CPE across a mobile network.\"). Moreover, the mobile network is generic, as disclosed in the specification.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3:2-3 (\"As is known in the art, mobile network 102 has an access point at a switch 103.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Finally, claim 1 proceeds to claim retrieving data stored in the server in response to either an expiration of time or a request from the CPE. The data is then transmitted to the CPE in multiple sequentially-numbered information signals. Courts have found that \"collecting, storing, and retrieving data [have been] found patent-ineligible in several recent cases.\"\n   <em>\n    Encyclopaedia Britannica\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5759773\" index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/128/103/#p112\">\n    128 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   112 (citing\n   <em>\n    Content Extraction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6892926\" index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/776/1343/#p1345\">\n    776 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1347 ). For instance, in\n   <em>\n    Content Extraction\n   </em>\n   , the Federal Circuit invalidated patent claims \"drawn to the abstract idea of 1) collecting data, 2) recognizing certain data within the collected data set, and 3) storing that recognized data in a memory\" because \"[t]he concept of data collection, recognition, and storage is indisputably well-known.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6892926\" index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/776/1343/#p1345\">\n    776 F.3d at 1347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Furthermore, according to the Patent's specification, the idea of using a timer to control data retrieval is conventional. Specifically, the \"server 104 stores time periods.\" '541 Patent at 7:29-30. The \"timer may be ... on a daily basis, weekly basis or monthly basis as preferred by the user/subscriber.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7:33-35. Similarly, the Federal Circuit has also held as invalid claims directed to \"sending information back and forth,\n   <em>\n    at specified time intervals\n   </em>\n   or in sequence.\"\n   <em>\n    Dealertrack\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3748297\" index=\"219\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/674/1315/#p1332\">\n    674 F.3d at 1332-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis\n   added). Also, the specification describes as conventional the process of initiating the data retrieval process as a request from the CPE. Specifically, when a CPE initiates a request for data retrieval, it can take the form of \"more\n   <em>\n    conventional\n   </em>\n   methods such as the dialing of a 1-800 call center number or logging on to a website.... This request may come directly from utilizing the CPE\n   <em>\n    as is known in the art\n   </em>\n   or may come from the user's own\n   <em>\n    conventional\n   </em>\n   computer or\n   <em>\n    conventional\n   </em>\n   telephone or any other third party telephone.\" '541 Patent at 9:9-18 (emphasis added). Lastly, the transmission of data in multiple sequentially-numbered signals is a conventional process. The specification discloses that the data to be transmitted \"in connection with IP protocol transfer, [can be] portioned into packets for transmission\" and then these packets \"are transported in one or more info signals.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4:14-22. However, the specification expressly acknowledges that data transfer via IP protocol was known in the art: \"Depending on the type of device, communications methods,\n   <em>\n    as known in the art\n   </em>\n   , may be utilized to transmit the data between CPE 101 and server 104. For example, ... internet protocol connection[s may be used]....\n   <em>\n    As is known in the art\n   </em>\n   , these techniques may be used to send any type of data request or data signal.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3:45-55 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Thus, none of claim 1's elements, assessed individually, provides an inventive concept. After all, \"[i]nstructing one to 'apply' an abstract idea and reciting no more than generic computer elements performing generic computer tasks does not make an abstract idea patent-eligible.\"\n   <em>\n    Capital One Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055438\" index=\"220\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/792/1363/#p1366\">\n    792 F.3d at 1368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, the ordered combination of these elements also does not yield an inventive concept. In\n   <em>\n    BASCOM\n   </em>\n   , the Federal Circuit held that \"an inventive concept can be found in the non-conventional and non-generic arrangement of known, conventional pieces.\" 827 F.3d at 1350. However, the arrangement of claim 1's elements are conventional, as evidenced by\n   <em>\n    Dealertrack\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Two-Way Media.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Dealertrack\n   </em>\n   , the claims were directed to \"receiving data from one source[,] ... selectively forwarding the data ... and forwarding reply data to the first source.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3748297\" index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/674/1315/#p1332\">\n    674 F.3d at 1333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The\n   <em>\n    Two-Way Media\n   </em>\n   court invalidated the claim, called the ordering of claim elements a \"conventional ordering of steps ... with conventional technology to achieve its desired result.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267251\" index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/874/1329/#p1339\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, claim 1's elements are also a conventional ordering of steps.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Therefore, claim 1 of the '541 Patent does not contain an inventive concept. The Court finds that at\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   step one, claim 1 of the '541 Patent is directed to an abstract\n   idea. At\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   step two, there is no inventive concept sufficient to save the claim. Thus, the Court concludes that the '541 Patent is directed to unpatentable subject matter under \u00a7 101. Next, the Court addresses whether there are open factual issues that preclude dismissal on the pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Whether there Exist Factual Questions that Preclude Resolution of the Instant Motion under Rule 12\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Plaintiff's opposition cites disclosures in the complaint that purportedly preclude resolution of the instant motion under Rule 12. Opp. at 21-22. For instance, Plaintiff vaguely alleges that the \"claim elements, individually or in combination, are unconventional.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267251\" index=\"226\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/874/1329/#p1339\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 22 Likewise, Plaintiff alleges that \"[t]he solutions described and claimed in the '541 Patent represented a significant advance over existing approaches and were not well-known, routine, or conventional in the field at the time the application leading to the '541 Patent was filed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267251\" index=\"227\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/874/1329/#p1339\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, there are no\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   factual allegations or references to the '541 Patent claims that undergird Plaintiff's purported fact questions cited in Plaintiff's opposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Under Federal Circuit law, \"[w]hether a claim recites patent eligible subject matter is a question of law which ... has in many cases been resolved on motions to dismiss or summary judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Berkheimer v.

The\n   <em>\n    Uniloc\n   </em>\n   court rejected plaintiff's contentions that the claimed invention did not feature \"routine and conventional elements like hardware configurations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"231\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202287675\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotations omitted). The\n   <em>\n    Uniloc\n   </em>\n   court reasoned that the plaintiff was attempting to \"manufacture a factual question\" by relying on attorney arguments found in the complaint.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"232\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202287675\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, the situation is analogous to that in\n   <em>\n    Uniloc\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff can merely point to attorney argument found in the complaint as grounds for why claimed elements are not routine or conventional. Thus, per the\n   <em>\n    Uniloc\n   </em>\n   court, Plaintiff's attorney arguments in the amended complaint do not create a factual dispute precluding disposition of the instant case on a Rule 12 motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Moreover, under Federal Circuit law, the\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   inquiry must focus on the\n   <em>\n    claim language.
