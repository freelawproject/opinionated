PAUL OETKEN, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   A group of plaintiffs bring this putative securities class action against the drug manufacturer Mylan N.V. and several of its officers, in connection with the alleged misclassification of the EpiPen, a rebate scheme involving the EpiPen, and the alleged inflation of prices for various generic drugs. On March 28, 2018, the Court granted in part and denied in part Defendants' motion to dismiss the prior class action complaint (Dkt. No. 69), and Plaintiffs subsequently filed the operative amended complaint (Dkt. No. 89).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Defendants now move to dismiss the new allegations in the amended complaint. (Dkt. No. 95.) For the reasons that follow, the motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs are purchasers of Mylan's common stock. On October 11, 2016, Plaintiff Stef Van Duppen initiated this action against Mylan N.V., Mylan Inc., and officers Heather Bresch and John Sheehan. (Dkt. No. 1.) Separately, Plaintiff Landon W. Perdue filed an action against Mylan N.V., Mylan Inc., and officers Heather Bresch, Paul B. Campbell, Robert J. Coury, Kenneth S. Parks, and John D. Sheehan on October 13, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    See Perdue v. Mylan N.V.\n   </em>\n   , No. 16 Civ. 8000, Dkt. No. 1.) On January 9, 2017, the Court consolidated the two cases for pre-trial purposes, appointed Lead Plaintiffs, and approved Lead Counsel. (Dkt. No. 26.) Lead Plaintiffs subsequently filed an Amended Class Action Complaint (Dkt. No. 39) asserting claims under: (1) Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b), and Rule 10b-5,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .10b 5, against all Defendants; (2) Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t(a), against the individual Defendants; and (3) Section 1 of the Israeli Securities Law of 1968, against all Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendants jointly moved to dismiss the complaint (Dkt. No. 45), and the Court granted the motion in part (Dkt. No. 69). The Court dismissed Plaintiffs' securities claims to the extent they relied on an alleged \"pay-for-delay\" agreement with Teva Pharmaceuticals, alleged agreements with schools regarding the EpiPen, and an alleged agreement to allocate the market\n   for the generic drug doxycycline hyclate delayed release (\"Doxy DR\"). (Dkt. No. 69 at 27-30, 34.) The Court also determined that certain statements alleged in the complaint were not actionable. (Dkt. No. 69 at 11-12, 17, 20.) Finally, the Court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the Israeli securities law claim, given the complex issues and exceptional circumstances presented in this case. (Dkt. No. 69 at 36-40.) Plaintiffs' remaining securities claims-premised on the misclassification of the EpiPen in the Medicaid rebate scheme and the alleged price-fixing agreements concerning five generic drugs-survived the motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 6, 2018, Plaintiffs filed the operative Second Amended Class Action Complaint (\"Amended Complaint\"). (Dkt. No. 89 (\"Compl.\").) Defendants now move to partially dismiss the Amended Complaint (Dkt. No. 95), challenging the sufficiency of its new allegations (Dkt. No. 96 at 1 &amp; n.1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The facts of this case are described in this Court's prior opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Mylan N.V. Sec. Litig.\n   </em>\n   , No. 16 Civ. 7926,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201595985\">\n    2018 WL 1595985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1-3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 28, 2018). Here, the Court recounts background necessary to resolving the instant motion, as well as those new facts alleged for the first time in the Amended Complaint. The factual allegations in the Amended Complaint are assumed true for the purposes of this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Mylan is a developer, manufacturer, and distributor of brand-name and generic pharmaceuticals. (Compl. \u00b6 2.) This action arises out of Mylan's conduct regarding the drug EpiPen Auto-Injector (\"EpiPen\") and several generic drugs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mylan is a public company, trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. (Compl. \u00b6 30.) Lead Plaintiffs Menorah Mivtachim Insurance Ltd., Menorah Mivtachim Pensions and Gemel Ltd., Phoenix Insurance Company Ltd., Meitav DS Provident Funds and Pension Ltd., and Dan Kleinerman (\"Plaintiffs\") bring this action on behalf of themselves and a class of individuals who purchased the common stock of Mylan N.V. or Mylan, Inc. between February 21, 2012, and October 30, 2017. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 29.) Defendants in this action include Mylan N.V., Mylan, Inc., and various Mylan executives who served during the class period (collectively, \"Mylan\"). (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 30-37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The conduct giving rise to this action falls into two categories of alleged wrongdoing: (1) Medicaid misclassification, and (2) antitrust violations. First, the Amended Complaint alleges that Mylan unlawfully misclassified the EpiPen as a generic drug for purposes of the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (\"MDRP\"). (Compl. \u00b6 5; Dkt. No. 69 at 2-3;\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 39-97.) The previous complaint outlined the details of this alleged misclassification, along with various statements that Plaintiffs alleged to have misled investors in connection with the misclassification. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. No. 39 \u00b6\u00b6 33-90, 201-04.) Plaintiffs repeat those allegations in the Amended Complaint, and present several additional statements that Plaintiffs contend were also rendered misleading by the failure to disclose the alleged misclassification. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 242-43, 289-91.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Second, the Amended Complaint alleges that Mylan entered into a number of anticompetitive agreements to block competitors from the market and inflate the prices of various drugs. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 12-13, 15-18;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 69 at 3-4.) The Amended Complaint repeats allegations from the previous complaint that Mylan schemed to manipulate the market to maintain a supracompetitive price for the generic drug Doxy DR, and schemed to fix prices for the generic drugs albuterol sulfate, benazepril, clomipramine, divalproex, and propranolol. (Compl. \u00b6 115; Dkt. No. 39 \u00b6 104.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Although Plaintiffs' claims regarding market allocation of Doxy DR were previously dismissed for failure to plausibly allege scienter, the Amended Complaint contains new allegations regarding the agreement of Mylan executives to engage in market allocation with respect to Doxy DR, in an attempt to cure the pleading deficiency. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 127, 130-31, 134-45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Amended Complaint includes new allegations regarding Mylan's alleged antitrust misconduct. Among these are allegations that Mylan engaged in price fixing in the markets for three other generic drugs: doxycycline monohydrate (\"Doxy Mono\"), glipizide-metformin, and verapamil. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 187-200, 405.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs' new allegations also include claims that Mylan engaged in anticompetitive conduct regarding the EpiPen and a competing epinephrine autoinjector-the Auvi-Q produced by Sanofi-Aventis. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 12-13.) Specifically, the Amended Complaint alleges that Mylan offered EpiPen at a rebate of 30% or more to third-party payors in the medical insurance market, on the express condition that the payors would decline to reimburse for the Auvi-Q. (Compl. \u00b6 104.) As a result, Mylan blocked the Auvi-Q from accessing half of the market for epinephrine autoinjectors, and caused its market share to drop. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 107-08, 110.) Sanofi decided not to relaunch Auvi-Q, and is suing Mylan for antitrust violations in connection with the alleged conduct. (Compl. \u00b6 113.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Furthermore, the Amended Complaint adds an additional corrective disclosure relevant to allegations of loss causation: On October 31, 2017, a group of 47 state attorneys general issued a press release publicizing new allegations from an amended complaint that the group would be filing in their ongoing antitrust action against Mylan (\"State AG action\"). (Compl. \u00b6 394.) On that day, Mylan shares fell $ 2.53, or 6.62%. (Compl. \u00b6 395.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Finally, the previous complaint brought claims against five of Mylan's executives. (Dkt. No. 39 \u00b6\u00b6 28-32.) To that group of individual Defendants, the Amended Complaint also adds Rajiv Malik, who served as the President of Mylan from January 1, 2012, to the present, and has served as an Executive Director of Mylan since 2013. (Compl. \u00b6 35.) The Amended Complaint adds allegations about Malik's involvement in the challenged conduct, including six allegedly misleading statements made by Malik and Malik's sale of Mylan stock in a manner potentially evidencing his scienter. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 127, 130, 141-42, 307-08, 409.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

(Dkt. No. 96 at 11-12.) First, Mylan contends that the Amended Complaint continues to include quantitative statements of earnings from Mylan's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings, which the Court previously determined to be \"not actionable\" in its prior opinion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. No.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   96 at 11; Dkt. No. 69 at 11 (\"[T]he mere statement of historical financial information does not give rise to a duty to disclose illegal conduct that may have contributed to that performance.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Mylan requests that these statements from 10-K and 10-Q reports about Mylan's financial performance-both those repeated from the prior complaint and alleged for the first time in the Amended Complaint-be dismissed. (Dkt. No. 96 at 12.) As Mylan observes, Plaintiffs do not respond to this argument. (Dkt. No. 101 at 5.) Accordingly, for the reasons given in the Opinion of March 28, 2018 (Dkt. No. 69 at 11), the Court reiterates that quantitative statements of earnings contained in Mylan's Forms 10-K and 10-Q are not actionable misstatements. Mylan's request to dismiss these allegations from the Amended Complaint is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Second, with respect to certain statements about sources of income, Mylan contends that Plaintiffs have merely repackaged already-dismissed allegations that Mylan misleadingly \"failed to disclose an 'acute risk' of fines\" (Dkt. No. 69 at 12), as allegations that Mylan misleadingly failed to disclosed that its actions were \"likely to raise regulatory scrutiny\" (Dkt. No. 96 at 12 (quoting Compl. \u00b6 320).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs acknowledge the Court's holding \"that Mylan was not obligated to disclose\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   its past conduct put it at risk of future regulatory scrutiny\" (Dkt. No. 100 at 15), but nonetheless argues that being unable to accurately judge the risk of regulatory scrutiny through Mylan's omissions about past conduct made the omissions material (Dkt. No. 100 at 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   It appears that the parties do not actually disagree about\n   <em>\n    whether\n   </em>\n   certain statements are actionable, but would benefit from clarification about\n   <em>\n    the grounds on which\n   </em>\n   they are actionable. The Court thus reiterates that \"Mylan's statements explaining income\" are actionable because the statements \"put its sources of income at issue,\" and the statements were misleading for failing to disclose the extent to which Mylan's income was inflated by its misclassification of the EpiPen and its other alleged anticompetitive activities. (Dkt. No. 69 at 12.) Although the concealment of the risk of regulatory scrutiny may contribute to the materiality of the omissions for investors, the statements explaining income were not themselves misleading for failing to disclose a risk of future regulatory scrutiny. As such, insofar as the Amended Complaint could be read to allege that certain statements are\n   <em>\n    misleading\n   </em>\n   due to a failure to disclose future regulatory risk, those allegations are dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Mylan contends that Plaintiffs failed to adequately plead the existence and illegality of this underlying misconduct. (Dkt. No. 96 at 5-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   As an initial matter, Plaintiffs contend that they need not allege that these two bases of conduct constituted antitrust violations, because in any event Mylan's failure to disclose their existence to investors was misleading. (Dkt. No. 100 at 2, 10-11, 14.) According to Plaintiffs, the Amended Complaint makes clear that \"these omissions were misleading regardless of whether or not the conditional rebates\" or pricing agreements \"constituted antitrust violations.\" (Dkt. No. 100 at 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Court disagrees with this construction of the Amended Complaint. Paragraph 14, which Plaintiffs rely on for this argument as to the EpiPen rebate scheme, provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Mylan repeatedly failed to tell the whole truth about the ways in which it competed and about the reasons for its financial success, including in the market for epinephrine autoinjectors, by failing to disclose this anticompetitive conduct. While Mylan's conduct certainly violated U.S. antitrust laws, including Sherman Act Section 2, investors cared about this conduct in any event due to the significant liability to which it exposed Mylan.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   (Compl. \u00b6 14.) This paragraph clearly states that the challenged failure \"to tell the whole truth\" was premised on \"anticompetitive conduct.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) And such conduct would only \"expose[ ] Mylan\" to \"significant liability\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), if it was, indeed, in violation of antitrust laws. Furthermore, the remainder of the allegations in the Amended Complaint involving the Sanofi rebate scheme clearly portray the conduct as an antitrust violation. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Compl. \u00b6 114.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Paragraph 18 contains similar language regarding the alleged price-fixing agreements: \"Mylan's statements suggested that it did not compete through collusion with competitors on prices, when in fact it did, and while Mylan's collusion certainly violated U.S. antitrust laws, investors cared about such collusion in any event due to the significant liability to which it exposed Mylan.\" (Compl. \u00b6 18.) But again, the agreements only exposed Mylan to liability if they were, in fact, unlawful.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Because the Amended Complaint alleges that omissions regarding the EpiPen rebate scheme and generic drug price-fixing agreements were misleading because the underlying conduct violated antitrust laws, then, Plaintiffs must adequately allege that such conduct occurred and was unlawful in order to survive a motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Menaldi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4338925\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/164/568/#p576\">\n    164 F.Supp.3d at 578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

(Dkt. No. 96 at 10-11; Dkt. No. 101 at 4.) Plaintiffs' direct evidence boils down to a single April 23, 2014 phone call. But the allegations surrounding the alleged call do not identify which employees were involved, where the call took place, or the contours of the alleged agreements.

The\n   October 31, 2017 corrective disclosure thus applies only to statements rendered misleading as to the alleged unlawful market allocation of Doxy DR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Allegations Against Malik\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Next, Mylan seeks to dismiss the allegations against newly added Defendant Rajiv Malik, arguing that: (1) certain of Malik's statements are not actionable; (2) the Amended Complaint failed to plead a strong inference of scienter; and (3) the Amended Complaint fails to plead control-person liability under Section 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Actionable Statements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Mylan first argues that certain of Malik's statements made during the class period are not actionable as material misrepresentations or omissions. The Amended Complaint adds six statements by Malik during the class period. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 307, 319, 324, 339, 345, 351.) Mylan characterizes these statements as addressing three topics: (i) historical financial performance; (ii) optimistic characterizations of results and opinions about future performance; and (iii) the performance of Mylan's generics business. (Dkt. No. 96 at 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   These first two categories of statements, according to Mylan, are not actionable in light of the Court's prior opinion and relevant precedent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) And Plaintiffs do not dispute that Malik's statements on such topics, as alleged in the Amended Complaint, cannot form the basis for their claims. (Dkt. No. 101 at 7; Dkt. No. 100 at 16.) Accordingly, the Court holds that only Malik's statements in the third category, pertaining to performance of Mylan's generic drug segment, are potentially actionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Mylan also contends that any claims against Malik based on statements made before July 2012 are barred by the Exchange Act's five-year statute of repose.

As such, Plaintiffs have failed to adequately plead Malik's culpable participation regarding the allegations involving the EpiPen and generic drug price fixing, and the statements rendered misleading by the failure to disclose that conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Finally, as to the second element of control liability, Mylan concedes that Malik had control over the six statements that he personally made. (Dkt. No. 96 at 24; Dkt. No. 101 at 10.) Accordingly, Plaintiffs have adequately pleaded a control-liability claim against Malik, but only to the extent such a claim is premised on allegations that the six statements made by Malik were misleading for failure to disclose the Doxy DR market allocation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Claims Against Mylan Regarding Doxy DR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   In addition to repleading the allegations that survived the earlier motion to dismiss and adding new allegations premised on different underlying misconduct, the Amended Complaint also attempts to cure a particular deficiency in Plaintiffs' previous complaint. Plaintiffs claim that certain of Mylan's statements were misleading because they failed to disclose that Mylan engaged in anticompetitive behavior, in violation of antitrust law, in allocating the market for the generic drug Doxy DR. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 123-152.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The Court held in the Opinion of March 28, 2018 that Plaintiffs had \"plausibly plead[ed] the existence of a market allocation arrangement between Mylan and Heritage\" with respect to Doxy DR. (Dkt. No. 69 at 30-31.) However, the Court held that Plaintiff's failed to adequately plead scienter. (Dkt. No. 69 at 34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   In the Amended Complaint, borrowing from the State AG action, alleges that Defendant Rajiv Malik, Mylan's President, agreed with the president of Heritage on a May 8, 2013 phone call, to allocate the market for Doxy DR between their two pharmaceutical companies. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 129-132.) Plaintiffs contend that the Amended Complaint adequately pleads scienter as to the Doxy DR agreement, given the involvement of Malik. (Dkt. No. 100 at 2, 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Mylan argues that the complaint again fails to adequately plead scienter solely because \"Plaintiffs rely entirely on the unproven allegations copied from the CTAG's complaint to supplement their previously dismissed allegations of scienter as to Doxy DR.\" (Dkt. No. 96 at 23.) As explained above, the Court rejects this argument and considers the allegations in the Amended Complaint, regardless of whether they originated in the State AG action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   From those allegations, the Amended Complaint adequately pleads Malik's scienter as to the Doxy DR agreement. And because the Court may \"readily attribute[ ] the scienter of management-level employees to corporate defendants,\"\n   <em>\n    In re Marsh &amp; Mclennan Cos., Inc. Sec.

Accordingly, Plaintiffs have overcome the deficiency of their prior complaint and adequately pleaded scienter as to the Doxy DR claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Defendants' motion to partially dismiss the Second Amended Class Action Complaint is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.

Regardless of the applicable pleading standard for antitrust misconduct nestled in a securities case, and in light of the fact that the Court bases its decision primarily on the substance of the complaint\n    <em>\n     in this case\n    </em>\n    , the Court considers the result in the\n    <em>\n     In re EpiPen\n    </em>\n    antitrust litigation as offering only persuasive support for the conclusion that Plaintiffs' allegations regarding the Sanofi rebate scheme sufficiently allege anticompetitive conduct to survive a motion to dismiss.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    Heritage Pharmaceuticals Inc. is another pharmaceutical company, which sells some of the same generic drugs as Mylan and is alleged to have entered various price-fixing agreements with Mylan.

(Dkt. No. 100 at 22.) A court, in its discretion, can decline to allow parties to relitigate \"issues expressly or impliedly decided earlier in the proceeding.\"\n    <em>\n     In re Initial Pub.

And notwithstanding Rule 12(g), \"[a]n amended complaint ... entitles a defendant to raise substantive arguments aimed at 'judicial resolution of the controversy' in a new responsive pleading, even if those arguments were not raised in response to the original complaint.\"\n    <em>\n     In re Parmalat Sec.

(Dkt. No. 96 at 18 n.13.) Plaintiffs do not directly address this point, instead arguing that the Amended Complaint pleads scienter as to all Defendants for the EpiPen rebate scheme. (Dkt. No. 100 at 17.) Because allegations regarding Malik's scienter as to the EpiPen rebate scheme and generic drug price fixing substantially overlap, the Court addresses scienter as to both. Even assuming that Malik had involvement with EpiPen products, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have failed to adequately plead scienter to establish Malik's primary liability for misstatements pertaining to EpiPen products.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    Mylan's reply brief also raises \"additional reliability problems\" with \"Plaintiff's scienter allegations.\" (Dkt.
