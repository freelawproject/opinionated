Defendant presents a facial attack on subject matter jurisdiction; in other words the Court does not have subject matter jurisdiction if there is no federal question. (Doc. 5.). However, under a facial attack the Court must consider the allegations of the complaint as true, and here the plaintiff has sufficiently asserted a claim that the defendant violated her rights under the Fair Housing Act, a federal statute. Further, in\n   <em>\n    Williamson v. Tucker\n   </em>\n   , the Fifth Circuit held that \"...as a general rule a claim cannot be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because of the absence of a federal cause of action.\"\n   <em>\n    Williamson v.

Likewise, she has not alleged any facts that she has a special disability involving sensitivity to noise. The particular noises she describes are caused by either the acts of neighbors or by passing traffic. Her assertion is not a noise sensitivity or disability, but that the alleged noises would be egregious or tortuous to anyone regardless of a disability. The lease itself does not provide any special provisions regarding any disabilities or accommodations claimed by the plaintiff. Conversely, even if the Court was to conclude that she had a covered disability, plaintiff has failed to provide any facts in her complaint as to what the defendant has done and/or failed to do to accommodate her disability within the short window of nineteen (19) days from her date of possession to the filing of this complaint. To this point, she states in her response that she voiced her concerns to the defendant and that they gave her several options: 1) move out in thirty (30) days or 2) wait six (6) months for another unit to become available. Thus, by her own admission defendant did not refuse to accommodate her concerns. Of course, plaintiff seeks a sound proof apartment and the only solution would be to discontinue living in an apartment setting since no apartment owner would be able to accommodate such a request. Nevertheless, there are no facts alleged that the plaintiff gave the defendant an opportunity to conduct a meaningful review to determine the requested accommodation, if any, under the FHA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203602\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203602\">\n    at 1286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a result, defendant's motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) is granted as to plaintiff's claims under the Fair Housing Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Alabama Landlord Tenant Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Plaintiff's claim under the AURLTA is that the defendant has failed to properly maintain their apartments thereby allowing the alleged noise to penetrate her apartment from the upstairs apartment and/or from the outside, i.e. traffic noise. Alabama Code \u00a7 35-9A-204(a)(1) provides that\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   (a) A landlord shall:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (1) comply with the requirements of applicable building and housing codes materially affecting health and safety...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Plaintiff however has not alleged that defendant failed to comply with any applicable building or housing codes. In addition, this Court is unaware of any applicable building and/or housing codes that require an apartment landowner to provide and/or construct sound proof apartments. The lease between the parties does not provide any warranties for the absence of sound. (Doc. 5-1). Thus, the Court cannot draw a reasonable inference from the facts presented in plaintiff's complaint that the defendant is liable to the plaintiff under the AURLTA. Accordingly, defendant's motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) is granted as to plaintiff's claims under the Alabama Uniform Residential Landlord Tenant Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Invasion of Privacy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Plaintiff's invasion of privacy claim is based upon acts of criminal noise torture coming from neighbors and traffic that the defendant has failed to prevent and/or remedy. Plaintiff characterizes the noise as criminal; however, there is no viable relief for criminal noise violations within the framework of a civil case. On the other hand, Alabama Law recognizes four acts that constitute a civil invasion of privacy: \"(1) the intrusion upon the plaintiff's physical solitude or seclusion; (2) publicity which violates the ordinary decencies; (3) putting the plaintiff in a false but not necessarily defamatory position in the public eye; and (4) the appropriation of some element of the plaintiff's personality for a commercial use.\"\n   <em>\n    Phillips v. Smalley Maintenance Servs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7639599\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/435/705/#p708\">\n    435 So.2d 705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 708 (Ala.1983). In this case plaintiff's claims suggest an intrusion upon her physical solitude or seclusion, but she has not alleged that the defendant is causing this intrusion or that the defendant has failed to do anything regarding the alleged offensive noise. She does mention in her response that she has contacted law enforcement, which is the proper authority for a criminal action, but that they were not able to adequately assist her. Defendant correctly points out in their brief that the defendant is generally not liable under Alabama Law for the unforeseeable criminal actions of third-parties. See\n   <em>\n    Moye v. A.G. Gaston Motels, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7591779\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/499/1368/#p1370\">\n    499 So.2d 1368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1370 (Ala. 1986). Here again the Court cannot draw a reasonable inference from the facts presented in plaintiff's complaint that the defendant is liable to the plaintiff for a civil invasion of privacy. Further, her allegations of criminal activity are not properly before this Court. Consequently, defendant's motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) is granted as to plaintiff's claims under invasion of privacy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Based upon the foregoing, the Court concludes first that it possesses subject matter jurisdiction to consider plaintiff's claims and DENIES, in part, Defendant's Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 5) pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Now, accepting the facts of the complaint as true and viewing them with the leniency afforded to a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   plaintiff, the Court finds beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of her claims which would entitle her to relief. Accordingly, Reserve at Research Park LLC's Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 5) is GRANTED, in part, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as to all pending claims. Therefore, all pending claims asserted against Reserve at Research Park LLC are DISMISSED with prejudice.
