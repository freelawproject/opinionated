New, Jr., Inc.'s (\"BITCO\") motion for summary judgment on liability against Old Dominion Insurance Company (\"Old Dominion\"), Starr Indemnity &amp; Liability Company (\"Starr\"), and Crum &amp; Forster Specialty Insurance Company (\"Crum\"), ECF No. 54; (2) BITCO's motion for summary judgment on liability against Southern-Owners Insurance Company (\"Southern-Owners\") and National Trust Insurance Company (\"National Trust\"), ECF No. 57; (3) Southern-Owners' motion for summary judgment against BITCO, ECF No. 66; (4) National Trust's motion for summary judgment on liability against BITCO, ECF No. 88; (5) Crum's motion for summary judgment against BITCO, ECF No. 100; and (6) BITCO's motion to strike the affidavits filed by Southern-Owners, or in the alternative, to file a sur-reply, ECF No. 95.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court's rulings are set forth below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This consolidated action involves an insurance coverage dispute over the obligation, if any, of various insurance companies to defend and indemnify BITCO, as subrogee of A.E. New, Jr., Inc. (\"AE New\"), a general contractor, against state court claims for property damage due to allegedly defective work performed by their insureds, who served as subcontractors for the construction of the Central\n   Water Reclamation Facility project (\"the Project\") for the Emerald Coast Utilities Authority (\"ECUA\") in Pensacola, Florida.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In February 2009, ECUA hired AE New as general contractor for the Project. AE New subcontracted various portions of the construction work to Area Glass, Inc. (\"Area Glass\") and West Coast Metal Roofing &amp; Construction, LLC (\"West Coast Metal\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The terms of their respective subcontracts required each subcontractor to,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , indemnify AE New for all damages claims \"arising out of or resulting from\" the subcontractor's \"negligent acts or omissions\" in the performance of its work on the Project.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The subcontracts also required each subcontractor to maintain commercial general liability insurance naming AE New as an additional insured.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As per the subcontracts, both Area Glass and West Coast Metal obtained commercial general liability policies (\"the CGL policies\") with the requisite additional insured endorsements (\"Endorsements\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In particular, Area Glass was insured by Southern-Owners from October 28, 2008 through October 1, 2010, and by Old Dominion from October 1, 2010 through September 12, 2012. West Coast Metal was insured by Crum from March 26, 2009 through December 1, 2010. The Endorsements provide, in relevant part, that \"[a] person or organization is an Additional Insured, only with respect to liability arising out of 'your work' for that Additional Insured by or for you ... [i]f required in a written contract.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Southern-Owners Policy, ECF No. 42-14 at 43. The CGL policies define \"your work\" as \"(1) [w]ork of operations performed by your or on your behalf; and (2) [m]aterials, parts or equipment furnished in connection with such work or operations.\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 42. For purposes of the instant motions, the Court assumes that AE New is an additional insured under Area Glass and West Coast Metal's CGL policies, pursuant to the subcontracts and Endorsements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After construction at the Project was complete, ECUA retained an engineering firm to inspect the building. The engineering firm issued two reports identifying a number of construction defects and deficiencies on the Project.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Engineering Reports, ECF No. 1-3 at 140-204. ECUA then served a notice of claim on AE New, pursuant to Florida Statutes 558.004.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 138-39, 142. The notice of claim advised AE New of the discovery of the purportedly defective work set forth in the engineering firm's reports and provided AE New an opportunity to inspect and cure the defects.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At some point thereafter, AE New filed a lawsuit against ECUA and two other defendants in the Circuit Court for Escambia County, Florida, raising breach of contract claims related to their contract for the Project's construction. ECUA responded with an Amended Answer and Counterclaim (\"the state court counterclaim\"), in which it asserted claims of breach of contract and negligence against AE New based on the unresolved construction defects identified in the engineering reports. ECUA alleged that the defects had caused damage to various components of the Project and to other property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   AE New concluded that some of the allegedly defective work at the Project was performed by Area Glass and West Coast Metal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thereafter, AE New sent multiple letters to the two subcontractors and their insurers, invoking its rights as an additional insured under the CGL policies and demanding a defense for the state court counterclaims. AE New, represented by attorneys provided by its own liability insurer, BITCO, is defending against the state court counterclaims and has also asserted third-party claims against Area Glass, West Coast Metal, and other subcontractors, seeking to recover from them any amounts for which AE New might be held liable. The current status of the state court lawsuit is unclear from the parties' filings in this federal case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Two actions have been filed and consolidated for adjudication by this Court. First, on April 24, 2017, BITCO filed an action against Old Dominion, Crum, and Starr, seeking a declaration that they owed a duty to defend AE New against the state court counterclaim, pursuant to the terms of Area Glass and West Coast Metal's CGL policies, and alleging breach of contract based on the insurance companies' refusal to provide the requisite defense. Second, on May 8, 2017, BITCO filed an action against National Trust and Southern-Owners, alleging the same claims and seeking the same relief with respect to the additional insured provisions of the CGL policies for Lowery Industrial and Area Glass, respectively. Since that time, BITCO has voluntarily dismissed with prejudice its claims against Starr and National Trust.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 70; 114. Thus, only the claims against Old Dominion, Crum, and Southern-Owners remain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   BITCO argues that it is entitled to summary judgment against each of the remaining defendant insurance companies because the allegations in the state court counterclaim triggered their duty to defend AE New, which they all refused to do. Each defendant separately opposes BITCO's motion and all but one defendant, Old Dominion, have moved for summary judgment in their own favor regarding the duty to defend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A district court applies the same legal standards when ruling on cross-motions for summary judgment as it does\n   when only one party files a motion.\n   <em>\n    Certain Underwriters at Lloyds, London Subscribing to Policy No. SA 10092-11581 v.

March 27, 2018) (\"[F]aulty workmanship or defect work that has damaged the otherwise nondefective completed project has caused 'physical injury to tangible property' within the plain meaning of\" a standard CGL policy). According to BITCO, this authority is the source of Old Dominion and Southern-Owners' duty to defend AE New against the state court counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   There are two problems with BITCO's position. First, neither the state court counterclaim nor the accompanying engineering reports describe faulty or defective construction work that is \"fairly and potentially\" attributable to Area Glass. Under the subcontract, Area Glass was responsible for work related to doors and windows on the Project, which included\n   installing aluminum framed entrances and storefront windows, as well as aluminum door hardware.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Area Glass Subcontract, ECF No. 1-7 at 9-10. Consequently, only construction defects involving the aluminum doors or windows can \"fairly and potentially\" implicate Area Glass's work. No such construction defects are described in the relevant state court documents. Indeed, none of the documents even mentions doors. Windows are referenced twice in the engineering reports, but only to describe their appearance and with no allegation that the windows were defective or improperly installed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Engineering Reports, ECF No. 1-3 at 148, 156. In short, nothing in the state court counterclaim and accompanying engineering reports can be \"fairly [or] potentially\" read as a factual allegation of faulty or defective workmanship with respect to the doors and windows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Second, none of the relevant state court documents allege that the installation or condition of the aluminum doors and windows caused any of the property damage observed throughout the Project. The engineering reports describe an array of moisture-related property damage, including staining, algae accumulation, vegetation growth, efflorescence, moisture intrusion, and other water damage. However, there is no suggestion that the doors and/or windows caused or contributed to these problems. Instead, the reports explicitly attribute the property damage to alleged defects in the PVC and standing seam roof systems, guttering and downspouts, walls and lintels (including through-wall flashings), joint and sealant work, and masonry. Area Glass was not responsible for any of these aspects of the Project. Because none of the property damage is alleged to involve or relate to Area Glass's work on the aluminum doors and windows, it does not \"fairly and potentially\" fall within the general coverage of the subcontractor's CGL policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Court agrees with Old Dominion and Southern-Owners that BITCO extrapolates allegations about Area Glass from the engineering reports that the reports' authors themselves did not make and, in some instances, mischaracterizes the reports' findings and conclusions. For example, BITCO directs the Court to photographs of the Project that depict water staining and damage \"at the west entry interior near windows installed by Area Glass,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Photograph No. 58, ECF No. 1-3 at 187, and claims this damage \"may have been caused by [the subcontractor's] allegedly defective work.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 85 at 10. This statement is inaccurate and, in fact, is contradicted by the reports, which expressly attribute the pictured water staining and damage to a lack of through-wall flashing and improper masonry weeps, neither of which was within Area Glass's scope of work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Engineering Reports, ECF No. 1-3 at 147, 154, 156. Similarly, BITCO claims the engineering reports \"found that flashing was not observed at window sills,\" which \"caused moisture into the interior west covered entry.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 85 at 11. Again, inaccurate. The reports expressly state first that \"flashing\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   observed protruding from the [window] sills,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Engineering Reports, ECF No. 1-3 at 148 (emphasis added), and later, that all window sills \"appeared to have a flashing,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 156. Photographs of the \"typical window sill,\" in which sill flashing is plainly visible, were also included with the reports.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Photographs 60 &amp; 85, ECF No. 1-3 at 188, 201. Nowhere in these reports did the engineers even remotely suggest that sill flashing issues caused or contributed to moisture problems in the interior west covered entry. To the contrary, the engineers concluded that \"one of the main causes for moisture\" in that area was the lack of through-wall sheet metal flashing,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Engineering Reports, ECF No. 1-3 at 156,\n   which, again, was not within Area Glass's scope of work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   One final aspect of BITCO's claims against Old Dominion and Southern-Owners warrants additional comment. The state court counterclaim alleges that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [AE New] (either itself and/or through its subcontractors) negligently constructed and/or installed certain components of the Project. As a result, the Project has been determined to have certain defects and deficiencies and to have work which fails to comply with the plans and specifications, all of which have caused property damage to certain building components and which have caused damage to other property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   State Court Counterclaim, ECF No. 1-3 at 11. BITCO repeatedly insists, without citation to a single authority, that this statement, \"standing alone\"-that is, without reference to the accompanying engineering reports-\"clearly\" and \"specifically\" alleges property damage arising from Area Glass's defective work on the Project, and thus, triggers Old Dominion and Southern-Owners' duty to defend. This is incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   To begin with, this allegation does not identify the work of Area Glass (or any other individual subcontractor, for that matter) as negligent or deficient. Since numerous subcontractors performed construction work on the Project,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   List of Subcontractors, ECF No. 1-3 at 22, the Court may not infer solely from the above language that the state court counterclaims implicate Area Glass's work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wackenhut Servs., Inc. v.

In this case, the Court has already found that the factual allegations in the state court counterclaim fail to meet this standard, at least with respect to Area Glass's CGL policies. Therefore, Old Dominion and Southern-Owners owe no duty to defend AE New in that case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Crum &amp; Forster Specialty Insurance Company\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Crum concedes that the state court counterclaim and accompanying engineering reports allege defective work by its insured, West Coast Metal, but argues that it nonetheless has no duty to defend BITCO because none of the alleged property damage occurred during the applicable policy periods and, alternatively, the policy exclusion for Exterior Insulation and Finish Systems (\"EIFS Exclusion\") operates to preclude coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Regarding Crum's first argument, the Court disagrees. For there to be coverage under the Crum CGL Policies, there must be \"property damage\" that \"occur[ed] during the policy period.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Crum Policy, ECF No. 1-8 at 9;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trizec\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"349121\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/767/810/#p811\">\n    767 F.2d at 813\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[I]t is the damage itself which must occur during the policy period for coverage to be effective.\"). The parties disagree about precisely when damage \"occurs\" for purposes of policy coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Crum argues that damage \"occurs\" when it is discovered and that the state court counterclaim indicates that the alleged damage was not discovered until 2013, which was after the latest Crum policy expired. In contrast, BITCO maintains that Florida follows an \"injury-in-fact\" theory, under which damage \"occurs\" at the moment when there is actual damage and the date of discovery is irrelevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Courts have developed four theories for determining when damage occurs under a CGL policy: (1) exposure; (2) manifestation; (3) continuous trigger; and (4) injury-in-fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Auto Owners Ins.

Again, the Crum CGL Policy is materially similar to the policies in\n   <em>\n    Carithers\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Trizec\n   </em>\n   ; therefore, the\n   <em>\n    Carithers\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Trizec\n   </em>\n   analyses are binding here.

On consideration, the Court finds that Crum has failed to carry this burden. The Crum CGL policies were in effect from March 26, 2009 through December 1, 2010.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Crum Letter, ECF No. 99-5 at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Although the state court counterclaim does not expressly allege the actual date the damage occurred, its language, \"at least marginally and by reasonable implication,\" may be construed to allege that the damage attributable to Crum's insured (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , water damage from defective metal roofing, flashing, gutter, and downspout work) occurred between the commencement of construction in 2009 and the engineering expert's inspection of the Project in 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trizec\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"349121\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/767/810/#p811\">\n    767 F.2d at 813\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (reaching same conclusion based on a factually similar complaint);\n   <em>\n    Axis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324635\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/921/1338/\">\n    921 F.Supp.2d at 1349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (same). Because the Crum policies were in effect for a portion of that time period, the state court counterclaim \"fairly and potentially\" alleges damages that could fall within the policies' coverage. Therefore, the Court finds that the timing of the alleged property damage does not relieve Crum of its duty to defend AE New against the state court counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As to Crum's second argument, however, the Court finds that the EIFS Exclusion precludes coverage. Under Florida law, an insurer relying on an insurance policy exclusion to deny coverage \"has the burden of demonstrating that the allegations of the [underlying action] are cast solely and entirely within the policy exclusion and are subject to no other reasonable interpretation.\"\n   <em>\n    Hartford Accident &amp; Indem.

To date, no Florida court has analyzed the scope of an EIFS exclusion in a CGL policy.

There is no ambiguity here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Applying the plain and unambiguous language of the CGL policy in this case, the Court finds that Crum has shown the allegations in the state court counterclaim to be \"cast solely and entirely within\" the EIFS Exclusion. In particular, the relevant state court materials reflect that EIFS was used on \"[e]xterior soffits and ceilings\" throughout the Project.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Engineering Reports, ECF No. 1-3 at 147, 154. Consequently, the Crum EIFS Exclusion precludes coverage for \"any\" of West Coast Metal's \"work or operations with\n   respect to any exterior component\" of the Project.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. Crum Policy, 100-3 at 39-40. West Coast Metal worked\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   on exterior components of the Project, as it was responsible for tasks related to roofing (including membrane waterproofing, flashing and trim), gutters, and downspouts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   West Coast Metal Subcontract, ECF No. 1-29 at 11. Indeed, there is no evidence or argument that West Coast Metal performed any interior work. Accordingly, the EIFS exclusion applies to preclude coverage for damages arising from any of the subcontractor's allegedly defective work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   BITCO cites a slew of cases in support of its argument that the Crum EIFS Exclusion does not preclude coverage here.

While this is a significant exclusion (at least as applied in this case), it does not render the policy nonsensical or completely contradict the insuring provisions. Indeed, the policy still affords coverage for claims arising from West Coast Metal's work on the exterior of buildings without EIFS and to its work on a building's interior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   It is worth noting that the first of the Crum CGL policies, which clearly included the subject EIFS Exclusion, had already been in effect for over three months when West Coast Metal signed the subcontract with AE New.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Neither of these two entities appears to have considered the potential consequences of the Crum EIFS Exclusion in light of the nature of West Coast Metal's work on the Project.

AE New and BITCO cannot change the choice either. The Court thus finds that the Crum EIFS Exclusion is valid, unambiguous, and operates to preclude coverage for the claims alleged against AE New in the state court counterclaim.
