(Dkt. No. 23 at 3.) For the reasons that follow, the motion to dismiss is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following facts are taken from the First Amended Complaint (Dkt. No. 16 (\"FAC\")) and are presumed true for the purposes of this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant NYCHA is the City of New York's public housing agency. With the assistance of federal funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\"), NYCHA provides subsidized housing to over half a million residents of New York City in over 2600 buildings. (FAC \u00b6 12.) Plaintiff Chiffon Davis (\"Davis\") \"lives in an apartment in the Andrew Jackson Houses, a NYCHA-owned and operated public-housing development in the Bronx.\" (FAC \u00b6 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In the winter of early 2018, New York City \"suffered multiple 'arctic blasts' of freezing temperatures.\" (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 15, 18, 27.) Due to inadequate heating, the \"temperature in [Davis's] apartment seldom exceeded 50 degrees\" for weeks during this period, and \"was often freezing or below freezing.\" (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 15-16.) Specifically, during and after the storms of March 2 and March 7, 2018, the estimated temperature within her apartment was \"approximately 40 degrees Fahrenheit.\" (FAC \u00b6 18.) During this period, Davis's apartment would also occasionally be left without hot water, including for a four-day stretch in February of 2018. (FAC \u00b6 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Davis alleges that the heating system in her apartment complex cannot maintain adequate heat in her apartment during periods of sub-freezing outdoor temperatures, and NYCHA has not made reasonable efforts to ensure that the temperature in her apartment \"remains above minimum standards of habitability.\" (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 22-23.) Furthermore, Davis alleges that this is a recurring problem in NYCHA's buildings, and causes \"hundreds of thousands\" of residents in public housing complexes to \"suffer[ ] physical discomfort, emotional distress, increased illness, and decreased hygiene, as well as deprivation of rent paid for living conditions that do not meet minimum standards of habitability.\" (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 21, 24-25, 37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   According to Davis, certain policies and practices of Defendants have caused this public-housing heating crisis, specifically insufficient levels of boiler maintenance staff, a \"policy of prematurely closing heating maintenance request tickets\" to create the appearance that NYCHA is effectively handling the crisis, and failure to properly train employees. (FAC \u00b6 45;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 38-53.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On January 18, 2018, Davis initiated this action against NYCHA and its Chairperson, Oyeshola Olatoye (\"Olatoye\"). (Dkt. No. 1.) The operative complaint was filed on March 8, 2018, on behalf of a putative class of residents of NYCHA-owned public housing. (FAC \u00b6 54.) The First Amended Complaint asserts three claims for relief, alleging: (1) deprivation of rights under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201437\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and applicable regulations, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 60-75); (2) violation of substantive due process\n   rights under the Constitution, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 76-94); and seeking (3) a declaratory judgment that the residents' federal rights to public housing in compliance with minimum temperature requirements have been violated, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 95-102).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendants subsequently moved to dismiss the First Amended Complaint under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and 12(b)(1).

The Court addresses Defendants' motion in five parts, delineated by the specific claim or demand at issue: (A) the \u00a7 1983 claim premised on the violation of rights under federal law; (B) the \u00a7 1983 claim premised on violations of substantive due process; (C) the declaratory judgment claim; (D) claims against individual Defendant Olatoye; and (E) the demand for punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

(FAC \u00b6 63.) Section 1983 provides a cause of action against persons who, acting under color of state law, subject individuals to the \"deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws\" of the United States.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The federal law securing the right that has been violated, according to Davis, is supplied by the United States Housing Act of 1937,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20Stat.%20888\">\n    50 Stat. 888\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201437\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   In particular, Davis relies on \u00a7 1437(a) -which sets out the declaration of policy of federal housing law-and \u00a7 1437d(l)-which governs the nature of leases that must be employed by public housing agencies. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 65-67.)

Davis contends that the failure of NYCHA housing to comply with \"NYC Administrative Code \u00a7 27-20[2]9 and New York City Health Code \u00a7 131.07 regarding the minimum acceptable temperature for an occupied housing unit during the winter months\" thus violates\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%205.703\">\n    24 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g), and the resultant deprivation of rights is actionable under \u00a7 1983.

Lack of Relief Under Corresponding Federal Statutes\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   First, Defendants argue that the lack of an actionable federal right under \u00a7 1437 and \u00a7 1437d forecloses Davis from challenging the same underlying state action through a \u00a7 1983 claim premised on the deprivation of a constitutional right. (Dkt. No. 23 at 11-13.) Though somewhat confused, this argument seems to proceed in two steps: (a) the relief sought by Davis demonstrates that any claimed violation of due process is really an attempt to enforce\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201437\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1437d(l)(3) (Dkt. No. 23 at 11); and (b) where a statute limits the availability of relief, those limits cannot be circumvented by bringing claims styled as constitutional under \u00a7 1983 (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   On the first step, however, the Court is not persuaded that the relief Davis seeks in her second claim is the \"enforcement of a federal statute.\" (Dkt. No. 23 at 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Rather, the First Amended Complaint states that, as a result of the violation of the constitutional rights of Davis and the rest of the putative class, she and the putative \"class members have been damaged in the form of economic loss of value of rent and pain and suffering from exposure to extreme cold within their residences.\" (FAC \u00b6 94.) Subsequently, in the demand for relief, the complaint seeks in relevant part \"[a]n award of back rent and other damages as proved at trial,\" and \"[a]n award of punitive damages.\" (FAC at 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   This requested relief goes beyond the mere enforcement of \u00a7 1437 or \u00a7 1437d. And such damages are potentially both available and appropriate remedies for the deprivation of a constitutional right under \u00a7 1983.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Memphis Cmty. Sch.

In other words, these cases demonstrate the second condition for bringing suit under \u00a7 1983 : Congress must not have \"specifically foreclosed a remedy under \u00a7 1983,\" such as \"by creating a comprehensive enforcement scheme that is incompatible with individual enforcement.\"\n   <em>\n    Blessing\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651863\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/329/#p340\">\n    520 U.S. at 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651863\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/329/#p340\">\n    117 S.Ct. 1353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

Nevertheless, \"[i]n exceptional circumstances\" the State's failure to act may be actionable, such as where \"a governmental entity [has] a constitutional obligation to provide\" protection from harm \"either because of a special relationship with an individual, or because the governmental entity itself has created or increased the danger to the individual.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 79 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Ying Jing Gan v.

The complaint alleges that NYCHA engages in three policies or practices that caused the heating crisis. First, NYCHA \"maintain[s] boiler maintenance staffing at levels that are woefully insufficient to meet seasonal emergency repair demand\" (FAC \u00b6 39), which involved reassigning \"more than 100 boiler maintenance staff to other positions without replacement\" and failing to \"respond[ ] to emergency heating repair requests\" (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 40-42). Second, the complaint alleges that \"Olatoye and NYCHA maintain a policy of prematurely closing heating maintenance request tickets in order to create the appearance that NYCHA is far more responsive to such emergency requests than it actually is, obscuring the full extent of the crisis from the public and lawmakers.\" (FAC \u00b6 45.) Under this \"code of silence,\" Olatoye and NYCHA are alleged to have \"instruct[ed] their employees to mark heating maintenance request tickets as closed within hours of being opened, with a notation that heat was restored, when in fact heat was not restored and no effort was made to address the complaint.\" (FAC \u00b6 46.) Third, the complaint alleges that \"NYCHA and Olatoye engage in a policy of failing to adequately train employees at all levels to respond to complaints of inadequate heat.\" (FAC \u00b6 50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Defendants contend that these allegations fail to adequately allege affirmative acts on the part of NYCHA and Olatoye, or to satisfy the \"state created danger\" or \"special relationship\" exceptions to the rule that the state's failure to protect an individual from harm does not ordinarily implicate substantive due process. (Dkt. No. 23 at 15-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   With respect to whether Davis alleges that NYCHA and Olatoye engaged in affirmative acts to infringe her constitutional rights, Defendants acknowledge that the complaint alleges certain affirmative acts in the form of a \"code of silence.\" (Dkt. No. 23 at 15.) But they contend that the \"code of silence\" allegations are insufficient to support liability for substantive due process violation for two reasons: first, because the \"code of silence\" allegations are \"conclusory\" and \"devoid of any pleaded foundation in fact\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ); and second, because any deprivation of a right was caused by the failure to act to\n   <em>\n    repair\n   </em>\n   boilers and maintain heat, not by the existence of a\n   <em>\n    cover-up\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   As to the first argument, the Court disagrees. Although Davis pleads the existence of this policy \"on information and belief\" (FAC \u00b6 46), such allegations can satisfy the pleading threshold when the facts alleged are \"peculiarly within the possession and control of the defendant or where the belief is based on factual information that makes the inference of culpability plausible.\"\n   <em>\n    Arista Records, LLC v. Doe 3\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4228260\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/604/110/#p120\">\n    604 F.3d 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 120 (2d Cir. 2010) (internal citation omitted). Both circumstances obtain here. Facts supporting the existence of such a policy are uniquely within the possession of Defendants. And Davis pleads facts creating a foundation for her belief in the existence of this policy, namely past fabrications of lead inspection records and mayoral statements lauding the agency's responsiveness that\n   contrast with Davis's personal experience. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 20, 23, 47-48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   On the second point, Davis argues that \"[b]ut for Defendants' cover-up and 'Code of Silence,' the heating systems associated with the homes of Plaintiff and other class members would have been timely repaired, and they would not have been subjected to such harm.\" (Dkt. No. 21 at 9.) And the complaint itself alleges that the practice of \"mark[ing] heating maintenance request tickets as closed\" without actually restoring heat had the effect of \"depriving residents like Plaintiff the actual repair services they require.\" (FAC \u00b6 46;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 88.) These allegations are sufficiently plausible to survive a motion to dismiss. If requests for heating repairs were prematurely closed, the ticket would not be pending in the request system to be addressed in due course; and the lack of pending requests in the system, coupled with artificially short turn-around times, would obscure the problem from city officials who could have stepped in to ensure that heating was restored. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 48-49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Defendants respond by briefly questioning whether the alleged \"cover up\" actions will ultimately be able to satisfy the requirement that the affirmative acts challenged were the cause of the complained-of constitutional deprivations. (Dkt. No. 25 at 8.) The Court recognizes that Davis may face a heavy burden of demonstrating causation at a later stage of this litigation. However, for the purposes of the motion to dismiss, Davis has sufficiently pleaded both affirmative acts on the part of state actor Defendants, and that those acts caused the claimed deprivation of rights, which the Court now turns to.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Violation of Constitutional Rights\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Finally, Defendants argue that Davis has failed to establish the violation of any constitutional rights, as is required for a \u00a7 1983 claimed premised on the deprivation of rights secured under the Constitution. (Dkt. No. 23 at 13-14.) In the First Amended Complaint, Davis premises this claim on the violation of her substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. (FAC \u00b6 83.) To adequately plead a substantive due process violation, a plaintiff must allege: (1) the infringement of a right protected by substantive due process; and (2) that the conduct of the state actor was sufficiently \"egregious\" or \"outrageous\" to rise to the level of a constitutional violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Masciotta v.

The personal involvement of an individual defendant can be shown by:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   evidence that: (1) the defendant participated directly in the alleged constitutional violation, (2) the defendant, after being informed of the violation through a report or appeal, failed to remedy the wrong, (3) the defendant created a policy or custom under which unconstitutional practices occurred, or allowed the continuance of such a policy or custom, (4) the defendant was grossly negligent in supervising subordinates who committed the wrongful acts, or (5) the defendant exhibited deliberate indifference ... by failing to act on information indicating that unconstitutional acts were occurring.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <em>\n    Back\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9252347\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/365/107/#p127\">\n    365 F.3d at 127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (ellipsis in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Colon v.

No. 23 at 18.) Davis counters that the First Amended Complaint contains sufficient allegations pertaining to Olatoye's personal involvement in the conduct underlying the \u00a7 1983 claims. (Dkt. No. 21 at 23-24;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 41, 45-49, 77.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Indeed, the complaint alleges at various points that Olatoye \"participated directly in the alleged constitutional violation,\" or \"created a policy or custom under which unconstitutional practices occurred.\"\n   <em>\n    Colon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7412071\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/58/865/#p873\">\n    58 F.3d at 873\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court concludes that these facts are sufficiently well pleaded to plausibly allege Olatoye's personal involvement in the challenged conduct, such that dismissal of the claims against the individual Defendant is inappropriate at this stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Punitive Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Finally, Defendants seek dismissal of the demand for punitive damages in the First Amended Complaint. (Dkt. No. 23 at 19; FAC at 17.) Defendants are correct that the Supreme Court has foreclosed the possibility of receiving punitive damages from a municipality defendant in an action under \u00a7 1983.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298143\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/30/\">\n    461 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   36 n.5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298143\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/30/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Newport v.

However, the Supreme Court has expressly permitted the award of punitive damages against an individual public officer in an action under \u00a7 1983.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35-36,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298143\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/30/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the Court allows the constitutional claims against Defendant Olatoye to proceed, punitive damages remain a potential remedy in this case. There is thus no cause to dismiss that particular demand for relief from the operative complaint at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Defendants' motion to dismiss is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Defendants shall file an answer to the remaining claims within 14 days of the date of this Opinion and Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The Clerk of Court is directed to close the motions at Docket Numbers 18 and 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    Due to docketing issues, Defendants' motion to dismiss was filed twice, and the briefing on the docket was filed out of order. The Court is treating Docket Numbers 18 and 22 as a single motion and disregarding the order in which the briefs were filed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    Indeed, Davis specifically recognizes that \u00a7 1437 sets forth the \"broad policy goals\" of the Housing Act. (Dkt. No. 21 at 14.) Furthermore, the Court notes that she relies on this provision primarily to establish that \"lower-income families ... are the intended beneficiaries of the Housing Act\" (Dkt. No. 21 at 15), without demonstrating how this provision alone could be read to create an unambiguous, enforceable federal right to adequately heated housing.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Gonzaga\n    </em>\n    , the Supreme Court explained that \"the initial inquiry\" in statutory right cases under \u00a7 1983 -\"whether the statute confers any right at all-is no different from the initial inquiry in an implied right of action case.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254550\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/273/#p279\">\n     536 U.S. at 285\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254550\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/273/#p279\">\n     122 S.Ct. 2268\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Accordingly, this Court's analysis relies on both \u00a7 1983 cases and implied right of action cases where the focus of the inquiry was whether Congress intended to create a federal right.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    Defendants made the point in their moving brief that \"there is no private right of action to enforce a regulation that creates obligations that are not imposed by the regulation's controlling statute.\" (Dkt. No. 23 at 8.) In response, Davis disputed the state of the law, contending that it is an open question in the Second Circuit whether a federal regulation alone can create a federal right enforceable under \u00a7 1983. (Dkt. No. 21 at 17.) Although this was previously an open question in the Circuit,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     D.D. v. N.Y.C.

(Dkt. No. 23 at 13.) Although Davis devoted over a page to the property-rights argument in her response (Dkt. No. 21 at 10-11), Defendants notably did not mention it in their reply (Dkt. No. 25).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    Additionally, municipal law requires landlords to maintain certain minimum temperatures in dwellings from October through May.

But although Davis relies on these provisions elsewhere in her complaint (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 69-74), she does not specifically identify them as contributing to her claimed property interest (Dkt.
