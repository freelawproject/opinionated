(Docket 1). Defendants filed separate answers to plaintiff's complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dockets 37 &amp; 39). Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, together with a brief, an affidavit with nine exhibits and defendants' statement of undisputed material facts. (Dockets 62, 63, 64, 64-1 through 64-9 &amp; 65). Plaintiff filed a responsive brief, together with plaintiff's response to defendants' statement of undisputed facts with ten exhibits and plaintiff's declaration in support of Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(d) discovery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dockets 67, 67-1 through 67-10, 68 &amp; 70). Defendants filed a reply brief with one exhibit in support of their motion for summary judgment. (Dockets 72 &amp; 72-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff filed a motion seeking leave to file supplemental authority, a supporting brief and one case. (Dockets 78, 78-1 &amp; 79). Defendants filed a brief in response to plaintiff's motion. (Docket 82).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the reasons stated below, plaintiff's motion to file supplemental authority is granted, defendants' motion for summary judgment is granted in part and denied in part, and plaintiff's motion for Rule 56(d) discovery is denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Under Fed.

R. Civ. P. 56(a).

Initially she was in so much pain she couldn't believe it. The impact of her body hitting the concrete, maybe the weight of the box made her fall even harder.

Once the pain subsided, she felt fine. She didn't have any broken bones. Physically she feels fine. A week later, she began experiencing lightheadedness and dizziness. Equilibrium was off. Numerous time of ringing in her head. Went to doctor on 3/26, and doctor asked which ear was ringing, she couldn't tell. Vision is slightly blurry and pain in her head. She's been better the last few days. Went to ER on 3/26/2013 b/c that morning when she went to work the bright lights in the building hurt her head and eyes. While she was at ER, the did a CT scan. They said everything was negative. But she\n   was highly disappointed in the hospital staff. Never asked to see her bruises, no x-rays of her body were done. She felt like they didn't believe what happened to her. Up until that day, she had had a sharp ringing in her head, then went away. That night she had some minor ringing in head, so she knows she jarred her brain and she knows that can cause problems down the road. She had a minor cold about a month ago. Does not suffer from allergies/sinus issues. She did receive a call the next day to see how she was feeling. FU with optimologist [sic] on 3/26/2014 and told her everything looked fine.
