The Court will grant the motion in part and deny it in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case alleges that individuals who have taken one or more of Gilead's drugs containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (\"TDF\") have suffered unnecessary kidney and bone damage resulting from Gilead's failure to provide adequate warnings and its decision to develop drugs containing TDF rather than the safer compound tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (\"TAF\"). The complaint alleges the following: Plaintiffs have taken one or more drugs manufactured by Gilead that contain TDF. ECF No. 1 \u00b6 22. Since 2001, Gilead \"has received FDA [Food and Drug Administration] approval for five TDF-based drugs for the treatment of HIV\": Viread in 2001, Truvada in 2004, Atripla in 2006, Complera in 2011, and Stribild in 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 188-93. Viread has also been approved to treat Hepatitis B, and Truvada has been approved for use \"in combination with safer sex practices for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to reduce the risk of sexually acquired HIV-1 in adults at high risk.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 189, 190. Gilead has received FDA approval for three drugs containing TAF that are counterparts to its previously approved TDF drugs: Genvoya in 2015 and Odefsey and Descovy in 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 196-98. Genvoya, Odefsey, and Descovy are \"identical to\" to Stribild, Complera, and Truvada, respectively, \"except for the substitution of TAF for TDF.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Prior to the approval of Viread, Gilead had discovered TAF.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 194. \"TDF and TAF are two prodrug versions of the same parent drug, tenofovir, though TAF requires a dose more than ten times smaller than TDF to obtain the same therapeutic effect.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"Because TAF can be administered at a much lower does than TDF, its use is associated with less toxicity and fewer side effects.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. Prior to selling its first TDF drug in 2001, \"Gilead knew that TDF posed a safety risk to patients' kidneys and bones, ... that the relatively high dose of TDF created a greater risk of toxic effects, and that bone and kidney toxicities were even more likely to be seen with long-term use of TDF for the treatment of a virus that, for the foreseeable future, has no cure.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. \"Despite knowing that TAF could be given at a much lower, safer dose,\" \"that TDF causes kidney and bone damage and that TAF is safer for patients' kidneys and bones, Gilead designed the TDF Drugs to contain TDF rather than safer TAF.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7, 279. When Gilead began selling its TAF drugs, it \"convinced doctors to switch their patients from TDF-based to TAF-based regimens by demonstrating TAF's superior safety profile over TDF with respect to kidney and bone toxicity - the very benefits that Gilead could have and should have incorporated into its prior product designs but withheld from doctors and patients for over a decade.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"Stribild is even more toxic to patients' kidneys and bones than Gilead's other TDF-based products\" because it contains a higher dose of TDF than required.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. In addition to TDF, Stribild contains cobicistat, a \"pharmacoenhancer or 'booster' that inhibits the breakdown of elvitegravir, another active ingredient in Stribild.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. Prior to submitting Stribild for FDA approval, Gilead knew that \"TDF-associated renal toxicity occurs more frequently in patients taking TDF as part of a boosted regimen,\" and that the TAF dosage in Genvoya, the TAF-equivalent\n   to Stribild, could be reduced \"from 25 mg to 10 mg to account for the fact that cobicistat significantly increases tenofovir concentrations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13-14. Nonetheless, \"Gilead did not reduce the dose of TDF when it designed Stribild.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Gilead also \"failed to adequately warn physicians and patients about the risks and safe use of TDF. Gilead provided only the weakest, inadequate warnings to doctors and patients about the need for frequent monitoring of all patients for TDF-associated kidney and bone damage - preventing doctors from detecting early signs of TDF toxicity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. For example, \"after May 21, 2007, the TDF labels do not disclose that adverse kidney and bone events occurred in patients without pre-existing risk factors - which, combined with the warning to only routinely monitor patients at risk - gives the false impression that TDF is only harmful to people otherwise at risk for kidney and bone injuries.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 346. \"Gilead's monitoring instructions for at risk patients taking Viread, Truvada, Atripla, and Complera, and patients taking Stribild are also inadequate because they fail to recommend a specific, frequent monitoring schedule for doctors to assess patients' kidney function.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 347. \"Regularly scheduled, frequent monitoring of kidney function is necessary to catch early signs of TDF-induced toxicity and prevent injury because patients are generally asymptomatic during the early stages.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 345. Early detection of toxicity \"is key to preventing serious, potentially irreversible renal injury,\" and monitoring also \"ensure[s] that patients' kidneys are healthy enough to continue treatment\" or that patients receive necessary dosage adjustments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 324, 338.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs allege a financial motive for Gilead's alleged conduct. They allege that Gilead stopped developing TAF in 2004, claiming that it was too similar to TDF to continue development, but in reality did so because \"Gilead did not want to hurt TDF sales by admitting that its TDF-based products are unreasonably and unnecessarily unsafe.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. Gilead also stood to gain by having two different periods of drug exclusivity: first for TDF drugs and later for TAF drugs. \"Only once Gilead realized billions in sales through most of the TDF patent life did it seek to market safer TAF-based versions of its HIV medications.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. Gilead \"provides stronger monitoring warnings to physicians and patients in the European Union than it does in the United States for the exact same TDF products.... There is no scientific or medical rationale for these differences. Gilead was more concerned with increasing or maintaining crucial U.S. sales than it was in safeguarding patients from the known risks of TDF.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On the basis of these allegations, Plaintiffs assert design-defect and failure-to-warn claims under multiple states' product liability and negligence laws. Plaintiffs also assert state-law fraud and consumer protection claims, as well as claims for the breach of implied warranty and merchantability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The complaint names 140 plaintiffs from 31 states. ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 24-163. Plaintiffs' counsel filed a nearly identical case,\n   <em>\n    Dowdy v. Gilead Sciences, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 3:19-cv-00481-JST, on behalf of 25 different plaintiffs from 10 of the 31 states involved in this case. Case No. 3:19-cv-00481-JST, ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 23-47. The parties filed consolidated briefing on Gilead's motion to dismiss in both cases. ECF Nos. 45, 54, 60;\n   <em>\n    Dowdy\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 30, 40, 45. The Court granted the parties' stipulation to consolidate these cases for pretrial purposes on April 29, 2019, and ordered that \"[t]he master docket and master file for the consolidated actions shall be 3:18-cv-06972-JST and the consolidated action shall bear\n   the caption\n   <em>\n    Holley, et al. v. Gilead Sciences Inc.\n   </em>\n   \" ECF No. 67 at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Gilead moves to dismiss all of Plaintiffs' claims as preempted under federal law. It also argues that Plaintiffs' failure-to-warn claims should be dismissed because they do not adequately allege causation, and that their claims under state fraud and consumer protection laws should be dismissed because they do not comply with the heightened pleading requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). Finally, Gilead argues that another court's decision,\n   <em>\n    AIDS Healthcare Foundation, Inc. v. Gilead Sciences, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. C 16-00443 WHA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203648623\">\n    2016 WL 3648623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 (N.D.

Cir. 2018), establishes that it had no duty to introduce drugs containing TAF at an earlier date, and that Plaintiffs' claims based on that allegation should therefore be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II. JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   This case involves more than 100 plaintiffs, and Gilead does not contest that at least some of the plaintiffs are of diverse citizenship from Gilead, which Plaintiffs allege is a Delaware corporation with a principal place of business in California. ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 24-164. Gilead also does not contest that the total amount in controversy exceeds $ 5,000,000, exclusive of interest and costs, or that each Plaintiff's claims exceed $ 75,000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. This case therefore meets the statutory requirements for a \"mass action\" under the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (\"CAFA\"), and the Court has subject matter jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).\n   <em>\n    Corber v.

Gilead also knew that the relatively high dose of TDF created a greater risk of toxic effects, and that bone and kidney toxicities were even more likely to be seen with long-term use of TDF for the treatment of a virus that, for the foreseeable future, has no cure.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    ECF No. 1 \u00b6 5 (emphasis added);\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 210 (\"Since scientists first synthesized TDF, studies [including one published in 1999] have consistently shown that it\n    could cause significant kidney and bone damage.\").

Plaintiffs further allege that, \"less than one month after Viread entered the market, the first published case of TDF-associated acute renal failure occurred.

Plaintiffs allege that the risks of TDF drugs were known before Gilead submitted its first TDF drug for approval. It would be an unreasonable inference to conclude that Gilead did not present any information concerning the risks of TDF drugs to the FDA, especially when Plaintiffs allege that Gilead submitted multiple applications for different TDF drugs and that it also \"update[d] its Viread labeling at least four times [between 2002 and 2006] to describe the kidney damage patients experienced when taking TDF,\"\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 217, and again modified its labeling (as to unspecified drugs) in 2007 and twice in 2008,\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 224-25.

Adequacy of Causation Allegations in Failure-to-Warn Claims\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    Gilead argues that Plaintiffs have not adequately alleged causation on their failure-to-warn claims. Plaintiffs do not dispute that they must allege that the allegedly inadequate warnings caused them injury, or that the state laws they invoke require warnings to Plaintiffs' physicians and not to Plaintiffs directly. Instead, Plaintiffs argue that they \"have alleged what Gilead says is required - i.e., that but for Gilead's warning failures, Plaintiffs' physicians 'would have acted differently.' \" ECF No. 54 at 27 (quoting ECF No. 45 at 25).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    Gilead asserts that Plaintiffs must allege that their physicians would not have prescribed the TDF drugs had Gilead given different warnings, but that position is not supported by the case law. Although choosing not to prescribe a particular medication or device is one way that a physician might have acted differently, it is not the only adequate means of demonstrating causation on a failure-to-warn claim. To the contrary, as the first case cited by Gilead demonstrates, the relevant question is whether the plaintiff's physician would have \"prescribed the drug\n    <em>\n     in the same manner.\n    </em>\n    \"\n    <em>\n     Byrd v.

For example, in the count alleging violation of consumer protection laws, Plaintiffs allege that:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n    Gilead\n    <em>\n     intentionally misrepresented material facts in its promotional, marketing, and labeling communications\n    </em>\n    about the risks and benefits of the TDF Drugs to Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs' doctors, including but not limited to, that the TDF Drugs: 1) presented limited risk of kidney and bone toxicity resulting from purportedly unavoidable side effects of tenofovir; and 2) did not require careful,\n    frequent monitoring of all TDF Drug patients for TDF-associated kidney and bone toxicity.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    ECF No. 1 \u00b6 536 (emphasis added);\n    <em>\n     see also id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 539-43 (referring to \"misrepresentations\" as well as \"omissions\"). Plaintiffs elsewhere allege that Gilead \"misrepresent[ed] the safety profile of TDF when promoting TDF to doctors\" and gave \"misleading marketing messages\" to doctors, including \"that Viread was a 'miracle drug,' 'extremely safe,' and 'extremely well-tolerated' with 'no toxicities.' \"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 327, 333. Similarly, Plaintiffs allege that Gilead \"misrepresent[ed]: (a) that any tenofovir-induced toxicity was rare and unavoidable; (b) why Gilead had purportedly abandoned development of TAF in 2004; and (c) that TAF was 'new' once Gilead finally introduced the safer TAF design over a decade later.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 511;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 332 (alleging that \"Gilead continued to downplay the risks of TDF-induced toxicity when promoting its TDF Drugs to doctors by misrepresenting the drug as safe, dismissing case reports of acute renal failure and other TDF-associated adverse events as purportedly unavoidable side effects of tenofovir in an otherwise 'safe' drug, and discouraging doctors from monitoring patients for drug-induced toxicity using more sensitive markers of kidney function\"). Even Plaintiffs' opposition brief argues that \"Plaintiffs' fraud by omission and consumer protection claims ... are based, in part, on Gilead's omissions\n    <em>\n     and misrepresentations\n    </em>\n    with respect to TDF and TAF.\" ECF No. 54 at 26-27 (emphasis added). Thus, at least as currently pleaded, Plaintiffs' claims are not only about omissions, and Plaintiffs may not rely on the lower level of specificity allowed for claims based on alleged omissions to avoid dismissal of their misrepresentation claims. Plaintiffs do not argue that they have satisfied Rule 9(b) as to those claims, and the Court will therefore dismiss those claims with leave to amend.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    However, Plaintiffs' omissions-based claims are sufficiently pleaded. In\n    <em>\n     MacDonald v.

Cal. 2014), this Court considered allegations that Ford failed to disclose a coolant pump defect to consumers. Ford argued in its motion to dismiss that the plaintiffs failed to plead omission with particularity. The Court disagreed and concluded that:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n    Plaintiffs adequately allege the \"who what when and how,\" given the inherent limitations of an omission claim. In short, the \"who\" is Ford, the \"what\" is its knowledge of a defect, the \"when\" is prior to the sale of Class Vehicles, and the \"where\" is the various channels of information through which Ford sold Class Vehicles.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4338763\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/37/1087/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4338763\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/37/1087/\">\n     at 1096\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Likewise, here, as Plaintiffs observe in their opposition: \"The 'who' is Gilead, the 'what' is an adequate warning about the risks and safe use of TDF and the fact that Gilead was withholding safer designs of the TDF Drugs, the 'when' is prior to Plaintiffs' doctors' prescribing and monitoring decisions, and the 'where' is in Gilead's drug labeling, marketing, and promotional materials.\" ECF No. 54 at 31. For example, the complaint alleges:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n    Gilead intentionally suppressed, concealed, and omitted material facts in its promotional, marketing, and labeling communications about the risks and benefits of the TDF Drugs to Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs' doctors, including but not limited to, that: 1) all TDF patients should be carefully and frequently monitored for adverse kidney and bone effects on a frequent schedule; 2) Gilead had already developed the safer TAF design for delivering tenofovir into the body but nevertheless designed the TDF Drugs to contain TDF, and withheld the safer [TAF] design, in order to maximize profits on its TDF-based products and extend its ability to profit on its HIV\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n    franchise for years to come; and 3) Gilead knew that the tenofovir prodrug dose should be reduced when combined in a fixed dose combination pill with cobicistat, but did not reduce the TDF dose in Stribild.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    ECF No. 1 \u00b6 535 ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 507 (\"Gilead intentionally omitted from its prescriber and patient labeling an adequate warning regarding the need for doctors to monitor all TDF patients, on a frequent, specific schedule, for the adverse effects of TDF-associated bone and kidney toxicity.\").

AIDS Healthcare contends that Gilead knew of the efficacy and safety benefits of TAF in 2004 but shelved its clinical trials until 2011, leading to FDA approval (and a grant of NCE exclusivity) in 2015, just before the patents on TDF were set to expire.\n    </blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n     This, AIDS Healthcare contends, delayed the expiration date of Gilead's NCE exclusivity and thus delayed the moment that competitors would seek to challenge Gilead's patents on TAF.

It had no obligation to introduce the improved product at an earlier date. Any competitor could have beaten Gilead to market (and thus NCE exclusivity). \"Without more, it is not unlawful [under antitrust law] for any competitor in any market to delay the introduction of a new product or an entire line of new products until, as [the plaintiff] alleged in this case, the competition forces such introduction.\"\n     <em>\n      Foremost Pro Color, Inc. v.
