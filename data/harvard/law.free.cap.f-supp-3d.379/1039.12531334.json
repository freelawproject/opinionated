On January 16, 2019, defendants Lucky Stores, Inc. (\"Lucky\"), Nestl\u00e9 USA, Inc. (\"Nestl\u00e9\"), Save Mart Super Markets (\"Save Mart\"), The Kroger Company (\"Kroger\"), and The Save Mart Companies, Inc.

Beasley alleges that Nestl\u00e9, a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business \"in California or Virginia\" (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   First Am. Compl. (\"FAC\"), filed Dec. 19, 2018, \u00b6 12), \"manufactures, markets, and sells Coffee-mate\" (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3). He also alleges that Lucky, Save Mart, and SMCI, each of which is a California corporation,\n   and Kroger, a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Ohio, \"sold Coffee-mate at their grocery stores throughout California\" (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4) and that, during the class period, he purchased Coffee-mate from grocery stores owned by said four defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   According to Beasley, Coffee-mate, during the class period, contained partially hydrogenated oil (\"PHO\"), which is an \"[a]rtificial\" form of trans fat (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20) and an \"unsafe food additive\" (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3). In addition, Beasley alleges that, for portions of the class period, the packaging for Coffee-mate bore deceptive \"nutrient content claim[s],\" namely, \"0g Trans Fat\" and/or \"IT'S GOOD TO KNOW: 0g TRANS FAT/serv LACTOSE-FREE GLUTEN-FREE.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Based on the above allegations, Beasley, on October 29, 2018, filed his initial complaint in the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco. In said complaint, Beasley asserted five Causes of Action, brought both individually and on behalf of the following two putative classes: (1) a \"Class,\" defined as \"[a]ll citizens of California who purchased in California, on or after January 1, 2010, Coffee-mate products containing [PHO]\" (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Class Action Compl., Dkt. No. 1-3 (filed Nov. 26, 2018), \u00b6 147); and (2) a \"0g Trans Fat Claim Subclass,\" defined as \"[a]ll citizens of California who purchased in California, on or after January 1, 2010, Coffee-mate containing the nutrient content claim '0g Trans Fat' and containing [PHO]\" (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ). The first two Causes of Action were brought on behalf of the \"Class\" and asserted, respectively, \"Unfair Conduct\"/\"Unlawful Conduct\" (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 27:20 &amp; 28:5) under California's \"Unfair Competition Law\" (\"UCL\") and \"Breach of Implied Warranty of Merchantability\" (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 29:4). The last three Causes of Action were \"limited to\" the \"0g Trans Fat Claim Subclass\" and asserted, respectively, \"Unlawful Conduct\"/\"Fraudulent Conduct\"/\"Unfair Conduct\" (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 29:25, 32:4, &amp; 32:16) under the UCL, violation of California's \"False Advertising Law\" (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 33:9), and \"Breach of Express Warranty\" (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 33:20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Subsequently, on November 26, 2018, defendants removed the instant case to federal court, on the basis that the Court has jurisdiction pursuant to the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (\"CAFA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1453, 1711 - 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On December 19, 2018, Beasley filed the FAC, in which he reasserts the above five Causes of Action and adds, on behalf of the \"0g Trans Fat Claim Subclass,\" a Cause of Action under California's \"Consumer Legal Remedies Act.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC at 34:2.) Further, as to all Causes of Action, he asserts jurisdiction is proper in state court because, in addition to Beasley himself, \"several defendants\" and \"all members of the proposed class\" are California citizens (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201332\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201332\">\n    \u00b6 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), \"all claims are asserted under the laws of California\" (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201332\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ), and \"the decisions about the labeling and formulation of Coffee-mate during the class period were made in and emanated from\" California (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201332\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   By the instant motion, Beasley seeks an order remanding the above-titled action to state court, on the basis that the \"local controversy\" exception to CAFA applies.

Here, in their Notice of Removal, defendants assert the instant action satisfies CAFA's jurisdictional requirements.

As discussed below, the Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Beasley argues CAFA's \"principal injuries\" requirement is met because \"the injury\n   <em>\n    alleged\n   </em>\n   by [p]laintiff-the sale of an unlawful product in violation of California law-occurred entirely and wholly within California.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. at 16:9-11 (emphasis in original).) In response, defendants argue, \"class actions that challenge conduct that occurred nationwide and, therefore, injures consumers nationwide-like the nationwide sale of Coffee-mate-are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   'local' regardless [of] the presence of a local defendant and a narrowly defined putative class.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n at 2:3-5 (emphasis in original).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As set forth above, subsection (i)(III) requires that \"principal injuries resulting from the alleged conduct or any related conduct of each defendant were incurred in the State in which the action was originally filed.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(4)(A)(i)(III). CAFA does not, however, define the term \"principal injuries,\" nor does it state whose injuries should be considered or provide other guidance for interpreting subsection (i)(III), and the Court is not aware of any Ninth Circuit precedent addressing the question.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Winn v.
