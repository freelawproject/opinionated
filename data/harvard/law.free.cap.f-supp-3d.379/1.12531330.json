She suffers from various mental health disorders and a right-foot deformity, and she claims that these maladies have left her unable to work. The SSA considered and rejected these claims three times. The third denial came after a hearing conducted by an Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Ms. Perkins now seeks a reversal of the ALJ's decision. The SSA objects. The case was referred to a Magistrate Judge who considered the parties' arguments. She recommends that the Court grant Ms. Perkins's motion and remand her case for an immediate award of benefits. Because it finds that the ALJ's decision violated the \"treating physician rule,\" the Court will remand the case. But as the record does not show a clear entitlement to benefits, an immediate award is improper. The case will therefore be returned to the ALJ for additional fact-finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   To qualify for Supplemental Security Income, a claimant must establish that she is \"disabled.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20423\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(D), 1382(a)(1).

But that someone exhibits normal psychomotor activity during a treatment session is not necessarily inconsistent with her having marked limitations in concentration, social interactions, or adaptation. Indeed, Dr. Broadnax's treatment notes also suggest that Ms. Perkins has \"Concentration Problems,\" and that her judgment and insight are \"Poor.\" ECF No. 7-7 at 40. These notes could be read as supporting, rather than contradicting, her ultimate conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Similarly, the ALJ failed to detail the Broadnax opinion's internal inconsistencies. His decision examines Ms. Perkins's Global Assessment of Functioning (\"GAF\") scores. ECF No. 7-2 at 27. GAF scores measure how much a person's psychological symptoms affect her daily life.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

The Broadnax opinion found that Ms. Perkins's \"highest GAF score in the last year is 60 and her current GAF score is 55.\" ECF No. 7-2 at 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   These scores, the ALJ suggested, are \"not indicative of a disabling level of limitation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4160718\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/134/358/#p365\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He added that he accorded Ms. Perkins's high GAF scores \"significant weight,\" noting that they are \"indicative of only mild to moderate psychological symptoms.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4160718\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/134/358/#p365\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But the ALJ also explained that a \"GAF score represents a particular clinician's subjective evaluation at a single point in time,\" and that it \"may vary from day to day, from time to time, and between practitioners.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27-28. Because of this, the ALJ \"generally gives less weight to a specific GAF score than to the bulk of other, more convincing evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27. In fact, he suggested that \"in this case, the other evidence is generally more informative and is given more weight.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   It is difficult to square the ALJ's treatment of Ms. Perkins's GAF scores with his position on the limited usefulness of such scores. The ALJ does not explain why the two scores identified by the Broadnax opinion were given significant weight. Nor does he provide his reasons for concluding, given the other \"generally more informative\" evidence in the record, that these scores contradict the treating physician's overall assessment about Ms. Perkins's ability to perform work. Because of these deficiencies, the Court finds that the ALJ's decision violates the Circuit's treating physician rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The SSA's arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive. It suggests that \"substantial evidence supports the ALJ's evaluation of Dr. Broadnax's disability opinion.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. Maybe so. But the Court may \"only consider the grounds proffered by the agency in its decision,\" as \"\n   <em>\n    post hoc\n   </em>\n   rationalizations do not suffice.\"\n   <em>\n    Espinosa v.

The ALJ's decision, even when read holistically as the SSA asks the Court to do, does not show how the record evidence supports the ALJ's treatment of the Broadnax opinion. The Court therefore rejects this objection.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   But the SSA's next objection to the Magistrate Judge's Report\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   persuasive-a remand for an immediate award of benefits is improper. Whether the ALJ sufficiently explained his reasoning and whether the record shows that Ms. Perkins cannot work are two distinct inquiries. While the Court finds for Ms. Perkins on the former, it cannot do so on the latter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Indeed, as the SSA suggests, the record contains evidence that appears to undermine Dr. Broadnax's conclusions about Ms. Perkins's ability to work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Obj. at 4-5. For instance, Drs. Nicole Simpson and Nancy Heiser also assessed the claimant's mental health. Dr. Simpson found that Ms. Perkins's \"ability to maintain attention and concentration for extended periods\" is only \"moderately limited.\" ECF No. 7-3 at 11. She also determined that her \"ability to sustain an ordinary routine without special supervision,\" and her \"ability to work in coordination with or in proximity to others without being distracted by them\" are \"[n]ot significantly limited.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3720842,9298076\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/353/992/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Similarly, Dr. Heiser found that Ms. Perkins \"can concentrate for 2 hour periods to complete a normal 8 hour work day.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28. Like Dr. Simpson, she believed that Ms. Perkins suffers only mild or moderate limitations across several mental health and residual functional capacity categories.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27-28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   These findings seem to directly contradict the Broadnax opinion. And they suggest that the opinion may not fit the record as whole, perhaps justifying a decision by the SSA to accord it little weight.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1527\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(4) (\"Generally, the more consistent a medical opinion is with the record as a whole, the more weight we will give to that medical opinion.\").
