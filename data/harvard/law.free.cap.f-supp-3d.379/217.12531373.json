Briefly, the government alleges that defendant possessed a firearm and ammunition in connection with a drive-by shooting that he perpetrated on the morning of July 21, 2017. The government commenced this criminal prosecution by complaint on July 25, 2017 and defendant was arrested on August 8, 2017. Law enforcement officers seized both the LG Phone and the iPhone from the defendant at the time of his arrest. Defendant was subsequently charged in a two-count indictment with knowingly using and carrying a firearm in furtherance of a drug\n   trafficking crime in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)(A)(i), (ii), and (iii), and 924(c)(2), and possession of ammunition after having been convicted of a felony in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On November 2, 2017, the Government applied for a warrant to search the LG Phone (the \"LG Warrant Application\"), which included an affidavit from an investigator with the United States Attorney's Office (the \"LG Phone Affidavit\"). According to the LG Phone Affidavit, an individual (the \"Renter\") informed law enforcement that he and defendant had communicated via direct messages on Instagram regarding the rental of the vehicle used in the shooting, and that the two had also communicated with each other in the days following the shooting. The Renter deleted these and other Instagram direct messages from his account before proffering with the government. The affiant investigator averred that \"[b]ased on [his] training an experience, and [his] involvement in investigations that involve the use of social media platforms, such as Instagram, [he is] aware that individuals use Instagram on their cellphones.\" Glavin Aff. Ex. 3 at \u00b6 11, ECF No. 37-3. Additionally, the LG Phone Affidavit included paragraphs describing defendant's use of a phone number ending in \"3707\" (the \"3707 Number\") to communicate with various individuals. The Court granted the LG Warrant Application on November 2, 2017, authorizing the government to execute the warrant (the \"LG Warrant\") on or before November 16, 2017. The government extracted the contents of the LG Phone on two occasions: November 9, 2017 and March 21, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 29, 2018, shortly after the second extraction of the LG Phone, the government applied for a warrant to search the iPhone (the \"iPhone Warrant Application\"). The affidavit in support relied in part on information obtained from the prior search of the LG Phone. The Court granted the iPhone Warrant Application on March 29, 2018, authorizing the government to execute the warrant (the \"iPhone Warrant\") on or before April 12, 2018. The contents of the iPhone were extracted on April 25, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Responsive materials from both Phones were produced to the defense on February 5, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

First, he argues that the LG Warrant Application failed to allege facts connecting the relevant Instagram communications with the LG Phone, instead \"rel[ying] heavily upon the affiant investigator's generalized professional experience that individuals use Instagram on their cellphones.\" Mem. of Law in Supp. of Def.'s Mot. to Suppress at 6, ECF No. 36. In so arguing, defendant ignores the practical realities of how users are likely to engage with social media platforms such as Instagram. It is not only consistent with the affiant investigator's experience but also common sense that these communications - which included messages in which the Renter and defendant coordinated the acquisition of the drive-by vehicle - would be found on a mobile phone in possession of defendant at the time of his arrest. And the mere fact that the LG Warrant Application relied on practical considerations and law enforcement's expertise as one of the links in the chain connecting the subject property to the alleged criminal activity does not vitiate this Court's probable cause finding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Accordingly, the Court has little trouble concluding that there was probable cause to search the LG Phone on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Second, defendant argues that the evidence obtained from the LG Phone should be suppressed because of the government's alleged failure to disclose that (1) law enforcement agents had seized a second phone (the iPhone), and (2) the 3707 Number described in the LG Warrant Application was associated with the iPhone, not the LG Phone. Because neither the existence of the iPhone nor defendant's use of the 3707 Number had any bearing on the affiant's testimony with respect to the Instagram communications described\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \"there remains a residue of independent and lawful information sufficient to support probable cause\" even after stripping the LG Affidavit of the allegedly misleading statements.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Defendant cites readily distinguishable precedent\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   for the proposition that delays in certain circumstances can be constitutionally infirm, but neglects to explain how either of the government's searches in this case - which took, respectively, 15 months (the LG Phone) and 10 months (the iPhone) to complete - are\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   evidence of unreasonableness or resulted in any prejudice to the defendant. While the reasons for the delays here are not made explicit in the record, the most logical (and fairly obvious) explanation is one of resource allocation. Given that the searches were executed pursuant to valid warrants, commenced shortly after execution, and completed nearly three months prior to defendant's scheduled trial (and mere weeks after plea negotiations between defendant and the government broke down), we find the searches within the bounds of reason and decline to suppress evidence on account of the pace at which they were performed.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

While Rule 41(e)(2)(A)(i) provides that a warrant must command an authorized officer to execute it \"within a specified time no longer than 14 days,\" warrants seeking electronically stored information \"are deemed executed when the electronically stored information is seized and brought within the government's control, rather than when the information is analyzed by the government.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Glavin in Support of Defendant Joshua Sosa's Motion to Suppress (\"Glavin Aff.\"), Feb. 25, 2019, ECF No. 37, and attached exhibits.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    Because we hold that the search of the LG Phone was supported by probable cause, we necessarily conclude that the iPhone Warrant Application did not improperly rely upon evidence obtained from that search.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Metter\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5747598\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/860/205/#p215\">\n     860 F.Supp.2d at 215\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (E.D.N.Y. 2012) (finding that the government's retention of electronic data seized pursuant to a warrant for fifteen-months without beginning any review \"unreasonable and disturbing\");\n    <em>\n     Ganias\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4063948\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/755/125/#p135\">\n     755 F.3d 125\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 135 (2d Cir. 2014) (concluding that the government's retention of non-responsive files for two-and-a-half years was unreasonable, but taking no issue with the government's 13-month initial review of the files to determine their responsiveness).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    For this reason, and because the search was performed within a reasonable period of time, we also reject defendant's bare assertion that the government violated the Fourth Amendment in extracting the contents of the LG Phone a second time on March 21, 2018.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    Even if the Court were to credit defendant's too-clever-by-half reading of Rule 41(e)(2)(B), \"suppression would not be the appropriate remedy because there was no prejudice to the defendant by the delay, and there is no evidence of any intentional and deliberate disregard of any provision of Rule 41.\"\n    <em>\n     United States v.
