None of the County's arguments has merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The County suffered no prejudice (and was not misled) due to any inadequacies in Plaintiffs' March 11, 2015 letter. It is undisputed that the letter was provided by certified mail to the County's legal representative\n   on March 11, 2015, just ten days after the accident. Certified Mail Receipt at p. 2, March 11, 2015 Letter, attached as Ex. 2 to Pls.' CSF, ECF No. 156-4. Although not technically filed with the County Clerk, the letter provided notice to appropriate County officials when it was received by the Hawaii Office of the Corporation Counsel. There is no evidence of prejudice to the County because the written letter was provided to the Office of the Corporation Counsel rather than filed with the County Clerk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   And the purpose of the March 11, 2015 letter was clear. It was provided to the County to inform it that Surnow was killed by one of its police officers while Surnow was riding his bicycle in the early morning on Waikoloa Road, and requested preservation of any investigative materials, information, or evidence in possession of the County. It was sent on letterhead of the Davis Levin Livingston law firm and signed by Attorney Davis, and gave notice to the County of Surnow's name, the specific date and time of the accident, the general location of the accident, the nature of the accident, that Surnow died, the identity of the County police officer responsible for the accident, the contact information for the Plaintiffs' representatives, and a list of information and evidence that Plaintiffs sought. Thus, the letter clearly was written, and reasonably understood to be, in anticipation of litigation against the County. Although the March 11, 2015 letter did not ask for a specific dollar amount in damages, it is indisputable that the letter was related to the Plaintiffs' potential claims for the alleged wrongful death of Surnow. The letter provided sufficient notice to the County pursuant to HRS \u00a7 46-72 and Hawaii Charter \u00a7 13-18.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The County has put forward no evidence that it was prejudiced in its ability to investigate or prepare for litigation due to any technical faults in the March 11, 2015 letter. At the hearing on May 6, 2019, the County argued that there was potential prejudice because the County would be required to set aside money in its budget for a settlement, and may have done so if the March 11, 2015 letter specified a dollar amount. The argument is unconvincing and not supported by any evidence. The County did not provide any affidavit or other admissible evidence to support its argument. The record establishes that the March 11, 2015 letter informed the County of the nature and extent of Surnow's injuries and that the County thoroughly investigated the incident after receipt of the notice. \"[T]he fact that the various county officials had investigated and/or had knowledge of 'when, where and how the injuries occurred' all have relevancy.\"\n   <em>\n    Oakley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1446482\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/54/210/#p214\">\n    54 Haw. at 217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=505%20P.2d%201182\">\n    505 P.2d at 1186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In short, there was no prejudice to the County in this case. Plaintiffs have demonstrated there was significant correspondence between County officials and Plaintiffs following receipt of the March 11, 2015 letter. Not only was there a thorough investigation of the accident following the March 11, 2015 letter, but Plaintiffs assisted County officials in the investigation. County officials proceeded to file criminal charges following the investigation of the\n   accident. Buddemeyer was tried and convicted in the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit, State of Hawaii, for Negligent Homicide in the Third Degree.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Judgment (November 30, 2018), Ex. 9 to Pls.' CSF, ECF No. 156-11. Buddemeyer was prosecuted by Prosecuting Attorney Mitchell D. Roth, a representative of the County.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=505%20P.2d%201182\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The County was also able to timely file for insurance coverage because of the March 11, 2015 written notice. On the same date as the letter, the County filed an Automobile Loss Notice with its insurance carrier relating to Surnow's death. Automobile Loss Notice (March 11, 2015), Ex. 3 to Pls.' CSF, ECF No. 156-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Because Plaintiffs' March 11, 2015 letter provided sufficient notice to the County pursuant to HRS \u00a7 46-72 and Hawaii Charter \u00a7 13-18, and the County suffered no prejudice in its ability to investigate or prepare for litigation due to any faults in the written notice, the statutory notice prerequisite has been satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    D.
