The Commissioner now moves for judgment on the pleadings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons stated below, the Commissioner's motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Ms. Urena's Claim for Benefits and Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Ms. Urena first applied for disability insurance benefits on June 6, 2012,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Certified Administrative Record, filed June, 8, 2018 (Docket # 9) (\"R.\"), at 48, and for supplemental security income on June 28, 2012,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 49, 96-111. Her applications listed a disability onset date of August 31, 2010. See R. 96, 105.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Social Security Administration denied her applications on August 29, 2012. R. 52. Ms. Urena requested a hearing before an administrative law judge (\"ALJ\"), which occurred on August 8, 2013. R. 68-69;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 22-47. She was not represented by an attorney at the hearing. R. 24. In a written decision dated January 7, 2014, the ALJ denied Ms. Urena's application. R. 8-18. Ms. Urena requested a review of the ALJ's decision by the Appeals Council. R. 5-7. The Appeals Council denied this request on March 24, 2015. R. 1-4. Ms. Urena commenced a civil action in federal district court on May 1, 2015, and timely filed her complaint on that date\n   <em>\n    pro\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    se\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 385-88. On January 11, 2016, the district court remanded the case pursuant to the parties' stipulation. R. 397-99. On February 23, 2016, the Appeals Council vacated the ALJ's January 7, 2014, decision, giving specific instructions to the ALJ to evaluate certain medical opinions, develop the record, evaluate the claimant's impairments and residual functional capacity, and obtain vocational expert testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 400-04.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On remand, a new hearing was held before a different ALJ on October 11, 2016. R. 345-66. On March 7, 2017, the ALJ issued a decision finding that Ms. Urena was not disabled. R. 325-38. On October 18, 2017, the Appeals Council denied review. R. 319-24. On December 22, 2017, Ms. Urena commenced this action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint, filed Dec. 22, 2017 (Docket # 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    The Administrative Record and Medical Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Commissioner has provided a summary of the medical evidence contained in the administrative record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.

Having examined the record, we adopt the Commissioner's summary as accurate and complete for the purposes of the issues raised in this suit. We discuss all the medical evidence pertinent to the adjudication of this case in section III below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    The March 7, 2017, Hearing Before the ALJ\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Ms. Urena was not represented at the hearing held on October 11, 2016. R. 347. At the start of the hearing, the ALJ explained that she developed the medical record by sending Ms. Urena for an examination,\n   and by requesting hospital records from Montefiore Medical Center. R. 348-49. The ALJ stated that she had not yet received psychiatric records from Montefiore but that she would keep the record open and send a follow-up request to obtain a complete record. R. 349.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Ms. Urena testified that she was born on December 14, 1968, and was 47 years old at the time of the hearing. R. 351. She was single and lived with her child, who was 14 years of age. R. 351-52. Her highest level of education was \"some college.\" R. 352. The onset date of Ms. Urena's alleged disability was August 31, 2010. R. 351. During the hearing, Ms. Urena alleged that she experiences anxiety and panic attacks in noisy environments, R. 354-55, and in crowds,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 356; that she experiences depression that causes her to \"not want[ ] to do anything,\" R. 359; and that she struggles with fear that she might \"blackout and hurt someone,\" which causes her to shake and sometimes prevents her from leaving her house,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 360, 364.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   During the hearing, Ms. Urena stated that she had worked since August 31, 2010, the alleged onset date of her disability. R. 352-55. She testified that she performed housekeeping work in the home of a person she knew on a sporadic basis, approximately two or three times per week, in 2010, 2012, 2013, and 2015. R. 352-53, 360-61. Ms. Urena stated that she was able to perform this work despite her anxiety because her employer \"always gave [her] ... privacy\" and left her alone in the house while she worked, and Ms. Urena would complete her work before anyone came home. R. 360-61. Ms. Urena also testified that she took a course and obtained a certificate in tax preparation from September 2015 through January 2016. R. 353. She subsequently worked as a tax preparer, but explained that her hours were cut after she \"got sick ... a couple of times\" while at work. R. 354. After her hours were cut to three days per week, and then to two days per week, she was let go in late March 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 353-55. Ms. Urena testified that it was difficult for her to work in the office as a tax preparer when there was noise, but that \"if it's quiet [she could] manage for a while, but then it bec[omes] ... overwhelming.\" R. 354-55.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Once she becomes overwhelmed, Ms. Urena stated that she \"get[s] anxiety and panic attacks,\" which she said would scare her coworkers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 354-55. Ms. Urena also stated that her fears of blacking out and hurting someone have caused her to be afraid to leave the house, and to call into work to say that she cannot go. R. 364.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Ms. Urena testified that in a typical day, she would attend appointments, talk with her son, prepare his dinner, and watch television. R. 355. She stated that she does her laundry at home, and goes food shopping with a friend. R. 356. She testified that she does not go food shopping alone because \"it's too crowded,\" and she does not like being in crowds. R. 356. For transportation, Ms. Urena testified that she takes taxis when she can afford it but will take buses when she cannot. R. 356. She testified that she leaves extra time to wait for an empty bus to arrive when she is traveling, and will not take trains because they are too crowded. R. 356-57. She testified that she sews to pass the time, R. 358, and that she is involved with her son's activities, but has to \"force\" herself to be involved because she will not allow him to\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   her in a depressed state, R. 359-60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Ms. Urena testified that she takes Zoloft, Lamictal, Atarax, and Topamax, for her anxiety, R. 357, and attends therapy twice a month at Montefiore Medical Center, R. 357-58. She sees a psychiatrist every two months for medication refills. R. 358. Ms. Urena states that she does not sleep well, and at the time of the hearing could sleep straight for three hours due to drowsiness being a side effect of one of her medications. R. 358-59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A vocational expert testified during Ms. Urena's hearing by telephone.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 361. The ALJ asked the vocational expert hypothetical questions about an individual of Ms. Urena's age and with her educational background, and asked the vocational expert to assume that the hypothetical individual \"is capable of performing simple routine tasks- ... one to two-step tasks at all exertional levels,\" and that the hypothetical individual could \"have occasional contact with co-workers and supervisors but no direct work-related contact with the public.\" R. 362. Further, the ALJ instructed the vocational expert to assume that the individual could \"work around others but not on teams or in collaboration with others,\" and could \"make simple decisions and adapt to occasional changes in essential work tasks.\" R. 362. The vocational expert opined that such an individual could performs the jobs of cleaner, of which there were 100,000 jobs in the national economy; mail clerk, of which there were 120,000 jobs in the national economy; and document preparer, of which there were 80,000 jobs in the national economy. R. 362. The ALJ then asked the vocational expert to further assume that \"the individual would miss two or more days of work per month on a regular and recurring basis because of anxiety.\" R. 362-63. In that case, the vocational expert concluded that \"there would be no jobs for this individual.\" R. 363.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   D. The ALJ's Decision\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The ALJ concluded that Ms. Urena was not disabled, as defined in the Social Security Act, from August 31, 2010, through the date of the decision. R. 337. The ALJ found that Ms. Urena met the insured status requirements of the Social Security Act through December 31, 2013, R. 330, and that while she had worked since August 31, 2010, her post-alleged onset date earnings did not meet the applicable substantial gainful activity threshold, R. 331. Accordingly, the ALJ concluded that Ms. Urena had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since the alleged onset date. R. 331. The ALJ next found that Ms. Urena had the following severe impairments: 1) adjustment disorder with anxiety ; 2) bipolar disorder ; 3) panic disorder ; 4) anxiety disorder, not otherwise specified; and 5) substance abuse disorder, in sustained full remission. R. 331. Upon reviewing several physical conditions reflected in the record, the ALJ concluded that none of these caused more than minimal functional limitations. R. 331. In reaching this decision, the ALJ noted that Ms. Urena did not allege disabling physical impairments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 331.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The ALJ next considered the severity of Ms. Urena's mental impairments, singly and in combination, in order to determine whether Ms. Urena had an impairment listed in Appendix 1 of the regulations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 331-33. In reaching her conclusion, the ALJ considered whether Ms. Urena's severe mental impairments met the \"paragraph B\" criteria of Listing 12.04, depressive, bipolar and related disorders; or Listing 12.06, anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorders.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   R. 331-33;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   20\n   C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 1 \u00a7 12.00(A). To meet those criteria, a claimant must show that the mental impairments result in at least one extreme or two marked limitations\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   in each of four broad areas of functioning, which are \"[u]nderstand, remember, or apply information; interact with others; concentrate, persist, or maintain pace; and adapt and manage oneself.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 12.00(A)(2)(b);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 331-32. The ALJ concluded that the impairments resulted in no limitations on Ms. Urena's ability to understand, remember, or apply information, R. 332; moderate limitations on Ms. Urena's ability to interact with others,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   R. 332; moderate limitations on Ms. Urena's ability to concentrate, persist, or maintain pace, R. 332; and moderate limitations on Ms. Urena's ability to manage herself, R. 332-33. In reaching these conclusions, the ALJ explicitly considered Ms. Urena's hearing testimony, progress notes from Ms. Urena's treating physicians at Montefiore Medical Center, and reports from state agency consultative examinations. R. 332-33. The ALJ further concluded that the evidence failed to establish the presence of \"paragraph C\" criteria, R. 333, indicating a \"serious and persistent mental disorder[ ].\" 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 1 \u00a7 12.00(A)(2)(c). Accordingly, the ALJ concluded that Ms. Urena did not have an impairment that meets or medically equals one of the impairments listed in the Appendix.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 331-33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The ALJ next assessed Ms. Urena's residual functional capacity (\"RFC\"). R. 333-36. The ALJ concluded that Ms. Urena had the RFC to perform less than the full range of work at all exertional levels. R. 333. Specifically, the ALJ found that: 1) Ms. Urena can perform simple, routine, one to two step tasks; 2) that she can tolerate occasional contact with coworkers and supervisors, but no direct work-related contact with the public; 3) that she can work around others, but not on teams or in collaboration with others; and 4) that she can make simple decisions and adapt to occasional changes in essential work tasks. R. 333. In reaching these conclusions, the ALJ found that while Ms. Urena's \"medically determinable impairments could reasonably be expected to cause some of the alleged symptoms ..., [her] statements concerning the intensity, persistence and limiting effects of these symptoms are not\n   entirely consistent with the medical evidence and other evidence in the record.\" R. 334.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The ALJ noted that she gave \"limited weight to the assessments\" of two treating sources, Dr. G. Blass and Ms. Beverly Punter-Knox, because their opinions were \"conclusory\" and were at odds with other evidence in the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 335. The ALJ gave more weight to the evaluations of Drs. Michael Kushner, Ruby Phillips, and Joseph G. Vitolo because they were \"generally consistent with the medical evidence.\" R. 335. The ALJ concluded by finding that, based on the vocational expert's testimony, Ms. Urena was \"capable of making a successful adjustment to other work that exists in significant numbers in the national economy\" accounting for her \"age, education, work experience, and residual functional capacity.\" R. 337. Accordingly, the ALJ concluded that Ms. Urena was not disabled.

Indeed, Ms. Urena's medical records show that this condition is managed with medication.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 510, 514 (Montefiore record from June 2015 noting that Ms. Urena takes synthroid for hypothyroidism and is \"[a]symptomatic\"). Based on information contained in Ms. Urena's records from Lincoln Medical Center and Montefiore Hospital, the ALJ concluded that Ms. Urena's left 5th finger tendon injury and daily headaches did not last the required 12 months or longer. R. 331. This conclusion is supported by Ms. Urena's hospital records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 149-99 (documenting finger injury and healing progress);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    565-67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (documenting headaches). With respect to Ms. Urena's knee pain, the ALJ noted that \"the record is\n   absent an associated diagnosis\" and that \"an April 2014 knee x-ray was unremarkable.\" R. 331. The ALJ did not address Dr. Gino Zunino's report that Ms. Urena had knee pain that affected her ability to work and required exertional limitations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 331;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   R. 264 (noting that Ms. Urena reported to Dr. Zunino that she \"is not physically ... able to work at this time\" in part because she experiences \"pains to both knees\").

The ALJ first determined that Ms. Urena had five medically-determinable severe mental impairments : 1) adjustment disorder with anxiety ; 2) bipolar disorder ; 3) panic disorder ; 4) anxiety disorder, not otherwise specified; and 5) substance abuse disorder, in sustained full remission. R. 331. These findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record, which the ALJ pointed to in her decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 331-332 (citing R. 200-31, 232-365, 492-500).

However, the ALJ also noted that \"mental status examinations of record did not reveal cognitive abnormalities.\" R. 332. The ALJ cited two consultative reports conducted by Dr. Kushner on August 17, 2012, R. 232, and Dr. Phillips on April 1, 2016, R. 492-500. Dr. Kushner concluded that Ms. Urena's \"ability to maintain attention and concentration may be mildly impaired,\" R. 235, but also noted that this might be the result of \"anxiety in the evaluation,\" R. 234. He concluded that her recent and remote memory skills were \"generally intact,\" based on memory tests performed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 234. Dr. Kushner further concluded that Ms. Urena could \"follow and understand simple directions or instructions\" and could \"perform simple tasks independently.\" R. 235. He also noted that Ms. Urena could \"maintain a regular schedule[,] ... learn new tasks[,] ... perform complex tasks under supervision[, and] ... make appropriate decisions.\" R. 235. Dr. Phillips' conclusions were largely the same.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 492-500. She concluded that Ms. Urena was \"[m]ildly limited in the ability to maintain attention and concentration,\" \"[m]ildly limited in the ability to relate adequately with others,\" and \"[m]oderately limited in the ability to deal appropriately with stress.\" R. 495. However, Dr. Philips also concluded that Ms. Urena had no limitation in her ability to follow and understand simple directions and instructions, to perform simple tasks independently, to maintain a regular schedule, learn new tasks, to perform complex tasks independently, or to make appropriate decisions. R. 494-95. Further, Dr. Phillips concluded that Ms. Urena's recent and remote memory skills were \"[i]ntact,\" based on tests of her memory functioning. R. 494. The ALJ also cited to Ms. Urena's Montefiore Medical Center records, which consistently indicate that Ms. Urena's thought process was linear, her thought content unremarkable, her insight and judgment good, and her perception unremarkable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 200-31. Finally, the ALJ noted that Ms. Urena acknowledged that she was able to cook, perform housework, take public buses when not crowded, shop with assistance, and work as a housekeeper and tax preparer, R. 332, matters that\n   are in fact documented in the record,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 352-57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The ALJ found that Ms. Urena had \"moderate limitations\" with respect to interacting with others. R. 332. The ALJ considered Ms. Urena's allegations of \"panic symptoms triggered by crowds and loud noise,\" and noted that \"[p]rogress notes reflect complaints of ongoing anxiety and intermittent findings of depressed/anxious affect.\" R. 332. However, the ALJ also considered that Ms. Urena \"consistently indicated that she socialized with family and maintained good relationships,\" that \"mental status examinations did not generally reveal behavioral abnormities [sic],\" and that \"state agency consultative examinations did not reveal more than moderate restriction in the claimant's ability to relate adequately with others.\" R. 332. These findings are supported by the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 200-31 (progress notes from Beverly Punter-Knox, LCSW, consistently indicating a normal mental status exam, and frequently noting that Ms. Urena has a supportive family); R. 235 (report of state consultative examiner Dr. Michael Kushner finding that Ms. Urena's \"ability to relate adequately with others ... may be impaired by psychological symptoms\" but that these symptoms \"do not appear to be significant enough to interfere with the claimant's ability to function on a daily basis\"); R. 495 (report of state consultative examiner Dr. Ruby Phillips, finding Ms. Urena \"[m]ildly limited in the ability to relate adequately with others\"). In her submission, Ms. Urena states that due to her anxiety and panic attacks, she \"cannot even enjoy [f]amily gatherings.\" Pl. Decl. at 2. However, this assertion is consistent with the ALJ's finding, supported by the record, that Ms. Urena in fact has \"moderate limitations\" with respect to interacting with others. Accordingly, the ALJ's conclusion that Ms. Urena experienced only moderate limitations in her ability to interact with others was supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   With respect to \"concentrating, persisting, or maintaining pace,\" the ALJ concluded that Ms. Urena has \"moderate limitations.\" R. 332. The ALJ considered Ms. Urena's complaints of \"daily panic symptoms, concentration deficits, and memory deficits,\" her allegations that \"she is sometimes unable to leave the house due to a fear of blacking out and hurting someone,\" and that she was unable to work in a noisy office environment. R. 332. However, the ALJ gave greater weight to Ms. Urena's acknowledgment of her ability to cook, perform housework, take public buses when not crowded, shop with assistance, and work as a housekeeper and tax preparer, R. 332, which Ms. Urena testified to during the hearing, R. 352-57. The ALJ also correctly noted that \"examinations of record did not generally reveal more than mild concentration deficits.\" R. 332. For example, state agency consultative examiner Dr. Kushner found that Ms. Urena was \"[o]nly mildly impaired, possibly due to anxiety in the evaluation\" with respect to her attention and concentration. R. 234. State agency consultative examiner Dr. Phillips found that Ms. Urena's attention and concentration were only \"[m]ildly impaired due to anxiety.\" R. 494. Similarly, progress notes from Montefiore Medical Center frequently note that Ms. Urena's concentration and attention span were \"intact\" or normal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 505, 509, 740. Accordingly, the ALJ's conclusion was supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The ALJ found that Ms. Urena experienced \"moderate limitations\" with respect to \"adapting and managing [herself].\" R. 332-33. The ALJ considered that progress notes revealed \"some increased symptoms in response to stressors,\" Ms. Urena's statements that she is \"sometimes unable to leave the house due to a fear of blacking\n   out and hurting someone,\" and Ms. Urena's statements that she was unable to work when the office was noisy. R. 332-33. However, the ALJ gave greater weight to evidence showing that Ms. Urena was \"compliant with treatment and attended scheduled appointments,\" and had the ability to \"cook, perform housework, take public buses when not crowded, and shop with assistance,\" in addition to working as a housekeeper and tax preparer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   R. 333.

[and] manages her own money and is able to take public transportation\"). Accordingly, the ALJ's determination that Ms. Urena faced only moderate limitations in this area is supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Because Ms. Urena's mental impairments did not result in at least two \"marked limitations,\" or one \"extreme\" limitation, the ALJ could properly find that the \"paragraph B\" criteria were not satisfied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    The ALJ Properly Determined Ms. Urena's Mental Residual Functional Capacity\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   At step four of the five-step inquiry, the ALJ considered whether despite Ms. Urena's severe impairments, she had the RFC to perform past work. The ALJ concluded that Ms. Urena \"is unable to perform any past relevant work,\" but noted that \"[a] specific finding as to the claimant's ability to perform her past relevant work is not necessary\" because \"all potentially applicable Medical-Vocational Guidelines would direct a finding of 'not disabled' given [Ms. Urena's] age, education, and residual functional capacity.\" R. 336. The ALJ concluded that Ms. Urena had \"the residual functional capacity:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   to perform less than the full range of work at all exertional levels but with the\n   following non-exertional limitations: she can perform simple, routine, one to two step tasks.

R. 335. The ALJ noted that Dr. Kushner and Dr. Philips \"both concluded that [Ms. Urena] would be able to perform simple and complex tasks, maintain a regular schedule, learn new tasks, and make appropriate decisions with only mild limitations in her ability to maintain attention/concentration.\" R. 335.

Unlike the conclusions reached by Dr. Blass and Ms. Punter-Knox, the ALJ noted that the opinions of the state agency consultative examiners were not \"conclusory\" but rather were based on \"essentially\n   unremarkable mental status examinations ....\" R. 335;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 234 (report of Dr. Kusnher, noting in mental status examination that Ms. Urena's \"[d]emeanor and responsiveness to questions was cooperative\" and her \"[m]anner of relating, social skills, and overall presentation were adequate\"); R. 493 (report of Dr. Phillips, noting in mental status examination, that Ms. Urena's \"demeanor was cooperative and anxious\" and her \"manner of relating was adequate\"). The ALJ also noted that Dr. Vitolo concluded, based on Ms. Urena's \"retained activities of daily living, her positive response to treatment, and the generally unremarkable mental status examinations of record despite occasional episodes of increased symptoms associated with increased stress,\" that Ms. Urena had \"no more than moderate work-related mental restrictions,\" and \"would be able to engage in substantial gainful activity that involved simple repetitive tasks, one to two step commands, and occasional social contact.\" R. 335 (citing R. 725). Accordingly, the ALJ could properly accord greater weight to the opinions of Drs.

The ALJ recognized that \"[t]he record ... documents complaints of disturbed sleep, diminished appetite, dysphoric moods, concentration deficits, memory deficits, and frequent anxiety attacks triggered by crowds on trains, in elevators, and in waiting rooms.\" R. 334. Nonetheless, the ALJ concluded that while Ms. Urena's \"medically determinable impairments could reasonably be expected to cause some of the alleged symptoms ... the claimant's statements concerning the intensity, persistence and limiting effects of these symptoms are not entirely consistent with the medical evidence and other evidence in the record ....\" R. 334.

The ALJ noted that Ms. Urena acknowledged the ability to cook, perform housework, take public buses when not crowded, and shop with assistance. R. 334. In addition, the ALJ cited Ms. Urena's testimony that she was able to work as a housekeeper and a tax preparer when she was in a quiet environment. R. 334. Further, the ALJ noted that Ms. Urena did not initiate treatment until October 2011, over a year after the alleged onset date, and that her progress reports were indicative of only \"moderate symptoms\" between May 2012 and July 2012. R. 334. The ALJ also noted that Ms. Urena's symptoms were responsive to medication. R. 334. On the basis of this information in the record, the ALJ discounted Ms. Urena's statements regarding the \"intensity, persistence, and limiting effects\" of her symptoms. R. 334.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The record supports the ALJ's findings. For example, in November 2016, while Ms. Urena was taking Zoloft for \"generalized anxiety disorder,\" she reported that anxiety was \"not a problem.\" R. 734. In December 2015, she also reported that she did not feel nervous or anxious. R. 556, 562. Treatment records repeatedly reported\n   that she was of \"euthymic\" (that is normal) mood. R. 205, 212, 214, 216, 221, 224-26, 228-30. In August 2012, Ms. Urena reported to Dr. Kushner that she \"socialize[s]\" and has a \"good family relationship[ ] with her sister.\" R. 235. In October 2013, Ms. Urena reported to a social worker that she socialized with family and friends every day. R. 260.
