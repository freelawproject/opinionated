McFADDEN, U.S.D.J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Few ideas are more central to the American political tradition than the doctrine of separation of powers. Our Founders emerged from the Revolution determined to establish a government incapable of repeating the tyranny from which the Thirteen Colonies escaped. They did so by splitting power across three branches of the federal government and by providing each the tools required to preserve control over its functions. The \"great security against a gradual concentration of the several powers in the same department,\" James Madison explained, \"consists in giving to those who administer each department the necessary constitutional means and personal motives to resist encroachments of the others.\"\n   <em>\n    The Federalist No. 51\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This is a case about whether one chamber of Congress has the \"constitutional means\" to conscript the Judiciary in a political turf war with the President over the implementation of legislation. The U.S. House of Representatives seeks to enjoin the Secretaries and Departments of the Treasury, Defense, Homeland Security, and the Interior (collectively, the \"Administration\") from spending certain funds to build a wall along our southern border. The House argues that this expenditure would violate the Appropriations Clause of the Constitution and usurp Congress's authority. This harm, the House suggests, constitutes an \"institutional injury\" supporting Article III standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Administration disagrees. The Judiciary cannot reach the merits of this dispute, it contends, because the Constitution grants the House no standing to litigate these claims. The Administration is correct. The \"complete independence\" of the Judiciary is \"peculiarly essential\" under\n   our Constitutional structure, and this independence requires that the courts \"take no active resolution whatever\" in political fights between the other branches.\n   <em>\n    See The Federalist No. 78\n   </em>\n   (Alexander Hamilton). And while the Constitution bestows upon Members of the House many powers, it does not grant them standing to hale the Executive Branch into court claiming a dilution of Congress's legislative authority. The Court therefore lacks jurisdiction to hear the House's claims and will deny its motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The House and the President have been engaged in a protracted public fight over funding for the construction of a barrier along the border with Mexico. Following the longest partial shutdown of the Federal Government in history, Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019 (the \"CAA\"), which provided $ 1.375 billion for new border fencing in the Rio Grande Valley.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pub. L. No. 116-6 (2019). The President had sought much more.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter from Acting Dir., Office of Mgmt. &amp; Budget to Senate Comm. On Appropriations (Jan. 6, 2019) (requesting \"$ 5.7 billion for construction of a steel barrier for the Southwest border\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On the same day he signed the CAA into law, President Donald Trump declared that \"a national emergency exists at the southern border of the United States.\" Proclamation No. 9844,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Fed.%20Reg.%204949\">\n    84 Fed.

Rec. S1882 (Mar. 14, 2019). Explaining the vote, Speaker Nancy Pelosi remarked that \"[w]e would be delinquent in our duties as Members of Congress if we did not overturn what the President is proposing. He is asking each and every one of us to turn our backs on the oath of office that we took to the Constitution of the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Speaker Pelosi's Floor Speech on Privileged Resolution, House of Representatives (Feb. 27, 2019).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The President vetoed the resolution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Veto Message to the House of Representatives for H.J.

For the override to be operative, the Senate would have also had to vote to support it by a super-majority. It did not attempt to do so. So the \"veto of the President was sustained and the joint resolution was rejected.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Fed.%20Reg.%204949\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The House then filed this suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Upon a declaration of a national emergency \"that requires the use of armed forces,\" the Secretary of Defense \"may authorize the Secretaries of the military departments to undertake military construction projects, not otherwise authorized\n   by law that are necessary to support such use of the armed forces.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202808\">\n    10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

But whatever these cases may suggest about the House's ability to hale the Executive into court in the context of investigations, or the scope of this ability, they are of little use to the House here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Indeed, using the Judiciary to vindicate the House's investigatory power is constitutionally distinct from seeking Article III standing for a supposed harm to Congress's Appropriations power. Unlike the Appropriations power, which requires bicameralism and presentment, the investigatory power is one of the few under the Constitution that\n   <em>\n    each\n   </em>\n   House of Congress\n   may exercise individually.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. Const. art.

In 1927, for instance, the Supreme Court observed that a \"legislative body cannot legislate wisely or effectively in the absence of information respecting the conditions which the legislation is intended to affect or change.\"\n   <em>\n    McGrain v.
