That was an action to recover the amount of a note given for the purchase price of \u00e1 stove which the plaintiffs\u2019 agent sold and. delivered to the defendant in the town of Grand Isle. The plaintiffs resided in Middlebury, and the defendant resided in Alburg. The defendant pleaded in abatement that at the time of giving the note, and for a long time before, and ever after, the plaintiffs were engaged in the business of manufacturing stoves, and of transporting the same to various parts of the State for sale as an article of merchandise; that the plaintiffs in the course of their said business sent a quantity of stoves to Grand Isle to be there sold and disposed of by their agent, authorized for that purpose; that the defendant purchased the stove, for which said note was given, of the plaintiffs\u2019 said agent at Grand Isle, and that the same was there delivered to him. The plaintiffs replied that the stove for which the note was given was not purchased by the defendant of any agent of the plaintiffs to whom a quantity of stoves had been sent or transported, or who had a quantity of the plaintiffs\u2019 stoves for sale in the Town of Grand.Isle. To this replication the defendant demurred. In disposing of the case thus presented, the Court said: \u201cAlthough the conditions of the provision are somewhat general, yet the reason and object of it confine it to cases, where a person opens a shop, or establishes business in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>town, as dealer or trader in goods, wares and merchandise. * * * The act applies to a sale made by one who has thus established and carried on business in a town * * * and was never intended to apply to a single act of selling on a particular occasion by one who did not use or follow the trade of vending goods, wares and merchandise, or if he did, was only transiently in the town in which the sale was made and had no established business there. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">' While that case presented an instance of a single sale on a particular occasion, yet the language of the Court indicates that it did not consider that those facts alone were determinative. <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Hazen, </em>25 Vt. 178, is to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">The object of this statute is confined to instances where the vendor opens a shop or store, or establishes a business in the town where the sale is made <em>as a dealer in goods, wares and merchandise, </em>and to peddlers going from town to town, as was held by this Court in <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>41 Vt. 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">The facts in the case at bar do not show that the plaintiff had established business in Westminster as a dealer in goods, wares and merchandise. The mere sale of crops received in lieu of rent, whether sold to one person or to several, at private sale or at public auction, and even though like sales may have taken place on several previous occasions, does not establish the vendor in business as a dealer or trader in goods, wares and merchandise, and does not take the case out of the general provisions of the statutes directing where justice suits shall be made returnable.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
