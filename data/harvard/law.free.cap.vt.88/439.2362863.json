It is plain enough from the opinion handed down by us when the case was here before, that the assertion that the county owns the land on which the courthouse stands is wholly incorrect. This statement. is contrary to the holding, and should be eliminated from the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">It is equally plain that the provision regarding the occupancy of the land for county purposes, which might include purposes not contemplated when the dedication was made, is too broad, and should be so restricted as to provide for a reversion if the county should cease to occupy the land for a courthouse site.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">The suggestion that these questions are purely academic and could not endanger the rights of the orator are of no force, since it is now a question of compliance with a mandate. See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>82 Vt. 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">\n<em>Decree reversed and cause remanded that the decree may be made to conform to the mandate in the particulars herein named.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
