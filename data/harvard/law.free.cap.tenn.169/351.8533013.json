The decisions elsewhere are in conflict. They are collected in notes, 17 A. L. R., 1197, 61 A. L. R., 1197, and 90 A. L. R., 1387. A review of these authorities is not necessary, since repeated decisions of this court have indicated the limits of coverage given in this jurisdiction to a policy insuring against death resulting from accidental means.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">In <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Fidelity &amp; Casualty </em>Co., 133 Tenn., 672, 182 S. W., 252, L. R. A., 1916D, 536, Ann. Cas., 1917A, 86, it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-10\">\u201cThe general rule is that an injury is not produced by accidental means, within the meaning of this policy, where the injury is the natural result of an act or acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>in which the insured intentionally engages. A person may do certain acts the result of which produces unforeseen consequences resulting in what is termed an accident; yet it does not come within the terms of this contract. The policy does not insure, against an injury that may be caused by a voluntary, natural, ordinary movement, executed exactly as was intended. Therefore, to determine the matter, we look, not to the result merely, but to the means producing the result. It is not sufficient that the injury be unusual and unexpected, but the cause itself must have been unexpected and accidental. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-3\">The foregoing was quoted and approved in <em>Ramsey </em>v. <em>Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co., </em>143 Tenn., 42, 223 S. W., 841, 13 A. L. R., 651, and the rule announced again recognized in <em>McFarland </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bonding &amp; Ins. Co., </em>157 Tenn., 254, 8 S. W. (2d), 369, 64 A. L. R., 962.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><em>Hahn </em>v. <em>Home Life Ins. Co. of N. Y., </em>169 Tenn., 232, 84 S. <em>W. </em>(2d), 361, is not at all in conflict. That was a case of death from ptomaine poisoning. Tainted food was the means of death. The intention of the insured was to eat wholesome food. His eating poison food was accidental.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The declaration here avers that the injury that occasioned insured\u2019s death was \u201cunforeseen, unexpected, fortuitous, and accidenta:!.\u201d See <em>Hartford Accident, etc., Co. </em>v. <em>Hay, </em>159 Tenn., 202, 17 S. W. (2d), 904. There is no averment that the external means \u2014 the heat present in a Tennessee boiler room as of July 24 \u2014 was unforeseen, unexpected, or unusual. Nor is there any averment that the insured\u2019s exposure to the means\u2014 his firing the boiler \u2014 was anything but an intentional act.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>Although, recognizing the 'force of the contrary contentions, we feel, that our previous decisions require an affirmance of the court below. It may be added that the Supreme Court \u00a1of the United States has quite \u25a0recently held that a death from sunstroke, the exposure of deceased being voluntary, was not a death from accidental means, that court taking the distinction between accidental means and accidental result long since adopted in this jurisdiction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The decisions in workmen\u2019s compensation cases may be left out of consideration. Under that statute (Code 1932, section 6851 et seq.), the employer is liable for \u25a0injuries from accidents to employees arising out of and in the course of their employment. The statute is concerned to afford protection against accidental results. In the sense of the statute, broadly speaking, the employment itself is the means of the accident and the employment, of course, is never accidental.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b386-7\"> See Landress v.
