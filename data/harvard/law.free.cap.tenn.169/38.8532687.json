The amount of compensation is to he determined upon reference as to what would he reasonable remuneration for .counsel in a proceeding in which the infant is made a defendant and a guardian <em>ad litem </em>appointed to represent him. In determining the amount of fees, the relationship of counsel and the infant is an antagonistic one. See <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Vaughn, supra; Rowling </em>v. <em>Scales, </em>1 Tenn. Ch., 618; Gibson\u2019s Suits in Chancery (Chambliss Ed.), see. 106.

If desired, an order may be entered remanding the case to the circuit court for a reference as to fees, with leave to counsel to file\u2019 a petition in that court making the infant a defendant thereto, and, upon the forthcoming- of the answer of the guardian <em>ad litem, </em>the case may be referred to the clerk for proof and a report.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">This court is without jurisdiction to determine the matter presented in the petition; hence it will be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
