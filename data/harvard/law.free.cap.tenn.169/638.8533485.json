For the purposes of this opinion, we may omit consideration of that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">The deceased was seventeen years of age at the time he' is said to have met with the accident. He was employed in the defendant\u2019s stockyards and it is averred that he was kicked on the leg by a cow, while driving cattle into a pen, in December, 1934. Evidence introduced by petitioner tends to show that the kick of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>animal made a bruised place on the boy\u2019s leg, that the limb began to pain bim, and that he began limping just after receiving the blow. The boy\u2019s leg continued to hurt him and he continued to limp, but neither he nor his mother seems to have regarded his condition serious. He kept on working.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Some time in the spring of 1935 the deceased went to a negro called \u201cDoc\u201d and took some electrical treatments. The mother does not know who \u201cDoc\u201d was, whether he was a licensed physician or not. Thereafter the young man went to a chiropractor and took some treatments. His mother from time to time bathed his leg with hot water.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">The boy\u2019s leg steadily grew worse, and in April, 1935, he went to the Greneral Hospital. During April, 1935, defendant\u2019s manager learned of the boy\u2019s condition, the boy having quit work, and defendant\u2019s manager, in company with an attorney for defendant\u2019s insurer, called on the mother, and, after obtaining her permission, removed the boy from the Greneral Hospital to St. Thomas Hospital, where it was thought he would have better treatment. An operation was performed on the boy\u2019s leg. The bone was found to be in bad condition, fever followed, and complications described in the record by medical terms, and death resulted in July, 1935.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">No officer or superior servant of the defendant had any knowledge that an accident had happened to the young man, or that there was such a claim, until April, 1935. According to petitioner\u2019s evidence, the boy undertook to conceal his disability from his employer, fearing he would lose his job if the employer learned of any physical incapacity. It further appears from evidence introduced by petitioner that the boy, when asked by persons at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>the stockyard about his lameness, replied that he had rheumatism.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">The testimony of Dr. Brower, speaking from X-ray pictures made of the boy\u2019s leg\u2019 at the hospital and from the history of the case, tends to show that proper medical treatment and advice in the beginning of the boy\u2019s trouble would have prevented serious consequences. The defendant insists that it is absolved of any liability herein by reason of the failure of the young\u2019 man to give the notice of injury, within thirty days after the occurrence of the accident, as prescribed by Code, sections 6872, 6873. Dr. Brower\u2019s testimony shows rather clearly that the employer was prejudiced by failure to receive such notice, if liability exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">The petitioner insists that her son having been under eighteen years of age at the time of the accident was relieved of the obligation as to notice imposed by the sections of the Code just mentioned. This contention cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Code, section 6872, exacts this notice of \u201cevery injured employee or his representative . . . unless reasonable excuse for failure to give such notice is made to the satisfaction of the tribunal to which the claim for compensation may be presented.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">Code, section 6852 (b), provides that \u201c \u2018employee\u2019 shall include every person, including a minor, in the service of an employer,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">These two statutory provisions mean that every employee must give the prescribed notice and that one in the service of an employer, although he be a minor, is still an employee.'</p>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">There is nothing in the record indicating that the deceased was illegally employed under the child labor stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>utes, Code, section 5314 et seq. There is an intimation in <em>Western Union Telegraph Co. </em>v. <em>Ausbrooks, </em>148 Tenn., 615, 257 S. W., 858, 33 A. L. R., 330, that, although a minor was illegally employed, his representative after an accident resulting in his death might elect to ratify the contract and recover under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. Such an observation, however, was <em>dictum </em>in that case and is beside the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">In <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Coal </em>&amp; <em>Iron Corp., </em>151 Tenn., 132, 268 S.W., 377, it was expressly decided that a minor employee over eighteen years of age was bound by the statutory provision above quoted as to notice. It was inadvertently suggested that such statutory notice would not be required of an infant employee under eighteen years of age. The rights of no employee under eighteen years of age were before the court for consideration in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\"><em> </em>We have heretofore shown from the statute that the notice is exacted of every employee and that, although a minor, such an employee is still an employee. A recovery under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act is a recovery obtained as under contract. The statute imposes its terms upon such contracts of employment as it covers. So, when a minor, or his representative, sues under the workmen\u2019s compensation statute, the burdens of that statute cannot be escaped. This minor\u2019s contract of employment was voidable only. When the minor\u2019s representative affirmed the contract and sought its benefit, such representative ratified the contract as a whole with all its obligations. This principle finds frequent application in cases which -apply the contract limitations of insurance policies to minors. <em>Heilig </em>v. <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co., </em>152 N. C., 358, 67 S. E., 927, 20 Ann. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>Cas., 1290; <em>Mead </em>v. <em>Phoenix Ins. Co., </em>68 Kan., 432, 75 P., 475, 64 L. R. A., 79, 104 Am. St. Rep., 412; <em>Suggs </em>v. <em>Travelers\u2019 Ins. Co., </em>71 Tex., 579, 9 S. W., 676, 1 L. R. A., 847.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-3\">The petitioner relies on <em>McClain </em>v. <em>Kingsport Imp. Corp., </em>147 Tenn., 130, 245 S. W., 837, in which it was held that minor dependents, nnder sixteen years of age, prior to the appointment of a guardian, were not bound by the provisions of Code, section 6872, as to notice. This conclusion necessarily followed from the terms of the statute. The notice is required of \u201cevery injured employee or his representative\u201d under Code, section 6872. Code, section 6852 (b), provides \u201cany reference herein to an employee who has been injured shall, when the employee is dead, also include his legal representatives, dependents and other persons to whom compensation may be payable under this chapter.\u201d The minors in <em>McClain </em>v. <em>Kingsport Imp. Corp., </em>had no legal representative for more than thirty days after the accident and, being dependents under eighteen years of age (Code, section 6858), compensation could not have been paid to them directly and there was no person \u201cto whom compensation may be payable\u201d until a guardian was appointed.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">No valid reason for the failure on the part of this young man to give the employer notice of the accident he is said to have sustained is apparent on the record before us. The boy kept on with his work for some months, and, as heretofore stated, seemed to have made an effort to conceal his injury rather than to inform the employer thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\"><em> </em>We do not see how any waiver of its right to notice can be asserted against the employer here. True, the employer undertook to look after the boy when his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>condition was learned. The employer seems to have paid the hospital hill, the doctor\u2019s bill and funeral expenses. All these things, however, were done long after the thirty days provided for notice expired. The employer was discharged at the time of the acts relied on as a waiver. Neither the employee nor his mother was prejudicially misled. Any right to compensation had been lost by the failure to give notice. There was no ground upon which to base an estoppel as in most of the cases upon which petitioner relies. Neither was there any consideration for the alleged waiver. Ordinarily, to constitute the waiver of a condition of a contract, there must be a consideration or an element of estoppel. <em>American Central Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>McCrea, Maury </em>&amp; <em>Co., </em>76 Tenn. (8 Lea), 513, 41 Am. Rep., 647; <em>Dale </em>v. <em>Continental Ins. Co., </em>95 Tenn., 38, 31 S. W., 266.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
