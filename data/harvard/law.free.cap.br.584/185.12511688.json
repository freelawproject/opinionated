PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. The 2006 Foreclosure Action and the 2007 Chapter 13 Case\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On August 7, 2002, the Debtors executed the Note and Mortgage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Jt. Stips. \u00b6 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Debtors defaulted on their monthly payments on the Note. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.) After the Debtors defaulted on the Note, BONY accelerated the Note and initiated a foreclosure action on December 20, 2006 (\"2006 Foreclosure Action\") in the Trumbull County, Ohio Court of Common Pleas (\"State Court\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The current bankruptcy case is the second chapter 13 case filed by the Debtors. They previously filed a chapter 13 bankruptcy petition on April 30, 2007, which was denominated Case No. 07-40993 (\"2007 Case\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The chapter 13 plan in the 2007 Case (2007 Case, Doc. 2) provided for the Debtors to make regular payments directly to Homecomings Financial Network on the Note and Mortgage on their Residence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   BONY filed a proof of claim in the 2007 Case, which was denominated Claim No. 6-1 in the total secured amount of $80,241.54 with $8,709.06 listed as the pre-petition arrearage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.) Claim No. 6-1 was based on the Note and Mortgage. Notices relating to Claim No. 6-1 were to be sent to Homecomings Financial, LLC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Debtors' plan in the 2007 Case was confirmed on January 7, 2008 (2007 Case, Doc. 29). On August 13, 2012, the Chapter 13 Trustee filed Notice of Final Cure Payment on Residential Mortgage regarding Claim No. 6-1 (2007 Case, Doc. 72). The Debtors received a discharge in the 2007 Case on September 12, 2012 (2007 Case, Doc. 75).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Approximately two months after the Debtors received their discharge in the 2007 Case, BONY filed Motion to Vacate Bankruptcy Stay in the 2006 Foreclosure Action to \"reinstate this case to the active docket and grant leave to continue with the prosecution of this case.\" (Jt. Stips. \u00b6 11; Mot. for S.J., Ex. B at 1.) The State Court granted BONY's motion and reinstated the 2006 Foreclosure Action. (Jt. Stips. \u00b6 12; Mot. for S.J., Ex. C.) During the pendency of the Debtors' 2007 Case, on June 25, 2007, the State Court issued a judgment of foreclosure (\"Foreclosure Judgment\") in the 2006 Foreclosure Action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Jt. Stips. \u00b6 7.) On December 21, 2012, BONY requested the State Court to issue an order of sale upon decree of foreclosure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Jt. Stips. \u00b6 13; Mot. for S.J., Ex. D.) On February 4, 2013, the State Court vacated the Praecipe For Order of Sale. (Jt. Stips. \u00b6 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On May 15, 2013, BONY moved to vacate the Foreclosure Judgment and dismiss the 2006 Foreclosure Action. (Mot. for S.J., Ex. E.) Five days later, the 2006 Foreclosure Action was dismissed without prejudice. (Jt. Stips. \u00b6 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. The 2015 Foreclosure Action and the 2017 Chapter 13 Case\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On April 9, 2015, BONY filed a foreclosure action in the State Court (\"2015 Foreclosure\n   Action\"), which sought to collect on the Note an unpaid principal balance of $67,508.91, but which reflected that the Debtors did not have any personal liability on the Note due to their bankruptcy discharge in the 2007 Case. (Jt. Stips. \u00b6 21.) On December 15, 2015, the Debtors made their third and last payment in the amount of $614.06 to BONY on a trial modification; the parties did not enter into a permanent loan modification. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Debtors filed a voluntary petition pursuant to chapter 13 of Title 11 on March 15, 2017 (\"Petition Date\"), which commenced the case that is currently before the Court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.) On July 26, 2017, BONY filed Claim 14 based on the Note and Mortgage, showing a principal balance of $67,207.03. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) Specialized Loan Servicing LLC (\"SLS\") is listed on Claim 14 as the party to which notices and payments should be sent. Claim 14 was filed as a secured claim and lists $46,062.47 as the amount necessary to cure any default as of the Petition Date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On September 15, 2017, the Debtors filed Objection to Claim Filed by The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (\"Claim Objection\") (Doc. 40).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Among the reasons the Debtors seek disallowance of Claim 14 is that Claim 14 is barred by the applicable statute of limitations, which is the only issue before this Court on summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On February 13, 2018, the Debtors, SLS, and BONY filed Joint Motion to Set an Evidentiary Hearing for Debtors [sic] Objection to Claim Number 14-1 (\"Joint Motion\") (Doc. 53), in which the parties requested the Court to set (i) a discovery deadline of March 19, 2018; and (ii) a date for an evidentiary hearing. The Court held hearings on the Claim Objection and Joint Motion on February 15, 2018, at which the Court granted the oral motion of counsel for the Debtors for leave to file a motion for summary judgment on the statute of limitations issue. Following those hearings, the court entered Amended Order Setting (i) Discovery Completion Date; and (ii) Evidentiary Hearing (Doc. 58), which set March 26, 2018 and April 16, 2018, respectively, as those dates. The Court also entered Order Setting Briefing Schedule (Doc. 59) regarding the Debtors' proposed motion for summary judgment. In accordance with that briefing schedule, the parties' respective motion and briefs are currently before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II.

ARGUMENTS OF THE PARTIES\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. The Debtors' Motion for Summary Judgment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Debtors argue that BONY cannot enforce the Note because the statute of limitations in O.R.C. \u00a7 1303.16(A) has expired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   BONY accelerated the Note after the Debtors defaulted. BONY filed the 2006 Foreclosure Action on December 20, 2006, alleging that the Note was in default as of August 1, 2006. (Jt. Stips. \u00b6 3; Mot. for S.J., Ex. A.) Because acceleration is a condition precedent to filing a foreclosure action, the Debtors contend that the Note was accelerated, at the latest, as of December 20, 2006-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the date BONY filed the 2006 Foreclosure Action. The Debtors argue that the statute of limitations is six years, as set forth in O.R.C. \u00a7 1303.16(A), which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [A]n action to enforce the obligation of a party to pay a note payable at a definite time shall be brought within six years after the due date or dates stated in the note or, if a due date is accelerated, within six years after the accelerated due date.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   O.R.C. \u00a7 1303.16(A) (2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Because the statute of limitations to enforce an accelerated note is six years from the date of acceleration, the Debtors argue that December 20, 2012 was the last date BONY could enforce the accelerated Note. (Mot. for S.J. at 6.) The Debtors further argue that Claim 14 must be disallowed because BONY dismissed the 2006 Foreclosure Action without prejudice and did not refile a foreclosure action within the one-year \"savings clause\" period in O.R.C. \u00a7 2305.19.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   BONY commenced the 2015 Foreclosure Action in April 2015-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , more than two years after expiration of the six-year statute of limitations in O.R.C. \u00a7 1303.16(A). Thus, the Debtors contend that (i) BONY cannot enforce the Note; and (ii) the 2015 Foreclosure Action is time-barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Debtors also argue that the default under the Note was never brought current in their 2007 Case. Moreover, the parties have stipulated that, at no time since the debt was accelerated (as of December 20, 2006) has the Note been simultaneously pre-petition and post-petition current. (Jt. Stips. \u00b6 25.) As further support for the Note never being brought current, the Debtors point to the actions BONY took to\n   reinstate the 2006 Foreclosure Action approximately two months after they received their discharge in the 2007 Case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Debtors quote a portion of the Mortgage, which provides that, under certain circumstances, the Debtors had the right to reinstate the Note after it had been accelerated. The Debtors had the right to reinstate the accelerated Note by:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (a) pay[ing] Lender all sums which then would be due under this Security Instrument and the Note as if no acceleration had occurred; (b) cur[ing] any default of any other covenants or agreements; (c) pay[ing] all expenses incurred in enforcing this Security Instrument, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees, property inspection and valuation fees, and other fees incurred for the purpose of protecting Lender's interest in the Property and rights under this Security Instrument....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   (Mortgage \u00b6 19.) Because the Note was never brought current, the Debtors contend that (i) the Note, by its terms, could not have been reinstated; and (ii) the original default that led to the 2006 acceleration of the Note has never been cured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Because the statute of limitations bars BONY from enforcing the Note, the Debtors argue that BONY is likewise prohibited from seeking to enforce the Mortgage, which is an incident to the Note. The Debtors state that BONY's only potential remedy is ejectment, which only concerns title to the property. (Mot. for S.J. at 6.) Thus, the Debtors reason that (i) BONY is barred by the statute of limitations from enforcing the Note; (ii) BONY is precluded from filing a foreclosure action to exercise its\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   remedies against the Debtors' Residence; and (iii) the Debtors have no personal liability on the Note as a result of their discharge in the 2007 Case. Consequently, the Debtors conclude that Claim 14 must be disallowed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. BONY's Response\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   BONY counters that the Motion for Summary Judgment should be denied for three reasons. First, BONY argues that, as a matter of law, a confirmed chapter 13 plan that provides for the cure of a pre-petition default and payment of a note de-accelerates a previously accelerated note. Because the Debtors' 2007 Case provided for the cure of the default and continued payment under the Note, BONY argues that the Note was de-accelerated. BONY represents that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201322\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(5) permits a debtor to cure the default amount through a chapter 13 plan and reinstate the payment schedules of a home mortgage note, notwithstanding the pre-petition acceleration of the mortgage debt. BONY further states that \"where the loan is de-accelerated, the statute of limitations stops until another acceleration letter is sent.\" (Resp. at 3 (citation omitted).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Second, notwithstanding de-acceleration of the Note in the 2007 Case, BONY argues that the Note was independently de-accelerated in 2013 when it was reinstated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) In support of this argument, BONY states that it \"sent a Letter [attached to the Response as Exhibit 1] stating that as of May 5, 2013, the debt was reinstated.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6 (citation omitted).) According to BONY, the letter indicates that the outstanding balance was no longer the entire amount of the debt-which BONY argues would be the case if the Note was in an accelerated status-but rather was only $18,413.83 for past due payments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) BONY argues that \"[w]here the debt is de-accelerated under this provision of the U.C.C. [ O.R.C. \u00a7 1303.16(A) ], the statute of limitations stops until another acceleration letter is sent, where the limitations period runs from the new acceleration date.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 (citation omitted).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Third, BONY explains that, although often filed simultaneously, an action in Ohio to foreclose a mortgage is separate and distinct from an action to collect the balance due on a promissory note. BONY contends that Ohio law holds that the six-year limitations period in O.R.C. \u00a7 1303.16 applies only to personal collection of a negotiable instrument and not to an\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   action on a mortgage, which is covered by the statute of limitations for contracts in O.R.C. \u00a7 2305.06.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   BONY postulates that, under the prevailing law in Ohio, even if collection on a note is time-barred under O.R.C. \u00a7 1303.16, enforcement of the mortgage is not. Thus, BONY concludes that, even if the last acceleration occurred in 2006, BONY is not time-barred under O.R.C. \u00a7 2305.06 from bringing an\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   action on the Mortgage; so Claim 14 is not time-barred. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   BONY finally argues that this Court should abstain from deciding this issue in order to avoid duplicative litigation, because (i) a central issue in the 2015 Foreclosure Action is whether the complaint is barred by the statute of limitations; and (ii) the 2015 Foreclosure Action was pending prior to the Debtors' filing this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. The Debtors' Reply\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In their Reply, the Debtors make an argument for imposition of judicial estoppel. Since the complaint in the 2006 Foreclosure Action was based on acceleration of the Note as of December 20, 2006, in seeking reinstatement of the 2006 Foreclosure Action, BONY represented to the State Court that the Note had been accelerated in 2006 and continued to be accelerated. The State Court relied on this representation in reinstating the 2006 Foreclosure Action to its active docket. Consequently, the Debtors assert that BONY is prohibited by judicial estoppel from taking a contrary position now regarding de-acceleration of the Note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Debtors also contend that the Note was not reinstated in May 2013. The Debtors reiterate their arguments that (i) the Note and Mortgage do not provide BONY with the unilateral right to reinstate the Note; and (ii) the Debtors never paid all sums and met all conditions precedent that would permit them to have the Note reinstated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Debtors further argue that BONY inaccurately represents the prevailing law in Ohio regarding the statute of limitations for enforcing a mortgage. Finally, the Debtors state that a decision by this Court that Claim 14 is barred by the statute of limitations will not result in inconsistent litigation because it will be\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   on the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     IV. LEGAL ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. BONY's Interest in the Mortgage Is Sufficient for Claim 14\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Court begins its analysis by examining the sufficiency of BONY's Claim 14. There is no dispute that the Debtors' personal liability on the Note was discharged in their 2007 Case, leaving BONY with recourse only against the Debtors' Residence, which is the security for the Mortgage. BONY's rights against the Debtors' Residence, however, are sufficient support for Claim 14.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   [W]e have no trouble concluding that a mortgage interest that survives the discharge of a debtor's personal liability is a \"claim\" within the terms of \u00a7 101(5).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   Even after the debtor's personal obligations have been extinguished, the mortgage holder still retains a \"right to payment\" in the form of its right to the proceeds from the sale of the debtor's property. Alternatively, the creditor's surviving right to foreclose on the mortgage can be viewed as a \"right to an equitable remedy\" for the debtor's default on the underlying obligation. Either way, there can be no doubt that the surviving mortgage interest corresponds to an \"enforceable obligation\" of the debtor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   The Court of Appeals thus erred in concluding that the discharge of petitioner's\n   <em>\n    personal liability\n   </em>\n   on his promissory notes constituted the complete termination of the Bank's\n   <em>\n    claim\n   </em>\n   against petitioner. Rather, a bankruptcy discharge extinguishes only one mode of enforcing a claim-namely, an action against the debtor\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   -while leaving intact another-namely, an action against the debtor\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   The conclusion that a surviving mortgage interest is a \"claim\" under \u00a7 101(5) is consistent with other parts of the Code. Section 502(b)(1), for example, states that the bankruptcy court \"shall determine the amount of [a disputed] claim ... and shall allow such claim in such amount, except to the extent that ... such claim is unenforceable against the debtor\n   <em>\n    and property of the debtor\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added). In other words, the court must allow the claim if it is enforceable against\n   <em>\n    either\n   </em>\n   the debtor\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   his property. Thus, \u00a7 502(b)(1) contemplates circumstances in which a \"claim,\" like the mortgage lien that passes through a Chapter 7 proceeding, may consist of nothing more than an obligation enforceable against the debtor's property. Similarly, \u00a7 102(2) establishes, as a \"[r]ul[e] of construction,\" that the phrase \" 'claim against the debtor' includes claim against property of the debtor.\" A fair reading of \u00a7 102(2) is that a creditor who, like the Bank in this case, has a claim enforceable only against the debtor's property nonetheless has a \"claim against the debtor\" for purposes of the Code.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

There is simply no support for this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   BONY cites to several cases for the proposition that a chapter 13 bankruptcy plan that provides for curing the arrearage and paying a note and mortgage de-accelerates the note. \"Despite the entire balance on the loan having been accelerated, under the [2007 Case] plan, the [Debtors] were allowed to cure the arrearage and make current payments outside the plan, as is standard practice.\" (Resp. at 2.) BONY states, \"In\n   <em>\n    Morrison\n   </em>\n   , the District Court noted that \u00a7 1322(b)(5) permitted Chapter 13 debtors to cure the default amount through the plan and 'reinstate the original payment schedules of their home mortgage notes, notwithstanding the acceleration of the mortgage debts prior to their filings for relief.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Morrison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6127788\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/35/996/#p999\">\n    35 B.R. 996\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 999 (S.D.

However, BONY does not cite to any contract provision or case law to support the argument that a note is re-accelerated when a debtor emerges from bankruptcy, thus starting a new limitations period. The Court finds no legal or factual support for the argument that there is a new cause of action for enforcement of a \"re-accelerated\" note when a debtor emerges from bankruptcy protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   At the conclusion of the Debtors' 2007 Case, there were only two possible outcomes: (i) the Debtors were current under\n   the Note, in which case, the express terms of the Mortgage allowed the Debtors the right to reinstate the Note and Mortgage; or (ii) the Debtors were not current under the Note such that the remedies under the pre-petition acceleration applied-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , BONY had the remaining time before expiration of the six-year statute of limitations to enforce the accelerated Note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Based on the Debtors' failure to bring the Note current in the 2007 Case, BONY moved the State Court to reinstate the 2006 Foreclosure Action. The 2006 Foreclosure Action was premised on the 2006 acceleration of the Note-indeed, a required element of the foreclosure cause of action was that the Note had been accelerated. The State Court accepted BONY's representation and moved the 2006 Foreclosure Action to its active docket. BONY's conduct in seeking reinstatement of the 2006 Foreclosure Action is in direct contradiction to its argument now that the Note was re-accelerated with a new statute of limitations. If, as BONY now argues, the Note was re-accelerated when the Debtors' 2007 Case ended, BONY would have had to commence a new foreclosure action based upon the new acceleration date. This is not what BONY did. In stark contrast to its current re-acceleration argument, BONY's act to reinstate the 2006 Foreclosure Action was consistent with (i) the statute of limitations in O.R.C. \u00a7 1303.16(A) beginning to run in December 2006; and (ii) \u00a7 108 of the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   As a consequence, this Court finds that BONY is judicially estopped\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   from arguing that the Note was re-accelerated with a new statute of limitations when the Debtors emerged from their 2007 Case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Indeed, finding merit to BONY's argument that a note, after having been de-accelerated in a chapter 13 case by \u00a7 1322, is re-accelerated upon conclusion of that chapter 13 case with a new statute of limitations would stand current bankruptcy practice on its head. When a foreclosure action is pending at the time a bankruptcy petition is filed, mortgagees routinely move to lift the automatic stay to prosecute the pending foreclosure action. These mortgage holders do not seek stay relief to re-accelerate the note and file a new foreclosure action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   This Court finds that any \"de-acceleration\" of the Note by virtue of the Debtors' 2007 Case could not and did not toll the statute of limitations in O.R.C. \u00a7 1303.16(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2. The Note Was Never Reinstated\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   BONY argues that the statute of limitations has not expired because the Note was reinstated. In the context of a chapter 13 plan, de-acceleration is not the same as reinstatement of a note. \"[D]eceleration of a previously accelerated loan and cure of arrearages in that obligation, when compelled by the provisions of a debtor's Chapter 13 plan, do not constitute a voluntary process of reinstatement.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Seibel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6108587\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/82/463/#p465\">\n    82 B.R. 463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 465 (Bankr. S.D. Ohio 1987). \"[T]here are essential differences between a contractual mortgage reinstatement and the statutory cure right afforded by \u00a7 1322(b)(5) of the Bankruptcy code.

S.D. Ohio 2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Seeming to recognize that de-acceleration of the Note in the chapter 13 context is not the same as reinstatement of the Note, BONY argues that the Note was \"independently de-accelerated in 2013\" when the Note was reinstated. (Resp. at 5.) As set forth above, once the Note was accelerated, the Mortgage provided the Debtors with the right to reinstate the Note and Mortgage if they paid BONY all sums due under the Note as if it had not been accelerated plus all other fees incurred by BONY in enforcing the Note and Mortgage. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mortgage \u00b6 19.) The parties have stipulated that the Debtors never paid BONY all sums required to reinstate the Note. Accordingly, the Debtors never had the contractual right to reinstate the Note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In contrast to the Debtors' limited right to reinstate the Note, neither the Note nor the Mortgage provides BONY with the ability to unilaterally reinstate the previously accelerated Note. Thus, by the express terms of the Note and Mortgage, the accelerated Note was not reinstated. BONY's argument that the Note was reinstated in 2013 fails because (i) BONY has stipulated that the Note was never brought current-\n   <em>\n    i.e\n   </em>\n   ., the default that precipitated acceleration of the Note was never cured; and (ii) once the Note was accelerated, no term in either the Note or Mortgage permits BONY to unilaterally reinstate the Note. Consequently, the Court finds no legal or factual basis for BONY's assertion that the Note was reinstated in 2013 or at any other time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   BONY argues, \"[U]nder Article 3 of the U.C.C. [O.R.C. \u00a7 1303,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ], where the loan is de-accelerated, the statute of limitations stops until another acceleration letter is sent.\" (Resp. at 3-4 (citation, n.2 omitted).) BONY fails to point to the U.C.C. or Ohio Revised Code provision that stops the statute of limitations from running. Instead, for this proposition, BONY cites\n   <em>\n    U.S. Bank, N.A. v.

In fact, the\n   <em>\n    Cox\n   </em>\n   case in no way deals with the effect of a bankruptcy filing on a previously accelerated note or any kind of de-acceleration of a note. Instead, the Supreme Court of New York, Westchester County cited to specific New York law that permitted a lender to revoke a prior acceleration.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   It is well settled that once a mortgage debt is accelerated, the entire amount becomes due and the statute of limitations begins to run.

Here, (i) BONY offers no evidence that it ever revoked the 2006 acceleration of the Note; and (ii) the statute of limitations ended on December 20, 2012, whereas BONY asserts that the Note and Mortgage were reinstated in May 2013,\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   several months\n   outside the statute of limitations. Simply put, the\n   <em>\n    Cox\n   </em>\n   case does not support BONY's position and is inapposite to the facts before this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Nor has BONY shown that the Debtors and BONY agreed to reinstate the Note. Without such an agreement, the Note could not have been reinstated. \"Once a loan is accelerated and the entire amount is due, absent agreement of the parties, the outstanding balance remains due.\"\n   <em>\n    Fed.

The reason for this is a fundamental disagreement between the parties concerning what statute of limitations applies if BONY seeks only to enforce its\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   rights under the Mortgage. The Debtors contend that the Mortgage is an incident to the Note and, once the statute of limitations in O.R.C. \u00a7 1303.16(A) has expired, BONY is also barred from seeking foreclosure under the Mortgage. BONY, on the other hand, argues that its right to enforce the Mortgage is a separate and distinct cause of action, which has a longer statute of limitations in O.R.C. \u00a7 2305.06 that has not expired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Deutsche Bank Nat'l Trust Co. v.

The debtors received a chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge at an unspecified time after August 2009. Deutsche Bank filed a foreclosure action on August 12, 2011, from which the appeal arose. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Deutsche Bank, holding that it was the holder of the note and mortgage prior to the commencement of the foreclosure action and, thus, had standing to foreclose upon the mortgage.

Based upon the Ohio statute and this definition, it\n   appears BONY would need to hold legal title and be entitled to possession of the Debtors' Residence in order to maintain a cause of action for ejectment. Holding a mortgage on the Debtors' Residence is not the same as holding legal title to the property.

BONY states, \"A central issue in the 2015 Foreclosure is whether the complaint is barred by the statute of limitations.\" (Resp. at 11.) BONY argues that \"a finding by [this Court] that [Claim 14] is time-barred under O.R.C. 1303.16 could result in inconsistent rulings between this Court and the state court.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Section 502(a) of the Bankruptcy Code states, \"A claim or interest, proof of which is filed under section 501 of this title, is deemed allowed, unless a party in interest ... objects.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20502\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (2018). Pursuant to \u00a7 502(b), this Court is required to resolve objections to claim, and a claim shall be disallowed if the claim is \"unenforceable.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20502\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). Here, the Debtors have objected to Claim 14, asserting that the debt is unenforceable because the statute of limitations has expired. Section 558 of the Bankruptcy Code authorizes the Debtors to assert the statute of limitations as a defense to Claim 14.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, this Court is required to rule on the Claim Objection because only allowed claims may be paid through the Debtors' chapter 13 plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Notwithstanding that this Court is required to rule on the Claim Objection so that this bankruptcy case can be administered, BONY states, \"When an issue brought before a federal court is already pending before a state court, there are circumstances in which abstention by the federal court is appropriate.\" (Resp. at 11.) BONY's entire argument about inconsistent rulings rests on the fact that the 2015 Foreclosure Action was filed prior to the Claim Objection. The Court finds BONY's argument to be disingenuous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The 2015 Foreclosure Action was pending for two years without the \"central issue\" of the statute of limitations being addressed. Significantly, in the time since the filing of this bankruptcy case, BONY has not sought to have the automatic stay lifted so the State Court could adjudicate the statute of limitations issue. Apparently, BONY is content to have the issue regarding\n   the statute of limitations remain unresolved indefinitely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Most astounding is BONY's audacity in raising this abstention argument. Incredibly, after (i) asking this Court to set an evidentiary hearing to resolve the Claim Objection; and (ii) having not opposed the Debtors' request to file a motion for summary judgment on the statute of limitations issue, for the first time in response to the motion, BONY now takes the position that this Court should abstain. This case does not present the kind of circumstances where abstention is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   It is black letter law that any ruling by this Court on the statute of limitations issue will be\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   to the extent the State Court has the same parties and the same issue before it. Thus, there can be no danger of \"inconsistent rulings.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     V. CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the Court will (i) grant the Motion for Summary Judgment in part, finding that enforcement of the Note and foreclosure upon the Mortgage are both governed by the six-year statute of limitations in O.R.C. \u00a7 1303.16(A) and are time-barred; and (ii) deny the Motion for Summary Judgment in part, finding that the Mortgage may support an action for ejectment, which is covered by the statute of limitations in O.R.C. \u00a7 2305.04 and which would not be time-barred. However, because the issue of ejectment has not been fully briefed, the Court makes no finding that Claim 14 encompasses a potential cause of action for ejectment or that a cause of action for ejectment supports allowance of Claim 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDER (i) GRANTING, IN PART, MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT; AND (ii) DENYING, IN PART, MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   This cause is before the Court on Motion for Summary Judgment on Objection to Proof of Claim No. 14-1 (\"Motion for Summary Judgment\") (Doc. 62) filed by Debtors Arthur L. Fisher, Sr. and Pamela L. Fisher on March 8, 2018. The Debtors ask the Court to disallow Claim 14\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   because the underlying claim is barred by the six-year statute of limitation in Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 1303.16(A).

On March 29, 2018, the Debtors filed Reply in Support of Debtors' Motion for Summary Judgment on Objection to Proof of Claim No. 14-1 (Doc. 72).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   For the reasons set forth in the Court's Memorandum Opinion Regarding Debtors' Motion for Summary Judgment on Objection to Proof of Claim No. 14-1 entered on this date, the Court hereby (i) grants the Motion for Summary Judgment in part, finding that enforcement of the Note and Mortgage are both governed by the statute of limitations in O.R.C. \u00a7 1303.16(A) and are time-barred; and (ii) denies the Motion for Summary Judgment in part, finding that the Mortgage may support an action for ejectment, which is covered by\n   the statute of limitations in O.R.C. \u00a7 2305.04 and would not be time-barred. However, because the issue of ejectment has not been fully briefed, the Court makes no finding that Claim 14 encompasses a potential cause of action for ejectment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     INSTRUCTIONS TO CLERK\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Please serve a copy of the foregoing upon the following via regular mail:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   1.
