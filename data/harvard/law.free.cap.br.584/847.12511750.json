Benjamin Goldgar, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n   This contested matter in the Caesars bankruptcies is a dispute over a purported claim transfer. Currently before the court for ruling is the motion of Whitebox Advisors, LLC (\"Whitebox\") for entry of a protective order. Whitebox's opponent, Earl of Sandwich (Atlantic City), LLC (\"Earl\"), opposes the motion. For the reasons discussed below, the motion will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In September 2016, Earl filed proof of claim No. 5858 in the bankruptcy case of one of the Caesars debtors, Showboat Atlantic City Operating Co., LLC. Earl asserted a $3.6 million unsecured nonpriority claim arising from a lease termination. On January 17, 2017, the debtors' third amended joint chapter 11 plan of reorganization was confirmed. In general, the plan provides for cash distributions to holders of allowed claims in various percentages depending on the claims' classifications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Whitebox asserts that Earl sold its claim shortly before confirmation. According to Whitebox, Earl entered into an agreement with Cowen Special Investments LLC (\"Cowen\") to sell the $3.6 million claim to Cowen for $2.15 million. Whitebox says the sale was negotiated in a series of emails between Earl and Cowen on January 11 and 12, 2017, and the sale was complete as of 8:34 a.m. (ET) on January 12. By noon the same day, Cowen had sold the claim to Whitebox. The sale terms were confirmed with an \"email trade confirmation\" describing the \"trade details\" of the sale. Some months later, Cowen and Whitebox entered into what Whitebox calls an Assignment and Release Agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   To notify the debtors that the Earl claim had been sold, on October 5, 2017, Whitebox filed with the court a transfer of claim form in accordance with Bankruptcy Rule 3001(e)(2), Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3001(e)(2). The form listed Whitebox as the transferee and Earl as transferor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Earl timely objected to the claim transfer, arguing that the claim had not in fact been sold. Earl insists that it is the true holder of the claim, not Cowen or Whitebox, and so is entitled to the distribution on account of the claim under the confirmed plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   When a party objects, Rule 3001(e)(2) requires a hearing to determine if the claim has indeed been transferred. The dispute over the purported transfer here is a contested matter under Bankruptcy Rule 9014. Rule 9014(c) declares that Rule 7026-which incorporates Rule 26 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, entitled \"general provisions governing discovery,\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 26 -generally applies in contested matters. Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Since Earl's objection, the parties have been conducting discovery. Earl has served document requests on both Whitebox and Cowen. Whitebox produced documents but sought Earl's agreement to keep some of them confidential, to be revealed only to certain people for certain purposes. At first Earl consented, and Whitebox forwarded a stipulation and agreed protective order to the court. But the proposed order would have had the court find there had been \"good cause shown,\" and no such showing had been made.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties were advised that the\n   order would not be entered without a motion showing good cause. They were also told to base their proposed order on the district court's model confidentiality order. Efforts to reach an agreement must then have broken down, because Whitebox has moved on its own for entry of a protective order, and Earl has objected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In its motion, Whitebox asks to have approximately 289 pages of documents \"protect[ed] during the discovery process\" from \"competitors.\" (Reply at 4). Whitebox describes the documents as (1) the Assignment and Release Agreement; (2) communications between Whitebox and Cowen in January 2017 about the negotiation of a document related to Whitebox's purchase of the claim; (3) communications between Whitebox and Cowen in March 2017 about the claim; (4) a letter Whitebox sent to Cowen in April 2017 about the claim; and (5) a brief series of \"Bloomberg chat messages\" exchanged either internally at Whitebox or between Whitebox and Cowen in January, February, and April of 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The motion will be denied. Whitebox has not demonstrated good cause for the entry of a protective order because it has not shown either that the information it wants to protect is confidential or that the information's disclosure would result in a clearly-defined, serious injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The initial question is the basis for entry of any protective order. In adversary proceedings and contested matters, protective orders are authorized under Rule 26(c).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Handy Andy Home Improvement Ctrs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6460459\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/199/376/#p380\">\n    199 B.R. 376\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 380 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 1996) ; 10\n   <em>\n    Collier on Bankruptcy\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9018.04 at 9018-5 (Richard Levin &amp; Henry J. Sommer eds. 16th ed. 2017). Section 107(b) of the Bankruptcy Code and Rule 9018 also authorize protective orders. But section 107(b) concerns papers filed in bankruptcy cases, not discovery material.\n   <em>\n    Handy Andy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6460459\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/199/376/#p380\">\n    199 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   381 ; 2\n   <em>\n    Collier on Bankruptcy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 107.01 at 107-3. The same is true of Rule 9018(2). Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9018(2) (referring to a \"paper filed in a case under the Code\"). Rule 9018(1) is broader, allowing an order to protect \"a trade secret or other confidential research, development, or commercial information.\" Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9018(1). But the same phrase appears in Rule 26(c)(1)(G), Fed. R. Civ 26(c)(1)(G), which, unlike Rule 9018, expressly applies in contested matters such as this one,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9014(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Whitebox styles its motion for protective order a motion under section 107 and Bankruptcy Rule 9018. Because the material sought to be protected has not been filed with the court, section 107 and Rule 9018(1) are irrelevant. Because this a contested matter and the dispute arises out of discovery conducted under Rule 26,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rule 9018(2) is equally irrelevant. Instead, the standards under Rule 26(c) determine whether Whitebox is entitled to entry of its proposed protective order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Rule 26(c) confers broad discretion on a trial court to decide when a protective order is appropriate and what protection is required.\n   <em>\n    Seattle Times Co. v.

Its sparse motion describes the motions simply as \"internal communications and certain communications and agreements between Cowen Special Investments and Whitebox Advisors.\" (Mot. at 4). Whitebox does supply more detail about the documents in its reply, dividing them into five categories. But the categories are so broad as to be largely uninformative:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n    \u2022 An \"Assignment and Release Agreement negotiated and executed between Whitebox and Cowen.\" (Reply at 4). What the agreement concerns, apart from the transferred claim, is unclear. Whitebox describes the agreement as having been executed \"pursuant to Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence\" (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    ), but what that means is anyone's guess. The evidence rules do not authorize people to enter into contracts.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n    \u2022 Communications between Whitebox and Cowen in January 2017 concerning \"the negotiation of a document related to Whitebox's purchase of the Claim from Cowen.\" What kind of \"document\" the document might be Whitebox does not explain. Nor does Whitebox explain how the document is \"related to\" the purchase.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n    \u2022 Communications between Cowen and Whitebox in March 2017 \"concerning the Claim.\" Apart from providing a date, this description says nothing. The entire dispute on which the parties are taking discovery \"concerns the claim.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n    \u2022 A letter from Whitebox to Cowen in April 2017 \"concerning the Claim.\" Again, the subject matter of the letter, a letter \"concerning the claim,\" is too broad to be meaningful or informative.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n    \u2022 A series of \"Bloomberg chat messages\" between Whitebox employees or between Whitebox and Cowen in early 2017. Presumably, these are some form of email or text message. Their subject is not described.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    <em>\n     Second\n    </em>\n    , Whitebox has failed to demonstrate these documents are confidential. The motion asserts they \"constitute confidential communications.\" (Mot. at 4). That is no more than a conclusion; the motion offers no facts from which the conclusion might be drawn. Whitebox likewise asserts in its reply that the documents contain \"Whitebox's confidential commercial information.\" (Reply at 2;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 4). The reply then elaborates that the documents reflect Whitebox's \"buying, selling, contract negotiation, and contract formation processes and strategies,\" as well as \"contract terms and pricing information.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 4-5). But describing the information this way does not compel the conclusion that it is also confidential. It would have helped had Whitebox at least identified the business it is in and described its operations. But it has done neither, making it impossible to evaluate whether the information is the kind such a business would ordinarily keep confidential. Nor has Whitebox asserted that it takes any particular measures to keep the information confidential.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Andrew Corp. v. Rossi\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"500543\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/180/338/#p341\">\n     180 F.R.D. 338\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 341 (N.D.

Whitebox says in its motion that disclosure would affect its ability \"to negotiate future claims trades.\" (Mot. 4). On this point, as with the question of confidentiality, Whitebox elaborates somewhat in its reply, insisting that disclosure of the information would give its competitors \"crucial insight into its commercial operations and strategies, including its negotiation tactics and financial bearings.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 4).\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    But this, too, is no more than a conclusion-a \"broad allegation[ ] of potential harm or competitive injury,\"\n    <em>\n     Global\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4157369\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/133/1079/#p1084\">\n     133 F.Supp.3d at 1084\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (internal quotation omitted), not the \"particular and specific demonstration of fact\" necessary to obtain a protective order,\n    <em>\n     Gulf Oil\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1313645\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/452/89/\">\n     452 U.S. at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    102 n. 16,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1313645\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/452/89/\">\n     101 S.Ct. 2193\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

If Whitebox is suggesting that the agreement is confidential because Rule 408 would make it inadmissible at trial, Whitebox cites no legal authority suggesting that all inadmissible documents are automatically confidential. Rule 26(b)(1) suggests otherwise. Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1) (\"Information within [the] scope of discovery need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable.\"). (Because the agreement is between Whitebox and Cowen, it does not appear Rule 408 would bar its admission in any event. Rule 408 renders inadmissible evidence relating to the compromise of \"the claim,\" Fed. R. Evid. 408(a)(1)(2), meaning the claim to be tried.
