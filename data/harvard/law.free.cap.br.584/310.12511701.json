(\"Elite\") and San Diego Testing Services, Inc. (\"SDTS\") (collectively, \"Elite Entities\") are in the business of providing educational advising and tutoring services. Christopher John Hamilton was an officer and part-owner of SDTS. With the help of his wife, Elizabeth Leigh Tesolin, and others, he opened a competing business and absconded with the Elite Entities' lesson plans, proprietary information, and teachers. The Elite Entities obtained a $2 million state court judgment against Mr. Hamilton and Ms. Tesolin (collectively \"Debtors\"), who then sought chapter 11\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   bankruptcy protection. The bankruptcy court determined that the judgment was nondischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Debtors appeal the nondischargeability judgment, arguing that the bankruptcy court ignored Supreme Court precedent and misapplied Ninth Circuit law. We AFFIRM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Separately, the Elite Entities appeal from the bankruptcy court's order disallowing some of the postjudgment interest on the state court judgment. The bankruptcy court should have awarded the Elite Entities postjudgment interest at the state rate. We REVERSE and REMAND.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Prelitigation events\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Elite Entities provide academic counseling, tutoring, and college preparatory and standardized test prep services to high school students. In 1999, Mr. Hamilton joined Elite as a faculty member. In 2006, Elite formed a sister company, SDTS, and Mr. Hamilton became a shareholder, officer, and director of SDTS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After a few years, Mr. Hamilton grew discontented with the Elite Entities. In 2011, he retained a law firm to advise him on separating from the Elite Entities and forming his own company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In September 2011, while still an officer and director of SDTS, Mr. Hamilton formed Summa Consulting, LLC (\"Summa\"), an academic counseling and tutoring company. He also began gathering the Elite Entities' proprietary information with the assistance of other SDTS employees and his wife, Ms. Tesolin. For example, he took employee personnel files, student records, teaching materials and lesson plans, curriculum development tools, and a copy of the data on SDTS's server. He also began undermining SDTS's prospective\n   business by discouraging potential students from enrolling at SDTS and diverting them to Summa's programs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On October 6, 2011, without any prior notice, Mr. Hamilton resigned from SDTS. That same day, he used the Elite Entities' confidential contact list to send e-mails notifying SDTS's clients of his departure and soliciting business for Summa. Over the next two weeks, several other employees left SDTS to join Mr. Hamilton at Summa, leaving only one employee remaining at SDTS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. State court lawsuit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Shortly thereafter, the Elite Entities filed suit in state court against the Debtors, Summa, and other former SDTS employees, asserting causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty, breach of duty of loyalty, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, trade secret misappropriation, unfair competition, aiding and abetting, violation of California Penal Code \u00a7 502, and unjust enrichment. The complaint sought damages totaling $7.7 million and punitive damages against Mr. Hamilton.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Following a trial, the jury returned two special verdicts in the Elite Entities' favor. In relevant part, it found Mr. Hamilton liable for $2,070,000 for breach of fiduciary duty, breach of duty of loyalty, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, trade secret misappropriation, and punitive damages. It also found Ms. Tesolin jointly and severally liable for $1,855,000 under an aiding and abetting theory (collectively, \"State Court Judgment\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Bankruptcy case and adversary proceeding\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On the day of a scheduled sheriff's sale of Mr. Hamilton's stock in SDTS, the Debtors filed their chapter 11 petition. The Elite Entities filed proofs of claim based on the debt arising from the State Court Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Elite Entities also filed an adversary complaint against the Debtors, seeking a determination that the State Court Judgment was nondischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(6). They asserted that each of the causes of action for which the Debtors were found liable constituted a willful and malicious injury that was nondischargeable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Debtors and the Elite Entities filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The Elite Entities argued that the bankruptcy court should apply issue preclusion to the State Court Judgment and hold that the entire debt was nondischargeable. In response, the Debtors agreed that the jury's factual findings had preclusive effect, but contended that the unintentional torts lacked the requisite element of intent and the corresponding damages were dischargeable debts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The bankruptcy court granted the Elite Entities summary judgment on the intentional interference with prospective economic advantage claim because the Debtors conceded that the State Court Judgment necessarily established willful and injurious intent. It thus held that the corresponding $160,000 award was nondischargeable as to the Debtors jointly and severally. It initially held that the jury's special verdict satisfied the issue of malice on all causes of action. However, the bankruptcy court later reconsidered its ruling and held that the jury did not allocate punitive damages to any particular cause of action, so it was improper to infer that Mr. Hamilton acted with requisite malice. It also denied the Elite Entities' request concerning postjudgment interest and directed them to file a separate motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Trial and nondischargeability judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The bankruptcy court conducted a four-day trial to determine whether the remaining debt was nondischargeable. Following trial, the bankruptcy court issued its memorandum decision holding that the State Court Judgment was nondischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(6). It considered whether the Elite Entities had satisfied \u00a7 523(a)(6)'s \"willful and malicious injury\" test laid out in\n   <em>\n    Kawaauhau v. Geiger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503165\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/57/\">\n    523 U.S. 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503165\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/57/\">\n    118 S.Ct. 974\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503165\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/57/\">\n    140 L.Ed.2d 90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998), and\n   <em>\n    Petralia v. Jercich (In re Jercich)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11129506,11147796\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/238/1202/\">\n    238 F.3d 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2001).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   First, it ruled that Mr. Hamilton had acted willfully. It noted that, under\n   <em>\n    Jercich\n   </em>\n   , willfulness is satisfied if the defendant either (1) had a subjective motive to inflict injury upon them, or (2) believed that injury was substantially certain to result from his conduct. It found that the Elite Entities had not shown that Mr. Hamilton had a subjective motive to injure them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Rather, the court ruled that the Elite Entities successfully established that Mr. Hamilton believed that injury was substantially certain to result from his conduct. It found that \"it is readily apparent that Mr. Hamilton's conduct caused substantial harm. He was a central, executive-level employee and departed without notice. And he took several key employees with him.\" Mr. Hamilton also carefully orchestrated his departure with his wife and other SDTS employees and took the Elite Entities' best teachers, proprietary information (including e-mail contact list and client database), tangible property, and SDTS's hard drive. Moreover, due to Mr. Hamilton's \"significant premeditation,\" the Elite Entities' \"ability to conduct business was markedly impeded. And Mr. Hamilton's conduct badly disrupted Elite's business. There was immediate disorder .... Plaintiffs' upper management did not know who had the keys to the building.\" The court concluded that Mr. Hamilton\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   knew with substantial certainty that his conduct would result in harm to Plaintiffs. Aside from inference, the court's conclusion is based on reason: What he was doing simply\n   <strong>\n    had\n   </strong>\n   to be harmful. For example, in his September 26, 2011 e-mail to his father, Mr. Hamilton described his impending resignation as his \"own personal D-Day\" and that he would be \"pull[ing] the pin\" on October 1, 2011.... This conjures up images of massive damage being inflicted. Further, there was evidence concerning a \"coup\"-presumably against Plaintiffs' leadership to harm it or deprive it of control. And Mr. Hamilton's October 8, 2011 e-mail discusses an upcoming meeting with attorneys in Los Angeles to discuss \"fold[ing] up the old entity.\" ... This suggests that Mr. Hamilton expected Elite or SDTS would cease to exist, or at least to function, as a business entity. Mr. Hamilton's efforts in testimony to convince the court that this was just meant to resolve his ownership in SDTS, i.e., that he would buy out Mr. Park and Mr. Sung or vice versa, is not credible and the court rejects it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (Emphasis in original.) Accordingly, the Elite Entities established that Mr. Hamilton acted willfully.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Second, the court ruled that Mr. Hamilton acted with malice. It rejected Mr. Hamilton's argument that he established \"just cause or excuse\" because he had sought and relied on the advice of counsel in good faith to lawfully separate from the Elite Entities and start Summa.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Third, the court found that Mr. Hamilton's conduct was tortious because it implicated torts under California law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Finally, the court determined that Mr. Hamilton's liability to the Elite Entities was nondischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(6). But the court held that there was insufficient evidence to establish the nondischargeability of Ms. Tesolin's debt, and, as a result, only the $160,000 joint and several judgment arising from the intentional interference with prospective economic advantage claim was nondischargeable as to Ms. Tesolin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Debtors timely filed a notice of appeal from the judgment (\"Nondischargeability Judgment\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Motion for postjudgment interest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Following the entry of the Nondischargeability Judgment, the Elite Entities moved for a nondischargeability determination on postjudgment interest accruing on the State Court Judgment (\"Postjudgment Interest Motion\"). They sought a determination that postjudgment interest was nondischargeable and accrued at the California rate of ten percent from the date of entry of the State Court Judgment pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 685.010. They argued that it is well settled in the Ninth Circuit that prepetition, nondischargeable debts accrue interest postpetition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In opposition, the Debtors argued that, because an adversary proceeding is a federal matter brought under a federal statute (and a nondischargeability claim is solely a federal question), the court must apply the federal interest rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Following a hearing, the bankruptcy court entered an order (\"Postjudgment Interest Order\") granting in part and denying in part the Postjudgment Interest Motion. The court thought that there were four relevant time periods: (1) between the State Court Judgment and the petition date (\"Period One\"); (2) between the petition date and the adversary complaint (\"Period Two\"); (3) between the adversary complaint and the Nondischargeability Judgment (\"Period Three\"); and (4) the time after entry of the Nondischargeability Judgment (\"Period Four\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Debtors conceded that the ten percent California rate applied to Period One. The court stated that \"[i]nherent in the judgment was the statutory 10% interest right; it is a substantive aspect of Plaintiff's prepetition claim. It is thus integral to the nondischargeable State Court Judgment and is likewise\n   <strong>\n    nondischargeable\n   </strong>\n   .\" (Emphasis in original.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Second, the court held that the state rate was applicable to Period Two, which was the short postpetition, pre-complaint period. It held that the postjudgment interest that was accruing following the State Court Judgment properly continued to accrue, and any interest before the adversary complaint was filed \"was part and parcel of the liability arising from the State Court Judgment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Third, the court disallowed any interest during Period Three, which lasted for three years while the adversary complaint was pending. It noted that \"[t]he Complaint's filing vested the court with sound discretion to award prejudgment interest.\" It analyzed the \"equities, fairness, and what it will take to make Plaintiffs whole.\" It reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiffs earned a handsome return on the State Court Judgment while it accrued interest at the state rate. This amply protected the time value of the\n   money at stake. But to allow that to continue past the Complaint's filing date strikes the court as punitive. Prejudgment interest is an element of compensation, not a penalty. To be sure, Defendants behaved badly. But having a large nondischargeability judgment is significant punishment already. To allow three more years of state-rate interest-let alone post-judgment at that rate for all time-is inequitable. How could Defendants ever hope to pay off this debt if it continues accruing interest at 10%? The court views this is [sic] an intolerable burden, one so extreme that it threatens to deny Defendants any semblance of a fresh start.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   It thus stated that the Elite Entities were not entitled to any \"prejudgment\" interest during Period Three.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Finally, for the same reasons, the court exercised its discretion to award the Elite Entities \"postjudgment\" interest at the federal rate for Period Four.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Elite Entities timely appealed the Postjudgment Interest Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The bankruptcy court had jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 157(b)(1) and (2)(I).

It found that he caused \"substantial harms\" by departing with several key employees without notice, taking the Elite Entities' proprietary information and tangible property, and leaving SDTS in confusion and disarray, such that the Elite Entities did not even have keys to the building. The court found that \"[w]hat he was doing simply\n   <strong>\n    had\n   </strong>\n   to be harmful.\" (Emphasis in original.) It noted that Mr. Hamilton described his departure as his \"own personal D-Day,\" \"pulling the pin,\" a \"coup,\" and \"folding up the old entity.\" The court found that the evidence suggested that \"Mr. Hamilton expected Elite or SDTS would cease to exist, or at least function, as a business entity.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Mr. Hamilton is patently wrong that the bankruptcy court applied an incorrect standard and only required \"some harm.\" As the court found, Mr. Hamilton knew that his actions would cause \"substantial injury\"-his own words conjured images of battle, explosion, revolt, or the destruction of a business. Even if he did not predict the exact dollar value of the damage he would cause, Mr. Hamilton knew with substantial certainty that his acts would cause significant damage to the Elite Entities. That is sufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Mr. Hamilton puzzlingly argues that the bankruptcy court erred by deciding the Nondischargeability Judgment on the sole basis of the State Court Judgment and should have consulted a copy of the trial transcript. This argument is frivolous. Mr. Hamilton conveniently forgets the four-day trial that the bankruptcy court conducted on the issue of nondischargeability. The bankruptcy court heard testimony and argument concerning the causes of action asserted in the state court and came to its own conclusions regarding Mr. Hamilton's knowledge and intent; its decision was not based on \"the jury verdict alone.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Accordingly, the bankruptcy court's findings met\n   <em>\n    Jercich\n   </em>\n   's\"substantial certainty\" standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Mr. Hamilton is not an honest but unfortunate debtor.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Mr. Hamilton argues that public policy supports the dischargeability of the State Court Judgment. He contends that exceptions to discharge must be narrowly construed-and thus a finding of \"actual intent\" is necessary-to \"afford debtor[ ] the 'fresh start' anticipated by Congress ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The fatal flaw in his argument is that he is not an \"honest but unfortunate debtor\" for whom the bankruptcy discharge was intended. As\n   <em>\n    Jercich\n   </em>\n   stated, not every debtor is entitled to a fresh start:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   Congress's decision to make the debts listed under \u00a7 523(a) nondischargeable reflect[s] a decision by Congress that the fresh start policy is not always paramount.

We hold that the former line of decisions is correct in cases like this one, where there is a valid prepetition state court judgment. The Nondischargeability Judgment was not a new money judgment under federal law. It simply determined that the State Court Judgment was not dischargeable. As such, the bankruptcy court lacked authority to override the state court's award of interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   This case is distinguishable from cases where there is no prior state\n   court judgment. In such a case, the bankruptcy court needs to determine both the existence of a debt\n   <strong>\n    and\n   </strong>\n   its dischargeability. The bankruptcy court may then issue a money judgment for the debt, and federal law would govern pre- and postjudgment interest.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Zenovic v.

The bankruptcy court also may (but is not required to) issue a new money judgment where the bankruptcy court decides that the state court's judgment is invalid or that only part of the debt embodied in a state court judgment is dischargeable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cottle v.

Or. 2016), explains why the bankruptcy court may not change the amount of a valid state court judgment in this context. The state of Oregon obtained a judgment against the debtor for overpayment of unemployment benefits. The judgment bore postjudgment interest at the state rate. The debtor filed for bankruptcy relief, and the state sought a declaratory judgment that its claim was nondischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(2). The bankruptcy court held that the underlying debt was nondischargeable, but then discharged the accruing interest, entered a new money judgment, and held that the nondischargeable debt bore postpetition interest at the federal statutory rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The state appealed, and the district court vacated the bankruptcy court judgment, holding that the discharge of the postjudgment interest and the issuance of the money judgment were improper. It agreed with the state that \"the Bankruptcy Court abused its discretion in entering a federal money judgment in the amount of the nondischarged debt because it deprived Plaintiff of its right to collect the state statutory interest on that debt and interfered with Plaintiff's rights to collect the fraudulently-obtained benefits.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4281449\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/551/869/\">\n    551 B.R. at 875\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Similarly, the bankruptcy court here deprived the Elite Entities of the postjudgment interest that they were due under\n   the State Court Judgment. The determination of nondischargeability did nothing to change their entitlement to postjudgment interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Accordingly, the bankruptcy court did not have discretion to deny or adjust the accrual of interest at the state rate after entry of the State Court Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The bankruptcy court properly determined that the State Court Judgment was nondischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(6). However, it erred when it declined to award the Elite Entities postjudgment interest at the state rate for the entire period following entry of the State Court Judgment.
