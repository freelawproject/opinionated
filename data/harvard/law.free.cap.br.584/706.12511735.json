Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians (\"the Tribe\") and Kewadin Casinos Gaming Authority (\"Kewadin Authority\") (Appellees or collectively \"the Tribe Defendants\"), did not waive their sovereign immunity to the claims asserted in the Adversary Proceeding and dismissing them from the Adversary Proceeding. For the reasons that follow, the Court AFFIRMS the Bankruptcy Court and DISMISSES the Tribe Defendants from this Adversary Proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Procedural History of this Adversary Proceeding\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On May 29, 2008, Greektown Holdings, LLC and certain affiliates (collectively the \"Debtors\"), commenced proceedings under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code,\n   <em>\n    In re: Greektown Holdings, LLC, et al., Debtors\n   </em>\n   (E. D. Mich. Bankr. No. 08-53104, ECF No. 1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On or about May 28, 2010, this Adversary Proceeding was commenced,\n   <em>\n    The Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors on Behalf of the Estate of\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Greektown Holdings, LLC\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    v.

The Complaint in the Adversary Proceeding alleges that $177 million was fraudulently transferred by the debtor, Greektown Holdings, LLC (\"Holdings\"), to the Defendants for no or inadequate consideration. (Adv. Pro. ECF No. 1, Complaint.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Complaint alleges that the fraudulent transfers from Holdings may be avoided and recovered under sections 544 and 550 of the Bankruptcy Code,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and under the Michigan Uniform Fraudulent Transfers Act (\"MUFTA\") (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20566.31\">\n    Mich.

(Adv. Pro. ECF No. 8.) The parties stipulated to bifurcate the motion to dismiss to first have the Bankruptcy court decide the purely legal question of whether Congress, in Section 106(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, abrogated the Tribe's sovereign immunity and thereafter, if necessary, to decide whether the Tribe waived its sovereign immunity by participating in the Bankruptcy proceedings. The Bankruptcy Court heard oral argument on the Congressional abrogation issue on December 29, 2010, and took the matter under advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   While the issue of Congressional abrogation of sovereign immunity was still under advisement in the Bankruptcy Court, in 2012, the Tribe Defendants and the Litigation Trustee reached a settlement, filed a motion to have the settlement approved and requested that the Bankruptcy Court hold off issuing its ruling on the Tribe's motion to dismiss pending a decision on the Settlement Motion. This Court ultimately approved the Settlement Agreement, which contained a claims bar order that was an important aspect of the Settlement Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    In re Greektown Holdings, LLC\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 12-12340, ECF No. 10, Opinion and Order Granting Corrected Motion for Order Approving Settlement Agreement.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The non-settling Defendants in the Adversary Proceeding, Maria Gatzaros, Ted Gatzaros, Dimitrios Papas and Viola Papas (\"the Papas and Gatzaros Defendants\"), appealed the Court's Order approving the Settlement Agreement to the Sixth Circuit, objecting to the inclusion of the claims bar order. (\n   <em>\n    In re Greektown\n   </em>\n   , No. 12-12340, ECF No. 33, Notice of Appeal.) The Sixth Circuit reversed and remanded with instructions to this Court to reconsider the propriety and breadth of the claims bar order.\n   <em>\n    Papas v. Buchwald Capital Advisors LLC (In re Greektown Holdings, LLC)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3697497,6051879\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/728/567/\">\n    728 F.3d 567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 2013). With the claims bar order under fire, the parties stipulated in this Court to withdraw the motion for an order approving the settlement and the proceeding before this Court was dismissed. (\n   <em>\n    In re Greektown\n   </em>\n   , No. 12-12340, ECF Nos. 48, 49, Stipulation and Dismissal.) The parties thereafter agreed to voluntary mediation before Bankruptcy Chief Judge Phillip Shefferly in an effort to resolve all of the claims against the all of the remaining Defendants in the MUFTA Adversary Proceeding. Despite their efforts under Judge Shefferly's guidance, the parties were unable to achieve a settlement of the Adversary Proceeding. (Adv. Pro. ECF No. 449, Mediator's Certificate, 6/2/2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On June 9, 2014, with settlement negotiations at a standstill, the Tribe Defendants renewed the 2010 motion to dismiss on the grounds of sovereign immunity. (Adv. Pro. ECF No. 453, Renewed and Supplemented Motion to Dismiss Adversary Proceeding Re: Sovereign Immunity.) The parties renewed their stipulation to have the Bankruptcy Court first determine whether Congress had abrogated the Tribe Defendant's sovereign immunity in section 106 of the Bankruptcy Code and, only if no congressional abrogation was found, to then determine whether the Tribe Defendants had waived sovereign immunity for purposes of this MUFTA proceeding. On August 13, 2014, the Bankruptcy Court issued its Opinion and Order Denying the Tribe's Renewed and Supplemented Motion, concluding that \"Congress sufficiently, clearly, and unequivocally intended to abrogate [the Tribe's] sovereign immunity in [ section 106 of the Bankruptcy Code ].\" (Adv. Pro. ECF No. 474 at 36, August 12, 2014 Opinion and Order.) The Tribe Defendants appealed Bankruptcy Judge Walter Shapero's ruling and this Court reversed, holding that Congress did not unequivocally express its intent to abrogate sovereign immunity of Indian tribes in section 106 of the Bankruptcy Code.\n   <em>\n    In re Greektown Holdings, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4220942\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/532/680/\">\n    532 B.R. 680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Mich. 2015). This Court remanded the matter to the Bankruptcy Court for further proceedings on the issue of whether the Tribe Defendants waived sovereign immunity, as outlined by the Bankruptcy Court in its December 23, 2010 Stipulated Order bifurcating the sovereign immunity issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On September 29, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court issued its Opinion and Order finding that the Tribe had not waived its sovereign immunity and granting the Tribe's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction on the basis of sovereign immunity.\n   <em>\n    In re Greektown Holdings, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12134598\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/559/842/\">\n    559 B.R. 842\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. E.D. Mich. 2016). The Litigation Trustee has now appealed the Bankruptcy Court's September 29, 2016 Opinion and Order. This Court heard oral argument on the waiver appeal on April 10, 2017. Following the hearing and while the matter was still under advisement, the Litigation Trustee and the Tribe Defendants participated in a global facilitation effort, along with the Papas and Gatzaros Defendants, under the direction of retired United States District Court Judge Gerald Rosen. On September 26, 2017, the parties notified the Court that those efforts were unsuccessful in resolving the matter, thus necessitating this Court's resolution of the Litigation Trustee's appeal of Judge Shapero's September 29, 2016 Opinion and Order finding no waiver of sovereign immunity by the Tribe Defendants and dismissing the Tribe Defendants from the MUFTA Adversary Proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Bankruptcy Court's September 29, 2016 Opinion and Order\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Bankruptcy Court concluded that\n   <em>\n    Memphis Biofuels, LLC v. Chickasaw Nation Indus., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7343403,3481550\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/585/917/\">\n    585 F.3d 917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 2009), in which the Sixth Circuit held that where a tribal charter requires board approval to waive sovereign immunity, nothing short of such an express approval will operate to waive tribal immunity, foreclosed the Litigation Trustee's MUFTA proceeding against the Tribe Defendants.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12134598\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/559/842/\">\n    559 B.R. at 846-48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Judge Shapero reasoned that because it is undisputed that the governing charter here required a board resolution waiving sovereign immunity as to the MUFTA claims, and it is also undisputed that no such resolution was adopted, and because it is likewise undisputed that the Tribe did not enter into any contract or agreement by which it expressly agreed to waive sovereign immunity as to the MUFTA claims,\n   <em>\n    Memphis Biofuels\n   </em>\n   precluded any suit against the Tribe Defendants\n   to which the Tribe's board had not expressly consented by board resolution.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12134598\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/559/842/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Judge Shapero reasoned that because\n   <em>\n    Memphis Biofuels\n   </em>\n   held that \"unauthorized acts of tribal officials are insufficient to waive tribal sovereign immunity,\" no conduct of the Tribe short of an express board resolution could serve to waive the Tribe Defendant's sovereign immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Judge Shapero further held, rejecting the Litigation Trustee's alternative argument that the Tribe Defendants waived sovereign immunity by participating in the underlying Bankruptcy proceeding, that the \"Tribe Defendants' participation in the claims allowance and confirmation process has not, as a matter of law, constituted a waiver of sovereign immunity that is broad enough to encompass this entire adversary proceeding against them, which seeks to recover alleged fraudulent transfers.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12134598\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/559/842/\">\n    559 B.R. at 849-50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Bankruptcy Court extended this holding and found that even if, as alleged by the Litigation Trustee, the Tribe Defendants caused the Debtors to file the Bankruptcy Petition in this action, the Tribe did not thereby waive its sovereign immunity to the MUFTA adversary proceeding filed against them.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12134598\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/559/842/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12134598\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/559/842/\">\n    at 851-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Factual Background as Relevant to This Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   It is undisputed, as alleged in the Complaint in this Adversary Proceeding, that the Tribe Defendants have appeared and participated in the claims allowance process in the underlying Greektown Bankruptcy proceedings (Bankr. Case No. 08-53104) by filing certain proofs of claim (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Bankr. ECF Nos. 263, 280, 282, 325, 2314) and by filing appearances and objections in that proceeding (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Bankr. ECF Nos. 706, 751,1404, 1654, 1990, 2236).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Each of the Notices of Appearance filed by the Tribe Defendants in the underlying Greektown Bankruptcy proceedings expressly stated that the Tribe Defendants did not thereby consent to the exercise of jurisdiction over them and specifically reserved the right to assert all affirmative defenses, including lack of subject matter jurisdiction. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ibid\n   </em>\n   ; Adv. Pro. ECF No. 649-1, Tribe Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss at 13.) Likewise, the Tribe Defendants' Objections filed in the underlying Greektown Bankruptcy proceedings also expressly sought to preserve the Tribe Defendants' right to assert all available affirmative defenses, resulting in the final Plan Confirmation Order acknowledging that the Tribe Defendants are not deemed to have waived or released their right to assert all available defenses in any potential avoidance claim filed against them. (Bankr. ECF No. 2046, Order Confirming Second Amended Joint Plans; Adv. Pro. ECF No. 649-1, Tribe Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss at 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Also undisputed is the fact that the Tribe's governing Tribal Code (which applies equally to the Kewadin Gaming Authority, an instrumentality of the Tribe established pursuant to the Gaming Authority Charter and defined as a \"Tribal Entity\" pursuant to the Tribal Code) expressly defines the limited conditions under which the Tribe Defendants may waive their sovereign immunity. (Adv. Pro. ECF No. 649-1, Ex. A, Affidavit of Candace Blocher, Exs. B, C, Chapters 44 and 94 respectively of the Tribal Code.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   Tribal Code provides in relevant part that \"[t]he sovereign immunity of the Tribe, including sovereign immunity from suit in any state, federal or tribal court, is hereby expressly reaffirmed unless such immunity is waived in accordance with '44.105 or '44.108.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 44.104.) Section 44.105 provides in relevant part that the sovereign immunity of the Tribe may be waived \"(a) by resolution of the Board of Directors expressly waiving the sovereign immunity of the Tribe and consenting to suit against the Tribe in any forum designated in the resolution;\n   <em>\n    provided\n   </em>\n   , that any such waiver shall not be general but shall be specific and limited as to duration, grantee, transaction, property or funds of the Tribe subject to the waiver, court having jurisdiction and applicable law ... or (b) by a Tribal entity exercising authority expressly delegated to such entity in its charter or specially by resolution of the Board of Directors....\" (Tribal Code \u00a7 44.105(1)(a)(b).) Section 44.108 provides a waiver of sovereign immunity \"for any claim sounding in contract\" arising from an express, written, and signed contract involving a proprietary function of the Tribe.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   It is also undisputed that: (1) there is no Board resolution waiving the Tribe Defendants' tribal immunity and consenting to suit on the claims asserted in this MUFTA Adversary Proceeding; and (2) there is no contract containing a provision purporting to waive the Tribe Defendants' tribal immunity as to the claims asserted in this MUFTA Adversary Proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In addition to these undisputed facts, the Litigation Trustee asserts that certain conduct of the Tribe Defendants establishes that the Tribe Defendants exerted complete dominion and control of the Debtors, used the Debtors as their agents in connection with the fraudulent transfers alleged in this Adversary Proceeding and directed the Debtors to initiate the underlying Bankruptcy proceedings in order to forestall an action by the Michigan Gaming Control Board (\"MGCB\") against the Tribe Defendants, thereby becoming one with the Debtors under principles of agency and alter ego/piercing the corporate veil. While the Tribe Defendants do not concede the truth of these allegations they do accept them, as did Judge Shapero, solely for purposes of resolving the legal waiver issues presented in this appeal. Judge Shapero accepted \"as true,\" and so does this Court in reviewing his Opinion and Order, that \"the Tribe Defendants' pre-petition and post-petition conduct as relates to the Debtors amounts to pervasive dominion and control and went well beyond filing proofs of claim or other litigation conduct.\" (\n   <em>\n    In re Greektown Holdings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12134598\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/559/842/\">\n    559 B.R. at 852-53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Counsel for the Litigation Trustee succinctly stated at the April 10, 2017 hearing the \"issue of first impression\" presented in this appeal: whether principles of alter-ego/piercing the corporate veil and/or agency can be applied to find a waiver by conduct of an Indian tribe's sovereign immunity. The Litigation Trustee submits that the Debtors in the underlying Greektown bankruptcy proceedings were the \"mere instrumentalities\" of the Tribe Defendants, and were \"dominated and controlled\" by the Tribe Defendants both before and after the bankruptcy filings and used by the Tribe Defendants to initiate the Greektown bankruptcy proceedings to avoid an action by the MGCB to force the Tribe Defendants to relinquish their interest in Greektown Casino.

Counsel for the Litigation Trustee explained at the hearing before Judge Shapero that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   [g]enerally the filing of a proof of claim in a bankruptcy case waives immunity only with respect to the claims that arise from that proof of claim.... And the tribe Defendant[s] filed a proof of claim and the application for an administrative expense and-and so they put these in issue[ ].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   But as we said back in 2010 and have consistently said, this case is not simply about the tribe defendants' filed proof of claim or their application for rounds [sic] of administrative expense claim. We have always asserted that the tribe defendants' pervasive involvement in the events leading up to and after the bankruptcy filings go beyond the simple act of filing proofs of claim.... It's the filing of the bankruptcies themselves. The events leading up to that absolutely. But the filing of the case itself, not just in the proof of claim, but the filing of the overarching umbrella that is this bankruptcy case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   (Bankr. ECF No. 742, 1/14/16 Hr'g Tr. 22:19-23:5; 23:25-24:3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Of course the Tribe Defendants are not among the Debtors in the underlying bankruptcy proceedings; the Tribe Defendants did not initiate \"the overarching umbrella that is this bankruptcy case.\" And so, to even proceed on the theory that filing the \"overarching\" bankruptcy case would amount to a waiver as to these MUFTA claims under the limited doctrine of \"waiver by litigation\" discussed in the cases cited\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the Litigation Trustee is forced to rely on equitable principles of alter-ego/veil piercing and/or agency to attribute the conduct of the Debtors to the Tribe Defendants:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   The-the conduct of the debtors should be applied to the tribe defendants.... [B]y filing the case [the Tribe Defendants] have essentially embraced all of the actions that can be brought under that case, that's right.... [I]f they're willing to stipulate to that, you know, we'll ride that-that's-we'll\n   ride that horse. I don't think we need the alter ego or piercing the corporate veil issues.... But if the tribe is unwilling to stipulate that they initiated the bankruptcy cases, we have to establish that conduct in an alternative way. And that is by establishing the debtors were the alter ego of the tribe defendants or that the defendants-or the debtors' corporate veil should be pierced. Because then for all intents and purposes the tribe is the debtor. The conduct of the debtor is the conduct of the tribe, it's one. It's not implicit, it's not by implication, it is their conduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   (Bankr. ECF No. 742, 1/14/16 Hr'g Tr. 23:19-21, 26:11-27:2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    2. No court has ever applied the equitable doctrine of alter-ego/veil piercing to find a waiver of an Indian tribe's sovereign immunity and Supreme Court precedent precludes this Court from creating such a doctrine which necessarily finds an implied waiver by conduct.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Success on this theory requires a finding that the Tribe Defendants' conduct in allegedly controlling the Debtors and causing the Debtors to initiate the underlying bankruptcy proceedings amounts to a waiver of the Tribe Defendants' sovereign immunity to the fraudulent transfer claims at issue in this Adversary Proceeding. The Litigation Trustee would like the Court to reach this finding of waiver through two distinct analytical steps: first, find that the Tribe Defendants exerted such dominion and control over the Debtors that the conduct of the Debtors could be attributed to the Tribe Defendants under equitable principles of agency/alter-ego/veil piercing (the Tribe Defendants concede this for purposes of this appeal), and second, find that because the two are one, the Tribe Defendants did in fact file the underlying bankruptcy proceedings, thereby waiving their sovereign immunity as to all claims (including the avoidance claims alleged in this Adversary Proceeding) asserted as part of those underlying proceedings. The Litigation Trustee submits that if \"Plaintiff were successful in establishing that the Debtors were the alter egos of the Tribe Defendants such that their respective corporate veils should be pierced, the Tribe Defendants' sovereign immunity is waived by operation of law, not by implication.\" (Appellant's Br. 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   But even assuming without deciding that filing the underlying bankruptcy proceeding would be sufficient affirmative conduct on the part of the Tribe Defendants to clearly and unequivocally express their intent to waive their sovereign immunity to the fraudulent transfer claims at issue in this Adversary Proceeding (a claim that the Tribe Defendants contest), the Court must necessarily apply an equitable doctrine attributing legal significance to the Tribe Defendants' alleged conduct in controlling the Debtors, and then rely on that imputed conduct, to conclude that the Tribe Defendants unequivocally and clearly expressed their desire to waive their sovereign immunity to the claims asserted against them in this Adversary Proceeding. In urging the Court to adopt this admittedly unprecedented approach to waiver of sovereign tribal immunity, the Litigation Trustee relies principally on three cases:\n   <em>\n    Warburton/Buttner v.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   As the Litigation Trustee concedes, this appeal presents an issue of first impression as neither the parties nor the Court has unearthed a case in which a court has applied the equitable doctrines of alter-ego/veil piercing and/or agency to find that an Indian tribe waived it sovereign immunity. In the absence of a different directive from Congress or the Supreme Court or the Sixth Circuit limiting the breadth of tribal immunity, this Court is constrained to reject the Litigation Trustee's novel theory of implied waiver. The touchstone of the theory is the alleged conduct of the Tribe Defendants in controlling the Debtors and allegedly forcing the Debtors to initiate the underlying bankruptcy proceedings. This conduct, regardless of how the Litigation Trustee spins the theory, is the sole basis for implying a waiver that was not expressed through the required formal board resolution unequivocally consenting to suit on these MUFTA claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   There is no evidence in this case of clear express language, unequivocally stating the Tribe Defendants' intent to consent to the filing of these MUFTA claims against them.
