Cohen's (\"the Trustee\") appeal from the judgment of the Bankruptcy Court, which determined that property owned by now-deceased Gregory Chernushin (\"the Debtor\") is not part of the Debtor's bankruptcy estate but instead is owned by Defendant Andrea Chernushin free of the interest of others. This Court exercises jurisdiction over the appeal pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and 158(a)(1). The Court has reviewed the record and the parties' briefs. For the reasons set forth below, the Bankruptcy Court's judgment is AFFIRMED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following facts are undisputed. On August 17, 2015 the Debtor filed a voluntary Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. ECF No. 7-1 at 54. His wife, Mrs. Andrea Chernushin, neither joined his petition nor filed her own. At the time of his bankruptcy filing, the Debtor owned a vacation property located in Crested Butte, Colorado (\"the Property\"). The Debtor and Mrs. Chernushin owned the Property in joint tenancy with the right of survivorship. Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20541\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Debtor's interest in\n   the Property became part of his bankruptcy estate when he filed for bankruptcy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 2, 2015 the Court converted the Debtor's case to one under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code and the Trustee was appointed. On either June 8 or June 9, 2016 the Debtor died, but his death did not affect the progression of the bankruptcy case pursuant to Fed. R. Bankr. P. 1016. Days later, on June 15, 2016, the Trustee filed an adversary proceeding against the Debtor, Mrs. Chernushin, and two secured creditors in an effort to sell the Property. Mrs. Chernushin filed an answer in which she asserted that the Debtor's interest in the Property was terminated by operation of law on the day that he died, and therefore the Property was no longer part of the bankruptcy estate. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment on the issue. ECF No. 7-1 at 54. In an April 3, 2017 order, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Colorado granted Mrs. Chernushin's motion for summary judgment and determined that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   the Debtor's interest in the Property remained in joint tenancy, with its accompanying right of survivorship, until the time of his death. At the time of his death, the Debtor's interest in the Property terminated. The Defendant [Mrs. Chernushin] now owns the Property free of any interest of the Debtor. The Property is not property of the Debtor's bankruptcy estate, and the Trustee is not entitled to sell it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20541\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Bankruptcy Court thus entered judgment for Mrs. Chernushin and dismissed the adversary proceeding.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20541\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On May 3, 2017 the Trustee filed an appeal of the Bankruptcy Court's decision.

ECF No. 9.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Bankruptcy Court made its determination\n   based upon Colorado joint tenancy law, as codified in C.R.S. \u00a7 38-31-101. ECF No. 7-1. The Trustee alleges that the Bankruptcy Court \"ignored the Supremacy Clause of the United States and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20541\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \" and other provisions of the Bankruptcy Code in making this decision, and the Trustee argues that had the Bankruptcy Court properly applied federal law it would have ruled in the Trustee's favor.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20541\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   After reviewing the briefs and relevant law, I AFFIRM the Bankruptcy Court's grant of summary judgment and determination that the Property is no longer part of the bankruptcy estate. My reasoning is explained below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Debtor and Mrs. Chernushin owned the Property as joint tenants. \"[J]oint tenancy is a form of ownership in which each joint tenant possesses the entire estate, rather than a fractional share.\"\n   <em>\n    Taylor v. Canterbury\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9240654\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/92/961/#p964\">\n    92 P.3d 961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 964 (Colo. 2004). When a joint tenant dies, his or her interest in the property is terminated, and the surviving joint tenant's interest in the property continues free of the deceased joint tenant's interest. C.R.S. \u00a7 38-31-101(6)(c). Jointly held property remains in a joint tenancy unless that joint tenancy is severed.\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9240654\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/92/961/#p964\">\n    92 P.3d at 964\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The filing of the bankruptcy petition did not sever the joint tenancy, C.R.S. \u00a7 38-31-101(5)(b) and here neither party makes any other argument that severance occurred.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the parties concur that the joint tenancy remained intact until at least the day the Debtor died, and the only issue remaining is whether the Debtor's interest in the Property survives with the Trustee despite the Debtor's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   When a person files for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, his or her property is put into a \"bankruptcy estate\" from which his or her creditors will be paid.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20541\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The bankruptcy estate \"includes all legal or equitable interests of the debtor, including properties held in joint tenancy, at the commencement of this case.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20541\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   A trustee is appointed to oversee the bankruptcy estate and has a duty to recover and liquidate assets for the benefit of the Debtor's creditors.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20541\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 704(a). In this case, one such asset that the Trustee sought to liquidate for the benefit of the Debtor's creditors is the Property. The parties agree that when the Debtor filed for bankruptcy protection on August 17, 2015, the Trustee (on behalf of the bankruptcy estate) took over the Debtor's interest as a joint tenant in the Property and held this interest until at least the date of the Debtor's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   However, the parties disagree about the impact, if any, that the Debtor's death had on the Trustee's interest in the Property. The Trustee argues that the Debtor's death had no impact on the Trustee's interest in the Property because \"all of his property [had become] property of [the] bankruptcy estate,\" and the Trustee remained standing in the Debtor's place after\n   he died. ECF No. 9 at 10. Put differently, because the Trustee had taken the Debtor's place, the Trustee argues that the Debtor's death and resulting extinguishment of the Debtor's joint tenancy rights in the Property did not mean that the Trustee figuratively \"died\" and also lost rights to the Property. Instead, the Trustee argues that the Trustee lives on, and as a result, the joint tenancy interest does as well. Mrs. Chernushin contests this assertion, arguing that the Trustee acquired the same rights that the Debtor held in the Property, and that the Trustee cannot assert greater title than the Debtor himself could have asserted. Therefore, Mrs. Chernushin argues that when the Debtor died and his interest in the Property was terminated, the Trustee's interest in the Property was likewise terminated. I agree with Mrs. Chernushin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Tenth Circuit has made clear that while a trustee \"stands in the shoes\" of a debtor, the trustee is to \"take no greater rights than the debtor himself had.\"\n   <em>\n    Sender v. Buchanan\n   </em>\n   (In re Hedged-Investments Assocs., Inc.),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1793571,6464174\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/84/1281/\">\n    84 F.3d 1281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1285 (10th Cir. 1996) (internal citations omitted). Therefore, even though the Trustee acquired and controlled the Debtor's interest in the Property, the Trustee's interest remained subject to the same limitations as those limiting the Debtor.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1793571,6464174\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/84/1281/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Under joint tenancy law, the Debtor's rights in the Property were to be terminated upon his death. Because the Trustee stood in the Debtor's shoes, he too was encumbered by the statutory mandate that a joint tenant's rights are terminated upon death. Thus, when the Debtor died, his death terminated both his rights to the Property\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the Trustee's rights to the Property. \"Standing in the shoes\" of the Debtor does not mean that the Trustee's life can mitigate the Debtor's death in the context of joint tenancy rights. As stated by the Bankruptcy Court in this case, \"the Trustee has not cited any court to so hold, and this Court will not be the first.\" ECF No. 7-1 at 57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As an alternative argument, the Trustee posits that Colorado's joint tenancy laws are irrelevant because Colorado law is superseded by federal law in this case due to the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 9 (citing U.S. Const., Art. VI, Cl. 2 ). Here, the Trustee believes that the Bankruptcy Court's decision conflicts with federal laws that indicate that a debtor's death has no impact on a bankruptcy proceeding. For example, the Trustee cites Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 1016, which states that in the event the Debtor dies, \"the estate shall be administered and the case concluded in the same manner, so far as possible, as though the death...had not occurred.\" Further, the Trustee notes that under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20541\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) a bankruptcy estate \"includes all legal or equitable interests of the debtor, including properties held in joint tenancy,\n   <em>\n    at the commencement of this case\n   </em>\n   ,\" and therefore argues that the Debtor's death does not change the interest in the Property that the Trustee acquired from the Debtor at the commencement of the case.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20541\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (emphasis added). In the Trustee's view, the fact that the Debtor died is of no consequence to the Trustee's interest in the Property because there exists \"no provision or rule of the Bankruptcy Code that vitiates the Bankruptcy Estate's rights to the Crested Butte Property\" due to the death of the Debtor. ECF No. 9 at 4. The Trustee also points to a portion of the House Congressional Record that states: \"Once the estate is created, no interests in property of the estate remain in the debtor. Consequently, if the debtor dies during the case, only property exempted from property of the estate/acquired by the debtor after the commencement of the\n   case...will be available to the representative of the probate estate.\" HR Rep. 95-595, 368, 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5963, 6324. Based on these federal laws and Congressional record, the Trustee argues that under federal law the Property remains a part of the bankruptcy estate despite the Debtor's death. Because state joint tenancy law leads to the opposite result, the Trustee argues that Colorado law is in conflict with the federal laws. And because the Supremacy Clause mandates that federal laws trump conflicting state laws, the Trustee posits that it is improper to rely on Colorado joint tenancy law to determine this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   This argument is unavailing. While the Trustee is correct that there are federal laws describing the way trustees should treat property interests they hold in the event that a debtor dies, these federal laws do not displace the role of state law in answering the initial question of which property interests belong to the Trustee to begin with. The Supreme Court has made clear that \"[p]roperty interests are created and defined by state law\" in bankruptcy proceedings.\n   <em>\n    In re Marshall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3290728,5742310\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/550/1251/\">\n    550 F.3d 1251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1255 (10th Cir. 2008) (citing\n   <em>\n    Butner v.

It is not a violation of the Supremacy Clause for the Bankruptcy Court to apply state law in determining the property interests of the parties involved in the bankruptcy proceeding; indeed, that is the proper procedure. Here, the Bankruptcy Court correctly turned to Colorado law to determine the property interests of the parties. Because Colorado law expressly dictates that the property interests of a joint tenant (and thus of a trustee standing in his shoes) are terminated upon death, the Bankruptcy Court's determination that the Trustee's interest in the Property was also terminated is proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Finally, the Trustee argues that the Bankruptcy Court erred when it \"failed to address the authority of the Chapter 7 Trustee [u]nder\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20544\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\" ECF No. 9.
