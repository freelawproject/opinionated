Richard Caputo, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Presently before me is an appeal filed by Christopher Paige (\"Mr. Paige\") and Michele Paige (\"Ms. Paige\") (collectively, where appropriate, the \"Paiges\" or \"Appellants\") from the December 29, 2016 Order of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. In the proceedings below, the Bankruptcy Court found in favor of the Paiges on their motion for judgment on partial findings on all counts of the adversary complaint filed by\n   Lerner Master Fund, LLC (\"LMF\"). The Bankruptcy Court, however, subsequently denied the Paiges' requests that sanctions be imposed against LMF and its counsel, Attorney John C. Goodchild, III (\"Mr. Goodchild\") and the law firm of Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius LLP (\"Morgan Lewis\") (collectively, where appropriate, \"Appellees\"). The Paiges appeal the denial of their requests for sanctions, arguing that the Bankruptcy Court abused its discretion in declining to impose sanctions pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201927\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 9011(b), and/or the Bankruptcy Court's inherent power. The Paiges also appeal various interlocutory decisions of the Bankruptcy Court preceding the denial of their requests for sanctions. Because the Bankruptcy Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Paiges' motions for sanctions and the Paiges are not entitled to relief on the other issues they raise on appeal, the decision of the Bankruptcy Court will be affirmed and the Paiges' appeal will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    at 1176-1177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The Bankruptcy Court also found LMF's \u00a7 727(a)(3) claim failed because there was no evidence that the Paiges \"took any affirmative action to cause ... records not to be available to LMF or the Chapter 7 trustee.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1178). Regarding LMF's claims to the dischargeability of the debt under \u00a7 523(a)(4) and (6), the Bankruptcy Court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Michele's refusal to turn over the total fund to LMF at the end of a three year lock up was primarily motivated by her rather selfish desire that the hedge funds not be dissipated. While the fund remained under her control, she would continue to utilize it to fund expenses including her own income. This was the essential reason why the Delaware Court held her liable for breach of fiduciary responsibility. It was apparent, however, that Michele was not motivated by some malicious motive such as theft of funds, fraud on the principal, or some false pretense. She, rightly or wrongly, relied on a contractual provision allowing her company to \"gate\" the withdrawal so that only 20% of the investment could be withdrawn each year. This procedure has been recognized as a device to protect fund managers, not the investors. Tr. # 261 at 154. It so happens that LMF was by far the only significant investor and by acting in her own self interest and not that of the client, the Delaware Court found that Michele Paige breached her fiduciary responsibility. Nevertheless, on advice of counsel, both Christopher and an outside attorney, she did rely upon the terms of a contract between the parties in refusing to turn over the investment at the end of the three year \"lock up.\" On examination, Christopher Paige opined, without challenge, that a hedge fund was a compensation vehicle for its manager. It was \"a way of hiring an investor [sic] that you couldn't afford to pay a salary.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   It has been said that adherence to a contract does not violate a duty of good faith.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    for example\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Creeger Brick &amp; Bldg.

Furthermore, a review of the rather detailed Delaware Court decision reinforces the conclusion that the issues litigated between the parties were certainly intense and acrimonious, but they turned on contractual provisions and not reckless or fraudulent conduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   It should go without saying that unless Count I could be established against Michele Paige, then Count III alleging that Christopher \"aided and abetted\" her would also come up short.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 525-527). Use of that power was not appropriate, according to the Bankruptcy Court, because: (1) LMF \"at all times, acted professionally in court proceedings\"; (2) since the Amended Adversary Complaint \"did not violate the Rule 9011 standard of objective reasonableness [it], therefore, by definition was not in bad faith\"; and (3) that sanctions are warranted for \"vexatious proceedings, but not weak cases.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 526).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As such, by Order dated December 29, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court entered judgment in favor of Mr. Paige and Ms. Paige and against LMF, but denied the Paiges' requests for sanctions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 537).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Instant Appeal.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Paiges timely filed a Notice of Appeal to this Court of the Bankruptcy Court's December 29, 2016 Order. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1,\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   ).

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 4,\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   ). While the Paiges appear to challenge virtually every adverse ruling of the Bankruptcy Court, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1,\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   ; Doc. 4,\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   ), the issues raised on appeal loosely assign error to: (1) the Bankruptcy Court's finding as to the timeliness of the Adversary Complaint; (2) the Bankruptcy Court's resolution of discovery and evidentiary issues pertaining to the motions for sanctions; and (3) the Bankruptcy Court's ultimate decision denying the requests for sanctions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 6, A-27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Paiges submitted their opening brief in support of their appeal on January 17, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 6,\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   ). On February 13, 2017, LMF filed its appellee brief.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   As stated, the Paiges generally contend that: (1) the Bankruptcy Court erred in its disposition of LMF's motion to extend time to file the Adversary Complaint; (2) the Bankruptcy Court wrongly ruled on discovery and evidentiary issues relating to their motions for sanctions; and (3) the Bankruptcy Court abused its discretion in declining to sanction LMF, Mr. Goodchild, and/or Morgan Lewis. I will address each of these contentions in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Motion to Extend.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Based on the initial scheduling of the \u00a7 341 meeting of creditors, the last day for LMF to file its Adversary Complaint was December 6, 2011. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 34, 2). As the \u00a7 341 meeting was not concluded by this date, LMF, on December 1, 2011, five (5) days before its complaint was due, filed a motion to extend the time for filing a complaint to determine dischargeability to twenty (20) days after the conclusion of the \u00a7 341 meeting. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 67, 92a-97a). Thereafter, LMF and Ms. Spott entered into a stipulation providing that if the Bankruptcy Court denied LMF's December 1, 2011 motion to extend the deadline, LMF would still have five (5) days from the date of the denial of that motion to file a complaint to determine dischargeability. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 67, 98a-99a). LMF, though, subsequently learned from Ms. Spott that the Paiges were unhappy with the December 6, 2011 stipulation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 65, 42:15-24, 78:17-79:1). A few days after learning that Ms. Spott no longer represented the Paiges, LMF, while its motion to extend was still pending, filed its Adversary Complaint, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 35, 10;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 28, 37-51), which the Paiges moved to dismiss on timeliness grounds. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 161-204). The Bankruptcy Court held a hearing on the motion to extend and the timeliness of the Adversary Complaint. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 58,\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   ). Following the hearing, the Bankruptcy Court granted the motion to extend, concluding that: (1) the stipulation between Ms. Spott and LMF was enforceable; and (2) \"[r]egardless of the enforceability of the joint stipulation,\" \"independent grounds for such an extension exist[ed] under Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 4007(c).\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 29, 1004-1014). The Paiges challenge this ruling on appeal.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 29, 1009-1011).

The Discovery and Evidentiary Rulings.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Before and during the four day evidentiary hearing on the Paiges' requests for sanctions, the Bankruptcy Court made a number of discovery and evidentiary rulings which the Paiges challenge on appeal. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 15, 515-517; Doc. 37, 122:8-123:4, 125:16-23, 128:14-21; Doc. 24, 1257; Doc. 16, 1206-1209;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 40, 57:1-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   First, the Paiges contend that the Bankruptcy Court erred by denying its request for discovery of LMF and its counsel in support of its motions for sanctions.

Here, the record is devoid of evidence of \"extraordinary circumstances\" suggesting that discovery in support of the sanctions motion was appropriate. Similarly absent from the record is any \"clear need\" for the deposition of Mr. Goodchild to have been compelled. In these circumstances, the Bankruptcy Court cannot be said to have abused its discretion in denying the sanctions-related discovery requests. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 40, 57:1-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Second, the Paiges contend that the Bankruptcy Court erroneously ruled on evidentiary issues during the hearing on the motions for sanctions.

More particularly, the Paiges claim that the Bankruptcy Court should have admitted the emails between LMF employees that were produced during the Delaware Litigation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 6, 31-33). The Paiges also argue that the Bankruptcy Court wrongly admitted settlement negotiation letters that were offered by LMF.

With respect to the settlement communications, the Bankruptcy Court properly overruled the Paiges' objections thereto because those communications were offered to rebut the claim that LMF unduly delayed the bankruptcy proceedings. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 37, 122:8-123:4, 125:16-23, 128:14-21);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 408(b) (evidence of compromise offers and negotiations may be admitted \"for another purpose, such as ... negating a contention of undue delay ...\"). Similarly, the Bankruptcy Court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to admit the email communications between LMF employees regarding the Paiges. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 15, 515-517). The Bankruptcy Court ruled that those emails were not relevant to the Paiges' requests for sanctions because,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , they were not prepared by LMF during the pendency of the bankruptcy proceeding, they were not sent by LMF's counsel in this proceeding, and there was no evidence connecting these emails pre-dating the Delaware Litigation to LMF's decision to file the Adversary Complaint and continue to litigate the adversary proceeding.

As previously stated, the Bankruptcy Court found that sanctions were not warranted under \u00a7 1927, Rule 9011(b), and/or its inherent sanction power. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 15, 519-537).

And, in applying that law to the facts of this case, the Bankruptcy Court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the Adversary Complaint as originally filed was not frivolous or meritless.

Based on the outcome of the Delaware Litigation and the findings of the Court of Chancery therein, the Bankruptcy Court rightly found that LMF's allegations in the Amended Adversary Complaint \"appeared likely to have evidentiary support when filed and later advocated,\" especially in light of LMF's success against Ms. Paige in the Delaware\n   Litigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Based on the record, I am unable to find that the Bankruptcy Court abused its discretion in determining that Rule 9011(b) sanctions were not warranted based on LMF's commencement of adversary proceedings against the Paiges or LMF's advancement through trial of the claims set forth in the Amended Adversary Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Lastly, the Bankruptcy Court's refusal to impose sanctions pursuant to its inherent power was not an abuse of discretion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 15, 525-527).

The Bankruptcy Court found that as the Amended Adversary Complaint was objectively reasonable, the claims were not brought in bad faith. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 15, 526). Likewise, the Bankruptcy Court explained that there was no basis to impose sanctions on LMF for its counsel's conduct at trial because its \"behavior through the course of the proceedings was quite restrained.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Nothing in the record suggests an abuse of discretion in this finding. Lastly, the Bankruptcy Court rejected the Paiges' request to impose sanctions on LMF for its pursuit of a \"weak\" case through trial because sanctions are appropriate for \"vexatious proceedings, but not weak cases.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). As found by the Bankruptcy Court, the record does not support the use of the Court's inherent sanction power on the facts and proceedings of this case. Thus, the Bankruptcy Court did not abuse its discretion in declining to impose sanctions against LMF based on its inherent power.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The Paiges raise a number of issues with respect to the Bankruptcy Court's denial of their requests for sanctions under \u00a7 1927, Rule 9011(b), and/or its inherent sanction power. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 6, 1-38). First, the Paiges essentially contend that sanctions were appropriate because LMF unnecessarily delayed and stalled the litigation process resulting in the adversary proceedings lasting nearly five (5) years. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11). There is nothing in the record to support the imposition of sanctions for the length of these proceedings, nor is there any evidence that LMF unreasonably multiplied the proceedings. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 15, 523-524). Second, the Paiges argue that sanctions were appropriate because of Appellees' conduct throughout the adversary proceedings, which included making false representations to prosecute claims Appellees knew to be false. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 6, 14-20, 23-24, 28-29). The Paiges' characterization of the proceedings, though, is not supported by the record and I am unable to find that LMF or its counsel made any false representations or prosecuted false claims before the Bankruptcy Court. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 15, 520). Third, the Paiges maintain that the Bankruptcy Court incorrectly construed their requests for sanctions by considering only the reasonableness of the Adversary Complaint when filed without addressing LMF's counsel's subsequent conduct in investigating and advancing those claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 6, 24-27). That argument is without merit given the Bankruptcy Court's sanction opinion noting that the Paiges claimed that\n   LMF \"violated Rule 9011 by filing and\n   <em>\n    later pursuing\n   </em>\n   that Complaint....\" (Doc. 15, 525 (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (LMF's allegations \"appeared likely to have evidentiary support when filed and\n   <em>\n    later advocated.\n   </em>\n   \");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 526 (addressing the essence of the Paiges' claim that \"LMF\n   <em>\n    advanced\n   </em>\n   the Complaint with as weak a case as it manifested at trial.\") ). Finally, the Paiges challenge the Bankruptcy Court's conclusion that the email communications between LMF's associates did not justify imposing sanctions against LMF or its counsel. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 6, 30-31). The Bankruptcy Court did not abuse its discretion in finding that those communications were not dispositive of any issue in the adversary proceeding. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 15, 523).

Ms. Paige, though, appears to have never practiced as an attorney or applied to be a member of a state bar. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. 53, 10:11-24). The Paiges are representing themselves\n    <em>\n     pro se\n    </em>\n    in this appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    In the Court of Chancery's decision, it observed that email banter between LMF's employees about Ms. Paige's appearance was inappropriate, derogatory, immature, and degrading.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at *7. Nevertheless, the court rejected the Paiges' contention that the emails were evidence of LMF's personal antipathy to injure Ms. Paige.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    LMF indicates that its Appellee brief is also submitted on behalf of Mr. Goodchild and Morgan Lewis to the extent they are proper appellees in this matter. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. 67, 9 n.1). The Paiges in response to the Appellee brief filed a notice of mootness and a motion to strike and/or force amendment to that brief on the basis that the brief was not signed or filed on behalf of Mr. Goodchild or Morgan Lewis. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. 69,\n    <em>\n     generally\n    </em>\n    ). However, as the docket reflects, the Appellee brief was submitted electronically on behalf of LMF, Mr. Goodchild, and Morgan Lewis. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    docket,\n    <em>\n     generally\n    </em>\n    ). The Paiges' motion will thus be denied.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    Bankruptcy Rule 9011 is the equivalent sanctions rule to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, and, as such, cases decided pursuant to Rule 11 also apply to Rule 9011.\n    <em>\n     In re Miller\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703639,5870095\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/730/198/\">\n     730 F.3d 198\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 204 (3d Cir. 2013).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
