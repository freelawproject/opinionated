Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff filed this adversary proceeding on July 6, 2016 seeking specific performance or, alternatively, damages for breach of contract. [Doc. 1 (the \"Original Complaint\") ]. Defendants filed motions to dismiss the Original Complaint. [Docs. 11, 12]. The Court granted the motions to dismiss with leave for Plaintiff to make limited amendments to the Complaint (the \"Dismissal Order\"). [Doc. 21]. Plaintiff filed a motion to reconsider the order granting the motions to dismiss (the \"Motion to Reconsider\") [Doc. 23] and filed an\n   amended complaint (the \"Amended Complaint\"). [Doc. 30]. Defendants filed motions to dismiss the Amended Complaint (the \"Second Motions to Dismiss\") [Docs. 40, 41]. The Court herein considers Plaintiff's Motion to Reconsider and Defendants' Second Motions to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The parties and other relevant persons in this proceeding are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \u2022 Rohrig Investments, LP (\"Plaintiff\"): the Debtor-Plaintiff in this proceeding;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \u2022 Knuckle Partnership, LLLP (\"Knuckle\"), 3116-3136 Roswell Road, LLC (\"3116\"), and Robert C. Loudermilk, Jr. (\"Robin\" or \"Robin Loudermilk\" and with Knuckle and 3116, the \"Loudermilk Parties\"): Defendants in this proceeding;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u2022 3110 Roswell Road, LLC (\"3110\" and with the Loudermilk Parties, the \"Defendants\"): a Defendant in this proceeding;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 George W. Rohrig, Jr. (\"George\" or \"George Rohrig\" and with Plaintiff, the \"Rohrig Parties\"): a principal of Plaintiff;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 R. Charles Loudermilk, Sr. (\"Charlie\" or \"Charlie Loudermilk\"): a principal of 3110.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff's Original Complaint contained two counts-one for specific performance and one for breach of contract. In summary, the Original Complaint alleged as follows: 3116 owns real property in the Buckhead District of Atlanta, which it agreed to sell for more than $10 million. The deal was temporarily halted when Plaintiff filed in the county real property records a document asserting an interest in parking rights in the property. Thereafter, 3116 filed an adversary proceeding against Plaintiff and George Rohrig to remove the affidavit from the public record (the \"Parking Rights Dispute\" or the \"Parking Rights AP\"). The parties settled the matter, along with other disputes, under terms set forth in a settlement agreement. [Doc. 30-1, Ex. 6, hereinafter the \"Agreement\" or the \"Settlement Agreement\"]. The Settlement Agreement required the Loudermilk Parties to obtain from 3110 and convey to Plaintiff a deed to the 8 at 8 office building (the \"8 at 8 Property\"), an extension of the property lines for the 8 at 8 Property (the \"Disputed Property\"), and an easement for a pedestrian walkway (the \"Breezeway,\" and with the 8 at 8 Property and the Disputed Property, the \"8 at 8 Properties\"). Plaintiff complied with all its obligations under the Settlement Agreement, but Defendants failed to convey the entirety of the 8 at 8 Properties. The dispute primarily centers on the language \"to the extent it is legally possible, the Loudermilk Parties will obtain ... and convey ... an extension of the property lines for the 8 at 8 Property westward to Early Street ....\" [Settlement Agreement \u00a7 3.0].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Court granted Defendants' motions to dismiss the Original Complaint in their entirely because the Court found that: (1) it was not legally possible for the Loudermilk Parties to convey all of the Disputed Property when the property owner refused to agree to the transfer, (2) the description of a portion of the property to be conveyed was not adequately described, and (3) Plaintiffs failed to allege sufficient facts to state a claim against 3110 based on an agency relationship between the Loudermilk Parties and 3110. [Doc. 21]. The Dismissal Order further granted Plaintiff limited leave to amend the complaint. In the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff has supplemented its allegations to address the agency question, the sufficiency of the description, generally provide greater detail, and has added equitable claims against Defendants. The Amended Complaint includes the following documents attached as exhibits:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (1) 2006 Consolidation Map; (2) 2007 Boundary Survey; (3) Limited Warranty Deed to 3110 Roswell Road, LLC; (4) Limited Warranty Deed to Rohrig Investments, LP; (5) 2007 Valentino Survey; (6) Settlement Order and Settlement Agreement; (7) 2014 Rohrig Survey (with Valentino email exchange); (8) email exchange from Mr. Teague to Mr. Howard to Mr. Frasier; (9) Valentino email to Rohrig Investments with Replat Survey; (10) email from Mr. Howard to Mr. Frasier by way of Valentino; (11) Section 3.0 Letter from Mike King; and (12) Proposed Deed for Specific Performance. In addition, the Amended Complaint contains lengthy quotations from the transcript of a hearing held in this Court on October 28, 2014. A copy of the transcript is filed in the main bankruptcy case. [Case No. 13-53483, Doc. 1121, hereinafter \"Hearing Tr.\"].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Amended Complaint includes counts for specific performance against all Defendants; breach of contract against all Defendants; breach of contract against the Loudermilk Parties; quantum meriut and unjust enrichment against 3110; and reformation of the Settlement Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As a preliminary matter, Defendants contend the Motion to Reconsider is moot because the Amended Complaint supersedes the original complaint. [Doc. 52 at 2, 53]. Defendants are correct in stating the general rule.\n   <em>\n    Pintando v. Miami-Dade Housing Agency\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3706784\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/501/1241/#p1243\">\n    501 F.3d 1241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1243 (11th Cir. 2007). However, the general rule does not address the effect of an amended complaint on a pending motion to reconsider dismissal. \"A rule that a party waives all objections to the court's dismissal if the party elects to amend is too mechanical ....Without more, the action of the amending party should not result in completely denying the right to appeal the court's ruling.\" 6 Fed.

Usually this issue arises when the plaintiff opts not to reassert a dismissed claim in the amended complaint. Here, all of Plaintiff's claims from the Original Complaint are subsumed in the Amended Complaint. Nevertheless, in an abundance of caution and to preserve any appeal rights held by Plaintiff, the Court will consider the Motion to Reconsider in conjunction with the Second Motions to Dismiss as all the issues raised in the Motion to Reconsider are relevant to determination of the Second Motions to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Plaintiff, Knuckle, and Robin Loudermilk owned membership interests in two limited liability companies: Loudermilk/Rohrig, LLC and 335 West Ponce Shoppes, LLC. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11]. Plaintiff and Knuckle owned membership interests in Loudermilk/Rohrig 3261, LLC (with Loudermilk/Rohrig, LLC and 335 West Ponce Shoppes, LLC, the \"LLCs\"). [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] The LLCs own various real estate properties.

[\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On the petition date, Plaintiff and Robin Loudermilk were co-managing members of the LLCs. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17]. As a result of Plaintiff's bankruptcy filing, Knuckle and Robin Loudermilk asserted that Plaintiff had become dissociated pursuant to the operating agreements of the LLCs and that Plaintiff was no longer authorized to act as a co-managing member of the LLCs. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18]. Knuckle and Robin sought and obtained stay relief to enforce the dissociation provisions in the LLCs' operating agreements.

At that time, Charlie Loudermilk was identified as the registered agent and remained so through the administrative dissolution of the LLC in 2011. [Id \u00b6 24-25]. Charlie and Plaintiff each owned a 50% interest in 3084. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27]. Plaintiff alleges on information and belief that 3110, which is 100% owned by Charlie Loudermilk, substituted in for Charlie as a 50% member of 3084 before July 31, 2007.

[\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34]. The option agreement was extended twice, first through January 18, 2007 and then through January 19, 2007. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35-36]. The second amendment to the option agreement provided that 3084 would transfer an undivided 50% interest in the 3116 Property to Plaintiff, and then 3084 and Plaintiff would transfer their respective 50% interests in the 3116 Property to Novare. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37]. The second amendment also provided that 3084 and Plaintiff would have an opportunity to participate in the ownership of an LLC that would own and operate the parking garage that Novare intended to build on the 3116 Property. [\n   <em>\n    I\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    d.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On January 19, 2007, the following transactions occurred: Novare assigned its interest in the option agreement to 3116 Roswell Road, LLC (the \"Roswell LLC\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   which was 100% owned by Novare. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39]. The Roswell LLC purchased the 3116 Property, and 3084 and Plaintiff each transferred their 50% interest in the 3116 Property to the Roswell LLC, leaving 3084\n   with the 3084 Roswell Road parcel. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40-43].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The 3084 Roswell Road parcel was thereafter split into three tracts. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47]. In connection with the split, 3084 ordered a boundary survey, which was dated September 17, 2004 and last revised on August 1, 2007 (the \"2007 Survey\"). [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44-46, Ex. 2]. The 2007 Survey depicts the Roswell Road Property as a whole and depicts the 3084 Roswell Road parcel split into three tracts: (1) a tract containing the Roxy Theatre and all of the 8 at 8 Properties (\"Tract 1\"); (2) a tract containing the demised interior wall space of .00745 acres sitting between the buildings numbered 3098 and 3102 Roswell Road (\"Tract 2\"); and (3) a tract containing retail shops south of 8 at 8 (\"Tract 3\"). [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On July 31, 2007, 3084 transferred Tract 1 to Defendant 3110. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53, Ex. 3]. Plaintiff alleges on information and belief that Charlie Loudermilk is the manager and sole member of 3110. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52]. Also on July 31, 2007, 3084 transferred Tract 2 and Tract 3 to Plaintiff. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54, Ex. 4]. All the transfers were made by limited warranty deeds that incorporated the 2007 Survey. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In September 2007, Plaintiff, George Rohrig, and Gary Pollock ordered a boundary, topographic, and utility survey for the 3084 Roswell Road parcel and property to the south of that parcel (the \"Valentino Survey\"). [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58, Ex. 5]. The Valentino Survey was plotted on November 19, 2007 and incorporates the 2007 Survey among other things. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On March 31, 2008, the Roswell LLC sold the 3116 Property to 305-309 Pharr Road, LLC (\"Pharr Road LLC\"). [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60]. Pharr Road LLC was organized by Mr. Teague on February 22, 2007, with Robin Loudermilk identified as its initial registered agent. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62]. In connection with the sale of the 3116 Property to Pharr Road LLC, Plaintiff agreed to execute a termination of the second amendment to the option agreement described above, which had provided Plaintiff an opportunity to participate in the ownership of an LLC that would own and operate the parking garage that Novare intended to build on the site. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63]. Plaintiff agreed to sign the termination agreement based on representations from Charlie Loudermilk that Plaintiff's rights under the second amendment would nevertheless be preserved. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64]. Contemporaneous with execution of the termination agreement, Charlie and George Rohrig executed a handwritten agreement providing that in exchange for Plaintiff signing the termination agreement, Charlie would honor any rights George currently had pursuant to the second amendment. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65-66]. Thus, by March 31, 2008, the Loudermilks owned the 3116 Property. [\n   <em>\n    I\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    d.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On December 23, 2009, Pharr Road LLC changed its name to 3116-3136 Roswell Road, LLC, which is Defendant 3116 in this proceeding. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68]. 3116 represented to this Court on October 20, 2014 in support of its request for a temporary restraining order in the Parking Rights Dispute, that Plaintiff has never owned an interest in Pharr Road, LLC or in 3116. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69]. Defendant 3116 also represented to this Court that Charlie Loudermilk, Robin Loudermilk, and Greg Howard (\"Greg Howard\" or \"Mr. Howard\") owned Pharr Road LLC and now own 3116, which owns the 3116 Property. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 70].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On August 12, 2014, 3116 agreed to sell the 3116 Property to Hanover R.S. Limited Partnership (\"Hanover\") for more than $10 million. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72]. Prior to the sale, Plaintiff filed an Affidavit Regarding Parking Rights in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia, in which Plaintiff claimed parking rights in the 3116 Property by virtue of the second amendment to the\n   option agreement, the termination agreement, and the handwritten agreement. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73-74]. Thereafter, 3116 commenced the Parking Rights AP against Plaintiff and George Rohrig to remove the parking rights affidavit from the public record. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On October 22, 2014, the Rohrigs (including Rohrig Investments, George Rohrig, Matt Rohrig, Al Rohrig, John Frasier, Stephen DeWitt) and their attorneys from Stone &amp; Baxter engaged in extensive negotiations with the Loudermilks (including Robin Loudermilk, Mr. Howard, Knuckle, and 3116) and their respective attorneys from Greenberg Traurig and McKenna Long. [\n   <em>\n    I\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    d.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76]. The purpose of the negotiations was to reach a consensual resolution of three related matters: (1) the dissociation issue; (2) the division of ownership of the LLCs' property; and (3) the Parking Rights Dispute. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 77]. Although the parties did not resolve the disputes at that time, the template for their eventual settlement arose, including the concepts of splitting the LLCs' properties between the two sides, assenting on the dissociation issue as a result of the property split, and conveyance of the 8 at 8 Properties from the Loudermilks to the Rohrigs to resolve the Parking Rights Dispute. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 78].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On October 23, 2014, on behalf of the Rohrigs, Ward Stone emailed a global settlement offer to Mike King for the Loudermilks that proposed with respect to the Parking Rights Dispute that \"Rohrig gets the '8 at 8' space including land all the way to Early [S]treet ....\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 79-80]. On October 25, 2014, on behalf of the Loudermilks, Mike King emailed a counter offer to Ward Stone for the Rohrigs setting out what each of the relevant Loudermilk parties (including 3110) was willing to do to reach a global settlement. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 81]. With respect to the Parking Rights Dispute, the counter offer proposed that the \"8 at 8 retail space\" owned by 3110 \"will be transferred to Rohrig as platted, without an extension to Early Street.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 82]. Mike King also indicated that under the counter offer there \"will be complete releases of the LLC members and their principals and related parties (including Robert C. Loudermilk, Sr., Robert C. Loudermilk, Jr., Knuckle, George Rohrig and Rohrig Investments).\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 83]. Thereafter, Ward Stone responded with a further counter offer that provided that the \"8 at 8 retail space will be transferred to Rohrig as platted, with [typo omitted] an extension to Early Street, adjustable as necessary as to not interfere with the existing Roxy encroachments.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84-85].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On October 28, 2014, the parties attended a hearing in the Parking Rights AP. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 86]. In lieu of an evidentiary hearing, the parties conducted a global settlement conference at the courthouse, with the following persons in attendance: For the Rohrigs: Plaintiff, George Rohrig, John Frasier, Matt Rohrig, Al Rohrig, Stephien Dewitt, and their attorneys Ward Stone and David Bury; for the Loudermilks: Robin Loudermilk, Greg Howard, Knuckle, 3116, their attorneys from Greenberg (Ernest Greer, Mike King, and Sean Gordon), and their attorney from McKenna Long (Gary Marsh). [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   87-88]. Discussions included the issue of how to resolve the Parking Rights Dispute to permit the sale of the 3116 Property to Hanover to proceed and to find a substitute for the parking rights that Plaintiff would have to relinquish for the sale to proceed. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 89]. During the discussions, Robin Loudermilk and Greg Howard agreed that 3110 would convey the 8 at 8 Property to Plaintiff with an extension of the property line on the 8 at 8 Property to Early Street on the condition that the extension to Early Street would be accompanied by cross-easements for the Loudermilks' use of the Roxy Theatre's loading dock and the area\n   surrounding the loading dock. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 91]. The parties in the settlement conference were aware that the agreed on extension would cover a portion of the loading dock. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 92].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The litigation attorneys in attendance were without their real estate specialists and access to the plats, surveys, and the real estate record. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 93]. As the settlement conference was being conducted on the Court's schedule, and the Court was awaiting announcements, the attorneys agreed that 3110 would convey the 8 at 8 Property with an extension to Early Street over the dock so long as extending the property line in that manner was \"legally possible\" after consulting such specialists and real estate documents. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Having reached a global agreement in principle, the Loudermilks and their attorneys left 3110 an \"out\" for matters in the real estate record or arising by operation of real estate law over which 3110 had no control. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 95].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Rohrig Parties and the Loudermilk Parties announced the terms of the settlement to the Court on October 28, 2014 (the \"Announced Settlement\"). [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 96]. Mike King, on behalf of 3116, read the settlement terms to the Court on the understanding that other attorneys who participated in the settlement conference would supplement or clarify. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 97]. Mr. King stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Within three business days, the owner of a property on Roswell Road that houses the 8 at 8 store, that LLC is controlled by Robert C. Loudermilk, Senior, will deliver a deed to Rohrig Investments for the 8 at 8 property by limited warranty deed in fee subject to encumbrances of record.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   In addition, it is the intention of the parties that, to the extent it is legally possible to extend the property lines bordering the 8 at 8 property to Early Street ... and subject to documentation and survey, as necessary ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   To the extent that that is possible, a deed will be delivered giving that extension of property, subject to necessary cross-easements, as necessary, to also serve the Loudermilk-Knuckle and other Loudermilk properties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 98, quoting Hearing Tr. at p.3 li. 15-25, p.4 li. 8-11.] Mr. King further stated that \"[t]he releases that are intended are intended to be very broad, and will include the principals and related parties, and it is here on my notes, the LLCs themselves, the members, their principals, related parties. And that includes also Greg Howard, who is a member of 3116.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 99, quoting Hearing Tr. at p.8 li. 4-8.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Mr. Marsh also stated on the record that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   The only part of the settlement the parties would envision implementing immediately, really is a settlement of the adversary proceeding so the quit-claim deed for 3116 and the deed to the Debtor of the 8 at 8 space, that would happen prior to Court approval of the over all settlement. But that we would implement this week, is the understanding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   And then the reciprocal easement that Mr. King talked about relating to the 8 at 8 would help service the Buckhead Theater. That would be an easement of access for that property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 100, quoting Hearing Tr. at p.11 li. 13-22.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Following the October 28, 2014 hearing, the attorneys for the parties began documenting the Settlement Agreement. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 101]. After exchanging at least 15 drafts, the Rohrig Parties and the Loudermilk Parties reduced the Announced Settlement to the Settlement Agreement. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 102]. Plaintiff alleges on information and belief that the Loudermilk Parties executed the\n   Settlement Agreement and delivered their signatures to the Rohrig Paries on November 8, 2014. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 103]. The Rohrig Parties executed the Settlement Agreement, and delivered their signatures to the Loudermilk Parties on November 10, 2014. However, the Settlement Agreement and the parties' respective obligations under the Settlement Agreement were expressly subject to and dependent on Bankruptcy Court approval under Rule 9019. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 105].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Settlement Agreement incorporates the Announced Settlement by express reference. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 106]. The Settlement Agreement required the following, each of which was to serve as an initial undertaking to effectuate the Settlement Agreement: (i) withdrawal of 3116's objection to confirmation of Plaintiff's Chapter 11 plan (which occurred prior to confirmation of the plan); (ii) dismissal of the Parking Rights AP without prejudice (which occurred on October 29, 2014); (iii) withdrawal of Robin Loudermilk's and Knuckle's proofs of claims and Plaintiff's objections to the claims (which occurred on December 4, 2014 and December 8, 2014, respectively); and (iv) dismissal of the stay relief appeal (which occurred on December 8, 2014). [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 107].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Section 3.0 of the Settlement Agreement provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Within three (3) business days of Authorization, the Loudermilk Parties will obtain from 3110 Roswell Road, LLC and deliver to Rohrig a Limited Warranty Deed granting title to Rohrig of property known as the 8 at 8 space subject to encumbrances of record. The 8 at 8 space (the \"8 at 8 Property\") is currently a part of property numbered in Fulton County, Georgia as 3110 Roswell Road. In consultation with Rohrig's surveyors and attorneys, and to the extent it is legally possible, the Loudermilk Parties will obtain from 3110 Roswell Road, LLC and convey to Rohrig by limited warranty deed an extension of the property lines for the 8 at 8 Property westward to Early Street subject to documentation and surveys, as necessary. Any extension of the property lines will include cross easements for the benefit of 3110 Roswell Road, LLC and the Loudermilk Parties. In addition, the Loudermilk Parties will obtain from 3110 Roswell Road and convey to Rohrig an easement for pedestrian traffic to the portion of the 3110 Roswell Road property commonly known as the \"breezeway.\" The Rohrig Parties and the Loudermilk Parties will split the costs of documentation and surveys related to the conveyance of the 8 at 8 Property, and any extension or relocation of property lines, up to $10,000 on a 50-50 basis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 110, quoting Settlement Agreement \u00a7 3.0]. Section 4.0 of the Settlement Agreement states that Plaintiff and George Rohrig have \"already delivered to 3116 a Quitclaim Deed conveying any rights they have in the 3116 Property, including a release of parking rights.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 111, quoting Settlement Agreement \u00a7 4.0].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   What the parties call the 8 at 8 Property is currently a part of property numbered in Fulton County, Georgia, as 3110 Roswell Road and owned by 3110. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 109]. The agreement by the Loudermilk Parties to deed the 8 at 8 Property to Plaintiff and the agreement by the Rohrig Parties to quitclaim any interest in the parking spaces at the 3116 Property was a one-to-one deal in which both properties were viewed as being equally valuable to the receiving party. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 108].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   On November 13, 2014, Plaintiff filed its Motion for Authorization to Enter Into a Compromise and Settlement Agreement\n   Pursuant to Rule 9019. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 112]. On or before November 14, 2014, Plaintiff asked Valentino to update the Valentino Survey to reflect a conveyance from 3110 to Plaintiff of the 8 at 8 Property in the extended configuration contemplated in the Announced Settlement and the Settlement Agreement. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 113]. On November 20, 2014, Valentino delivered the updated survey (the \"Rohrig Survey\") to Plaintiff by email along with a legal description of the property to be conveyed. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 115, 116]. In the email, Valentino stated that the property would have to be replatted to combine the 0.075 acres\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   with Plaintiff's property to the south. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 117, Ex. 7]. Plaintiff alleges that this email demonstrates that Valentino viewed the Settlement Agreement as simply contemplating that the northern building line on the 8 at 8 Property would be extended to Early Street and that the line would replace the existing boundary line between Plaintiff's and 3110's properties. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 118].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Plaintiff alleges on information and belief that during the week of December 1, 2014, Mr. Howard transmitted the Rohrig Survey to Mr. Teague for preparation of a limited warranty deed transferring the 8 at 8 Properties as depicted on the Rohrig Survey from 3110 to Plaintiff. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 121].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Court heard the settlement motion on December 3, 2014 and entered an order approving the Settlement on December 4, 2014 at 10:45 am. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 122-123]. The field study for the Rohrig Survey and the Rohrig Survey itself pre-dated this Court's approval of the Settlement Agreement. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 124].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Later on December 4, 2014, at 1:38 pm, Mr. Teague emailed Mr. Howard a draft limited warranted deed (the \"Draft Deed\") that conformed to the Rohrig Survey and legal description. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 125-127, Ex. 8]. The email stated that \"The survey also needs to be addressed to 3110 Roswell Road, LLC.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 125]. Mr. Teague also described the cross-easements over the loading dock and the breezeway easement\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and 3110's remaining property following the transfer. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 128-129]. Mr. Teague also reserved for 3110 a permanent, no-build easement, preventing Plaintiff from constructing additional buildings or vertical improvements on the property. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 130].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Also on December 4, 2014, about two hours after receiving the Draft Deed from Mr. Teague, Mr. Howard forwarded Mr. Teague's email and Draft Deed to John Frasier, a principal of Plaintiff. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 131]. In doing so Mr. Teague wrote that \"we need Valentino to address the survey to 3110 Roswell Road, LLC.... I will not be able to provide an executed copy tomorrow, but can provide on Monday [December 8, 2014].\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 132]. Plaintiff alleges on information and belief that Mr. Howard transmitted the Draft Deed to Mr. Frasier with express authority from 3110, and that Mr. Howard has express authority from 3110 to represent to Mr. Frasier that the Draft Deed would be executed by Monday, December 8, 2014. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 133-34].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Because Mr. Howard approved the Rohrig Survey, instructed Mr. Teague to base the Draft Deed on the Rohrig Survey, and forwarded Mr. Teague's work product on behalf of 3110 to Plaintiff, all without objection, it appears the Rohrig Parties, the Loudermilk Parties, Valentino, Mr. Howard, Mr. Teague, and 3110 all interpreted the Settlement Agreement in the same way with respect to the identity of the 8 at\n   8 Property, the extension of the property line, the conveyance of a portion of the loading dock, and the meaning of \"legally possible.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 135].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   On December 12, 2014, Bill Busby of Valentino sent a follow up email to Plaintiff, with documents necessary for replatting the property, including a replat survey. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 137-140, Ex. 9]. The email stated that the 3110 owners would have to sign one of the documents. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 137]. The replat survey is addressed to \"3110 Roswell Road, LLC and Rohrig Investments, LP.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 141].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Plaintiff rejected the Draft Deed because the Settlement Agreement did not mention a no-build easement in favor of 3110. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 142, 144]. On January 15, 2015, Mr. Howard emailed Mr. Frasier, stating that he had discussed the transfer with Charlie Loudermilk, and Charlie was \"not willing to touch the area of the property that includes the loading dock.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 146, Ex. 10]. Mr. Howard requested an updated survey and legal description that he could provide to Mr. Teague for use in drafting a limited warranty deed. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 146]. Attached to the email was a copy of the Rohrig Survey with a shaded area showing the portion of the property 3110 was willing to transfer to Plaintiff. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 147]. On February 16, 2015, Mr. Howard forwarded the January 15, 2015 email and the shaded Rohrig Survey to Valentino, requesting a survey and legal description consistent with the shaded area. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 148]. Valentino forwarded the request to Plaintiff. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 149].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   On March 17, 2015, the Loudermilk Parties, through attorney Mike King, sent a letter to counsel for the Rohrig Parties, with a limited warranty deed executed by Charlie Loudermilk on behalf of 3110.

Also attached to the letter was an exhibit plat dated February 26, 2015, prepared by Valentino for 3110 that referenced the same job and file number from the Valentino Survey and the Rohrig Survey. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 154-155]. These documents have 3110 conveying only the aforementioned shaded area on the Rohrig Survey.

[\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 156]. As of the date of the Amended Complaint, Defendants have not delivered such deed to Plaintiff. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 158]. Plaintiffs allege on information and belief that it is legally possible for Defendants to comply with all the requirements set forth in Section 3.0 of the Settlement Agreement. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 159].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Plaintiff makes additional allegations to support a claim based on agency as follows: Charlie Loudermilk at one time had a direct ownership interest in each of the LLCs as that term is defined in the Settlement Agreement. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 161a]. Charlie Loudermilk maintains an indirect ownership interest in the LLCs by having transferred his direct ownership interests in the LLCs to Knuckle in 2010. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 161b]. Charlie Loudermilk at one time had a direct ownership interest in Loudermilk/Rohrig 3084, LLC. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 161c]. Plaintiff alleges on information and belief that Charlie Loudermilk transferred his interest in 3084 to 3110, maintaining an indirect ownership therein. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 161d].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   3084 was the entity that owned the entire Roswell Road Property, sold the 3116 Property to Novare, and conveyed the remainder of the property to Plaintiff and 3110. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 161e]. Charlie Loudermilk, Robin Loudermilk, and Greg Howard are the sole direct owners of 3116. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 161f].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   3116 purchased the 3116 Property from Novare and then agreed to sell it to Hanover, which sale was halted by the Parking Rights Dispute. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 161g].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   As an owner of 3116, Charlie Loudermilk had a financial incentive to see the Parking Rights Dispute resolved as part of the Settlement Agreement as he was a direct personal beneficiary of such resolution. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 161h]. In addition, as an indirect owner of the LLCs through Knuckle and having made significant capitalization loans to at least two of the LLCs, Charlie Loudermilk had a financial incentive to see that the dissociation issue and related property split were resolved under the Settlement Agreement. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 161i]. Charlie Loudermilk received a release under the Settlement Agreement. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 161j].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In term sheets leading up to the settlement conference on October 28, 2014, Mr. King made representations to Plaintiff about terms and conditions that the LLCs, Robin Loudermilk, Knuckle, 3116, and 3110 were willing to comply with to reach a global settlement of the disputes. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 161k]. In the settlement conference, Robin Loudermilk and Greg Howard made representations to the Rohrigs that 3110 would convey the 8 at 8 Property as contemplated in the Settlement Agreement. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 161\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   ]. In the Announced Settlement, Mr. King described the 8 at 8 Property conveyance in a manner suggesting that 3110, having agreed to make the conveyance, would in fact make the conveyance. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 161m]. Also in the Announced Settlement, Mr. King emphasized the breadth of the releases, including as to Charlie Loudermilk and his affiliates. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 161n]. In the Announced Settlement, Mr. Marsh stressed the necessity of the cross-easements for the benefit of 3110 and other Loudermilks. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 161o].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In efforts to document the Settlement Agreement, Mr. King represented to counsel for the Rohrigs on November 7, 2014 that \"we will agree to give Rohrig an easement to the breezeway,\" a comment which suggests Mr. King is speaking with authority on behalf of 3110, as 3110 was the owner of the Breezeway. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 161p].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   All the correspondence starting the week of December 1, 2014 through February 16, 2015 among Mr. Howard, Mr. Teague, Valentino, and Mr. Frasier involved Mr. Howard speaking and making representations and requests on behalf of 3110 and Charlie Loudermilk [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 161q]. Mr. Howard is 3110's registered agent. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 161r]. In addition, at a March 13, 2014 hearing on Robin Loudermilk and Knuckle's motion for stay relief, Mr. Howard testified under oath about his managerial role in Charlie Loudermilk's, Robin Loudermilk's, The Loudermilk Companies', and their affiliates' corporate governance and financial and business affairs. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 163]. At that hearing, Mr. Howard testified that as of May 2014, he had been CFO of The Loudermilk Companies, LLC-the management entity for all of the Loudermilk family investments, LLCs, joint ventures, and wholly owned investments-for 10 years. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 164a, b]. He further testified that he manages the personal finances for Charlie and Robin Loudermilk, and he works on their family trusts and estate matters and manages the family office, which is concentrated in commercial real estate. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 164c, d]. Mr. Howard testified that he manages all the Loudermilk's real estate and and is involved in all financial reporting and accounting. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 164e, f]. Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff alleges Mr. Howard is an expressly authorized agent for Charlie Loudermilk, Robin Loudermilk, and their entire portfolio of personal and business interests. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 165]. Plaintiff further alleges that based on information on the website for The Loudermilk Companies, it holds itself out\n   to the public as a representative and contact for all the Loudermilk properties at the heart of the Parking Rights Dispute. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 170].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Mr. Teague has performed substantially all the real estate work for every transaction described in the Amended Complaint. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 161s]. Plaintiff alleges on information and belief that every action taken by Mr. Teague on behalf of the various Loudermilk and Rohrig parties since 2006 was taken with express, written authority, including the work he performed on December 4, 2014 to effectuate the 3110 conveyance under the Settlement Agreement. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 161t].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   When Plaintiff filed a motion to reopen its bankruptcy case to enforce the Settlement Agreement, on December 18, 2015, Mr. Marsh and Mr. Gordon filed a notice of appearance on behalf of 3110. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 171a]. Prior to that date, the attorneys had appeared for Robin Loudermilk and Knuckle only. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 171b]. Plaintiff alleges on information and belief that Mr. Marsh and Mr. Gordon did not file the notice of appearance without express written authority from 3110. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 171c]. The attorneys withdrew the notice of appearance for 3110 on January 6, 2016, a few minutes after George Geeslin filed a notice of appearance for 3110. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 171d]. In objecting to Plaintiff's motion to reopen, the Loudermilk Parties and 3110 filed objections minutes apart, raising the same objections. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 171e]. Each of the objections, despite having been filed by three separate law firms, contained the same citation error. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 171f]. Plaintiff alleges that based on the foregoing and despite having separate counsel, Charlie Loudermilk, Robin Loudermilk, and all their entities have participated in these proceedings as a joint enterprise.

The Settlement Agreement was executed by (1) George Rohrig on behalf of Plaintiff as its sole general partner; (2) George Rohrig, individually; (3) Robin Loudermilk on behalf of Knuckle as manager of The Knuckle Company, LLC which in turn is general partner of Knuckle; (4) Robin Loudermilk, individually; and (5) Robin\n   Loudermilk on behalf of 3116 as its manager.

Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that Robin Loudermilk, Mr. Howard, 3116-3136 Roswell Road, LLC, The Loudermilk Companies, and all of the attorneys who appeared in or made representations through these proceedings had express authority to and actually did bind 3110 and Charlie Loudermilk to the Settlement Agreement.

Plaintiff's Contentions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Plaintiff contends that Robin Loudermilk, Greg Howard, 3116, The Loudermilk Companies, and all of their attorneys had actual or apparent authority to bind 3110 and Charlie Loudermilk to the terms of the Agreement. Plaintiff further contends that 3110 ratified the Settlement Agreement through the actions of Mr. Howard and Mr. Teague in providing to Plaintiff the unsigned Draft Deed that conveyed the 8 at 8 Property, the Breezeway easement, and all the Disputed Property, albeit subject to a no-build easement, along with Mr. Howard's statement that he could provide an executed copy by the following Monday. Plaintiff further contends 3110 ratified the Settlement Agreement by providing an executed deed in March 2015\n   conveying the 8 at 8 Property and a portion of the Disputed Property. Even though the executed deed did not convey all the property sought by Plaintiff, Plaintiff contends 3110 acknowledged and acted in accordance with 3110's interpretation of the Agreement; thus it performed like one who believes it has obligations under the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   i. Express and Apparent Authority\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   With respect to express authority, Plaintiff contends that its allegations \"suggest that discovery will reveal internal correspondence and agreements among [the Loudermilk family members, companies, and affiliates] that delegate express authority for one Loudermilk constituent to negotiate for and bind others[.]\" [Doc. 27 \u00b6 161]. Plaintiff also points to the notice of appearance filed by Mr. Marsh and Mr. Gordon on behalf of 3110 on December 8, 2015 which was withdrawn January 5, 2016 after George Geeslin filed a notice of appearance for 3110. Plaintiff also points out that the objections filed by three separate law firms representing the Loudermilk Parties and 3110 contained a common error in a case citation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   While the Amended Complaint includes several allegations that Plaintiff believed counsel for Defendants, or Mr. Teague or Mr. Howard were expressly authorized to represent 3110 and these parties represented what 3110 was willing to do, wholly absent from the Amended Complaint is any allegation that any of the Loudermilk Parties or their attorneys represented to Plaintiff that they were authorized to act on behalf of 3110 and were in fact acting on behalf of 3110 for purposes of the settlement negotiations. Also, missing is any allegation of facts that a written agreement exists, who is a party to the agreement, and what activities are authorized. Plaintiff has done no more than allege its belief that something must exist because Defendants are related entities and made representations that 3110 would do certain things. The interconnectedness of the various Loudermilk entities is not by itself enough to give rise to a reasonable inference that discovery will lead to written documentation of actual agency, especially when 3110 was not made a party to the Settlement Agreement and no one signed the Agreement as a representative of 3110. Further, the notice of appearance filed by Mr. Marsh and Mr. Gordon and the similar briefs filed by Defendants in response to Plaintiff's motion to reopen the main bankruptcy case were filed on December 8, 2015 and January 6, 2016, respectively. This was more than a year after the Settlement Agreement was approved on December 4, 2014, and does not sufficiently allege express agency during the time of the settlement negotiations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   With respect to apparent authority, Plaintiff has alleged Charlie Loudermilk is the manager and sole owner of 3110. Plaintiff's allegations are devoid of any actions, statements, or other manifestations by Charlie Loudermilk indicating that any of the Loudermilk Parties, their employees, or their attorneys were authorized to act on behalf of 3110 in negotiating the Settlement Agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff argues that it makes no sense to look for manifestations of apparent authority from the principal, 3110, because 3110 is an LLC and can only act through agents. However, O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-11-301 sets forth the authority of members and managers to act on behalf of\n   an LLC and to bind the LLC, depending on whether the LLC is member-managed or manager-managed. Plaintiff does not allege any facts from which the Court can reasonably conclude that anyone other than Charlie Loudermilk has the power to authorize others to act on behalf of 3110. Further, Plaintiff has not alleged any course of dealings or special circumstances from which the Court could reasonably infer that any other Loudermilk entity or employees were acting with apparent authority. Although Plaintiff has alleged that Mr. Howard has extensive management control over The Loudermilk Companies, Plaintiff has not alleged that Mr. Howard or any of the Loudermilk Parties has any history of negotiating the settlement of disputes among related third parties on behalf of 3110, nor has Plaintiff alleged that any attorney involved in the settlement negotiations was an attorney of record for 3110 at the time of the negotiations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   ii. Contracts With Agent\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Even if Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to state a claim that Defendants or any Defendant acted as 3110's agent in negotiating the Settlement Agreement, Plaintiff has not stated a claim against 3110 because Plaintiff contracted with the agent, as demonstrated by the fact that 3110 was not a named party to the contract and no one signed the contract as representative of 3110.

Ratification\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   With respect to ratification, Plaintiff contends 3110 received and accepted benefits under the Settlement Agreement, including a release of all Plaintiff's claims against Charlie Loudermilk and 3110.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff further contends that any argument 3110's performance was gratuitous is absurd given the contentious circumstances between the parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   But even if 3110 did receive some benefit under the\n   Agreement, its alleged actions did not manifest an intent to ratify the Agreement, as it never proffered a deed consistent with the Agreement (as Plaintiff interprets it). Assuming Mr. Howard had the authority to ratify the acts of purported agents on behalf of 3110, he provided an unexecuted Draft Deed for all the 8 at 8 Properties, subject to a no-build easement. Thus, the Draft Deed did not effect a ratification because it added restrictions not present in the Settlement Agreement and it was not signed. The subsequent executed warranty deed tendered by counsel for the Loudermilk Parties also did not effect a ratification because it did not include the Breezeway easement and it did not include the entirety of the Disputed Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Even if the Court were able to conclude that 3110's actions constituted ratification for purposes of a motion to dismiss, 3110 is not obligated to do anything under the Agreement. The only obligations with respect to conveyance of the property are those of the Loudermilk Parties. As noted above 3110 is not a named party or a signatory to the contract. Section 3.0 of the Settlement Agreement requires the Loudermilk Parties to \"obtain\" and to \"deliver\" or \"convey\" the relevant deed. It does not require 3110 to do anything; thus there are no actions of an agent to be ratified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   iv. Parties to the Agreement\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the signature blocks in the Agreement are patently ambiguous as to what capacity the Loudermilk Parties executed the Agreement, and that the Loudermilk Parties executed on their own behalf and on behalf of 3110. Plaintiff contends the ambiguity arises from the fact that the Agreement contemplates various obligations on the part of parties who are related to the signatories but did not execute the Agreement. For example, the LLCs that owned the 9 properties divided in Section 1 of the Agreement did not sign despite the fact that they had obligations under the Agreement. Plaintiff further argues that the Agreement's merger clause does not exclude parol evidence regarding the signature blocks because the Agreement incorporates and makes a part of its terms the Announced Settlement, such that the merger clause protects the Announced Settlement, and the merger clause is subject to exceptions by which parol evidence may be used to establish the meaning of ambiguous terms in the writing.

There is no separate agreement, representation or other inducement for the execution of this Agreement.\" [Settlement Agreement \u00a7 15.0].

The signature blocks identify the person signing, the entity for which he is signing, and his title with respect to that entity. Both George Rohrig and Robin Loudermilk signed the Agreement in representative capacities for Plaintiff and the Loudermilk Parties respectively and both also signed the Agreement, separately, in their individual capacities. This indicates both parties knew how to demonstrate agency when executing the Agreement. The fact that Robin Loudermilk did not expressly execute the Agreement on behalf of 3110, the fact that 3110 was not a named party to the Agreement, and the fact that 3110 has no obligations under the Agreement all lead to the inference that 3110 was not a participant intended to be bound by the Agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Further, the fact that no one signed the Agreement on behalf of the LLCs whose property was divided does not create an ambiguity. The Agreement states that the LLCs are controlled by the named parties to the contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   By contrast, nothing in the Agreement states that 3110 is controlled by a named party to the contract. To the contrary, the Amended Complaint alleges that 3110 is controlled by Charlie Loudermilk, who is not a named party to the Agreement. Moreover, the Agreement places no obligations on the LLCs; all the actions necessary to carry out the division of the LLCs' property are required of the\n   Parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Settlement Agreement \u00a7 1].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Because Plaintiff has failed to allege facts to demonstrate that 3110 is a party to the Agreement, either directly or through an agent, or to demonstrate that 3110 has any obligations under the Agreement, Plaintiff's claims against 3110 for specific performance and breach of contract will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   v. Promissory Estoppel\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Plaintiff also argues that its allegations state a saving claim of promissory estoppel that estops 3110 and the Loudermilk Parties from refusing to perform. To establish promissory estoppel, Plaintiff must allege facts showing (1) a promise made by Defendants; (2) Defendants should have reasonably expected Plaintiff to rely on the promise; (3) Plaintiff relied on the promise to its detriment; and (4) injustice can only be avoided by enforcing the promise.\n   <em>\n    Hendon Props., LLC v.

Furthermore, as the Loudermilk Parties argue, Plaintiff was in the best position to bind 3110 to the contract. Its failure to do so demonstrates a lack of reasonable reliance for purposes of promissory estoppel. Accordingly, Plaintiff's claim of promissory estoppel against 3110 will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Contract Claims Against the Loudermilk Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   In the Dismissal Order, the Court found that it was not legally possible for the Loudermilk Parties to convey all of the Disputed Property when the property owner refused to cooperate in the transfer. The Court held in the alternative that Section 3.0 of the Settlement Agreement was unenforceable due to the legal insufficiency of the property description.

As detailed below, the property description with respect to the Disputed Property is not sufficient to be enforced and therefore cannot be relied upon for purposes of promissory estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Plaintiff's Motion to Reconsider\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Moving on to Plaintiff's claim for damages for breach of contract, in its Motion to Reconsider, Plaintiff contends the Court made two manifest errors of law or fact: (1) it erred in its construction of the phrase \"legally possible\" and (2) it erred in finding the property description inadequate. The Settlement Agreement provides that \"[i]n consultation with Rohrig's surveyors and attorneys, and to the extent it is legally possible, the Loudermilk Parties will obtain from 3110 Roswell Road, LLC and convey to Rohrig by limited warranty deed an extension of the property lines for the 8 at 8 Property ....\" [Settlement Agreement \u00a7 3.0]. In the Dismissal Order, the Court determined that because O.C.G.A. \u00a7 44-5-30 requires a deed to be signed by its maker and because execution of the deed is required to pass title of real property, the Loudermilk Parties were restricted by law in transferring any more property than 3110 was willing to convey. [Doc. 21 at 15]. Thus, the transfer was not legally possible. The Court noted that finding a lack of legal possibility based on a statutory restriction was consistent with Plaintiff's interpretation of \"legally possible\" as referring to the type of restrictions imposed by statutes, ordinances, or regulations. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   i. The Court's Interpretation of Legally Possible\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Plaintiff contends the Court's interpretation is not consistent with Plaintiff's interpretation of \"legally possible\" and that it has always argued that \"legally possible\" tests whether the extension is legally possible. Plaintiff further contends the Court erred in failing to resolve ambiguities in the language in favor of Plaintiff on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Taking the allegations as true, there is no legal impediment to the transfer of the land\n   <em>\n    by 3110\n   </em>\n   . Thus, the transfer of the 8 at 8 Properties, as a general matter, is not legally impossible. However, it is legally impossible for the Loudermilk Parties to obtain the Property from 3110 and convey the Property to Plaintiff without the cooperation of 3110\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   . Plaintiff has not shown any manifest error of fact or of law in the Court's determination that the transfer of the Disputed Property is not legally possible. The fact that Plaintiff believes the phrase is ambiguous does not serve as a basis for reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Plaintiff contends the \"legally possible\" language applies to the extension of the property lines,\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   such that the lines must be extended unless \"some intervening law, regulation, ordinance, or competing property right over which 3110 has no control obstructs the\n   <em>\n    continuation\n   </em>\n   of such extension ....\" [Doc. 23 at 5 (emphasis in original) ]. In this sense, Plaintiff is not so much arguing about the interpretation of the phrase \"legally possible\" but instead arguing about what it modifies. But the Agreement makes no reference to what 3110 can or cannot control; rather it expressly imposes an obligation on the Loudermilk Parties to deliver what they can obtain from 3110. Again, this is not the type of manifest error of fact or law that justifies reconsideration of the Dismissal Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   ii. Sufficiency of the Property Description\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Turning to the sufficiency of the property description, the Agreement provides that the Loudermilk Parties will obtain and deliver to Plaintiff a limited warranty deed for \"property known as the 8 at 8 space subject to encumbrances of record,\" \"an extension of the property lines for the 8 at 8 Property westward to Early Street ... includ[ing] cross easements for the benefit of 3110 ... and the Loudermilk Parties,\" and \"an easement for pedestrian traffic to the portion of the 3110 Roswell Road property commonly known as the 'breezeway.' \" [Settlement Agreement \u00a7 3.0]. In the Dismissal Order, the Court\n   concluded that this description failed to locate the boundaries of the Disputed Property and that no extrinsic evidence in existence prior to the Agreement provided a means for locating those boundaries. [Doc. 21 at 19-20].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Plaintiff contends the Court's decision hinged on a mistake of fact about the location of the 8 at 8 Property and whether it could serve as a key to determine the boundaries of the Disputed Property. Plaintiff further contends the Court erred in concluding the word \"extension\" could not be used to locate the boundaries of the Disputed Property because the Court failed to consider the extension in conjunction with the 8 at 8 Property. Plaintiff further contends the Court erred in suggesting that any applicable extrinsic evidence must contain a legally sufficient description of the Property as opposed to making such a description readily ascertainable and that such extrinsic evidence did not exist at the time of the Agreement. Finally, Plaintiff contends the Court erred in concluding that the Breezeway easement was dependent directly or indirectly on the extension of the property lines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   With respect to the location of the 8 at 8 Property, the Court did question the nature of the 8 at 8 Property and the accuracy of its street address. [Doc. 21 at 17-18 and n.4 &amp; 6]. The Court further stated that \"the use of the word 'extension' does not render the description legally adequate, as it does not indicate the location of the 8 at 8 Property and does not provide a means of identifying all the boundaries of the ... [D]isputed [P]roperty.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18 (emphasis added) (footnotes omitted) ]. Plaintiff is correct that, as a physical landmark, the location of the 8 at 8 Property could be readily ascertained at the time of the Agreement. To the extent the Dismissal Order suggested otherwise, it was in error. In reaching its decision the Court assumed that the 8 at 8 Property was located at the 3110 Roswell Road address, and the Court's question about the address of the 8 at 8 Property did not inform the Court's conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   With respect to the terminology used by the Court when discussing the requirements to satisfy the statute of frauds,\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff argues the Court's use of the word \"description\" imposes a higher burden on Plaintiff than required by law. However, the Court discussed in detail the requirement of a legal description, which is the ability to readily ascertain the boundaries of real property. If the contract and applicable extrinsic evidence allow the boundaries of the property to be readily ascertainable-i.e., they show the \"precise location and boundaries\" of the property at issue or \"disclose[s] with sufficient certainty ...\n   <em>\n    the quantity and location\n   </em>\n   of the land\"-then they meet the requirement for an adequate legal description.\n   <em>\n    Daniel Mill, LLC v.

The Court determined the boundaries of the Disputed Property were not so ascertainable; it did not require a pre-exiting metes and bounds description of the Disputed Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Plaintiff argues that having established the location of the 8 at 8 Property, identifying the remaining borders of the Disputed Property is merely a mechanical process of drawing a line along the northern edge of the 8 at 8 Property and continuing\n   it to Early Street.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, Plaintiff argues that \"extension of property lines\" must be interpreted to mean a straight line.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, Plaintiff argues, the Disputed Property is bounded at the east by Roswell Road, bounded on the north by the aforementioned new line, bounded on the west by Early Street and bounded on the south by an existing property line.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   However, the dictionary definition of \"extend\" or \"extension\" does not require a straight line. It can mean, among other things, \"to spread or stretch forth: unbend,\" \"to stretch out to fullest length,\" or \"to cause to be longer\"\n   <em>\n    Extend\n   </em>\n   , Mirriam-Webster.com (last visited March 2, 2018).

The Court is not persuaded that given these definitions, use of the word \"extension\" dictates a course that runs straight out from the northern wall of the 8 at 8 Property. Plaintiff argues it should have the opportunity to put on testimony of experts as to the meaning of extend. But Plaintiff's disagreement with the Court's interpretation of \"extend\" is not a basis for reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Further, in the absence of a specific course for the extended property lines, the Agreement's use of the phrase \"westward to Early Street\" further muddies the water.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

Therefore, the only issue for the Court to consider is whether Plaintiff has alleged mutual mistake. Plaintiff does not identify any specific mutual mistake but merely asks the Court to reform the Agreement to effectuate the true intention of the parties to the extent the Court is not inclined to enforce Section 3.0. Whether Plaintiff is merely seeking reform of Section 3.0 or broader reform of the Agreement is not clear. Although, the parties have all acknowledged the existence of at least one mutual mistake, as it relates to the southern boundary of the Disputed Property, reform of that mistake alone will not affect the enforceability of Section 3.0. With respect to other possible mistakes, Plaintiff's claim fails because it did not specify the reforms it seeks,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Birdette v.

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to show 3110 is bound to the Settlement Agreement through principles of agency or any other theory. Plaintiff also has failed to allege facts to show 3110 has any obligations under the Agreement or that it made any promises subject to estoppel. In addition, Plaintiff has failed to allege 3110 received a valuable benefit from Plaintiff for which Plaintiff should be compensated. Accordingly, the Court will grant 3110's Second Motion to Dismiss and will dismiss all claims against 3110.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   With respect to the Loudermilk Parties, because they do not own the 8 at 8 Properties, Plaintiff has failed to state a claim for specific performance against them. Plaintiff may be entitled to damages for breach of contract, to the extent the Loudermilk Parties failed to satisfy all their obligations as to the 8 at 8 Property and the Breezeway easement. However, Plaintiff has failed to state a claim for breach of contract or promissory estoppel as to the Disputed Property because the Loudermilk Parties discharged their obligations under the contract and because the property description is insufficient for enforcement. Therefore, the Court will grant the Loudermilk Parties' Second Motion to Dismiss as to the claims for specific performance, promissory estoppel, and breach of contract as to the Disputed Property. The Court will deny the Second Motions to Dismiss as to the claims against the Loudermilk Parties for breach of contract as to the 8 at 8 Property and the Breezeway easement. In addition, the Court will grant\n   Plaintiff's Motion to Reconsider with respect to the sufficiency of the property description for the 8 at 8 Property (itself as opposed to any extension thereof) and the Breezeway easement, and will deny the Motion to Reconsider in all other respects. Finally, Plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient facts to show a mutual mistake as the Settlement Agreement and the Court will grant the Second Motions to Dismiss as to Plaintiff's claim for reformation of the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS ORDERED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-168\">\n    Decisions of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals issued on or before September 30, 1981 have been adopted as binding precedent in the Eleventh Circuit.\n    <em>\n     Bonner v.
