(\"Appellant\") seeks reconsideration of this court's August 30, 2017 Order affirming the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Vermont's Order of Discharge for Debtor and Appellee James T. Theodore (\"Debtor\"). On September 13, 2017, Appellant filed a motion for rehearing pursuant to Fed. R. Bankr. P. 8022(a)(2), arguing that the district court\n   overlooked (1) the legal principle that a debtor's bankruptcy plan remains binding on a debtor following discharge without a reaffirmation agreement; and (2) the lack of findings of fact required by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201141\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(5) to support the Bankruptcy Court's decision to grant Debtor's discharge. The court granted Appellant's motion for a rehearing on October 10, 2017 and heard oral argument on November 17, 2017. Debtor opposes rehearing and any reconsideration of this court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 25, 2010, Debtor, individually and d/b/a JTT Properties, filed for bankruptcy protection pursuant to chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Debtor's bankruptcy estate included twelve multi-family properties. For approximately six months preceding Debtor's bankruptcy filing, Debtor failed to make payments on six mortgage notes secured by the properties and held by the Federal National Mortgage Association (\"Fannie Mae\"). Approximately two weeks prior to Debtor's bankruptcy filing, Fannie Mae served Debtor with a notice of non-judicial foreclosure sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 23, 2010, Debtor filed his initial disclosure statement and plan with the Bankruptcy Court to which Fannie Mae objected. Thereafter, the parties negotiated regarding the extent to which Debtor's pre-petition liabilities under the mortgage notes would be payable under his chapter 11 plan. On October 27, 2011, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed the Debtor's chapter 11 plan (\"2011 Plan\") with the consent of Fannie Mae. The 2011 Plan incorporated the terms of modification agreements between Debtor and Fannie Mae, including the re-amortization of the mortgage notes secured by the properties. The 2011 Plan required Debtor to make fixed monthly payments of principal and interest to Fannie Mae with a balloon payment on December 31, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On December 16, 2015, Debtor moved to modify the 2011 Plan. Fannie Mae objected, and the Bankruptcy Court denied the motion on January 28, 2016. Shortly thereafter, in March 2016, Fannie Mae transferred its interest in the modified mortgage notes, secured by the properties, to Appellant. Four months later, in July 2016, following maturity of the debts under the 2011 Plan, Appellant and Debtor entered into additional loan modification agreements regarding all six mortgage notes, extending the maturity date and setting forth new loan balances and payment schedules. On July 22, 2016, Debtor moved to modify the 2011 Plan to incorporate the terms of the most recent loan modification agreements (\"2016 Modified Plan\"). Paragraph 5.6.2 is representative of the modification of each note held by Appellant covered by the 2016 Modified Plan:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Commencing on August 1, 2016, ... and continuing on same day of each successive month thereafter until June 30, 2021, [Debtor] shall make monthly equal blended installment payments of principal plus interest, based upon a twenty five (25) year amortization schedule with interest fixed at 5.25% per annum, on a mortgage amount of $186,689.08. The monthly payments shall be $1,118.73. A balloon payment or refinancing will occur by June 30, 2021, unless extended by agreement of the parties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (Doc. 2-31 at \u00b6 5.6.2);\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201141\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201141\">\n    at \u00b6 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .7.2, \u00b6 5.8.2, \u00b6 5.9.2, \u00b6 5.10.2, \u00b6 5.11.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Debtor submitted the 2016 Modified Plan for the Bankruptcy Court's approval. The Bankruptcy Court granted the motion to modify its Confirmation Order on August 10, 2016 and thereby confirmed the 2016 Modified Plan. Both the 2011 Plan and the 2016 Modified Plan stated that reaffirmation agreements would only be\n   enforceable if entered in accordance with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20524\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 2-2 at 34, \u00b6 11-4; Doc. 2-31 at 33, \u00b6 11-4.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Debtor is current on his payments under the 2016 Modified Plan and has filed all required monthly operating reports. In the absence of motions from the Office of the United States Trustee indicating otherwise, the Bankruptcy Court assumed that Debtor complied with all requirements imposed by the United States Trustee, including the requirement to pay quarterly fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural Background.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Bankruptcy Court's December 22, 2016 Order Granting Debtor's Motion for Entry of Discharge.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On November 8, 2016, Debtor filed a motion for entry of discharge and final decree, stating that he had completed \"[a]ll payments\" and \"complied with the terms of the [2016 Modified] Plan.\" (Doc. 2-35 at 1, \u00b6 1.) Debtor concedes this statement should be interpreted to mean that he was current with his payments under the 2016 Modified Plan, not that he had actually made all of the payments due thereunder.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant objected on December 1, 2016, requesting that the Order \"expressly state that the discharge would not apply to [Appellant's] modified debts.\" (Doc. 3 at 12.) On December 9, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court held a hearing on the motion at which Appellant failed to appear. At the hearing, Debtor challenged Appellant's objection on the grounds that his personal liability to Appellant under the modified debts should be discharged pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201141\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   because the parties did not enter into a reaffirmation agreement under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20524\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As this argument had not been briefed by the parties and Appellant was not present, the Bankruptcy Court issued a Scheduling Order for additional briefing on this issue. After filing its supplemental memorandum of law on December 14, 2016, Appellant submitted an addendum on December 16, 2016, two days after the filing deadline had passed, asserting that Debtor had not complied with \u00a7 1141(d)(5)(B) and therefore was not eligible for chapter 11 discharge as an individual. Debtor moved the Bankruptcy Court to strike the addendum because it was untimely and raised arguments beyond the scope of Appellant's original objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On December 22, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court issued its Memorandum of Decision finding that, because the parties did not comply with \u00a7 524 in modifying the loan agreements, Appellant was precluded from enforcing the debts included in the 2016 Modified Plan against Debtor personally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Overruling Appellant's objection and striking its addendum as untimely, the Bankruptcy Court entered an Order of Discharge on December 30, 2016. Appellant filed a notice of appeal that same day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The District Court's August 30, 2017 Order Affirming the Bankruptcy Court.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In its appeal before this court, Appellant argued that the Bankruptcy Court erred (1) in granting a discharge of Debtor's \"pre-petition claims even though those claims are payable in part under a confirmed plan\"; (2) in granting Debtor's personal discharge \"before the plan payments were complete\"; (3) in not following\n   <em>\n    United Student Aid Funds, Inc. v.

The court found that the Bankruptcy Court \"made clear the discharge was as to [Debtor's] personal liability on the [mortgage] notes[,]\" removing Debtor's personal liability for debts provided by the chapter 11 plan. (Doc. 8 at 4.) The court distilled Appellant's remaining allegations of error as involving \"whether and to what extent the Bankruptcy Court considered\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201141\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and if it erred in its application[ ] ... by granting a discharge to [Debtor] before plan payments were complete[ ]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201141\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Concluding that the Bankruptcy Court properly found that the loan modifications between Debtor and Appellant must comply with \u00a7 524 in order to be enforceable, in the absence of compliance, this court determined that Debtor was properly granted a discharge as to his personal liability on those debts. The court found that the Bankruptcy Court did not fail to consider whether Debtor was entitled to a discharge of his personal liability under \u00a7 1141 because the Bankruptcy Court held a hearing on the issue and allowed post-hearing briefing on the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

As a result, the court failed to recognize that debts arising from Appellant's modified mortgage notes and incorporated into the 2016 Modified Plan remain binding after discharge. In response, Debtor contends that the Bankruptcy Court correctly found that his debts to Appellant arise from pre-petition obligations and are only enforceable through a reaffirmation agreement that satisfies\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20524\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   To determine the nature of Debtor's obligations to Appellant, the court begins with the language of the Bankruptcy Code.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Caldor Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11357115,11432174\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/303/161/\">\n    303 F.3d 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 167 (2d Cir. 2002) (\"The task of resolving a dispute over the meaning of a provision of the Bankruptcy Code 'begins where all such inquires must begin: with the language of the statute itself.' \") (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Bankruptcy Court properly did not impose this requirement in approving and confirming either the 2011 Plan or the 2016 Modified Plan. Such a requirement would be redundant, requiring a creditor and debtor not only to negotiate for inclusion of a pre-petition debt into a proposed chapter 11 plan which is then approved by the Bankruptcy Court as part of the confirmation process, but also to enter into a separate reaffirmation agreement.

There, the debtor moved to reopen its chapter 11 plan, seeking to hold a creditor in contempt for violating the discharge injunction. At issue were\n   <em>\n    post-confirmation\n   </em>\n   contracts, including a covenant not to sue as part of a contract to pay any new claims that the creditor might have and an indemnity and release contract providing for the debtor and related entities to pay any damages the creditor incurred or the judgment creditor obtained after a specific date. As the Fifth Circuit pointed out, when the bankruptcy court issued its order confirming the debtor's chapter 11 plan, the post-confirmation contracts were not included therein. As a result, the creditor effectively sought to revive discharged debts by offering new consideration. Agreeing with the bankruptcy court that this questionable practice violated the Bankruptcy Code, the Fifth Circuit concluded that \"even if it could be argued that the [contract] was based upon new consideration, this Court finds that the [contract] was at least based in part upon the discharge[d] debt and therefore must comply with \u00a7 524 to be valid.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=448%20Fed.%20Appx.%20415\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=448%20Fed.%20Appx.%20415\">\n    at 420\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alterations in original) (internal quotation marks omitted).

Because of the danger that creditors may coerce debtors into undesirable reaffirmation contracts, they are not favored under the Bankruptcy Code and strict compliance with the specific terms in Section 524 is mandatory. A reaffirmation contract which does not comply fully with Section 524 is void and unenforceable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=448%20Fed.%20Appx.%20415\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=448%20Fed.%20Appx.%20415\">\n    at 419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   None of these concerns are present in the instant case.

Third, a discharge is available if certain requirements are met:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   [A]t any time after the confirmation of the plan, and after notice and a hearing, the court may grant a discharge to the debtor who has not completed payments under the plan if-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   (i) the value, as of the effective date of the plan, of property actually distributed under the plan on account of each allowed unsecured claim is not less than the amount that would have been paid on such claim if the estate of the debtor had been liquidated under chapter 7 on such date;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   (ii) modification of the plan under section 1127 is not practicable; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   (iii) subparagraph (C) permits the court to grant a discharge[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201141\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(5)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In the instant case, the Bankruptcy Court granted Debtor a discharge of his liabilities \"under \u00a7 1141\" (Doc. 2-45 at 7) but did not make findings of fact or explain how Debtor satisfied the \"for cause\" standard or the criterion for a discharge under \u00a7 1141(d)(5)(B). Appellant contends that, had the Bankruptcy Court engaged in the proper analysis, it could not have concluded that \u00a7 1141(d)(5)(B) was satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   It is undisputed that Debtor had not completed all payments under the 2016 Modified Plan when he sought a discharge\n   of his personal liability for confirmed plan obligations. While the Bankruptcy Court noted that Debtor was current with regard to his payments under the 2016 Modified Plan, it properly did not further find that all payments required by the plan had been completed. The Bankruptcy Court also did not conclude that Debtor was eligible for discharge \"for cause[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201141\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(5)(A).

These findings alone, however, do not satisfy \u00a7 114l(d)(5)(B)(i)-(iii). In affirming the Bankruptcy Court's decision, the district court found that the Bankruptcy Court considered whether Debtor was eligible for discharge under \u00a7 1141, but it did not address the requirements of \u00a7 1141(d)(5) in reaching that conclusion. In this respect, this court overlooked an issue properly raised by Appellant's appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

In this case, the latter circumstance is present; at issue is a question of law based on facts that are undisputed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Debtor's motion for entry of discharge did not address Debtor's eligibility for a discharge under \u00a7 1141(d)(5). Appellant objected to Debtor's motion, requesting that the order \"expressly state that any discharge granted does not affect [Debtor's] liability under the obligations currently held by [Appellant].\" (Doc. 2-39 at 2, \u00b6 6.) This placed the issue of Debtor's eligibility for a discharge before the Bankruptcy Court. After the Bankruptcy Court scheduled a hearing on Debtor's eligibility for a discharge, at which Appellant failed to appear, the Bankruptcy Court issued a Scheduling Order permitting additional briefing on Appellant's objection. In its timely filed memorandum of law, Appellant asserted that \"a discharge is available to an individual debtor under [c]hapter 11 upon completion of all payments under the Plan\" pursuant to \u00a7 1141(d)(5)(A). (Doc. 2-42 at 10, \u00b6 29.) Two days after the Scheduling\n   Order deadline passed, Appellant filed its addendum pointing out that Debtor was not eligible for discharge under \u00a7 1141(d)(5)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Appellant asserts that its \"core argument\" under \u00a7 1141(d)(1) was timely and adequately raised. (Doc. 6 at 13.) The court agrees. While the better practice would be to appear at a scheduled hearing and timely file memoranda of law, especially when the Bankruptcy Court generously extends the deadline to do so, Appellant's two arguments are essentially two sides of the same coin: in order to obtain a discharge prior to completion of payments under a confirmed chapter 11 plan, a debtor must satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 1141(d)(5) and Debtor here allegedly failed to do so. There was thus no lack of notice or unfair surprise in Appellant pointing out in its addendum that the relief Debtor sought was not available.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davis,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4256922\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/821/231/#p246\">\n    821 F.3d at 246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that the plaintiffs \"suffered no unfair surprise or prejudice from defendant's failure to argue\" an issue on summary judgment);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Probatter Sports, LLC v.

It would also be replete with cases in which chapter 11 debtors were discharged from plan obligations because those obligations were not also reflected in a reaffirmation agreement.
