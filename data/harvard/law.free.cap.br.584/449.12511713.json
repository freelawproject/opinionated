Pursuant to their Motion, the Grassos, as Trustees of the Trust (the \"Defendants\") seek dismissal of the six-count Complaint filed against them in their capacity as Trustees by Warren E. Agin (the \"Plaintiff\") pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), made applicable to this proceeding by Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7012(b). Through his Complaint, the Plaintiff seeks to avoid, pursuant to Mass.

The Plaintiff was appointed as Chapter 7 trustee the next day. On Schedule A/B: Property, the Debtor listed an ownership interest in 1195 Forest Street, Marshfield, Massachusetts (the \"Property\") with a value of $419,000, as well as personal property valued at $369,019.48, largely attributable to an exempt pension with a value of $339,202.31. On Schedule C: The Property You Claim as Exempt, the Debtor claimed the Massachusetts exemptions. In particular, she claimed the Massachusetts homestead exemption with respect to the Property,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mass.%20Gen.%20Laws%20ch.%20188%2C%20%C2%A7%203\">\n    Mass.

Laws ch. 246, \u00a7 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On Schedule D: Creditors Who Have Claims Secured by Property, the Debtor listed the Defendants as the holders of a claim in the amount of $388,714.98 secured by the Property. The Debtor, on Schedules I and J pertaining to her income and expenses, disclosed that she is a registered nurse, receives monthly alimony in the\n   sum of $5,560.84, has total monthly income of $7,534.50, has three dependents, has monthly ownership expenses for the Property in the sum of $2,425 and has total monthly expenses in the sum of $7,554.48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Chapter 7 trustee filed a notice of assets and the Court issued a bar date for filing claims. Five creditors filed claims in the case, including the Defendants in the sum of $383,745.77, Navient Solutions, the holder of a student loan debt, in the sum of $21,078.21, and three other creditors with claims totaling approximately $46,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On February 13, 2018, the Plaintiff filed his six-count Complaint against the Defendants, who are the Debtor's parents and California residents, setting forth the following counts: Count I (To Avoid and Recover Fraudulent Transfer Pursuant to M.G.L. c. 109A, \u00a7 5 and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20544\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 550, and 551 ); Count II (To Avoid and Recover Fraudulent Transfer Pursuant to M.G.L. c. 109A, \u00a7 6 and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20544\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 550, and 551 ); Count III (To Avoid and Recover Fraudulent Transfer Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20548\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 550, and 551 ); Count IV (Declaration Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20551\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ); Count V (To Avoid and Recover Preferential Transfer Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20547\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 550 ); and Count VI (To Deny Claim Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20502\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    III. THE PLAINTIFF'S COMPLAINT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Court paraphrases the Plaintiff's Complaint as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In early 2015, the Debtor was attempting to purchase a home and identified the Property, which was listed for a sale price in excess of $400,000, as the home she wished to buy. At the time, however, the Debtor only could qualify for conventional mortgage financing in the amount of approximately $300,000. Because the Debtor was limited in her ability to obtain sufficient financing to purchase the Property through a conventional lender, the Debtor turned to her parents, the Grassos, to assist her in purchasing the Property. The parties agreed that the Trust, created by the Grassos and for which they served as Trustees, would make the purchase and take title to the Property with the intent of eventually transferring the Property to the Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On May 7, 2015, the Trust acquired title to the Property for $419,000. The Debtor paid the initial deposit with the offer to purchase and subsequently paid the entire $19,000 deposit at the time of the purchase and sale agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the same date, the Debtor executed a promissory note (the \"Note\") in the principal amount of $400,000 (i.e., the purchase price less the $19,000 deposit paid by the Debtor) in favor of the Trust. As alleged by the Plaintiff, \"[t]here was no consideration, stated or otherwise, for the Note.\" The interest payments under the Note were $1,909.66 per month. The Note, however, contained no maturity date for the payment of the outstanding principal, although it accrued interest at the rate of four percent per annum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At the same time that the Debtor executed the Note, the Debtor entered into a lease with the Trust (the \"Lease\"), which required monthly payments of $1,909.66. The Debtor and the Trust also entered into \"an agreement whereby the Debtor would purchase the Property from the Trust for the purchase price of $419,000, with the Debtor's original payment of the $19,000 deposit credited toward the purchase price,\" such that the actual purchase price would be $400,000, the same amount as the Note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On or about June 7, 2015, the Debtor began making monthly payments to the Trust in the amount of $1,909.66. Nineteen months later, on December 15, 2016, the Trust transferred the Property to the Debtor for stated consideration of $419,000 pursuant to a deed (Land Court Doc. No. 754064), and, again on the same day, the Debtor also provided a mortgage (the \"Mortgage\") to the Trust to secure the prior Note in the amount of $400,000 which was recorded at 11:57 a.m. The Debtor commenced her Chapter 7 case at 1:50 p.m. that same day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Trustee alleged the following in his Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   The Trust's purchase of the Property was a straw transaction for the sole purpose of contravening the Debtor's inability to obtain financing in her own name.... The Trust was never the intended equitable owner of the Property.... The Debtor and the Grassos always intended for the Debtor to be the owner of the Property and to make all payments on the Property, which is precisely what occurred.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The Defendants\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Defendants correctly observe that through Counts I, II and III of the Complaint, the Plaintiff seeks to avoid the Note and Mortgage on the principal grounds that they constitute constructive fraudulent transfers pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws Ch. 109A, \u00a7\u00a7 5 and 6, and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20548\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   They argue that the facts of the Complaint, when taken as true, demonstrate that the Debtor received reasonably equivalent value in exchange for both the Note and Mortgage because in exchange for the Note the Debtor received \"(1) the Defendants' promise that the Trust would convey the Property to the Debtor at a later date for a set price; and (2) a lease-to own agreement which gave the Debtor immediate use of the Property in exchange for monthly payments of $1,909.66-the exact amount of the monthly interest payments called for under the Note.\" They add that, in exchange for the Mortgage, the Debtor received title to the Property, stating the following: \"The Debtor, as buyer, received a $400,000 house, and the Grassos, as sellers, took back a $400,000 mortgage. The Debtor, on the Trustee's own facts, received reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the Note and Mortgage.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   With respect to the Plaintiff's reference to the Note and Mortgage being transferred with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud one or more creditors as referenced by the Plaintiff in Count III, the Defendants observe that the motivation for the transfer was not fraudulent and was, in fact, set forth in the Complaint as follows: \"Because the Debtor could not qualify for sufficient financing, the Debtor and the Grassos agreed to have the Trust act as a straw purchaser to make the purchase and to take title to the Property.\" They assert that \"there is nothing fraudulent about such conduct, and the Complaint does not identify any reason why or how such a transaction could be fraudulent.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Defendants also seek dismissal of the Plaintiff's preference count. Although the Defendants agree that Debtor granted the Mortgage to the Defendants while she was insolvent, on account of an antecedent\n   debt, and within 90-days of the petition date, they contend that the Plaintiff cannot satisfy the requirement set forth in section 547(b)(5), and, in addition, they raise affirmative defenses. The Defendants state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Section 547(b)(5), an essential element of a preference, requires that the transfer enable the creditor to receive more than the creditor would receive if: (a) the case were a case under Chapter 7, (b) the transfer had not been made, and (c) the creditor received payment of such debt to the extent provided by the provisions of the Code.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   ... Here, had the transfer of the mortgage not occurred, the transfer of the Property would not have occurred, and the Grassos would still own the property and would not even be a creditor [sic] of the Debtor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   ... Similarly, because the Mortgage was transferred simultaneously, and as a condition of the transfer of the Property, the Grassos provided new value for the mortgage under both Sections 547(c)(3) and (4).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Defendants emphasize that all four elements of \u00a7 547(c)(3) have been satisfied because \"[t]he Mortgage, with a description on the Property, was executed by the Debtor and recorded simultaneously with the transfer of the Property by the Grassos to the Debtor. The Mortgage was given to enable the Debtor to acquire the Property, and was in fact used by the Debtor to acquire the Property.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Defendants conclude that because the remaining counts (i.e., Counts IV and VI) are derivative of the Counts 1, II, III, and V, they must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    The Plaintiff\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Plaintiff contends that instead of conducting a contemporaneously real estate sale involving a note and mortgage from the Debtor with title passing to the Debtor, the Defendants required the Debtor to sign the Note for $400,000 dated May 7, 2015 and that in exchange for the Note the Debtor did not receive any consideration as she did not take title to the Property or receive anything of equivalent value from the Defendants. The Plaintiff contends that \"[t]he Note constituted a fraudulent conveyance,\" emphasizing that \"nothing in the Note provided the Debtor with any rights to the Property,\" even though \"the Defendants required the Debtor to make the down payment on the Property in the amount of $19,000.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Plaintiff also argues that while the Defendants purchased the Property and leased it to the Debtor there was \"no basis for the Debtor to have given the Defendants a $400,000 note for the privilege of leasing the Property.\" Therefore, the Plaintiff argues that both the the Note and the $19,000 deposit were fraudulent transfers. The Plaintiff further argues that, although the Debtor eventually took title to the Property and granted the Mortgage to the Defendants dated December 15, 2016, the Mortgage constituted a voidable preference because it occurred more than 18 months after the Note was given and was an effort by the Defendants to secure the antecedent debt represented by the Note. In the alternative, the Plaintiff contends that \"if the Note was a fraudulent conveyance, the Mortgage is unsupported by any valid payment obligation and therefore void.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Finally, the Plaintiff argues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   The Debtor in her motion to dismiss also ignores the fact that she was actively pursued by creditors with claims at the time of the subject transfers and transactions. Indeed, such creditor collection efforts likely contributed to her inability to obtain financing. The Debtor's plan to effectively purchase the Property through her parents while leaving title\n   in them demonstrates an obvious and open intent to hinder, delay or defraud her creditors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    V.

While the Vendor's retained interest is not strictly a lien because one cannot own an article and at the same time have a lien upon it, this distinction has not prevented Pennsylvania courts from considering the vendor's interest a lien....

In virtually every other respect, such as responsibility for taxes, insurance and maintenance, the transaction is indistinguishable from a sale in which the seller takes back a mortgage to secure payment. Because of the similarity of such contracts to secured mortgage loans, courts have often treated them as secured debts rather than executory contracts. The classification of a particular contract depends on the terms of the transaction. If the seller has no significant duty to the buyer other than to convey title upon completion of payments, the contract should be found to be a secured debt and not an executory contract.

The December 15, 2016 Mortgage\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Pursuant to the December 15, 2016 deed, the Debtor obtained title to the Property in exchange for the $400,000 Mortgage. The Mortgage was a transfer as that term is defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (54), and the Plaintiff seeks the avoidance of the Mortgage under Counts I-III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The Mortgage was not a fraudulent transfer as to creditors of the Debtor because the Debtor obtained Property worth $419,000 in exchange for the execution of the $400,000 Mortgage securing the previously unsecured $400,000 Note. For purposes of section 548, \" 'value' means property, or the satisfaction or securing of a present or antecedent debt of the debtor ...\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20548\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2)(A). The Debtor received more than reasonably equivalent value for the $400,000 Mortgage-she obtained a deed to the Property worth $419,000. Had the Debtor not executed the Mortgage, she would not have become the owner of the Property. The Debtor's creditors (and the Plaintiff) could not have reached the Property to satisfy their claims prior to December 15, 2016 and, therefore, the creditors were not adversely effected by the execution of the Mortgage. The December 15, 2016 transaction was neutral in terms of creditors' ability to collect their debts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The Trustee in his Complaint presupposes that if he is successful in avoiding the $400,000 Note, the Mortgage is void, stating that if \"the Note was a fraudulent conveyance, the Mortgage is unsupported by any valid payment obligation and therefore void\" [sic]. The Court rejects this logic and, accordingly, concludes that the Plaintiff has failed to state a plausible claim for the avoidance of the Mortgage in Counts I-III. The Note is voidable and not void. At the time the Debtor executed the Mortgage, the Note was a valid obligation and \"supported\" the Mortgage. \"If the trustee avoids a 'transfer,' he can recover the property transferred or the value of the property under \u00a7 550. If, on the other hand, he avoids an obligation, the obligation is rendered unenforceable, there is nothing to return and \u00a7 550 affords no remedy.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Asia Global Crossing, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1579712\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/333/199/#p203\">\n    333 B.R. at 202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   In addition, the Court concludes that the transfer represented by the Mortgage was supported by valuable consideration in the form of the deed to the Property from the Trust to the Debtor.

At the time the Debtor executed the Mortgage in favor of the Defendants, they held an unsecured Note in the sum of $400,000. The Defendants transferred the Property to the Debtor and she then executed the Mortgage to secure the pre-existing Note, thus enabling the Debtor to obtain the Property and the Defendants to obtain the ability to satisfy the Note either through Debtor's regular monthly mortgage payments or foreclosure. Without the contemporaneous transfer of the Property to the Debtor, the execution of the Mortgage would have served no purpose and would not have constituted a \"transfer\" as the Defendants, not the Debtor, held title to the Property. In other words, without the Defendants' contemporaneous transfer of the Property\n   <em>\n    to\n   </em>\n   the Debtor, there could have been no \"transfer of an interest of the debtor in property.\" As noted above, the transfer represented by the Mortgage did not enable the Defendants to receive more than they would have in a Chapter 7 case because without the execution of the deed and the conveyance of the Property to the Debtor, the transfer would not have been made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The Court need not consider the enabling loan defense (or any other defenses) to preference liability with respect to the Mortgage as the Plaintiff's Count V does not state a claim to avoid a preferential transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.
