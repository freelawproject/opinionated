Schaaf, Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter is before the Court on the Debtor's Emergency Motion to Enforce Discharge Injunction Against Kentucky Tax Bill Servicing, Inc. and Bilz &amp; Associates, P.S.C., and for an Award of Damages, Including Attorney's Fees, Mild Non-Compensatory Monetary Damages, and Costs (\"Sanctions Motion\"). [ECF No. 126.] The Debtor alleges that Kentucky Tax Bill Servicing, Inc. (\"KTBS\") and its counsel, Bilz &amp; Associates, P.S.C. (\"Bilz\"), are seeking to recover a personal debt discharged in the Debtor's chapter 7 bankruptcy. KTBS and Bilz filed a Response to Debtor's Emergency Motion to Enforce Discharge Injunction and Motion for an Award of Damages in which they deny the Debtor's allegations. [ECF No. 132.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A hearing was held on January 18, 2018. The Court provided an opportunity for the parties to supplement their papers. KTBS and Bilz chose to stand on their Response and the Debtor submitted her reply brief. [ECF No. 143.] Thereafter the matter was submitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Sanctions Motion is granted. KTBS and Bilz have taken actions to collect a debt that was discharged in the Debtor's bankruptcy case, so they are in contempt of the discharge injunction. As a sanction for their contemptible conduct, attorney's fees and costs are assessed jointly and severally against KTBS and Bilz. Non-compensatory damages are not imposed, subject to the admonitions herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Procedural History.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Debtor's Bankruptcy Case.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Debtor filed for chapter 13 relief on October 22, 2009 [ECF No. 1], and converted to chapter 7 on November 4, 2010 [ECF No. 92]. At the time of filing, the Debtor owned numerous parcels of real property, including:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   The \"Franklin County Properties\":\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 a house and lot located at 128 Allnutt Drive, Frankfort, Franklin County, Kentucky, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 a house and lot located at 109 Phillips Street, Frankfort, Franklin County, Kentucky.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The \"Johnson County Properties\":\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 721 Washington Ave., Paintsville, Johnson County, Kentucky, and\n   \u2022 a house and lot located at KY Lane, Paintsville, Johnson County, Kentucky.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [ECF No. 26, Sch. A.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Debtor also scheduled a significant amount of property tax debt. The City of Frankfort was listed as one of several secured creditors based on some of the Debtor's property tax obligations. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] As a property owner, the Debtor is obligated to pay a tax on the assessed value of her real property unless an exception applies. Ky. Const. \u00a7\u00a7 3, 171 -74;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   KY. REV. STAT. \u00a7 132.020(1)(a) (the owner of real property is obligated to pay the annual assessment). Due to the Debtor's failure to pay taxes assessed on the Franklin County Properties, the City of Frankfort had a lien on those properties for eleven years following the date the taxes became delinquent. KY. REV. STAT. \u00a7 134.420(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Unpaid taxes are evidenced by a certificate of delinquency that the taxing authority may sell to a third party in lieu of pursuing collection on its own.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   KY. REV. STAT. \u00a7\u00a7 134.119 -129. The third-party purchaser may collect the tax and other specified amounts from the taxpayer through a collection action and foreclosure on the tax lien. KY. REV. STAT. \u00a7\u00a7 134.452, 134.490, 134.546. The record shows KTBS is a third-party purchaser and holder of certificates of delinquency associated with the past due taxes assessed on the Franklin County Properties.\n   <em>\n    See infra\n   </em>\n   . But the Debtor did not list KTBS as a creditor on her Schedules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Debtor received her discharge on December 6, 2011. [ECF No. 121.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Franklin County Actions.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Two lawsuits were filed in Franklin Circuit Court related to property tax liens on the Franklin County Properties in 2010. Case No. 10-CI-01198 addressed tax liens on the Allnutt Drive property (\"Case 1198\") and Case No. 10-CI-01199 involved tax liens on the Phillips Street property (\"Case 1199\"). Case 1198 and Case 1199 are referred to collectively herein as the \"Franklin County Actions\". Bilz represented KTBS in the Franklin County Actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The papers filed indicate KTBS was a named defendant in the Franklin County Actions because it acquired certificates of delinquency related to the Franklin County Properties. In late 2016, KTBS moved for\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   default and summary judgment in the Franklin County Actions. The Affidavit of Status of Account filed in Case 1198 shows KTBS is the owner of a certificate of delinquency for 2002 Franklin County property taxes on the Allnutt Drive property. [ECF No. 126-2, p. 11 of 25.] The Affidavit of Status of Account filed in Case 1199 shows KTBS is the owner of a certificate of delinquency for 2005 Franklin County property taxes on the Phillips Street property. [ECF No. 126-3, p. 10 of 21.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On December 6, 2016, the Franklin Circuit Court entered its Order Granting in Rem Default and Summary Judgment in Case 1198. The Order grants \"an\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   judgment against the subject property in the amount of Six Thousand Three Hundred Eighty-Four Dollars and Fifty Cents ($6,384.50) plus continuing interest in the amount of 12% per annum from date of entry of judgment until paid.\" [ECF No. 144, p. 3 of 7.] On March 7, 2017, the Franklin Circuit Court entered its Order Granting in Rem Default and Summary Judgment in Case 1199. The Order grants \"an\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   judgment against the subject property in the amount of Five Thousand Six Hundred Seventy-Two Dollars and Thirty Cents ($5,672.30) plus continuing interest in the amount of 12% per annum from date of entry of judgment until paid.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 6 of 7.] These\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   judgments\n   are referred to collectively herein as the \"Franklin County Judgments\".\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Counsel for KTBS and Bilz explained at the January 18 hearing that foreclosure sales followed entry of the Franklin County Judgments. Counsel said one sale did not generate sufficient funds to satisfy the debt and the other did not sell at all.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Johnson County Judgment Liens and Litigation.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Subsequent to, or possibly before, the foreclosure sales of the Franklin County Properties, KTBS, through Bilz, filed judgment liens naming the Debtor as the \"Judgment Debtor\" in Johnson County, Kentucky. The Notice of Judgment Lien regarding Case 1198 was filed March 24, 2017, and is of record in State Lis Pendens Book 71, Page 57, in the Johnson County Clerk's Office (the \"Case 1198 Lien\"). [ECF No. 126-4, p. 9 of 10.] The Case 1198 Lien indicates the judgment amount is $6,384.50 and provides that the filing shall \"act as a lien upon all real estate in your County in which the above Judgment Debtor has any ownership.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] The Case 1198 Lien specifically states it is an attempt to collect a debt. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 10 of 10.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Notice of Judgment Lien related to Case 1199 was also filed March 24, 2017, and is of record in State Lis Pendens Book 71, Page 55, in the Johnson County Clerk's Office (the \"Case 1199 Lien\"). [ECF No. 126-4, p. 7 of 10.] The Case 1199 Lien indicates the judgment amount is $5,672.30 and provides that the filing shall \"act as a lien upon all real estate in your County in which the above Judgment Debtor has any ownership.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] The Case 1199 Lien specifically states it is an attempt to collect a debt. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 8 of 10.] The Case 1198 Lien and the Case 1199 Lien are referred to collectively herein as the \"Judgment Liens\".\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On November 13, 2017, Bilz, acting for KTBS, filed a Complaint for Foreclosure with Notice under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act in Johnson Circuit Court, being Case No. 17-CI-00386 (the \"Johnson County Action\"). In the Complaint, KTBS represented that it had \"obtained an in personam judgment against Defendant June Joseph in Franklin Circuit Civil Case No. 10-CI-1198 ... and in Franklin Circuit Civil Case No. 10-CI-1199 ... by virtue of unpaid certificates of delinquency.\" [ECF No. 126-4, \u00b6 3.] KTBS further alleged that it is the holder of the Judgment Liens that are due and payable. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 4-5.] In its prayer for relief, KTBS asked for entry of a \"supplemental judgment against June M. Joseph ... in an amount to be determined by the trier of fact,\" foreclosure on the Johnson County Properties, and payment of the Judgment Liens from the proceeds of the sale. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 30-35.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On January 2, 2018, the Debtor filed an answer and counter-claim asserting the relief requested is barred by her chapter 7 discharge and violates the discharge injunction.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and 524(a). Shortly thereafter, Bilz asked counsel for the Debtor to agree to an amendment that would fix the erroneous allegation that KTBS had obtained\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   judgments against the Debtor in the Franklin County Actions. Debtor's counsel refused and demanded dismissal of the complaint. KTBS then filed a motion in the Johnson Circuit Court asking for leave to file an amended complaint. [ECF No. 126-9.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Following numerous attempts to resolve the dispute without court intervention, the Debtor was forced to file the underlying\n   Sanctions Motion before the hearing on the motion for leave to file an amended complaint. Counsel for KTBS agreed at the January 18 hearing that it would not pursue the pending motion in the Johnson County Action scheduled for hearing the next day, so immediate relief was not required. Therefore, any discussion regarding the emergency nature of the hearing is unnecessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The alleged violation of the discharge injunction arises because KTBS and Bilz filed Judgment Liens based on the Franklin County Judgments and then pursued foreclosure in the Johnson County Action in an attempt to satisfy the 2002 and 2005 tax liens assessed on the Franklin County Properties. These actions violated the discharge injunction and the Debtor is entitled to relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Debtor's Personal Liability on the Certificates of Delinquency Was Discharged, But KTBS Could Pursue the Tax Liens on the Franklin County Properties.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   An individual debtor in a chapter 7 proceeding is entitled to a discharge unless any exceptions apply.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). No exceptions were raised in the Debtor's bankruptcy case, so the Discharge of Debtor in a Chapter 7 Case was entered on December 6, 2011 (the \"Discharge Order\"). [ECF No. 121.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Discharge Order voids any judgment that establishes personal liability for a discharged debt.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20524\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). This means the Debtor's\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   tax obligations evidenced by the certificates of delinquency held by KTBS were discharged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   This is true even though KTBS was not listed as a creditor and did not file a proof of claim. KTBS and Bilz seem to suggest in their Response that the omissions justify their actions, but the failure to list a dischargeable debt in a no-asset chapter 7 case is not meaningful. Failure to list a dischargeable debt does not change the fact that the debt was discharged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zirnhelt v. Madaj (In re Madaj)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1362714,11705061\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/149/467/\">\n    149 F.3d 467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 472 (6th Cir. 1998) (holding that grounds do not exist to reopen a closed no-asset chapter 7 case to add an omitted creditor post-discharge because the omitted debt was already discharged). The debts owed to KTBS are clearly prepetition claims and KTBS conceded the dischargeability of the Debtor's\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   liability for tax debts multiple times. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 132, p. 2, 4 and 7 of 16; ECF No. 134 (additional comments by counsel at the January 18 hearing conceding the dischargeability of the Debtor's personal obligations).]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Discharge Order also \"operates as an injunction against the commencement or continuation of an action, the employment of process, or an act, to collect, recover or offset any such debt [\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 524(a)(1) ] as a personal liability of the debtor, whether or not discharge of such debt is waived ...\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20524\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). The discharge injunction promotes the fresh start policy of the Bankruptcy Code.\n   <em>\n    In re Oster\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=474%20Fed.%20Appx.%20422\">\n    474 Fed.Appx. 422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 424 (6th Cir. 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The discharge injunction does not, however, interfere with the longstanding principal that prepetition liens survive the bankruptcy case. As explained by the United States Supreme Court, \"a bankruptcy discharge extinguishes only one mode of enforcing a claim-namely, an action against the debtor\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   -while leaving intact another-namely, an action against the debtor\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Home State Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107779\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/78/#p84\">\n    501 U.S. 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 84,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6507321,1107779\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/111/2150/\">\n    111 S.Ct. 2150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107779\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/78/#p84\">\n    115 L.Ed.2d 66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991). Therefore,\n   the Debtor's personal liability was discharged, but KTBS was entitled to pursue collection of the Debtor's tax obligations by foreclosure of the tax liens on the Franklin County Properties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    B. KTBS Violated the Discharge Injunction by Attempting to Collect the Discharged Personal Obligation of the Debtor.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   A creditor that violates the discharge injunction may be held in contempt of court.\n   <em>\n    Pertuso v. Ford Motor Credit Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11174552,11172075\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/233/417/\">\n    233 F.3d 417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 421-423 (6th Cir.2000). The Debtor has the burden of proof to show by clear and convincing evidence that (1) the creditor violated the discharge injunction and (2) the creditor did so with actual knowledge of the injunction.\n   <em>\n    In re Frambes\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 08-22398,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%20400735\">\n    2012 WL 400735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (Bankr. E.D. Ky. Feb. 7, 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Debtor has met her burden by clear and convincing evidence. KTBS and Bilz admit they are trying to collect a prepetition claim evidenced by the certificates of delinquency in the Johnson County Action. [ECF No. 132, p. 2, 4 of 16.] They do not dispute knowledge of the discharge injunction and the record confirms they knew of the Discharge Order at least by July 5, 2013. [ECF No. 126-1 (the Notice of Termination of Automatic Stay filed by Bilz for KTBS in Case 1199 references the Discharge Order).] KTBS and Bilz insist that they are not seeking a personal judgment against the Debtor, and admit the discharge injunction prohibits them from collecting from the Debtor personally. [ECF No. 132, p. 2, 4-5, and 7 of 16.] But KTBS and Bilz claim they are not violating the discharge injunction because they only seek to satisfy the prepetition tax obligations through an\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   judgment against the Johnson County Properties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   An examination of the basis for the Johnson County Action does not support KTBS's and Bilz's characterization of their actions. KTBS and Bilz argue that the Johnson County Action does not violate the discharge injunction because it is: (1) a continuation of the\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   proceedings on the original tax liens; and (2) it was brought pursuant to a statutory lien created by K.R.S. \u00a7 134.546(4). [ECF No. 132, p. 6-10 of 16.] These arguments are unpersuasive because the liens KTBS and Bilz rely on are extinguished, non-existent, or invalid, and the liens could not secure a discharged personal obligation on a prepetition debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Original Tax Liens were Adjudicated and Extinguished.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Recognizing that only prepetition liens survive the bankruptcy proceeding, KTBS and Bilz argue the Johnson County Action is \"nothing more than a continuation of the same\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   proceedings on the same tax liens, but against other non-exempt prepetition properties which are statutorily subject to such tax liens.\" [ECF No. 132, p. 6 of 16.] There were only two liens against the Franklin County Properties held by KTBS when the Debtor filed bankruptcy and those prepetition tax liens were created by K.R.S. \u00a7 134.420(1). These liens extended only to the Franklin County Properties pursuant to the plain language of the statute. KTBS's interest based on those tax liens was adjudicated in Franklin Circuit Court, resulting in the\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   Franklin County Judgments. The tax liens were thereafter extinguished when the Franklin County Properties were sold by the master commissioner. \"In Kentucky, a sale of real property pursuant to a judicial decree extinguishes a creditor's liens thereon.\"\n   <em>\n    U.S. v. Wood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7405651\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/658/1561/#p1566\">\n    658 F.Supp. 1561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1566 (W.D. Ky. 1987) ) (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The original tax liens never attached to the Debtor's Johnson County Property and cannot support KTBS's and Bilz's attempt to collect on the certificates of delinquency in the Johnson County Action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    2. K.R.S. \u00a7 134.546(4) Does Not Create A Statutory Lien on the Johnson County Properties.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   KTBS also claims the Johnson County Action does not violate the discharge injunction because it only seeks to satisfy the Franklin County tax liability through an\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   judgment based on a lien created by K.R.S. \u00a7 134.546(4). [ECF No. 132, p. 4 of 16.] Section 134.546(4) provides: \"Any property while owned by a delinquent taxpayer shall be subject to foreclosure or execution in satisfaction of a judgment pursuant to an action in rem or an action in personam, or both, to enforce the obligation.\" KTBS argues that K.R.S. \u00a7 134.546(4) creates a \"statutory security interest in the subject properties for the amounts of the unsatisfied\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   judgments, which it perfected by filing its notices of lien....\" [ECF No. 132, p. 7 of 16.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   KTBS cited no authority to support its argument that K.R.S. \u00a7 134.546(4) creates a statutory lien prepetition or post-petition. Also, there is no mention of the creation of a lien in the legislative history of K.R.S. \u00a7 134.546, nor has KTBS cited any case law that indicates subsection (4) creates a lien.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Talbot v.

Pursuit of a discharged liability is clearly a violation of the discharge injunction, even if it is supported by a statutory lien. No party has attempted to argue that state law would trump federal law related to the discharge injunction, so an extended discussion of preemption in this area is not required.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Rader v.

Thus, K.R.S. \u00a7 134.546(4) is not a valid basis for KTBS's alleged\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   recovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The Judgment Liens Cannot Support the\n    <em>\n     In Rem\n    </em>\n    Relief Sought by KTBS.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   KTBS and Bilz never explained why the Judgment Liens were required if liens were created on or attached to other properties as alleged. Also, K.R.S. 134.546(4) is not addressed in the original complaint, proposed amended complaint, or the Judgment Liens. [ECF No. 126-9.] If liens were created, the Judgment Liens were not necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Regardless, KTBS and Bilz had no right to file the Judgment Liens based on the Franklin County Judgments. Kentucky's judgment lien statute creates a lien to secure for a \"final judgment for the recovery of money or costs\" against real estate owned by a judgment debtor in the county where the lien is filed. K.R.S. \u00a7 426.720(1). The Judgment Liens do not fit within the statute because they are based on the Franklin County Judgments.

[ECF No. 126-2, p. 1 of 21; ECF No 126-3, p. 1 of 21.] Further, the memoranda in support of the summary judgment motions do not even request relief against the Debtor or her interest in the properties.

K.R.S. \u00a7 134.546(4) does not create a lien and the Judgment Liens cannot support the\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   relief sought by KTBS and Bilz. There is simply no lien-judicial, statutory, or otherwise-to support KTBS's filing of the Johnson County Action. Even if a lien did exist, it could only secure the deficiency remaining from the sale of the Franklin County Properties, which is a personal obligation that was discharged in the Debtor's bankruptcy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Despite KTBS and Bilz's arguments to the contrary, the Johnson County Action is nothing more than an attempt to collect a discharged debt through the guise of an\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   action. KTBS's and Bilz's arguments in support of their actions merely show their scramble to find a valid basis after the fact.

It is not necessary to find willfulness, however, because \"[a] creditor's mistaken belief as to the validity of its actions is not a defense to violating the discharge injunction.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Martin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=474%20B.R.%20789\">\n    474 B.R. 789\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir.

The Debtor has incurred attorney's fees and costs in defending the Johnson County Action and filing and prosecuting the underlying Sanctions Motion. An appropriate sanction for contemptible conduct is an assessment of the Debtor's attorney's fees and costs incurred as a result. The Debtor will have an opportunity to supplement the record with proof of the fees and costs incurred due to the violations found herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Debtor also asks for an award of mild, non-compensatory damages. Additional monetary sanctions are not imposed. But KTBS and Bilz are now on notice that their actions are a blatant violation of the\n   discharge injunction. If they continue to take actions that increase the monetary burden on this Debtor, additional sanctions are possible.
