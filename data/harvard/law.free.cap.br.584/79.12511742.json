Mark, Judge United States Bankruptcy Court\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The Court conducted a hearing on March 20, 2018, on secured creditor Stonebrook II HOA, Inc.'s (\"Stonebrook\") Motion to Allow Late Claim (the \"Motion\") [DE # 43]. In the Motion, Stonebrook asks the Court to allow Stonebrook's late-filed claim, Claim No. 3 (the \"Claim\"), alleging that it did not timely receive notice of the claims bar date. The Debtor does not object to allowance of Stonebrook's Claim. However, the Chapter 13 Trustee, Nancy Neidich, objected at the hearing, arguing that lack of notice is not a basis to allow a late claim under Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3002(c). The Court agrees with the Trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Court need not reach the issue of whether Stonebrook timely received notice of the claims bar date because insufficient notice is not cause for extending the time to file a proof of claim in this chapter 13 case. The deadline for filing a proof of claim in a chapter 13 case is set forth in Rule 3002(c) of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure. Rule 3002(c) also lists the only exceptions to the deadline for filing a proof of claim in a chapter 13 case and lack of notice is not one of them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Court finds that its discretion to enlarge the time for filing a proof of claim in a chapter 13 case is limited to the exceptions specifically identified in Rule 3002(c). Although some courts have allowed late-filed claims based on considerations beyond those listed in Rule 3002(c),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   this Court follows those courts that do not believe a bankruptcy court has the authority to judicially create a lack of notice exception to timely filing a proof of claim when that exception is not listed in the applicable rule.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gardenhire v.
