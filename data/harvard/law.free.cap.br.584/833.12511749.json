Schmetterer, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant the City of Chicago (\"the City\") has moved to dismiss the adversary complaint brought against it by Debtor Monica Cross (\"Debtor\") pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) (made applicable here by Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7012 ). The City challenges the legal sufficiency of Plaintiffs' allegations, arguing that because it has a valid possessory lien pursuant to Illinois law, its actions are excepted from the automatic stay pursuant to 11 U.S.C.\u00a7 362(b)(3) and (b)(4). Debtor disputes the validity of the City's possessory lien and asserts that it is not properly exercising its police powers by retaining possession of the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In addition, Debtor has filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction, seeking to mandatorily enjoin the City into turning over the vehicle because she faces irreparable harm by not being able to work if she is not allowed to use the car. The City contends that Debtor has not met any of the standards set forth by the Seventh Circuit for the imposition of a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   These matters, based upon the same set of facts and similar legal arguments, will\n   be considered together. For the reasons discussed below, the City's Motion to Dismiss is denied by separate order entered this date. Additionally, Debtor's Motion for Preliminary Injunction is granted by separate order entered this date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Seventh Circuit opinion in\n   <em>\n    Thompson v. Gen. Motors Acceptance Corp., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5895949,3648271\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/566/699/\">\n    566 F.3d 699\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 2009) placed the burden squarely upon creditors to initiate a showing as to why they should be allowed to retain vehicles of bankruptcy debtors that were seized prepetition. Unless such showing is initiated, creditors must surrender the vehicle because of the automatic stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The City of Chicago has completely disregarded this obligation, choosing instead to continue holding vehicles of debtors postpetition and waiting many months until proceedings are brought by debtors against them in bankruptcy and then asserting a response that its purported possessory lien grants it an exception to the automatic stay. The City has taken this tactical delay position to coerce debtors to pay traffic fines quickly and fully in their bankruptcy plan and also to avoid paying filing fees required for the filing of motions for relief from the automatic stay. In this way, the City is circumventing entirely the procedural burden imposed on it by\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   and the protections provided to debtors by the automatic stay. The City must comply with the requirements of\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   so that debtors may, unless some cause is shown, recover their vehicles in bankruptcy, allowing them to continue working and making payments under their Chapter 13 plans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND FACTS ALLEGED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Debtor filed her underlying petition for Chapter 13 bankruptcy relief on January 12, 2018. Debtor's vehicle, a 2009 Cadillac SRX, was purchased from CarMax, and CarMax has a purchase money secured interest in the vehicle for $27,340.88. CarMax has valued the vehicle at $9,425.00. Debtor asserts that the vehicle is worth only $6,000.00 and that she has claimed a $2,400.00 exemption in the vehicle. Prior to the Debtor's filing of this bankruptcy case on January 12, 2018, the City seized the Debtor's vehicle in December 2017 or January 2018. The Debtor has incurred 38 total tickets, 7 of which she has paid, and one of which was dismissed. The 30 other tickets remain outstanding. The City initially filed a secured claim, Claim No. 3, in the amount of $5,099.90, but that claim has since been amended to $4,459.90. Debtor has requested that the City turnover her vehicle, but on April 17, 2018, the City informed Debtor that it would not do so unless the Debtor paid the entire secured claim in full, in regular monthly payments over the course of her Chapter 13 plan. The City would only agree to those terms and stated that upon confirmation of such a plan, the vehicle would be released to Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Debtor filed her instant adversary complaint against the City and CarMax on May 1, 2018. Debtor pleads two Counts against the City. In Count I, Debtor alleges that the City's lien is inferior to CarMax's purchase money interest, and thus, the City has no secured interest in the vehicle. Under Count I, Debtor seeks relief in the form of an order finding that CarMax is the superior lienholder, requiring the City to turnover the vehicle pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20542\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and finding that the City has violated its duty to turn over property of the estate pursuant to that same statute. In Count II, Debtor alleges that the City has violated the automatic stay by continuing to hold her vehicle, and that her plan provides for monthly payments\n   based on the value of the vehicle to the superior lienholder, CarMax. Under Count II, Debtor seeks relief in form of damages from the City for any duration of time during which it has impermissibly held her vehicle, as well as attorney's fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The City filed its Motion to Dismiss on May 4, 2018. City argues that pursuant to Illinois law, it has a statutory, superpriority possessory lien for towing and storage fees that supersedes CarMax's purchase money interest in the vehicle. As a matter of law, the City argues, that possessory lien entitles it to retain Debtor's vehicle. The City also asserts that Debtor cannot seek turnover pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20542\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   because it cannot be used to alter or avoid substantive lien rights and it is merely an enabling statute. Moreover, the City argues that turnover pursuant to \u00a7 542 requires that the Debtor have a substantive right to possession on the petition date, which the City argues Debtor did not have as the car was seized pursuant to an exercise of the City's police powers. Additionally, the City argues that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) does not require turnover because the City's actions are excepted from the automatic stay pursuant to 11 U.S.C. 362(b)(3) and 362(b)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Debtor filed her Response on May 15, 2018. She argues that she has adequately plead facts to sustain her complaint and that each of the facts plead by her supports her allegations against the City. Debtor also argues that as a matter of law it is the City who does not have any right to her vehicle as it does not have a valid lien pursuant to Judge Cox's opinion\n   <em>\n    In re Howard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12511693\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/584/252/#p255\">\n    584 B.R. 252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 255 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 2018). Debtor also asserts that whether the City has a superpriority lien or not is irrelevant, as a Seventh Circuit panel held in\n   <em>\n    Thompson v. Gen. Motors Acceptance Corp., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5895949,3648271\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/566/699/\">\n    566 F.3d 699\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 708 (7th Cir. 2009) that creditors are unequivocally required to turnover vehicles to debtors pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20542\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, the Debtor states that she had an interest in the vehicle that required turnover upon her request. Finally, Debtor asserts that the City is not excepted from the automatic stay pursuant to either\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3) or \u00a7 362(b)(4) because it neither has a valid possessory lien on the vehicle, nor has it demonstrated that its purpose for immobilizing Debtor's vehicle is non-pecuniary in nature and that Debtor is the type of driver that should be kept off the roads for the sake of public safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Additionally, Debtor filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction on May 3, 2018, seeking to mandatorily enjoin the City into returning her vehicle. Debtor states that she requires the vehicle as she is a substitute teacher who must travel to different schools in order to perform her duties. She argues that pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Thompson v. Gen. Motors Acceptance Corp., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5895949,3648271\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/566/699/\">\n    566 F.3d 699\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 707-08 (7th Cir. 2009), the City is required to turnover the automobile under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20542\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . She also states that she is likely to succeed in the adversary proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The City filed its Response to Debtor's Motion for Preliminary Injunction on May 15, 2018. It argues that pursuant to Illinois law, the Debtor has not met the standards as to any element required for a preliminary injunction. Those elements are, (1) whether the movant will suffer irreparable harm prior to a final resolution, (2) whether there is an adequate remedy at law, (3) whether the movant has a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits.\n   <em>\n    Turnell v. CentiMark Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5770007\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/796/656/#p661\">\n    796 F.3d 656\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 661 (7th Cir. 2015). The court is then asked to (4) weigh the irreparable harm facing movant against the irreparable harm that may be inflicted upon the non-moving party, and (5) the effects, if any, the grant or denial of\n   such a preliminary injunction would have against third parties.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5770007\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/796/656/#p661\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The City argues that no irreparable harm will occur to Debtor if she does not have her vehicle, and that Debtor has an adequate remedy at law should any harm occur at all, in the form of monetary damages. The City also asserts that, based upon its possessory lien and the stay exception of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3) that allows a creditor to take any action to maintain perfection of its liens, the Debtor is unlikely to prevail in the underlying adversary proceeding. The City also asserts that it faces great harm if it is forced to give up the vehicle, specifically if Debtor chooses to dismiss the adversary proceeding and simply walk away with the vehicle without providing a replacement lien. The City does not articulate what type of replacement lien could be given, though it asserts that no such replacement lien will adequately protect its interest in the way that a possessory lien does. Finally, the City asserts that public interest favors the City because the entire objective of impounding and retaining vehicles of debtors is to deter bad driving behavior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION AND VENUE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Subject matter jurisdiction lies under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Alternatively, a creditor may file an emergency motion for relief from the automatic stay and attempt to initiate a showing as to why they should be allowed to retain vehicles of bankruptcy debtors that were seized prepetition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Since the bankruptcy was filed in January, the City has not returned the Debtor's vehicle or filed any motion attempting to show that it should be allowed to retain Debtor's vehicle in direct contravention of\n   <em>\n    Thompson.\n   </em>\n   It is ignoring its procedural burden to either return the vehicle or make a showing as to why it should be allowed to retain the vehicle, and thus violating the automatic stay. The City is instead choosing to wait until debtors in bankruptcy challenge their possession of the vehicle to assert that their possessory lien is excepted from the automatic stay. However, the Seventh Circuit panel in\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   made it clear that a creditor was to turnover possession of the vehicle upon the request of the debtor or immediately to file a defense like the one the City is arguing. The\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   opinion does not allow the City to delay the return of the vehicle without the filing of a motion, nor does it allow the City to rest on its heels and wait for a debtor to initiate an action against it and only then assert its defenses. Even if a higher court were to rule that the City's possessory lien is a valid exception to the automatic stay, debtors may still offer alternative, substantive\n   liens in their plans that could protect the City's right to payment and allow for the return of the vehicle. The City thus far has denied debtors the right to contest the City's defenses or offer alternative liens by retaining possession of the vehicles without initiating any procedure allowing it do so. It is abundantly clear that the City is ignoring the procedural requirements of\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   and making life unnecessarily difficult for debtors who need their vehicles in order to get to work, earn money, and make payments on their Chapter 13 plans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   First,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3)'s exception to the stay applies only to \"acts\" taken by creditors to maintain their perfection. Passive possession of a debtor's property for the purposes of maintaining possession does not constitute an \"act,\" and courts that have held otherwise are reading that provision to include both \"acts\n   <em>\n    or omissions\n   </em>\n   ,\" which is not what the statute says. Moreover, requiring that the City immediately turnover the vehicle upon Debtor's request or file an emergency motion for relief from stay in order to determine if it can be adequately protected, either by retaining the vehicle or by being granted some other replacement liens, is an alteration of only the City's procedural rights, not its substantive rights, contrary to its arguments otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The City asserts that that interpretation of \u00a7 362(b)(3)'s \"act\" language runs contrary to the interpretation of \"act\" in the Seventh Circuit's\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   opinion.

It is quite clear that the scope of \u00a7 362(b)(3) is narrow compared to the scope of \u00a7 362(a)(3). A narrower application of the phrase \"any act,\" is thus warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The City also argues that it must retain possession of the vehicle in order to maintain perfection of its possessory lien, and that no other lien would sufficiently protect its interests.

The impounded vehicle serves as collateral to ensure the City's receipt of the fine.\" That assertion by the City seems to indicate that its immobilization and impoundment program has more to do with its pecuniary interest than it does any concern over the welfare of the public. Thus, the City has not demonstrated that it unequivocally passes the pecuniary interest test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Additionally, the City has not demonstrated that it passes the public policy test with regards to this Debtor.

N.D. Ill. 2018), the Debtor clearly had a pattern of dangerous driving, with 9 red-light violations, 6 speeding tickets and numerous parking tickets. While no one category of violation was dispositive, the opinion held that as to that particular debtor, the City had made a showing that Debtor was a reckless driver of the kind that the City's immobilization and impoundment program was meant to keep off the roads.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12420614\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/582/6/#p9\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In this case, the City has not made such a showing. While the number of violations Debtor has incurred is substantial, there was no evidence offered of the types of violations committed. Instead, the 30 tickets are merely described as \"vehicle related violations.\" But, clearly running a red light is much different than parking illegally.

Debtor has stated that she is a substitute teacher and that without her vehicle she cannot take assignments at various schools around the area. Public transportation will not suffice because Debtor cannot always anticipate when and where she will be called into work. Moreover, even if Debtor can get to work consistently by way of public transportation, she must also ensure that her children arrive at school each day. Without the vehicle. Debtor will not be able to work and will not be able to afford the necessary Chapter 13 plan payments to continue with her bankruptcy. This is irreparable harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Second, the Debtor does not have an adequate remedy at law. While the City is correct that both\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (k) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20542\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   contemplate that a debtor may seek monetary damages, Debtor will only receive that money after a judgment has been rendered. Receiving money after extensive litigation does nothing to alleviate Debtor's current issue, which is that she cannot get to work or drop her children off to school without the car. If she is not able to take up substitute teaching assignments, then she cannot make payments on her plan to the Chapter 13 Trustee. A future judgment is not an adequate remedy at this moment. Moreover, the City is under the mistaken impression that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (k) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20542\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) state that money damages are the exclusive remedy for violations of the bankruptcy stay and refusal to turnover property of the estate. The language of those statutes does not support that conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Third, Debtor has shown that she has a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits. The Opinion in\n   <em>\n    Thompson v. Gen. Motors Acceptance Corp., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5895949,3648271\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/566/699/\">\n    566 F.3d 699\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 707-08 (7th Cir. 2009), unequivocally requires creditors to return vehicles to debtors upon their request. While the City argues strenuously that its possessory lien requires it to maintain possession of the vehicle in order to remain perfected, it is doubtful whether such passive possession of the vehicle satisfies the requirements of the stay exception of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3), as discussed above. Moreover, while the City argues that it could be granted no lien to adequately protect it from the loss of its possessory lien, that too is a weak assumption given that the City's only goal is to receive full payment of the civil fines it has levied against Debtor, and that it does not necessarily need possession of the vehicle in order to achieve this through the Debtor's plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Kennedy\n   </em>\n   , No. 17 CV 5945,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202087453\">\n    2018 WL 2087453\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr.

The Debtor has case law to support her position and has a reasonable chance of succeeding on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Having satisfied the first part of the two-step analysis, the possibility of harm to the Debtor must be weighed against the possibility of harm to the City. Again, this factor must now be weighed heavily in favor of the Debtor. The City argues that it will be irreparably banned if it is required to give up possession of the vehicle because that would spell the end of its possessory lien. But, as discussed above, \"Congress contemplated this situation and decided that other provisions of the code would adequately protect, and therefore\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     should replace\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , a creditor's possessory interests.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Kennedy\n   </em>\n   , No. 17 CV 5945,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202087453\">\n    2018 WL 2087453\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr.

The City's contention that Debtor is likely simply to dismiss her bankruptcy case and abscond with the vehicle is unsupported. Debtor is a substitute teacher. Her entirely livelihood depends upon having her vehicle to travel to substitute\n   teaching assignments. Given the varying dates, times and locations that Debtor is asked to work, public transportation is not a particularly feasible option. Furthermore, in addition to her sporadic work schedule, Debtor must also drop her children off to school each day and do so prior to any work assignment she has that day. Clearly, if the injunction is not granted, Debtor is more likely to suffer irreparable harm than the City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Finally, the City asserts that it is in the best interests of the public to prevent Debtor from driving her vehicle in order to deter bad driving behavior arguing that there is great injury if, \"enforcement is impossible [because] vehicle owners can repeatedly ignore with impunity the sanctions imposed for violation of the ordinances.\"\n   <em>\n    Grant v.

Ill. 1984). While the Debtor has accumulated 30 outstanding tickets, there has been no showing yet that the type of bad behavior the City believes is paramount to the safety and convenience of the public was engaged in by the Debtor. Qualitatively, there is a difference between illegally parking and running red lights, and while both result in civil fines, the type of driver who routinely puts the lives of others in danger is more of a public menace than the one who double parks. Evidence as to the nature of Debtor's particular violations is not offered. Public policy generally favors keeping dangerous ordinance violators off the road, but the application of that public policy to this particular Debtor is not shown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Overall, however, it is clear that 4 of the 5 factors articulated by the Seventh Circuit weight heavily in favor of the Debtor.\n   <em>\n    Turnell v. CentiMark Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5770007\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/796/656/#p661\">\n    796 F.3d 656\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 661 (7th Cir. 2015).

Additionally, Debtor's Motion for Preliminary Injunction will be granted and a mandatory injunction will be created requiring the City to return Debtor's vehicle to her.
