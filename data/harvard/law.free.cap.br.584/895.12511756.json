Johnson's debts to it are excepted from discharge under sections 523(a)(2), (4) and (6) of the Bankruptcy Code. Doc. 1. Debtor denies the allegations. Doc. 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Portal Investments filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on October 31, 2017. Doc. 26. In support of its motion, Portal Investments offered a number of documents related to a JAMS Arbitration Case,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   including a Corrected Final Order and Award dated October 12, 2017. Doc. 28, exhibits 1-5. Portal Investments asserts the findings and conclusions included in the Corrected Final Order and Award collaterally estop Debtor from litigating the issues determined in the arbitration in this bankruptcy adversary proceeding. Doc. 27. Debtor resists the motion, but does not dispute the authenticity or admissibility of the Corrected Final Order and Award. Doc. 32. Rather, Debtor argues that whether the arbitrator's findings of fact support a finding of nondischargeability in bankruptcy is a question that was not addressed in the arbitration. Consequently, Debtor maintains that whether his debt to Portal Investments is excepted from discharge has not been \"actually and necessarily\" decided and therefore litigation of this issue is not precluded by collateral estoppel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. Debtor also argues summary judgment is inappropriate because questions of fact remain regarding the sum of damages attributable to Portal Investments' nondisclosure claim as compared to its breach of fiduciary duty claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6. He maintains that if the Court finds the debt he owes to Portal Investments excepted from discharge under only one theory of liability, it would be impossible for the Court to allocate the award between the two causes of action and determine exactly what portion is nondischargeable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the reasons stated below, the Court concludes that Portal Investments met its burden of showing that Debtor is collaterally\n   estopped from relitigating the issues actually and necessarily decided in the arbitration proceedings and that the arbitrator's findings satisfy the elements of Portal Investments' section 523(a)(2)(A) cause of action.

Specifically, it argues that the arbitrator made findings of fact sufficient to satisfy its fraud claims and that the issues adjudicated in the arbitration proceedings were identical to those at issue under sections 523(a)(2)(A), (a)(4) and (a)(6). Portal Investments also argues that it satisfied the remaining elements of collateral estoppel by showing that the parties were the same, the parties actually\n   litigated their disputes, the arbitrator entered a final judgment, and the findings of fact that proved the elements of its nondisclosure and breach of fiduciary duty claims in the arbitration (as well as the elements of its section 523 causes of action) were essential to the arbitration ruling. In support of these arguments, Portal Investments included a Statement of Established Facts in its brief (Doc. 27) and offered the arbitrator's interim orders, Final Order and Award and Corrected Final Order and Award as exhibits. Docs. 28-2 through 28-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In his response, Debtor does not challenge the authenticity or admissibility of the arbitrator's orders. Instead, he argues that the ultimate question at issue in this adversary proceeding-whether the findings of fact support a conclusion that the arbitration award is excepted from discharge in bankruptcy-has not been \"actually and necessarily litigated,\" an essential element of collateral estoppel. Doc. 32 at 4. Specifically, Debtor asserts \"whether the underlying facts of the [fraudulent nondisclosure and breach of fiduciary duty] elements above support a finding of nondischargeability in bankruptcy was not addressed in the arbitration.\" Doc. 32 at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Contrary to Debtor's assertion, the doctrine of collateral estoppel may preclude relitigation of issues decided in arbitration proceedings even if the arbitrator did not decide bankruptcy discharge issues.\n   <em>\n    B &amp; B Hardware, Inc., v.

Thus, the question is not whether the arbitrator decided whether Debtor is entitled to a bankruptcy discharge; it is whether the arbitrator considered the same material factual issues and legal standards in deciding the fraudulent nondisclosure and breach of fiduciary duty causes of action as this Court considers in deciding whether Portal Investments met the elements of its section 523 claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1307.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Debtor also argues summary judgment is inappropriate because questions of fact remain regarding the amount of damages attributable to Debtor's liability for fraudulent nondisclosure and breach of fiduciary duty, respectively. Debtor urges the Court to assess the dischargeability of the specific debt arising from each theory of liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Given that Portal Investments' motion is premised on the arbitrator's fact findings and legal conclusions, this Court will determine whether the interim orders together with the Corrected Final Order and Award should be granted preclusive effect and whether the arbitrator's determinations satisfy the elements of Portal Investments' section 523 causes of action. Finally, it will analyze the arbitrator's damage assessment to determine whether all or part of Debtor's debt to Portal Investments is dischargeable.

Both causes of action require proof of material nondisclosure of facts with intent to deceive, justifiable reliance and damages proximately caused by the nondisclosure. These are the issues that were actually litigated and decided in the arbitration proceedings. They are the same facts this Court must consider in deciding whether to deny discharge of Debtor's debt to Portal Investments. The arbitrator's determinations on the issues of materiality, nondisclosure, intent and reliance were necessary to finding Debtor liable for fraudulent nondisclosure and awarding Portal Investments damages in the arbitration proceedings.

Debtor and his co-defendants sought modification of the award, and when the arbitrator declined to alter it they did not appeal the matter further. Moreover, Debtor does not challenge the Corrected Final Order and Award's validity or finality in this adversary proceeding. Significantly, it is apparent from the arbitration proceedings that the Corrected Final Order and Award was the last step in the arbitration process. Accordingly, the Court finds that the JAMS Corrected Final Order and Award is a valid and final judgment on Portal Investments' claims for fraudulent nondisclosure and breach of fiduciary duty. Portal Investments met its burden of proving the fourth element of collateral estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In summary, the issues actually litigated between the parties and necessarily adjudicated to final judgment in the arbitration are the same as the factual issues raised in Portal Investments' section 523(a)(2)(A) cause of action. Further, there is abundant evidence that Debtor was allowed a full and fair opportunity to be heard and defend himself in the arbitration. Both parties were represented by counsel throughout the arbitration.

Doc. 28-3, \u00b6 33.d. In addition, the arbitrator found that Schlumberger's interest in acquiring Grimes Sales &amp; Service, and with it the ability to control distribution of HG pumping units, was material information. He reasoned that Portal Service's board of directors and shareholders (including Portal Investments) would certainly consider information about the company's most lucrative product important in deciding how to proceed in settlement negotiations with Debtor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The arbitrator also found Debtor knew this information was material.

The arbitrator did not find credible Debtor's assertion at the Phase I hearings that Debtor \"thought nothing of\" the calls from the Canadian Competition Bureau, in effect considering information about the impending acquisition of Grimes Sales &amp; Service inconsequential in his assessment of his family's ongoing dispute with Portal Investments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The arbitrator observed that it was highly unusual that Debtor did not discuss the call with either of his sons or his attorney, given the frequency with which Debtor spoke to his sons about business matters and the centrality of the settlement negotiations at the time. Indeed, the arbitrator found withholding the information \"required a great deal of discipline and determination on [Debtor's] part.\" Doc. 28-4, \u00b6 31.

Doc. 28-3, \u00b6 48. The arbitrator found Debtor intended to induce Portal Investments into entering the Settlement Agreement without Portal Investments' knowledge of the impending Schlumberger-Grimes acquisition.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 33.d, 48.

The arbitrator expressed serious concerns about the credibility of all the Johnsons based on discrepancies in their trial testimony. He appeared particularly unimpressed with some of Debtor's statements. The arbitrator concluded that Debtor acted contrary to his normal habits in deliberately keeping critical information from his sons and attorney because he knew it would disrupt the settlement negotiations by introducing a new and material fact. Until February 6, 2014, Debtor was operating under the assumption-expressly stated by Grimes at the parties' January 30 meeting about the distribution agreement-that as long as Grimes was at the helm of Grimes Sales &amp; Service, Portal Service would be able to buy pumps from the company, and thus continue its HG pumping unit business. The arbitrator concluded that someone with this knowledge would immediately understand the significance of the Canadian Competition Bureau's call, and would know that concealing such information was detrimental to Portal Investments' negotiation posture. Therefore, he concluded Debtor had both the fiduciary duty\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   to disclose the information and the personal financial and familial interest to withhold it, making his behavior all the more deceptive. Considering the totality of the circumstances as outlined by the arbitrator, Portal Investments met its burden of showing that Debtor acted deliberately with the intent to deceive, satisfying the third element of section 523(a)(2)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

Doc. 28-3, \u00b6 49. Specifically, he found that Portal Investments was justified in relying on Debtor's duty to act consistently with his fiduciary duty as a director of Portal Service. At the time of the settlement negotiations, Portal Investments had no knowledge from any other source that Schlumberger was in the process\n   of acquiring Grimes Sales &amp; Service. To the contrary, Portal Investments was relying on Grimes' express statement that \"[a]s long as I am here, you will be able to buy pumps from me.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6476672,323761\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/116/437/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Given the business relationship of the parties and the circumstances of the previous communication with Grimes, Portal Investments had no reason to know Debtor may be withholding material information regarding the future viability of the HG pumping unit business, and thus no reason to investigate further. The arbitrator's findings of fact satisfy the element of justifiable reliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Debtor's representation proximately caused damage to Portal Investments.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In Phase I of the arbitration, the arbitrator found that Portal Investments provided \"at least colorable threshold evidence of damages sufficient to allow\" the arbitrator to further explore damages in Phase II of the arbitration. Doc. 28-3, \u00b6 50. Specifically, the arbitrator pointed to \"undisputed evidence that after close of the Settlement Agreement [Portal Investments] invested an additional $1.5 million in Portal [Service] in hopes of stimulating its ongoing business, and without knowledge that its HG Pump distribution operations were likely in jeopardy due to Schlumberger's pending or perhaps completed acquisition of Grimes [Sales &amp; Service.]\" Doc. 28-3, \u00b6 50. During Phase II, he elaborated, finding that \"but for [Debtor's] fraud and breach of fiduciary duty, [Portal Investments] would not have invested the additional $1.5 million into Portal [Service].\" Doc. 28-4, \u00b6 18. Portal Service subsequently lost its HG pumping unit distribution agreement with Grimes Sales &amp; Service, the business failed and Portal Investments lost its $1.5 million investment. Therefore, the arbitrator found that Portal Investments \"suffered consequential damages ... of $1,500,000 as a direct consequence of [Debtor's] fraudulent non-disclosure and breach of fiduciary duty.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20. This conclusion satisfies the damages and proximate cause element.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The arbitrator also assessed prejudgment interest on the consequential damages at the rate of eight percent, which is allowed under Colorado's \"wrongful withholding\" statute.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%205-12-102\">\n    Colo.

The arbitrator calculated interest on $750,000 from February 18, 2014 (the date of the first investment) and interest on $750,000 from April 4, 2014 (the date of the additional investment), for a total sum of $428,877.05 in prejudgment interest. Thus, the arbitrator found that Portal Investments suffered actual consequential damages of $1,927,877.05, plus per diem interest accruing from the date of the Interim Order and Award, June 12, 2017.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%205-12-102\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%205-12-102\">\n    at \u00b6 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In addition to consequential damages, the arbitrator awarded Portal Investments $1 million in exemplary damages.

Rev. Stat. \u00a7 13-21-102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(a) ). The arbitrator found that Portal Investments' injury was \"attended by circumstances of fraud,\" and that Debtor's conduct was \"willful and wanton\" within the meaning of Colorado law, rendering a claim for exemplary damages appropriate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2013-21-102\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2013-21-102\">\n    at \u00b6 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Finally, the arbitrator awarded costs and attorneys' fees during a third phase of the arbitration, as follows: (1) costs in favor of Portal Investments and against Debtor in the sum of $81,612.39; (2) costs in favor of Rival Holdings and against Portal Investments in the sum of $1,305.06; and (3) attorneys' fees in favor of Portal Investments and against Debtor in the sum of $695,588. In addition, the arbitrator reallocated $8,000 in arbitrator\n   expenses in favor of Portal Investments and against the Johnsons and Rival Holdings, jointly and severally. Based on the combined damages, costs and fees, Debtor's total debt to Portal Investments is $3,713,077.44, plus interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The arbitrator's findings satisfy the damages element of section 523(a)(2)(A). Accordingly, Portal Investments met its burden of proving Debtor's debt to it is excepted from discharge under section 523(a)(2)(A). Having reached this conclusion, the Court finds it unnecessary to analyze Portal Investments' section 523(a)(4) or (a)(6) causes of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    5. The entire arbitration award is excepted from discharge.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Debtor argues that summary judgment is inappropriate because there are genuine issues of material fact regarding the amount of damages attributable to each cause of action-fraudulent nondisclosure and breach of fiduciary duty-under which the arbitrator found Debtor liable. Debtor argues that if the Court finds his debt to Portal Investments excepted from discharge under only one subsection of section 523(a), it would be impossible to determine what portion of the arbitration award is attributable to the theory of liability that corresponds with that relevant subsection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   As noted above, the Court analyzed Portal Investments' section 523(a)(2)(A) claim only. Section 523(a)(2)(A) bars the discharge of all liability arising from fraud, including actual damages, punitive damages, attorneys' fees and costs.\n   <em>\n    Cohen v. de la Cruz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503450\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/213/#p223\">\n    523 U.S. 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 223,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"168136\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/118/1212/\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503450\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/213/#p223\">\n    140 L.Ed.2d 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998). \"Once it is established that specific money or property has been obtained by fraud, however, 'any debt' arising therefrom is excepted from discharge.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503450\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/213/#p223\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503450\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/213/#p223\">\n    at 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"168136\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/118/1212/\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Applying this principle, the Court finds that the arbitrator's entire award, including compensatory and exemplary damages, attorneys' fees and arbitration costs, is the result of Debtor's fraud, and therefore excepted from discharge under section 523(a)(2)(A). Several reasons support this finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   First, the arbitrator's findings suggest that the full sum of Portal Investments' $1.5 million loss is causally connected to Debtor's fraudulent nondisclosure. In his interim order in connection with the liability phase of the arbitration, the arbitrator observed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   [T]he undisputed evidence that after close of the Settlement Agreement [Portal Investments] invested an additional $1.5 million in Portal [Service] in hopes of stimulating its ongoing business, and without knowledge that its HG Pump distribution operations were likely in jeopardy due to Schlumberger's pending or perhaps completed acquisition of Grimes, provides at least colorable threshold evidence of damages sufficient to allow damages to be explored in a further phase of this arbitration.... I find that [Portal Investments] has sufficiently established its claim of fraudulent non-disclosure against [Debtor] to proceed to Phase II of this Arbitration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Ex. 28-3 at 15. Although the arbitrator did not calculate total damages during the liability phase of the arbitration proceedings, he found that Debtor's fraudulent nondisclosure served as an independent cause of Portal Investments' loss of its $1.5 million investment, and thus an independent basis for a compensatory damages award.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 28-3, \u00b6\u00b6 39-51. Because the fraudulent nondisclosure claim relies on the same controlling or material facts and applicable legal standards as Portal Investments' section 523(a)(2)(A) cause of action, $1.5 million is excepted from discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Second, when considering the arbitrator's interim and Corrected Final Order and Award, it is apparent that both Debtor's fraudulent nondisclosure and breach\n   of fiduciary duty serve as independent bases for the full damages award, rather than each justifying only part of the compensatory damages award as Debtor suggests. The arbitrator relied on the same findings of fact in determining liability under both fraudulent nondisclosure and breach of fiduciary duty. Doc. 28-3, \u00b6\u00b6 53-54. Therefore, while the arbitrator combines the two causes of action in his interim order in connection with the damages phase of the arbitration-referring to the consequences of Debtor's \"fraudulent non-disclosure and breach of fiduciary duty\"-the predicate for liability under both causes of action is the same: Debtor's failure to disclose material information he had a duty under Colorado law to disclose. Portal Investments' $1.5 million investment loss is causally connected to Debtor's fraudulent nondisclosure\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   breach of fiduciary duty. Each claim serves as an independent basis for Portal Investments' loss. Accordingly, the Court deems additional fact-finding on the matter of compensatory damages, and the arbitrator's award of prejudgment interest on those damages, unnecessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The arbitrator also awarded Portal Investments $1 million in exemplary damages, which Colorado law allows for cases of \"fraud, malice, or willful and wanton conduct.\" Doc. 28-4, \u00b6 28 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2013-21-102\">\n    Colo.

The arbitrator found that Portal Investments' injury was \"attended by circumstances of fraud,\" that \"[Debtor's] fraudulent conduct was 'willful and wanton' within the meaning of Colorado law,\" and that Debtor's \"intentional non-disclosure of material information ... was deliberate and self-serving.\" Finally, he concludes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   \"[a] party so bent on preventing disclosure of this material information from everyone until well after the settlement deal was closed can clearly be described as engaged in 'conduct purposefully committed which the actor must have realized as ... done heedlessly and recklessly, without regard to consequences, or of the rights ... of others, particularly the [Claimant].' \"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2013-21-102\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2013-21-102\">\n    at \u00b6\u00b6 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 31 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2013-21-102\">\n    Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 13-21-102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(b) ).

The fact that he does not specifically delineate the exemplary damage award as flowing from one or the other causes of action does not preclude this Court from excepting this debt from discharge without further fact-finding. This step is not necessary because the arbitrator based the exemplary damage award on the same behavior as the compensatory damage award, i.e., Debtor's failure to disclose material information he had a duty to disclose. Therefore, both the compensatory and exemplary damages awards \"arise from\" the debtor's fraudulent nondisclosure, satisfying the requirements of section 523(a)(2)(A).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    de la Cruz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503450\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/213/#p223\">\n    523 U.S. at 223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"168136\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/118/1212/\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Finally, the arbitrator awarded $695,588 in attorneys' fees, $81,612.39 in costs and $8,000 in reallocated arbitrator expenses\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   to Portal Investments as a prevailing party.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Doc. 28-1.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The Court finds that Debtor is collaterally estopped from relitigating the issues decided in JAMS Arbitration Case Numbers 16372 and 17751 in defending against Portal Investments' section 523(a)(2)(A) cause of action. The findings and conclusions in the JAMS Arbitration interim orders and Corrected Final Order and Award satisfy the elements of section 523(a)(2)(A) and the entire arbitration award is excepted from discharge. Portal Investments' motion for summary judgment is GRANTED. Douglas L. Johnson's debt to Portal Investments in the sum of $3,713,077.44, plus interest is excepted from discharge under section 523(a)(2)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code. Because the Court holds the entire debt is excepted from discharge under section 523(a)(2)(A), it is unnecessary to reach the merits of Portal Investments' section 523(a)(4) and 523(a)(6) causes of action.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    These proceedings included JAMS Arbitration Case Numbers 16372 and 17751.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    The arbitration order and award in this case has not been confirmed.
