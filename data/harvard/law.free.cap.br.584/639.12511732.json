HARNER, U.S. BANKRUPTCY JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The claims at issue in this adversary proceeding have spawned years of litigation between the parties. Although the claims are multifaceted, those addressed by this Memorandum Opinion focus on alleged damage to, and a failure to repair and maintain, a condominium unit owned by Dr. Paul C. Clark. Dr. Clark and his family, Ms. Rebecca Delorme and Paul Clark, Jr. (collectively with Dr. Clark, the \"Creditors\"), moved into the unit in November 2009, and moved out of the unit in March 2010. The Creditors allege that the damage to the unit remains and that the unit has not been inhabitable since March 2010. The above-captioned Debtor disputes that the unit is uninhabitable and that it has failed to repair and maintain the unit as required by applicable law and the Debtor's governing documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The parties have each filed motions for partial summary judgment on claims relating to the alleged damage to the unit. The Debtor filed its third Motion for Summary Judgment (the \"Debtor's Third Motion\") [ECF 568], and the Creditors filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, Memorandum of Law in Support, and a Line attaching Affidavits (collectively, the \"Creditors' Motion\") [ECF 595, 596 and 597].\n   <footnotemark>\n    *\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties also filed opposition papers to each motion [the \"Debtor's Opposition\" at ECF 620; the \"Creditors' Third Opposition\" at ECF 621], and the Creditors filed a Reply in Support of their Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (the \"Creditors' Reply\") [ECF 632].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Court finds that the record shows no genuine issue of material fact with respect to the following: (i) the Creditors' breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract claims, and any related damages, based on facts, allegations, or conduct arising on or prior to February 23, 2012, are barred under the doctrine of res judicata by a 2012 decision of the Baltimore City Circuit Court; (ii) the Debtor breached its duty to maintain and repair the unit, but only as to facts and conduct occurring after February 23, 2012; and (iii) the Creditors do not have sustainable claims for attorney's fees or punitive damages. The Court thus will grant summary judgment on this specific and limited relief requested in the respective motions. The Court is not granting summary judgment or any relief\n   on the remaining aspects of the motions, including whether Ms. Delorme or Paul Clark, Jr. is a third party beneficiary of the contract, or whether the Debtor has any valid defenses to the breach of contract claim or, if no comprehensive defense, the amount of the Creditors' damages. Those issues will proceed to trial as previously scheduled in this contested matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Relevant Background on Chapter 11 Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Debtor is an unincorporated condominium association, comprising \"any person, firm, corporation, trust, or other legal entity ... holding legal title to a condominium unit\" in the building located at 100 Harborview Drive (the \"Building\"). Creditors' Motion Ex. 2, Art. I (q). The Building \"is a 29-story luxury residential high rise that stands on the shore of Baltimore's Inner Harbor.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Council of Unit Owners of the 100 Harborview Drive Condominium\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268847\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/572/131/#p135\">\n    572 B.R. 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 135 (Bankr.

The Debtor seeks to, among other things, reorganize its financial affairs and resolve years of litigation with the owners of two different units in the Building through a chapter 11 plan. Dr. Clark owns one of the units involved in this litigation-penthouse 4A (\"Unit PH4A\"). The Creditors' proofs of claim, at Claim Nos. 46, 47, and 48 (the \"Claims\"), collectively assert in excess of $25 million in damages against the Debtor. The Claims are based on alleged violations of the Fair Housing Act (\"FHA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203604\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (the \"FHA Claims\"), alleged property damage to Unit PH4A, and consequential and other damages allegedly arising from those claims. On January 24, 2017, the Debtor filed objections to the Claims [ECF 264-266]. On February 23, 2017, the Creditors each filed an opposition to the Debtor's objections [ECF 316-318].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On May 18, 2017, Judge Schneider entered a Scheduling Order [ECF 393] with respect to the contested matter involving the Claims (the \"Contested Matter\"). The Court and the parties have subsequently amended that Scheduling Order several times. [ECF 474, 514, 618, 640]. The parties have conducted discovery and filed a total of four different dispositive motions in the Contested Matter. The Court held a hearing for purposes of oral argument on three of these dispositive motions, including the Debtor's Third Motion and the Creditors' Motion, on January 5, 2018 (the \"Hearing\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (The transcript of the Hearing is at ECF 643 (the \"Transcript\").)

Relevant Background of Prior Administrative and Judicial Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Creditors and the Debtor have been litigating various issues relating to Unit PH4A for several years. The Maryland Court of Special Appeals summarized \"the multiplex of administrative and trial court actions and appeals involving\" the Creditors and the Debtor in a 2015 reported decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    100 Harborview Drive Condominium v. Clark\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4346616\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/224/13/\">\n    224 Md.App. 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4346616\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/224/13/\">\n    119 A.3d 87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 93 (2015). The Court recounts only those aspects of this litigation history\n   relevant to the pending motions. A more detailed account, including litigation relating to the FHA Claims, is set forth in the Court's Memorandum Opinion addressing the FHA Claims and entered simultaneously with this decision (the \"FHA Memorandum Opinion\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On October 20, 2010, Dr. Clark filed a lawsuit against the Debtor and its professional property management company, Zalco Reality, Inc. (\"Zalco\"), in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.\n   <em>\n    Clark v. Zalco Realty, Inc., et al.\n   </em>\n   , 24-C-10-007236 (Circ. Ct. Balt. City) (the \"First State Court Action\"). In the First State Court Action, Dr. Clark asserted a fraudulent misrepresentation claim and violations of the Maryland Consumer Protection Act against the Debtor and Zalco. These claims involved Dr. Clark's purchase of Unit PH4A in October 2009 and the resale disclosure certificate issued by the Debtor and Zalco in connection with that transaction. The Circuit Court granted summary judgment in favor of the Debtor and Zalco in the First State Court Action, which decision was subsequently affirmed by the Maryland Court of Special Appeals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    100 Harborview Drive\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4346616\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/224/13/\">\n    119 A.3d at 95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (describing result of this particular action).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On January 14, 2013, Dr. Clark filed a lawsuit in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City under the Maryland Condominium Act, seeking the production of certain documents from the Debtor and monetary damages.\n   <em>\n    Clark v. 100 Harborview Drive Council of Unit Owners, et al.\n   </em>\n   , 24-C-13-000322 (Circ. Ct. Balt. City) (the \"Second State Court Action\"). In the Second State Court Action, the Circuit Court held that the Debtor was not required to produce written legal advice provided to the Debtor or those documents already produced concerning the Debtor's financial affairs, but that it was required to produce certain legal invoices.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    100 Harborview Drive Council of Unit Owners v.

App. 2015) (describing the Circuit Court's decision and affirming in part, and vacating in part, that decision).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On May 8, 2013, Dr. Clark filed a lawsuit against the Debtor in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, alleging that the common elements of the condominium were defective, causing mold and water infiltration into Unit PH4A.\n   <em>\n    Clark v. 100 Harborview Drive Council of Unit Owners\n   </em>\n   , 24-C-13-002770 (Circ. Ct. Balt. City) (the \"Third State Court Action\"). In the Third State Court Action, Dr. Clark asserted various causes of action, including breach of contract, negligence, and breach of fiduciary duty. The Third State Court Action is pending in the Circuit Court, but is stayed as a result of the Debtor's chapter 11 case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On March 24, 2014, Dr. Clark filed a lawsuit against the Debtor in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, seeking a temporary restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief that would allow Dr. Clark to send his lawyers to the Debtor's Board and committee meetings.\n   <em>\n    Clark v. 100 Harborview Drive Council of Unit Owners\n   </em>\n   , 24-C-14-001537 (Circ. Ct. Balt. City) (the \"Fourth State Court Action\"). On October 31, 2014, the Circuit Court awarded summary judgment to the Debtor, ruling that the Debtor's policy resolution barring Dr. Clark's lawyers from the Debtor's meetings \"is lawful and proper.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Debtor's Second Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (\"Debtor's Second Motion\") [ECF 545] Ex. I. Additionally, in the Fourth State Court Action, the Debtor counterclaimed for injunctive relief, seeking access to Unit PH4A to perform necessary maintenance and repairs on common elements affecting water infiltration into the condominium building and its units.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Debtor's Second Motion Exs.

Just prior to purchasing their unit, the Creditors noted the presence of a small leak in the ceiling of the unit, and were told by Ms. Giselle Rivera, the general manager, that this item would be fixed shortly. On December 18, 2009, Ms. Delorme provided a copy of her front door key for Unit PH4A to management.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Creditors' Motion Ex. 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Creditors retained MMTS Environmental, which issued a report concerning water leakage in Unit PH4A on March 30, 2010. The Creditors thereafter moved from Unit PH4A on March 30, 2010, and moved back into Unit 433 at Pierside, which they took off the market at that time. The Creditors have resided in Unit 433 at Pierside, which is an approximately 1000 square foot unit, while Unit PH4A is approximately 4000 square feet, since March 30, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On June 28, 2010, the Baltimore City Health Department issued a Citation for mold in Unit PH4A against the Debtor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Creditors' Motion Ex. 11. As part of the Debtor's efforts to address issues in the unit, one of the rooms in the unit was actually shelled with the ceilings, and wall removed, leaving bare concrete and a view of the roof above without insulation to insulate heating and cooling. On May 19, 2011, the Debtor issued an Invitation to Bid on Roof Replacement of the building located at 100 Harborview Drive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Creditors' Motion Ex. 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Mr. Bruce Jacobs, M.I.H, C.I.H., an environmental hygienist, issued reports relating to Unit PH4A on December 14, 2011, and December 21, 2011.

The Debtor, on the other hand, argues that it has fulfilled all of its duties, that it addressed each problem identified with Unit PH4A as each issue arose, and that, to the extent delay occurred, the Creditors' conduct caused the delay and any resulting damage. The Court has reviewed all of the pleadings, including all of the exhibits thereto containing admissible evidence,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   and reaches the following conclusions concerning the Debtor's Third Motion and the Creditors' Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Capacity of a Minor to File a Proof of Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In the Debtor's Third Motion, the Debtor asserts that the Creditors' minor child does not have the capacity to file a proof of claim. A review of the proof of claim at claim no. 48 reveals that the child is identified as the \"debtor\" and Dr. Clark is identified as the \"creditor.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The supporting documentation for the proof of claim identifies only the child, as a minor. The Creditors' lawyer signed the proof of claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Civil Rule 17, made applicable to the Contested Matter by Bankruptcy Rules 9014 and 7017, provides that \"the law of the individual's domicile\" (if not acting in a representative capacity) or \"the law of the state where the court is located\" (if acting in a representative capacity) determines the capacity of an individual to sue or be sued. Fed. R. Civ. P. 17(b)(3). Maryland law thus applies regardless of whether the minor is attempting to act in\n   his own right or whether an individual is acting on his behalf. Civil Rule 17 further states that a minor who does not have a court appointed representative \"may sue by a next friend or by a guardian ad litem.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 17(c)(2). Maryland law generally invokes the concept of \" 'next friend' or 'prochein ami,' which is one who brings suit on behalf of a minor ... because the minor ... lacks capacity to sue in his or her own right.\"\n   <em>\n    Fox v.

The Debtor's own evidence on this issue, however, creates a genuine issue of material fact. For example, as noted above, the proof of claim form for claim no. 48 is confusing in that it does not identify the child as the creditor, but rather, identifies Dr. Clark as the creditor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   That reference to Dr. Clark is not as next friend of the child, but the parent is identified on the form.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The child's answers to Interrogatories attached as an exhibit to the Debtor's Third Motion also are signed by Dr. Clark, \"as parent and natural guardian of\" the child.

Standing to Bring Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Debtor argues that neither Ms. Delorme nor Paul Clark, Jr. have standing to sue because they are not the \"real party in interest\" with respect to the alleged damage to Unit PH4A. The deed for Unit PH4A is in the name of Dr. Clark, and, as such, Dr. Clark is considered the \"owner\" of the unit under the Debtor's governing documents. Creditors' Motion Exs. 1; 2 at 6.

Transcript at 150. The language specifically states that the bylaws \"inure[ ] to the benefit of\" the unit owners. Creditors' Motion Ex. 3, at \u00a7 2, Art. I. It likewise only extends the burdens of the contract to third parties, providing that it is \"binding\" on the unit owners and others.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%20163231\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This particular language identifies a clear distinction between the parties receiving the benefits and those receiving the burdens of the contract. Nevertheless, the Creditors argue that the parties intended the bylaws to not only bind, but also to apply in all respects to Ms. Delorme and Paul Clark, Jr. In this regard, Article XIII of the bylaws does suggest some benefit for \"residents,\" which appears to include parties other than the unit owners. For example, section 20 of Article XIII prohibits various conduct \"if it will disturb or annoy any residents of the building in which the unit is located or in any other building.\" Creditors' Motion Ex. 3, at \u00a7 20, Art. XIII. Given that a court must look to the contract and surrounding circumstances in making a third-party beneficiary designation, and given the potentially conflicting language in the bylaws, the Court finds that a genuine issue of material fact exists on this issue and will, accordingly, deny this aspect of the Debtor's Third Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Res Judicata of Decision in First State Court Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   As described in Part II, Dr. Clark filed the First State Court Action against the Debtor in October 2010. That lawsuit alleged that the Debtor engaged in fraudulent misrepresentations and violations of the Maryland Consumer Protection Act. Dr. Clark filed a second amended complaint in the First State Court Action in January 2012 (the \"Second Amended Complaint\"), and the Baltimore City Circuit Court entered summary judgment in favor of the Debtor on all counts on February 23, 2012 (the \"First State Court Decision\").

FF.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Debtor argues that the First State Court Decision and the doctrine of res judicata (claim preclusion) bar the Creditors' attempt to relitigate claims for damages to Unit PH4A. \"Under Maryland law, the elements of res judicata, or claim preclusion, are: (1) that the parties in the present litigation are the same or in privity with the parties to the earlier dispute; (2) that the claim presented in the current action is identical to the one determined in the prior adjudication; and, (3) that there has been a final judgment on the merits. ... If a final judgment exists as to a controversy between parties, those parties and their privies are barred from relitigating any claim upon which the judgment is based.\"\n   <em>\n    Anne Arundel Cty.

To determine whether a claim is identical to that previously litigated, Maryland follows the \"transactional approach.\" Under that approach, \"if the two claims or theories are based upon the same set of facts and one would expect them to be tried together\n   ordinarily, then a party must bring them simultaneously. ...

The transactional test is not, under Maryland case law, limited to a single transaction-e.g., the Creditors' purchase of the unit. Rather, it is focused on the facts alleged in the prior litigation and whether the plaintiff could have also brought additional claims based on the facts, circumstances, forum, and similar considerations relevant at that time. As noted above, the doctrine of claim preclusion is intended to prevent piecemeal legal theories and serial litigation.\n   <em>\n    Norville\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"976411\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/390/93/\">\n    887 A.2d at 1038\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Legal theories may not be divided and presented in piecemeal fashion in order to advance them in separate actions.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Here, the evidence shows that the Creditors were well aware of all of the facts relating to their claims for breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract for the alleged damage to, and the Debtor's alleged failure to repair and maintain, Unit PH4A. The plain language of the Second Amended Complaint clearly sets this out. Moreover, the Creditors could have brought the breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract claims in the state court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Creditors did not offer evidence to refute these facts, and they have not established a genuine issue of material fact on this basic concept.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Creditors did argue and presented evidence that their claims for breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract also relate to new facts and circumstances that were not in existence at the time of the First State Court Action and, thus, could not have formed the basis of any claims or causes of action.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Transcript at 167. Likewise, the Debtor argued that many of the issues with Unit PH4A are \"new\" and not just a continuation of one continuous leak. Transcript at 154-156. Accordingly, the Court will grant the Debtor's request for summary judgment based on the First State Court Action solely with respect to breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract claims, and any related damages, that could have been brought based on the facts and allegations set forth in the Second Amended Complaint and addressed by the First State Court Decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

The Debtor has, however, offered evidence and arguments supporting potential defenses to that alleged breach of duty (including, for example, that the Debtor did not have access to complete necessary repairs or\n   maintenance), as well as the amount of damages, if any. Accordingly, nothing in this Memorandum Opinion or the related Order precludes the Debtor from presenting evidence and arguments at trial concerning (i) any and all defenses the Debtor has to a breach of contract claim based on facts arising after the First State Court Decision; and (ii) the amount of damages, if any, not covered by a valid defense, including evidence and arguments on mitigation.

The Court grants summary judgment as requested by the Debtor's Third Motion with respect to (i) the Creditors' breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract claims, and any related damages, based on facts, allegations, or conduct arising on or prior to February 23, 2012; and (ii) the Creditors' request for attorney's fees and punitive damages. The Court grants summary judgment as requested by the Creditors' Motion with respect to the Debtor's breach of its duty to maintain and repair Unit PH4A, solely with respect to facts and conduct occurring after February 23, 2012. The Court is not granting summary judgment or any relief on the remaining aspects of these motions, including whether Ms. Delorme or Paul Clark, Jr. is a third party beneficiary of the contract, or whether the Debtor has any valid defenses to the breach of contract claim or, if no comprehensive defense, the amount of the Creditors' damages. Those issues will proceed to trial as previously scheduled in this contested matter. The Court will enter a separate Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"*\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    All references to pages in the \"Debtor's Second Motion,\" the \"Debtor's Third Motion,\" or the \"Creditors' Motion\" refer to the corresponding pages in the Memorandum in Support of that particular motion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    By an Order [ECF 502] dated October 26, 2017 (the \"October 2017 Order\"), the Court denied the Debtor's first dispositive motion \"without prejudice to the parties filing dispositive motions with respect to the FHA Claims in this contested matter on grounds other than claim and issue preclusion as set forth in the Motion.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    The Creditors appealed this decision to the Maryland Court of Special Appeals, which heard oral argument, but had not issued a ruling at the time that the Debtor filed this chapter 11 case.
