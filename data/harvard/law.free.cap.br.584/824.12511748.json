[Doc. 32 at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 6.] When he filed his bankruptcy case, Debtor owed the IRS a total of $226,089.33 for past-due income tax liabilities,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   for which the IRS had recorded Notices of Federal Tax Lien with the Knox County Register of Deeds on October 24, 2014 (for tax years 2004, 2007-08, and 2010-11), and August 21, 2015 (for tax years 2012-14).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 3-4; Doc. 17, Ex.

[Doc. 32 at \u00b6\u00b6 7-11, 13.] Thus, Debtor's monthly income (including the full amount of the MBL disability pension benefits) totals at least $11,769.00,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and his monthly expenses total approximately $9,643.00.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 20-21.] In addition to the fifteen-year-old, who attends a local high school, Debtor also has an eighteen-year-old son who is a student at the University of Tennessee. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10.] Debtor is entitled to receive the MLB disability pension benefits until his death or as long as his mental illness continues. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On August 5, 2016, the IRS issued a Notice of Levy against Debtor's MLB disability pension (\"2016 Levy\"), reflecting a total amount due of $192,040.10.

[Doc. 32 at \u00b6 17.] The IRS also agreed to reduce the levy by $703.00 monthly for estimated tax payments. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] The resulting levy payment from the MLB Pension Fund to the IRS was $3,877.00 monthly, with the remaining $4,523.00 going to Debtor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   [\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ] Notwithstanding the allowances, Debtor has not paid off the guardian ad litem fees, nor has he made estimated tax payments to the IRS for the 2017 tax year, for which he likely will owe taxes on annual income of approximately $140,000.00.

[\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 31-32.] Because the IRS did not consider Debtor's inability\n   to fund his son's college tuition as a justifiable hardship and Debtor appears to have sufficient income for tuition payments notwithstanding the 2016 Levy, the hardship request was denied. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33.] Nevertheless, the October 1, 2017 payment to the IRS under the 2016 Levy was subject to a \"stop payment\" by the MLB Pension Fund because Debtor had filed for bankruptcy protection on September 18, 2017. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34; Doc. 17, Ex. C.] The IRS allowed Debtor to have the full October payment; however, it did not agree to release the 2016 Levy and filed this Motion for Stay Relief in order to resolve the matter and receive future payments under the 2016 Levy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Doc. 32 at \u00b6 35; Doc. 17, Ex.

Notwithstanding that Debtor has monthly income of approximately $11,769.00, he has repeatedly failed to pay his taxes, including current estimated tax payments, and he has not paid guardian ad litem fees associated with his divorce, although the IRS reduced the levy amount for those express purposes. [Doc. 32 at \u00b6\u00b6 17-20, 36-37.] Accordingly, the Court finds that there is no real dispute that the IRS is entitled to stay relief for cause, including lack of adequate protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Notwithstanding his acquiescence that the IRS is entitled to stay relief to initiate a new levy against Debtor's MLB pension benefits, Debtor opposes the relief requested by the IRS in its Motion for Stay Relief for \"an order\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   modifying and annulling the automatic stay to permit the IRS to retain any funds it accesses by levy and to direct the MLBP Pension Fund to pay the [2016 L]evy as required by law\" [Doc. 17 at 4]. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 39 at 1.] Specifically, Debtor disagrees that the IRS \"is entitled to any levy payments due subsequent to the filing of the bankruptcy proceeding and prior to the IRS taking proper steps to cause the issuance of a new levy,\" [\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1], and argues that the 2016 Levy cannot continue against his MLB pension benefits because it is not a continuing levy for \"salary or wages\" as defined by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20301.6331-1\">\n    26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.6331-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) [\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4] and because the IRS's failure to release the 2016 Levy when Debtor filed for bankruptcy constitutes a violation of the automatic stay [\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In response, the IRS argues that Debtor's arguments lack merit because it is entitled to stay relief (as conceded by Debtor), the 2016 Levy is a continuing levy against the MLB disability pension benefits [Doc. 45 at 2-4], and that even if its failure to release the 2016 Levy did violate the automatic stay, the IRS is entitled to retroactive relief from the stay such that no violation occurred [\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-7].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Court, having analyzed both sides' arguments, finds that the 2016 Levy is a continuing levy against the MLB disability pension benefits and that the IRS is entitled to retroactive stay relief and annulment of the stay such that, to the extent\n   that any violation of the stay might have occurred, it is nullified.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Additionally, even though it was not stipulated, the Court can easily deduce that, because the 2016 Levy was issued in August 2016 and the parties are arguing over payments that were to be made to the IRS after October 1, 2017, the IRS, in fact, was receiving monthly payments from the MLB Pension Fund between August 2016 and October 2017 pursuant to the 2016\n   Levy. Thus, by its very nature, the 2016 Levy was continuing in nature and not, as Debtor argued in his brief, a one-time occurrence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    B.
