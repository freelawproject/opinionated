World Marketing Chicago, LLC, World Marketing Dallas, LLC, and World Marketing Atlanta, LLC (collectively, the \"\n   <em>\n    Debtors\n   </em>\n   \"), were subjected to a WARN Act class claim, as described by this court in its previous decision in this case,\n   <em>\n    In re World Mktg.

Ill. 2017) (Barnes, J.) (the \"\n   <em>\n    WARN Opinion\n   </em>\n   \").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   As set forth in the WARN Opinion, the Trustee asserted only one possible defense to the WARN claim and attempted to reserve other defenses to be asserted at a later time.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272516\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/564/587/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 593 n.4. This court found that the Trustee, in doing so, waived the right to propound any further defenses, as any further potential defenses were neither asserted nor was the reservation of these defenses sought by leave of the court.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272516\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/564/587/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On September 27, 2017, the Trustee filed the Adversary against the movants, the Kraft Parties, and several other entities [Adv. Dkt. No. 1]. The sixteen-count\n   complaint alleges various torts and liability claims against the Kraft Parties and the other entities. In response, the Kraft Parties sought to countersue the Trustee in the Adversary for breach of fiduciary duty and breach of trust, based on the Trustee's defense of the WARN claim. Anticipating the application of the so-called \"\n   <em>\n    Barton\n   </em>\n   doctrine,\" discussed below, the Kraft Parties brought the Motion under consideration for leave to sue the Trustee, to which the Trustee objected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The matter has been fully briefed and subsequently argued at the Hearing and has been taken under advisement. Except as otherwise expressly stated herein, this Memorandum Decision resolves all the matters under advisement in relation to the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As noted above, the central question before the court is that of the\n   <em>\n    Barton\n   </em>\n   doctrine and its application to the matter at bar. The Kraft Parties submit two principal arguments as to why, as a threshold matter, the\n   <em>\n    Barton\n   </em>\n   doctrine does not apply to the claims the movants seek to file. First, the Kraft Parties assert that the\n   <em>\n    Barton\n   </em>\n   doctrine is inapplicable when the party seeks to file a claim against a trustee in an adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy court which appointed the trustee. Second, the movants argue that the\n   <em>\n    Barton\n   </em>\n   doctrine does not apply to counterclaims against a trustee when the trustee begins the suit, even if the suit is filed in a non-appointing forum. This case also raises the issue as to whether the\n   <em>\n    Barton\n   </em>\n   doctrine extends just to statutory trustees or covers trustees appointed pursuant to a bankruptcy plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As will be shown below, the Motion may be resolved by answering the first question. As a result, the court need not examine the latter two. In order to answer the first question, the court must consider the nature of the\n   <em>\n    Barton\n   </em>\n   doctrine itself, its relation to jurisdiction and immunity and its application to matters brought before the bankruptcy court itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The\n    <em>\n     Barton\n    </em>\n    Doctrine\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Barton\n   </em>\n   doctrine has at its source the Supreme Court case of\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

The court will not allow him to be sued touching the property in his charge, nor for any malfeasance as to the parties, or others, without its consent; nor will it permit his possession to be disturbed by force, nor violence to be offered to his person while in the discharge of his official duties.

The\n   <em>\n    Barton\n   </em>\n   doctrine gives an appointing court the authority to govern jurisdiction over suits.\n   <em>\n    Barton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3494472\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/104/126/\">\n    104 U.S. at 136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is not a form of immunity in and of itself.\n   <em>\n    J &amp; S Props.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4051283\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/545/91/#p98\">\n    545 B.R. at 98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Simply stated, the\n   <em>\n    Barton\n   </em>\n   doctrine does not shield trustees from lawsuits. Rather, the doctrine requires the bankruptcy court to determine\n   <em>\n    where\n   </em>\n   the suit may be brought, not\n   <em>\n    whether\n   </em>\n   the trustee may be sued.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Jurisdiction is a gating question which requires a court to make a determination whether the suit is to proceed or whether jurisdiction should be withheld. Immunity, on the other hand, is an affirmative defense.\n   <em>\n    Capra v. Cook Cnty. Bd. of Review\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3715022\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/733/705/#p711\">\n    733 F.3d 705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 711 (7th Cir. 2013) (describing immunities as being \"personal defenses\"). The merits of affirmative defenses are determined on a motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    Venters v. City of Delphi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12010774\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/123/956/#p968\">\n    123 F.3d 956\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 968 (7th Cir. 1997). While the existence of an immunity defense might play into a bankruptcy court's weighing of a matter under the\n   <em>\n    Barton\n   </em>\n   doctrine,\n   <em>\n    see., e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Beck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8938313,8936209\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/421/963/\">\n    421 F.3d at 976\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as the trial court, the bankruptcy court itself can make the immunity determinations at the appropriate stage of litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   When the bankruptcy court is the trial court, it is neither necessary nor appropriate to consider the immunity defense at any time other than what is ordinarily appropriate. The court need not make any ruling on such a defense now. That will be considered in due course as the matter proceeds, if such a defense is raised at the proper procedural juncture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Because the\n   <em>\n    Barton\n   </em>\n   doctrine is inapplicable to matters tried in the bankruptcy court itself, the remaining arguments of the Kraft Parties need not be reached here. In turn, the court need not reach the\n   Trustee's immunity claims at this point. Because the bankruptcy court will be the trial court in this matter, it can consider that defense when and if raised. As a result, the Motion serves no purpose. As noted above and for the foregoing reasons, the Motion will therefore be denied as unnecessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   A separate judgment order to that effect will be issued concurrent with this Memorandum Decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    ORDER\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   This matter comes before the court on the Motion for Leave to File Counterclaims Against Trustee for Breach of Fiduciary Duty and Breach of Trust [Dkt.
