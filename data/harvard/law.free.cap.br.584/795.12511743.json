Chris Eden (\"Plaintiff\") filed\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff's Opposition to Debtor's Motion to Dismiss\n   </em>\n   on August 28, 2017 (the \"Response\"). (Docket No. 6). Plaintiff filed a complaint (Docket No. 1) (the \"Complaint\"), objecting to Defendant's discharge and the dischargeability of \"certain debts\" owed to Plaintiff. The Complaint has six counts: (I) removing or concealing property which otherwise would have been available to pay debts, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A) and (B)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; (II) failure to keep or preserve records pursuant to \u00a7 727(a)(3) ; (III) making false oaths pursuant to \u00a7 727(a)(4) ; (IV) failure to explain loss of assets to pay debts pursuant to \u00a7 727(a)(5) ; (V) obtaining money, renewal and extensions of credit by false pretenses, false representations and/or by actual fraud pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) or (B); and (VI) engaging in fraudulent transfers, fraudulent conveyances and false representations which inflicted willful and malicious injury pursuant to \u00a7 523(a)(6). Complaint at *3-7. Defendant seeks dismissal for insufficient service of process pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. (\"F.R.C.P.\") 12(b)(5). Motion at *2 \u00b6 5-6. Defendant also seeks dismissal of each of the six claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to Fed. R. Bank. P. (\"F.R.B.P.\") 7012(b) and F.R.C.P. 12(b)(6). Motion at *2-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Briefly, this Court concludes that although Plaintiff did not properly serve Defendant, Plaintiff is permitted the opportunity to re-serve Defendant. Therefore, the Motion to Dismiss on the grounds of insufficient service of process is denied. This Court also concludes that while Plaintiff has met the pleading burden for Counts II and III, Plaintiff has failed to meet the pleading burden for Counts I, IV, V, and VI. The Court therefore dismisses without prejudice Counts I, IV, V, and VI pursuant to F.R.C.P. 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff and Defendant are former spouses and former business partners. Complaint at *2 \u00b6 6. Plaintiff alleges that he and the Defendant each hold a 50% interest in K &amp; M Hardware, Inc. and Eden Oak Properties, LLC, (collectively, the \"Shared Entities\") and he is the sole member of Tarene Farms, LLC. Complaint at *2 \u00b6 7. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant breached her fiduciary duties with regard to the Shared Entities. Complaint at *2 \u00b6 6. Plaintiff filed a state court action against Defendant for Accounting, Breach of Fiduciary Duty, and Fraud in Cherokee County Superior Court. Complaint at *2 \u00b6 7. Plaintiff claims that Defendant was \"skimming hundreds of thousands of dollars off of K &amp; M Hardware ....\" Complaint at *2 \u00b6 8. Plaintiff also contends that Defendant's Amended Schedules falsely show that Defendant owns 100% of K &amp; M Hardware, despite Defendant's alleged admission to the contrary at the \u00a7 341 meeting of creditors, and that Defendant destroyed documents stating that Plaintiff owns 50% of Eden Oak Properties. Complaint at *2-3 \u00b6 11-12. Defendant denies all of these allegations. Defendant's Answer (Docket No. 5),\n   <em>\n    passim\n   </em>\n   . Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to F.R.C.P. 12(b)(5) and (6), applicable in this adversary proceeding through F.R.B.P. 7012. Motion at *1. First, this Order will address the Motion to Dismiss for insufficient service of process under F.R.C.P. 12(b)(5). It will then address which of Plaintiff's claims satisfy their respective pleading requirements and state a claim for which relief can be granted under F.R.C.P. 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Insufficient Service of Process\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant first moved for dismissal for insufficient service of process, pursuant to F.R.B.P. 7004 and 7012(b)(5), because Plaintiff failed to serve both Defendant and Defendant's counsel. Motion at *2. There is no Certificate of Service attached to the Complaint or filed on the Docket.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket (\n   <em>\n    passim\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff asserts in the Response that \"Debtor was mailed a copy of the Complaint and co-counsel of record, as noted in Debtor's lead bankruptcy case, was noticed by Plaintiff of the attempt to commence this action.\" Response at *3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff also asserts that he has cured any deficiency in service by \"serving Defendant and her counsel concurrently\" with the filing of the Response. Response at *3.

F.R.B.P. 7004(g), however, requires that \"[i]f the debtor is represented by an attorney, whenever service is made upon the debtor under this Rule, service shall also be made upon the debtor's attorney by any means authorized under [F.R.C.P.] 5(b).\" FED.

In\n   <em>\n    Hechinger\n   </em>\n   , the Plaintiff failed to serve a corporate defendant in accordance with F.R.B.P. 7004(b)(3) because the person to whom he mailed the summons and complaint no longer worked for the defendant.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9253436\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/308/683/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9253436\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/308/683/\">\n    at 686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
