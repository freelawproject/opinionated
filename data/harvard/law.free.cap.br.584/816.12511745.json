Ritz\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   controls this issue but, of course, disagree on how. In\n   <em>\n    Husky\n   </em>\n   , a company named Chrysalis owed Husky $164,000 for parts sold by Husky to Chrysalis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   While this debt was incurred, an individual named Ritz, who was a director and 30% owner of Chrysalis, drained money from Chrysalis and transferred it to other companies in which Ritz had an interest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Husky sued Ritz, seeking to hold him personally liable for the debt that Chrysalis owed Husky.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   This lawsuit was based on a Texas statute that allows creditors to impose personal liability on individuals for corporate debts where the individual has engaged in actual or constructive fraud.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Fifth Circuit held that Ritz did not commit \"actual fraud,\" within the meaning of section 523(a)(2)(A), when he took Chrysalis's money because a false representation is required for a debt to be deemed nondischargeable under section 523(a)(2)(A).\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because this holding disposed of the claim, the Fifth Circuit did not reach the issue of whether the transfers were sufficient to trigger personal liability under the Texas statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Supreme Court reversed, holding that fraudulent transfer schemes like those engaged in by Ritz were encompassed within the term \"actual fraud\" under section 523(a)(2)(A).\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   In a lone dissent, Justice Thomas argued that because the statute specified that the debt could be excepted from discharge only \"to the extent obtained by\" actual fraud, the fraud\n   must be present \"at the inception\" of the credit transaction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the dissent's view, in order for the debt to Husky to be nondischargeable, the fraud had to be a part of the transaction in which Husky supplied the parts to Chrysalis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the debt was incurred in the Chrysalis-Husky trade transactions that were unrelated to the transfers of Chrysalis cash to the Ritz companies, according to the dissent, the debt was not \"obtained by\" the fraud, as required by the statute, and so was not excepted from the discharge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The majority dismissed the \"at the inception of\" argument as imposing a reliance element that is not in the statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response to the \"obtained by\" argument, the majority said this:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   It is of course true that the transferor does not \"obtai[n]\" debts in a fraudulent conveyance. But the recipient of the transfer-who, with the requisite intent, also commits fraud-can \"obtai[n]\" assets \"by\" his or her participation in the fraud. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    McClellan v. Cantrell,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11204108,11197903\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/217/890/\">\n    217 F.3d 890\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (C.A.7 2000) ; see also\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 1587-1588. If that recipient later files for bankruptcy, any debts \"traceable to\" the fraudulent conveyance, see\n   <em>\n    Field [v. Mans],\n   </em>\n   516 U.S., [59] at 61,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6476672,323761\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/116/437/\">\n    116 S.Ct. 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"323761\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/516/59/\">\n    133 L.Ed.2d 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995) ] ;\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 1591, will be nondischargable under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A).\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Thus, under\n   <em>\n    Husky v. Ritz\n   </em>\n   the debt must be at least \"traceable to\" the fraudulent transfer. Under the facts of\n   <em>\n    Husky\n   </em>\n   , this test is met. While the trade debt owed by Chrysalis to Husky largely predated and was otherwise not related to the fraudulent transfers, Ritz became personally liable to Husky for the debt under Texas law by causing the transfers; and so, in that sense, the debt was \"obtained by,\" and certainly \"traceable to\" the transfers. Indeed, that is exactly what the bankruptcy court found on remand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Here, as in\n   <em>\n    Husky\n   </em>\n   , the Ericksons allegedly \"obtained\" property through a fraudulent transfer scheme.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the complaint says they \"(a) liquidated their nonexempt property; and (b) made unwarranted and gratuitous transfers from their wholly controlled corporations for the purpose of ... rendering them insolvent.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   But, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Husky\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   there is no allegation in the complaint or in Ms. Prado's response to the summary judgment motion, by affidavit or otherwise, that there is any connection between the transfers mentioned in the complaint and the pre-existing debt owed by the Ericksons to Ms. Prado.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, the Ericksons incurred\n   their debt on the T &amp; V note through a guarantee when T &amp; V bought the Optimum assets.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, even if the assets allegedly transferred came from T &amp; V, those transfers could have nothing to do with the debt that already existed. Since there is no connection between the debt and the transfers, the debt cannot be excepted from the discharge on this basis, and the summary judgment motion is granted to this extent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The motion for summary judgment will be granted, in part and denied in part, by separate order in accordance with this memorandum opinion and the oral ruling made contemporaneously with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(2)(A).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    --- U.S. ----,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4259915\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1581/#p1587\">\n     136 S.Ct. 1581\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1587-88,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=194%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20655\">\n     194 L.Ed.2d 655\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2016).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    Compl. 1, ECF No. 1.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=194%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20655\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=194%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20655\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    Compl. 2, ECF No. 1.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=194%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20655\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    ; Mot.
