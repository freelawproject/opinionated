Defendants filed the Motion to Dismiss, arguing that the facts pleaded in the Complaint show that the Defendants revoked the acceleration of the Loan prior to the expiration of the limitations period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the reasons set forth below in this, the Motion to Dismiss is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     JURISDICTION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This Court has jurisdiction over this core proceeding pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), 157(a) and 157(b)(2)(B). This decision constitutes the Court's findings of fact and conclusions of law to the extent required by Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7052.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff and her husband, David Simmons, are the owners of the real property located at 447 Saratoga Avenue, Brooklyn, New York 11233 (the \"Property\"). (Pl.'s Am. Compl. \u00b6 10-11, ECF No. 2). Plaintiff and her husband executed a note (the \"Note\") in favor of M.L. Moskowitz &amp; Co. Inc. d/b/a Equity Now (\"MLM\") for the principal amount of $332,500 (the \"Loan\"), on June 22, 2005, which was secured by a mortgage on the Property granted in favor of Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. as MLM's nominee, also dated June 22, 2005 and duly recorded on July 7, 2005 (the \"First Mortgage\"). (Pl.'s Am. Compl. \u00b6 12, ECF No. 2). The Note was assigned to BONY CEWALT, on June 18, 2007, which assignment was duly recorded on December 11, 2007. (Pl.'s Am. Compl. \u00b6 13, ECF No. 2). Bayview services the Note and the First Mortgage on behalf of BONY CEWALT. (Pl.'s Am. Compl. \u00b6 14, ECF No. 2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Upon the Plaintiff's default on the Loan, BONY CEWALT commenced an action to foreclose the First Mortgage in the Supreme Court of New York, County of Kings, Index No. 004036/2010 on February 17, 2010 (the \"Foreclosure Action\"). (Pl.'s Am. Compl. \u00b6 23, ECF No. 2). The parties engaged in foreclosure settlement conferences as directed by the state court between July, 2010 and September 2013, after which there was no further activity in the Foreclosure Action. (Pl.'s Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 24-25, ECF No. 2). Bayview prepared and mailed a letter, dated February 10, 2016, notifying the Plaintiff that the Loan had been de-accelerated and \"re-instituted\" as an installment loan (the \"De-Acceleration Letter\"). (Pl.'s Am. Compl. \u00b6 26,\n   ECF No. 2) (Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 13, Ex. 3). The Foreclosure Action was discontinued on July 27, 2016 (Pl.'s Am. Compl. \u00b6 28, ECF No. 2), and in August, 2016, the attorneys of BONY CEWALT mailed a \"Stipulation of Discontinuance\" and \"Stipulation Canceling Notice of Pendency\" dated August 17, 2016 to Plaintiff's attorney. (Pl.'s Am. Compl. \u00b6 27, ECF No. 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code on April 5, 2017, which lists BONY CEWALT as a secured creditor with a claim of $462,000. (Case No. 17-41643-CEC, ECF. No. 1.) BONY CEWALT filed a proof of claim in the amount of $561,940.84 on July 7, 2017. (Case No. 17-41643-CEC, Claim No. 7-1.) The Plaintiff thereafter commenced this adversary proceeding seeking (1) a judgment pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20C.P.L.R.%20%C2%A7%20213\">\n    N.Y.

(Pl.'s Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 45-67, ECF No. 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that the First Mortgage is unenforceable because the Defendants failed to perform an affirmative and unambiguous act which constituted a revocation of the acceleration of the Loan prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations period on February 17, 2016, because the Defendants did not seek to discontinue the Foreclosure Action until July, 2016, after the period had expired. (Pl.'s Opp'n to Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss, at 8-9, ECF No. 16). They further assert that sending the De-Acceleration Letter, while the Foreclosure Action was still pending in state court, was not an affirmative act sufficient to revoke the acceleration of the Loan. (Pl.'s Opp'n to Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss, at 9, ECF No. 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Defendants take the position that the De-Acceleration Letter constituted an affirmative act which revoked the acceleration of the Loan before the statute of limitation period expired.

Within approximately one month of discontinuing the action, the lender's servicer sent an acceleration letter to the borrower. The assignee of the loan then commenced a second foreclosure action in May, 2016. In response to this second action, the borrower commenced an action to quiet title against the assignees on the basis that the statute of limitations had run, because the original lender did not properly revoke the acceleration. In its decision to deny the assignees' motion to dismiss, the court agreed with the plaintiff-borrower's contention that the defendants \"did not affirmatively revoke their election to accelerate the entire debt\", finding that intent to revoke the acceleration was not unambiguously expressed because \"the defendants with one hand indicated their intent to [de-accelerate the debt by discontinuing the prior action]; and with the other hand indicated the opposite, that the debt remained accelerated.\" Tr. of Decision at 12,\n   <em>\n    Caneva v.

C.P.L.R. \u00a7 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) is unavailable to the Defendants because, according the Plaintiff, that provision is unavailable to corporations. (Pl.'s Am. Compl.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 55-59, ECF No. 2). This provision permits a plaintiff to reinstate and pursue a dismissed action within six months of its dismissal/termination, if the prior action was terminated in any manner\n   <em>\n    other than\n   </em>\n   , inter alia, voluntary discontinuance. The Defendants do not rely upon this tolling provision. Plaintiff's second cause of action, seeking a declaratory judgment that this provision is inapplicable, therefore fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff's Third Cause of Action: Disallowance of Defendant's claim under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20502\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Under section 502(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code, a claim against the bankruptcy estate will not be allowed if it would not be enforceable against the debtor or the debtor's property under applicable law. Plaintiff seeks the disallowance of the Defendants' claim in this bankruptcy case on the grounds that the Defendants' mortgage lien is unenforceable, and in support of this, re-states the allegations upon which the first cause of action is based. Because the third cause of action is tied to, and depends on the success of the first cause of action, which has been dismissed, it must also be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the Motion to Dismiss is granted with respect to the first, second and third causes of action. A separate order will be issued.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    All references to \"ECF No.\" are to documents, identified by docket entry number, filed in Adversary Proceeding No. 17-01098-CEC, unless otherwise indicated.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    The Property is encumbered by two additional mortgage liens, recorded after the First Mortgage, which are currently held by The Bank of New York Mellon fka The Bank of New York as Successor to JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. as Trustee for the Certificateholders of CWHEQ Revolving Home Equity Loan Trust, Series 2006-H securing the principal amount of $50,000 (the \"Second Mortgage\") (Pl.'s Am.
