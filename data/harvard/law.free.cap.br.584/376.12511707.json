BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case arises out of a fee dispute between a law firm and its former client.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   SFK represented Appellee Fusion Homes, LLC (\"Fusion\") in a state court proceeding in which Fusion attempted to foreclose on two properties located in Hollywood, Florida, to which it owned the notes and mortgages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SFK Br., \u00b6\u00b6 2-3, 5. While the foreclosure case was pending, the defendant in the state court proceeding, Daniel Alessi, filed a bankruptcy petition.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8. SFK participated in Mr. Alessi's bankruptcy proceeding on behalf of Fusion, contesting and filing motions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 8-9. Mr. Alessi subsequently filed an adversary proceeding against Fusion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10. At some point after the adversary proceeding began, Fusion obtained new counsel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 9-10. As part of the adversary proceeding, Mr. Alessi issued Requests for Production to Fusion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Believing SFK still possessed documents responsive to Mr. Alessi's discovery requests, Fusion's new counsel sent the requests to SFK, along with a subpoena pursuant to Rule 45.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b610-11. SFK objected to Fusion's subpoena on the ground that Fusion had not fully paid SFK for its representation, asserted a retaining lien, and moved to quash the subpoena and for a protective order.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The bankruptcy court held a hearing on SFK's Motion to Quash and denied the Motion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11. At the hearing, no evidence was taken, but the bankruptcy court gave two reasons for its denial of the motion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11; Hearing Tr., ECF No. 7, 30:1-31:12. First, the court found the existence of a common law or contractual retaining lien is not a specified defense to compliance with, nor a basis for quashing or modifying, a subpoena under Rule 45(d)(3). Hearing Tr., 30:1-6. Second, the court found sufficient allegations of SFK's misconduct in the adversary proceeding to create an exception to the retaining lien based on the court's own observations, including that \"Mr. Stok has been as uncooperative and unhelpful as possible.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30:13-31:12. However, the court specifically declined to make a finding of misconduct.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30:14-15. In the subsequent written Bankruptcy Order, SFK was ordered to produce the responsive documents within seven days, while Fusion was not required to post an interim bond as security. Bankruptcy Order, ECF No. 1, 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   SFK timely filed its Notice of Appeal of the Bankruptcy Order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1. SFK also filed an Emergency Motion for Stay Pending Appeal in the adversary proceeding. SFK Br., \u00b6 13. The bankruptcy court denied the Motion for Stay, so SFK filed an Emergency Motion to Stay Order Pending Appeal in district court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Case No. 17-61379, ECF No. 1. I referred the Motion to U.S. Magistrate Judge Jonathan Goodman, who granted SFK's Motion to Stay.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   SFK contests both of the bankruptcy court's grounds for denying its Motion to Quash. SFK argues that allowing a Rule 45 subpoena to override a retaining lien is improper and would essentially vitiate the common law right to a retaining lien. Fusion has conceded this point, so I will not address it. SFK's next argument is that the bankruptcy court could not create an\n   exception to the retaining lien based on misconduct without taking any evidence, and doing so violated its due process rights. If a hearing is to be held on the issue, SFK requests that the reference be withdrawn so it can be heard in district court in the first instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Exception to Retaining Lien\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   It is undisputed that SFK has a valid retaining lien. Where SFK's and Fusion's views differ is on the manner in which an exception to the retaining should be determined. Fusion contends the bankruptcy court had enough information before it to make a finding of misconduct and to compel SFK to produce the requested documents without Fusion posting any security. In support, Fusion goes through the information relayed at the June 28, 2017 hearing. SFK contends that the information in the record was merely the argument of counsel and does not constitute evidence. Either way, the bankruptcy court specifically stated it was \"not making any determination that there has been misconduct.\" Hearing Tr., 30:14-15. Absent such a determination, an order compelling SFK to hand over its files without adequate security was a departure from the requirements of the law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Conde &amp; Cohen, P.L. v. Grandview Palace Condo. Ass'n, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12180098\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/201/64/#p65\">\n    201 So.3d 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 65 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2015). This matter will be remanded for a factual determination as to whether any misconduct occurred to allow for an exception to the retaining lien.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   However, upon remand, the issue remains of whether an evidentiary hearing is necessary. In SFK's initial brief, it argues the bankruptcy court erred by overriding SFK's retaining lien without holding an evidentiary hearing, a violation of SFK's right to due process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fusion does not address whether SFK should have been allowed to present evidence in response to Fusion's accusations and the bankruptcy court's impressions of misconduct; it merely argues that the information in the record was sufficient to support a finding of misconduct. While SFK has cited no case law that it is entitled to an evidentiary hearing, an evidentiary hearing is generally only required where there is a disputed issue of material fact.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    All Care Nursing Serv., Inc. v. Bethesda Mem'l Hosp., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10538479\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/887/1535/#p1538\">\n    887 F.2d 1535\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1538 (11th Cir. 1989) (\"Where the injunction turns on the resolution of bitterly disputed facts, ... an evidentiary hearing is normally required to decide creditability issues.\");\n   <em>\n    United States v. Poe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1338263\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/462/195/#p197\">\n    462 F.2d 195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 197 (5th Cir. 1972)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (finding, in the criminal context, that if the allegations are sufficient to establish a claim \"and factual issues are raised, a hearing is required.\");\n   <em>\n    Bischoff v. Osceola County, Fla.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11243406\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/222/874/#p882\">\n    222 F.3d 874\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 882 (11th Cir. 2000) (concluding that for issues of standing, an evidentiary hearing is required where there are facts in dispute and credibility issues to be determined). Presumably there are hotly contested factual issues related to whether SFK engaged in attorney misconduct, meaning an evidentiary hearing is most likely prudent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Withdrawal of Bankruptcy Reference\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   SFK argues that if I determine this matter should have an evidentiary hearing, then I should withdraw the reference under both permissive and mandatory guidelines. I disagree. Neither standard permits or counsels withdrawal of the retaining lien claim. A district court\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   may withdraw, in whole or in part, any case or proceeding referred under this section, on its own motion or on timely motion of any party, for cause shown. The district court shall, on timely motion of a party, so withdraw a proceeding if the court determines that resolution of the proceeding requires consideration of both title 11 and other laws of the United States regulating organizations or activities affecting interstate commerce.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"This statute allows two types of withdrawal: (1) mandatory and (2) permissive. Mandatory withdrawal is required if the proceeding requires consideration of both title 11\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   nonbankruptcy code federal law.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Am.

The issue at hand, whether Fusion has shown an exception to a state law retaining lien, does not present issues of either federal or bankruptcy law. Mandatory withdrawal is therefore not appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"The decision of whether to grant a motion for permissive withdrawal is within the sound discretion of the district\n   court.\"\n   <em>\n    In re TPI Int'l Airways\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1356217\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/222/663/#p668\">\n    222 B.R. 663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 668 (S.D.

As noted in\n   <em>\n    In re Simmons\n   </em>\n   , a district court determining whether cause exists can consider such goals as advancing uniformity in bankruptcy administration, decreasing forum shopping and confusion, promoting the economical use of the parties' resources, and facilitating the bankruptcy process.\n   <em>\n    In re Simmons\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4231739,11493277\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/200/738/\">\n    200 F.3d 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 742 (11th Cir. 2000) (citing\n   <em>\n    Parklane,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6505907,1797059\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/927/532/\">\n    927 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   536 n. 5 ) (citations omitted) ).
