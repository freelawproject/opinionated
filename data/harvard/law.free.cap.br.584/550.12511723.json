INTRODUCTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This matter is before the Court upon conclusion of a trial on the merits on February 23, 2018. The plaintiff Kenneth Nathan (\"Trustee\") filed this adversary proceeding to avoid prepetition transfers from debtor James Libra (\"Debtor\") to defendant Nancy Libra (\"Defendant\") including certain court ordered transfers and obligations that arose as a result of a consent judgment of divorce between the parties in the Wayne County Circuit Court. Specifically, Trustee asserts that the transfers of Debtor's interest in the parties' marital home and of a disputed $30,000 in cash were fraudulent under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20548\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20566.31\">\n    Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 566.31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq, respectively. Defendant denies these allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following constitutes the Court's findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 52, made applicable by Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7052. For the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that the transfer of the Debtor's interest in the marital home did not constitute a fraudulent transfer within the meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20548\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B) and therefore may not be avoided. However, the Court finds that no value was given in exchange for the monetary transfer of $21,900 and consequently Trustee met his burden under M.C.L. \u00a7 566.35(1). This transfer may be avoided subject to Trustee establishing the elements of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20544\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   II. JURISDICTION AND RELATED ISSUES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This adversary proceeding seeks to avoid prepetition transfers as fraudulent and therefore is a core proceeding as defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(H).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On December 1, 2017, Trustee filed a motion for summary judgment seeking to avoid the above referenced transfers. On February 1, 2018, the Court held a hearing on Trustee's motion and denied Trustee's requested relief finding that, based on the facts of this case and the evidence presented at that time, the determination of reasonably equivalent value was inappropriate for disposition under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56. Neither party presented any argument or authority, then or now for purposes of trial, regarding the parties' interests in the property at the time of the relevant transfer and the mutual obligations of spouses pursuant to Michigan law. As will be discussed, the parties' legal rights change upon the filing of a divorce action; as a result, the Court reconsiders its prior finding that the issue of \"reasonably equivalent\n   value\" as to the pre-divorce monetary transfer was an issue of fact and proceeds with the following factual and legal analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The parties have submitted a Stipulation of Facts and Admissibility of Exhibits for Trial, wherein the parties stipulated to the authenticity and admission of all exhibits listed in the Final Pre-Trial Order as well as the establishment of certain prima facie elements of both claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 61). With regard to the fraudulent transfer claim under \u00a7 548, the parties stipulate that Trustee established (1) the transfer was made while Debtor was insolvent or rendered insolvent as a result of the transfer; and (2) the transfer was made within two years of Debtor's bankruptcy. For the fraudulent transfer claim under M.C.L. \u00a7 566.35(1), the parties stipulate that Trustee established (1) there was a Creditor whose claim arose before the transfer was made; (2) the transfer was made while Debtor was insolvent or rendered insolvent as a result of the transfer; and (3) the transfer was made within six years of Debtor's Bankruptcy petition. Accordingly, the only issue before the Court is whether Debtor received reasonably equivalent value for the transfers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   III. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    a.\n    <em>\n     Findings of Fact\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The facts of this case are largely undisputed. Defendant, 54, and Debtor, 56, were married for almost 28 years. They have three children together, ages 36, 34 and 30. During the marriage, Debtor was the primary breadwinner. Defendant took care of the home and raised their three children. Defendant occasionally worked part time when the children went to college. Her income ranged from $6,000-$8,000 per year with a maximum of $10,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Debtor worked at a local furniture store, Moss &amp; Associates, Inc. (\"M&amp;A\") for several decades before purchasing the business. Soon after taking over the business, it began experiencing financial losses. Debtor's average income in the beginning of his employment with M&amp;A was around $700 per week, it peaked at $2,400 per week, and went down to about $1,000 per week over the last few years before the business closed. The parties' joint tax returns show Debtor's income in 2012 at $69,606; 2013 at $60,409; and 2014 at $4,431. In 2016 his income was $65,000 and about $70,000 in 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Debtor maintained a retirement account through Edward Jones as a benefit of his employment with M&amp;A.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The retirement account was in his name only, Defendant was a named beneficiary. Debtor funded the account solely through earned bonuses. The retirement account was intended to provide for both spouses during their retirement years. With respect to the account\n   balance, the account was at its highest before 2011 at around $260,000. However, the Debtor depleted the account in an attempt to save the failing business. Defendant was unaware that Debtor had been withdrawing money from the retirement account. As of the date of the judgment of divorce, the account had a value of $20.88.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Debtor had an extramarital affair and left the marital home in late 2013. The parties agreed that Debtor would pay Defendant $30,000 as support from Debtor's retirement account. On May 22, 2014, Debtor took out the remaining $98,100 from his retirement account. Sometime in July of 2014, but before the filing of the divorce, Debtor gave Defendant around $30,000 in cash. The exact timing and amount of this transfer is unclear. However, the parties agree that the Debtor took back $2,500 of this money to pay his divorce attorney. Additionally, $5,600 was used to pay the balance of the credit card Debtor opened in Defendant's name without her knowledge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Debtor testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   We paid some personal debt, which was basically brought on the household from my business, and the moneys that were left I left with her. She was not working, and I was not working, and I left. I believe it was around 50,000 that was left, but I could be off by 5,000, 10,000. Like I said earlier, this whole timeframe for me is very, very difficult.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (Trustee's Exhibit 13, Debtor Dep. 44). Debtor later clarified that of the $50,000, $20,000 was used to pay the Bank of America credit card, \"I believe the Bank of America credit card was like 17,000, but that was from [M&amp;A]. Probably-probably around 20.\" (Debtor Dep. 48).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Debtor gave the Defendant this money because he depleted substantially all the retirement funds without her knowledge on a failed business and because his extramarital affair caused the breakdown of the marriage. Debtor testified, \"I just stated that I felt obligated because I had spent at least that much in trying to keep the business [M&amp;A] alive, and she deserved that.... She raised three beautiful children that are all graduates of Wayne State University.\" (Debtor Dep. 50).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Debtor gave Defendant the money in cash over a period of several weeks. (Debtor Dep. 48). Debtor testified that he would deposit the checks from Edward Jones into his individual Flagstar account, in which Defendant held no interest. (Debtor Dep. 47). Defendant was of the opinion that she received the money all at once. Defendant did not give anything to the Debtor when she received this money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendant was specifically questioned whether she paid any consideration or anything of value to Debtor in exchange for the $30,000 transfer, Defendant answered \"no.\" (ECF No. 74, Trial Transcript, 33). Furthermore, Trustee asked Defendant \"Did you ever have any agreement verbally or in writing that the $30,000 transfer was going to be in lieu of spousal support in the divorce proceeding?\", to which Defendant again answered \"no.\" (Trial Tr. 33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Court finds that the parties agreed that Debtor would give Defendant some money as support since she was not working. The Court further concludes that the record does not evidence an agreement to waive spousal support in exchange for this money. With regard to the actual amount transferred, the Court finds that of the $50,000 originally in Defendant's possession-$20,000 was used to pay the Bank of America credit card, $5,600 was used to pay off the credit card Debtor opened in Defendant's name, and $2,500 was taken\n   by Debtor to pay his divorce attorney-leaving $21,900.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In April 2014, Debtor was forced to close his business as a result of a wrist injury that placed him out of work, leaving him to collect unemployment benefits from April 2014 through November 2014. Debtor returned to work in November 2014 as a truck driver working for Sigma a division of Sysco.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Debtor filed for divorce on July 10, 2014. The Wayne County Circuit Court entered a consent judgment of divorce on January 26, 2015, wherein the parties agreed Debtor would transfer his interest in the marital home in return for a waiver of spousal support. Debtor was represented by an attorney. Defendant did not have any legal representation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Court finds that Defendant did not know her legal rights at the time of the divorce, or now. Defendant, who has an eleventh grade education, did not understand the meaning of consideration and her responses at a glance appear inconsistent. However, after reviewing her full deposition and trial testimony and the entire record of this case, it is clear that Defendant did give consideration (namely the waiver of spousal support) in exchange for the transfer of Debtor's interest in the marital home as reflected in the judgment of divorce.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Under the judgment of divorce, both parties waived spousal support. Furthermore, the parties agreed this waiver would be non-modifiable. This paragraph states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Neither party will pay spousal support to the other party, and spousal support is forever barred.\n   <em>\n    THE PARTIES FOREGO THEIR STATUTORY RIGHTS TO PETITION THE COURT FOR MODIFICATION OF SPOUSAL SUPPORT AND AGREE THESE SPOUSAL SUPPORT PROVISIONS ARE FINAL, BINDING AND NON-MODIFIABLE.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   (Trustee's Exhibit 8, Judgment of Divorce, 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   With regard to property and debt, the judgment of divorce provides,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Regarding the wife, she shall receive as her sole and separate property:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   1.

Spousal support is not a \"promise.\" A \"promise\" is defined in Merriam-Webster dictionary as \"a : a declaration that one will do or refrain from doing something specified[;] b : a legally binding declaration that gives the person to whom it is made a right to expect or to claim the performance or forbearance of a specified act.\" Merriam-Webster.com/dictionary/promise. Black's Law Dictionary defines \"promise\" as \"[t]he manifestation of an intention to act or refrain from acting in a specified manner, conveyed in such a way that another is justified in understanding that a commitment has been made; a person's assurance that the person will or will not do something. Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). Thus, a promise is a voluntary undertaking that may result in certain legal rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Unlike a promise, spousal support is a legal right or obligation mandated and enforced by statute. Once a legal right to spousal support arises and is ordered by the court, the obligation to pay the same is not voluntary. Furthermore, in Michigan, all judgments of divorce must include a provision for spousal support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   M.C.R. 3.211(B)(4). \"[A] judgment silent with regard to spousal support reserves it.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6050746\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/357/553/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   A support order is a final order or judgment. M.C.L. \u00a7 552.603(2). As such, it is enforceable by garnishment, execution and other remedies for the collection of judgments, M.C.L. \u00a7 600.4012, as well as other civil remedies and criminal sanctions outlined in M.C.L. \u00a7 552.601 et seq.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, unless spousal support is waived, the obligation to pay is mandated by law and is not a voluntary declaration of one spouse to the other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Spousal support is not an \"unperformed promise.\" The obligation to pay spousal support is based on considerations that transpired during the marriage and is quantifiable. Plainly, the statutory exclusion language of \u00a7 548(d)(2)(A) does not encompass spousal support obligations.

Application to Pre-Divorce Monetary Transfer under MUFTA\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   After reviewing the evidence the Court finds that Debtor received no value in exchange for the $21,900 monetary transfer. Defendant did not waive her right to spousal support in exchange for this money. Assuming for the sake of argument that Defendant did waive spousal support in exchange for this transfer, the Court finds that prior to the commencement of the divorce proceedings, Defendant did not have a statutory right to spousal support pursuant to either M.C.L. \u00a7 552.13 or \u00a7 552.23. It is undisputed that Debtor transferred the money to Defendant prior to the filing of the divorce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Until the complaint of divorce was filed, Debtor had no presently enforceable legal obligation of support owed to Defendant. Without an enforceable statutory right to spousal support, Defendant's waiver of such was more akin to a future promise and not a waiver of a legal claim. A future unperformed promise is specifically excluded from the definition of \"value\" under MUFTA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   While Defendant argues that the $30,000 came from Debtor's retirement account, to which she held a one-half interest,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   the timing of this transfer is key-as there was no marital estate. Defendant was only a named beneficiary under the Debtor's retirement plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, she held a contingent interest of a beneficiary and not the one-half-interest that she presumably\n   would have been entitled to under M.C.L. \u00a7 552.18, upon the filing of the divorce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that the Debtor did not receive value in exchange for the monetary transfer. As to the amount actually transferred, the Court concludes that the amount transferred to the Defendant was $21,900.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <em>\n    2. Application to Post-Judgment Transfer of Debtor's Interest in Marital Home under \u00a7 548\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The Court finds that a claim of spousal support arose under M.C.L. \u00a7\u00a7 552.13 and 552.23 in favor of Defendant upon the commencement of the divorce proceeding. But for Defendant's waiver of spousal support in exchange for the transfer of Debtor's interest in the marital home, spousal support would have been a debt owed by Debtor. Defendant had a legal right to payment under M.C.L. \u00a7 552.13 and \u00a7 552.23 for this debt. This spousal support is value to the bankruptcy estate as it would be reduced to a monetary stream of payments Debtor would be legally obligated to pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The consideration exchanged by the parties was the waiver of spousal support for the marital home. The judgment of divorce provides that both spouses waive spousal support, it is forever barred and nonmodifiable. However, given the respective financial positions of the parties and their earning capabilities, it is highly unlikely that Defendant would have been obligated or ordered to pay spousal support to Debtor. This mutual waiver of spousal support is illusory as Debtor did not have a claim to spousal support to waive in the first place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   \"Michigan's statute governing spousal support favors a case-by-case approach to determining spousal support.\"\n   <em>\n    Loutts v.

CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that there was no value given in exchange for the pre-divorce monetary transfer. Defendant did not waive her right to spousal support in exchange for the $21,900 monetary transfer. Even if Defendant had given such a waiver, no right to spousal support existed prior to the commencement of the divorce proceedings. Therefore, there was no legal obligation of support that would amount to a \"debt\" or \"claim\" under the Code or MUFTA. Consequently, Trustee may avoid the monetary transfer in the amount of $21,900 under M.C.L. \u00a7 566.35(1), subject to \u00a7 544. The Trustee did not plead \u00a7 544 in his complaint; further, the parties did not present any argument or stipulation regarding the elements of \u00a7 544. While the proofs will not be reopened, the Court will entertain supplemental briefing on this critical issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   With regard to the transfer of Debtor's interest in the marital home pursuant to the judgment of divorce, the Court finds that Defendant's waiver of her right to spousal support constitutes \"value\" as defined in \u00a7 548(d)(2)(A). The Court additionally finds that Trustee failed to meet his burden to show the value of the spousal support was less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for Debtor's one-half interest of the marital home. Accordingly, this transfer may not be avoided under \u00a7 548.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    The Court notes that Trustee did not plead\n    <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20544\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 544\n    </extracted-citation>\n    in his complaint.

Debtor was not properly served and was unable to appear as he was out of state at the time of the scheduled trial. The only witness called to testify was Defendant. The parties were given an opportunity to adjourn the trial to procure Debtor's presence, but both parties agreed to proceed as scheduled with the admission of Debtor's deposition transcript.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    No evidence was presented as to Debtor's income in 2015. Debtor testified that he has been working for Sigma since November 2014.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    The parties use the terms \"401,\" \"IRA,\" and \"retirement account\" interchangeably. The only documentation related to Debtor's retirement account is a statement from Edward Jones for October 1-November 25, 2015, which provides \"Custodian Edward Jones Trust Company for your Traditional IRA.\" (Trustee's Exh. 7). The Court will refer to this account as \"retirement account.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    There is also testimony regarding a roof repair and the cost of a new car, evidence of which is attached to Defendant's Responses to Request for Admissions, Interrogatories, and Requests for Production of Documents (Trustee's Exh. 10). However this evidence is speculative as the Court does not know who owned the car or the actual date of the roof repair. The invoice is dated May 4, 2015, which is after the February 24, 2015 home appraisal. Had the home been appraised after the new roof was installed, Defendant could have a contribution claim for half of the cost of the installation/repair. Nevertheless, without a claim, how Defendant chooses to use this money is irrelevant for the determination of reasonably equivalent value.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-141\">\n    The consideration given between the parties with respect to their divorce proceedings is separate and different from whether such consideration is \"value\" or \"reasonably equivalent value\" under the Code or MUFTA.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-142\">\n    Similarly, Section 566.33(1) of MUFTA provides\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-143\">\n    Value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or an antecedent debt is secured or satisfied.

Moreover, the parties mainly focus on the spousal support and the marital home in analyzing the transfers. As to the value of Debtor's interest in the marital home, Trustee ignores that the Court has to factor in the mortgage on the marital home to determine the former spouses' equitable share of the home's equity.\n    <em>\n     In re Neal\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4033595\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/fed-appx/541/609/#p612\">\n     541 Fed.Appx. 609\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 612 (6th Cir. 2013).
