Catherine J. Furay, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On May 18, 2017, Debtor Melissa Arnette filed a voluntary Chapter 7 petition. Debtor owns real estate located at 608 Gilbert Street, Eau Claire, Wisconsin (the \"Property\"). The Trustee, Christopher Seelen, commenced an adversary proceeding seeking a declaratory judgment that the mortgage of Wells Fargo is void on its face and, further, that the mortgage may be avoided as not properly recorded. The parties agreed there were no contested material facts and agreed to submit their dispute to the Court on briefs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following discussion constitutes the Court's findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 7052 and Rule 52 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The schedules list Wells Fargo as a secured creditor with a mortgage on the Property. The parties agree that a Mortgage was executed in favor of Century Lending Co. on January 29, 2010, and recorded on February 9, 2010. The Mortgage was then assigned to Wells Fargo on December 10, 2013, and the Assignment\n   was recorded on December 11, 2013. The Mortgage contains a street address but does not include a legal description of the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Trustee argues the mortgage can be avoided under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20544\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3) because the Trustee, in the shoes of a bona fide purchaser, did not have notice of the Mortgage due to the absence of a legal description.\n   <em>\n    In re Thulis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4143167\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/474/668/#p674\">\n    474 B.R. 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 674 (Bankr.

W.D. Wis. 2012). Further, the Trustee contends the Mortgage is void under the Wisconsin statute of frauds because it lacks a legal description.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Wells Fargo contends the absence of a legal description is not dispositive. Rather, it argues that if the property is described with \"reasonable certainty,\" the description is sufficient. If not, then Wells Fargo asserts it is entitled to equitable relief to enforce its mortgage under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20706.04\">\n    Wis. Stat. \u00a7 706.04\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It also contends that the Trustee is not a bona fide purchaser because indexing in a grantor/grantee index is sufficient to provide constructive notice.\n   <em>\n    Wenzel v.

Section 544(a)(3) provides in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (a) The trustee shall have ... the rights and powers of, or may avoid any transfer of property of the debtor or any obligation incurred by the debtor that is voidable by-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (3) a bona fide purchaser of real property, other than fixtures, from the debtor, against whom applicable law permits such transfer to be perfected, that obtains the status of a bona fide purchaser and has perfected such transfer at the time of the commencement of the case, whether or not such a purchaser exists.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   For purposes of determining whether the Trustee would be a bona fide purchaser under section 544, Wisconsin law governs.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20706.08\">\n    Wis.

The Trustee argues that because the Mortgage lacked a legal description and because it was not recorded in the tract index, it is not a valid conveyance of an interest. The Trustee therefore insists he is a subsequent good faith purchaser and can avoid the Mortgage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Trustee concedes he would only qualify as a subsequent bona fide purchaser if he did not have constructive or actual notice of the Mortgage. Under Wisconsin law, \"[s]omeone who actually knows about a prior claim or interest cannot claim the benefit of the recording statute.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Thulis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4143167\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/474/668/#p674\">\n    474 B.R. at 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

There, the court sought to determine the validity of a mortgage that lacked a legal description. The\n   <em>\n    Wenzel\n   </em>\n   mortgage contained only an address and was recorded in the grantor-grantee index, but not the land tract index. The court held that \"despite the deficient legal description, a mortgage's appearance in the grantor/grantee index establishes constructive notice to subsequent purchasers and the bankruptcy trustee may not use his strong-arm power to avoid the mortgage.\"\n   <em>\n    Wenzel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4332454\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/554/861/#p865\">\n    554 B.R. at 865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Trustee concedes the Mortgage was recorded in the grantor/grantee index. The Trustee also acknowledges the ruling in\n   <em>\n    Wenzel\n   </em>\n   . Regardless, the Trustee asks the Court to follow an earlier line of cases that suggests there is no constructive notice where a document is not recorded in a tract index.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Thulis\n   </em>\n   , the lender's mortgage contained a legal description of one lot. The debtor owned two lots. The court concluded the omission of the second lot was not sufficient to place the trustee-or any prospective purchaser-on notice that the bank might claim an interest in the omitted lot. There were no available records for the omitted lot that would in any way have referred to the bank's mortgage. In\n   <em>\n    Couillard\n   </em>\n   , the original mortgage contained accurate legal descriptions. A subsequent mortgage that secured a refinance did not contain legal descriptions or parcel identification numbers. After someone realized the mistake, a document called an affidavit of correction was filed, although it was not signed by the Couillards. The mortgage was indexed in the grantor/grantee index and the affidavit in the tract index.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The grantor/grantee index is sufficient to provide constructive notice. The Trustee relies heavily on the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Couillard\n   </em>\n   that \"an instrument must be properly recorded in order to be effective against third parties.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Couillard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4167801\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/486/466/#p477\">\n    486 B.R. at 477-78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Wenzel\n   </em>\n   court considered\n   <em>\n    Couillard\n   </em>\n   in its decision and distinguished it from these facts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wenzel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4332454\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/554/861/#p865\">\n    554 B.R. 861\n   </extracted-citation>\n   n.2.

E.D. Wis. July 9, 2012). In\n   <em>\n    Thulis\n   </em>\n   , the bank \"completely failed to record its mortgage.\"\n   <em>\n    Wenzel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4332454\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/554/861/#p865\">\n    554 B.R. 861\n   </extracted-citation>\n   n.2.\n   <em>\n    Thulis\n   </em>\n   is thus inapposite. The\n   <em>\n    Wittman\n   </em>\n   case was subsequently overturned in\n   <em>\n    Bank of New York Mellon Trust Co. v. Wittman\n   </em>\n   , No. 12-C-846,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%20173801\">\n    2013 WL 173801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Wis. Jan. 15, 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The bank in both this case and in\n   <em>\n    Wenzel\n   </em>\n   recorded the Mortgage in the grantor/grantee index, which would provide notice of Wells Fargo's pre-existing interest to a hypothetical purchaser. Moreover, the\n   <em>\n    Wenzel\n   </em>\n   holding more accurately reflects Wisconsin courts' interpretation of their own law. The Wisconsin Supreme Court has identified three sources a subsequent purchaser could consult to determine interests in land: (1) documents recorded with the register of deeds, (2) other records such as judgment or lien records, and (3) the land itself.\n   <em>\n    Bump v. Dahl\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8676105\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/26/607/#p613\">\n    26 Wis. 2d at 614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=133%20N.W.2d%20295\">\n    133 N.W.2d 295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A search of records at the register of deeds would have revealed the existence of the mortgage in Ms. Arnette's name. The Trustee does not appear to dispute that\n   such a search would have led to the discovery of the Mortgage. The ruling in\n   <em>\n    Wenzel\n   </em>\n   is therefore well within the Wisconsin Supreme Court's guidelines for a search of land records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Moreover, the ruling in\n   <em>\n    Wenzel\n   </em>\n   more adequately responds to the reality of recording statutes and practice. In Wisconsin, the registers of deeds are statutorily required to maintain an accessible and searchable grantor/grantee index under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2059.43\">\n    Wis. Stat. \u00a7 59.43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9). But, registers of deeds have the\n   <em>\n    option\n   </em>\n   and \"may\" keep a tract index under section 59.43(12m). Based solely on the statutory language, Wisconsin has expressed a preference for grantor/grantee indexes. It would be senseless for this Court to rule that a diligent purchaser must search a land tract index, when a land tract index may not even exist in some counties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   This preference was also acknowledged in\n   <em>\n    Bank of New York Mellon\n   </em>\n   . That court reasoned it \"seems more reasonable to look to the grantor/grantee index since one who gives money to another in return for an interest in property is primarily concerned with whether the person to whom he is giving the money has an interest in the property he is conveying.\"\n   <em>\n    Bank of New York Mellon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%20173801\">\n    2013 WL 173801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hiles v.

The Trustee had notice that Debtor and Wells Fargo executed the Mortgage.

It is clear the parties intended the Mortgage to encumber all the real property associated with the address 608 Gilbert Street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Trustee had constructive notice of the Mortgage. The Mortgage is valid and enforceable. The claims of the Trustee are dismissed. Each party shall bear its own costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   A separate order consistent with this decision will be entered.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
