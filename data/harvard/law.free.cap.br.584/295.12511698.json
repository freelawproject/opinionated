Thorne, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Porsha Simmons and Linda Nova (the \"Debtors\") filed a joint petition under chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code on February 5, 2018. On March 5, 2018, they attended their section 341 meeting with the office of the chapter 13 trustee, Marilyn Marshall. During the meeting, the Debtors were questioned about their marital status and responded by showing Ms. Marshall's attorney a copy of their \"Certificate of Civil Union.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   It appears to the court that the Debtors have generally fulfilled all requirements to confirm their plan or will have by the date now set for confirmation. Ms. Marshall has, however, filed a motion to dismiss one of the joint Debtors for ineligibility as a result of not holding a certificate of marriage. The court finds that the Debtors are eligible to file a joint petition under chapter 13 and the motion to dismiss will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Discussion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Basis of Motion to Dismiss\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Ms. Marshall argues in her motion that under section 302(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, a joint case may only be filed by \"an individual that may be a debtor and such individual's spouse.\" She points out that the word \"spouse\" is not defined in the Bankruptcy Code and cites Merriam-Webster's dictionary, which states that the common definition of \"spouse\" is \"married person: husband, wife.\" She further cites the United States Trustee's website, which considers \"spouse\" to be an individual who is lawfully married under any state law.

She further contends that because the Debtors did not convert their civil union to a marriage during the year in which this was possible under Illinois law, they are not legally married and, therefore, neither individual qualifies as a spouse under Illinois law. She seeks an order from this court dismissing one of the Debtors and requiring the dismissed Debtor to file an independent case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Definition of Spouse under the Bankruptcy Code\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Bankruptcy Code provides in pertinent part that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   A joint case under a chapter of this title is commenced by the filing with the bankruptcy court of a single petition under such chapter by an individual that may be a debtor under such chapter and such individual's\n   <em>\n    spouse\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20302\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (emphasis added).

Accordingly, the court looks to Illinois law to determine the nature of the Debtors' status vis-\u00e0-vis one another and whether or not that status means that they are in a state of marriage with one another.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   If the two were validly married under the relevant provisions of the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act, then the form and substance of the status of the two vis-\u00e0-vis one another under Illinois law would be such that they could be considered to be in a state of marriage with one another.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   750 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/201. They are not married under that statute, so the court must determine whether or not the two can be said to be in a state of marriage under Illinois law when the form and substance of their status vis-\u00e0-vis one another derives from the two having been joined in a civil union under the Illinois Religious Freedom Protection and Civil Union Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Illinois Religious Freedom Protection and Civil Union Act provides pertinently as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Protections, obligations, and responsibilities. A party to a civil union is entitled to the same legal obligations, responsibilities, protections, and benefits as are afforded or recognized by the law of Illinois to\n   <em>\n    spouses\n   </em>\n   , whether they derive from statute, administrative rule, policy, common law, or any other source of civil or criminal law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   750 Ill. Comp. Stat. 75/20 (emphasis added). The statute also provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \"Party to a civil union\" means a person who has established a civil union pursuant to this Act. \"Party to a civil union\" means, and shall be included in, any definition or use of the terms \"spouse\", \"family\", \"immediate family\", \"dependent\", \"next of kin\", and other terms that denote the spousal relationship, as those terms are used throughout the law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   750 Ill.

For that reason, the court concludes that the substantive nature of the Debtors' status under Illinois law vis-\u00e0-vis one another means that they are substantively, if not formally, in a state of marriage with one another under Illinois law, and therefore both are each other's spouses under the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Ms. Marshall fails to cite any authority considering the Illinois statute or other analogous statutes that supports the dismissal of the joint Debtors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   There appear\n   to be relatively few cases addressing similar situations, as state statutes tend to be unique. In a thoughtful analysis, the Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California concluded that two individuals in a domestic partnership under California law were not spouses of one another under section 302 of the Bankruptcy Code despite the relevant California domestic partnership provision being largely similar to the Illinois provision cited above (75 Ill. Comp.

Whether or not two persons are in a state of marriage with one another such that they are spouses of one another under federal bankruptcy law depends on the substance of those individuals' status vis-\u00e0-vis one another under relevant state law. State law labels and classifications are not controlling in and of themselves; thus, the fact that Illinois law might term two individuals joined in a marriage under the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act \"spouses\" while calling two individuals joined in a civil union \"parties to a civil union\" does not conclusively determine the federal question as to who exactly may be a \"spouse\" under the Bankruptcy Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4299768\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/511/621/#p631\">\n    511 B.R. 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 631 (Bankr.
