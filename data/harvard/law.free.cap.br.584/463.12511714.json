CRAIG, Chief United States Bankruptcy Judge\n   This matter comes before the Court on the motion of Robert L. Geltzer (the \"Trustee\"), as Chapter 7 Trustee of the estate of Man Kit Ng, to sanction Karamvir Dahiya and Dahiya Law Offices, LLC (collectively \"Dahiya\") pursuant to 11 U.S.C \u00a7 105(a) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201927\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (the \"Sanctions Motion\"). The Trustee seeks contempt and sanctions against Dahiya because of five statements in a motion to dismiss filed by Dahiya in\n   <em>\n    Geltzer v. Brizinova\n   </em>\n   , Adv. Pro. No. 15-1073 (ESS). The Trustee, who is also the chapter 7 trustee in\n   <em>\n    In re Brizinova,\n   </em>\n   Case No. 12-42935 (ESS), sought sanctions against Dahiya in\n   <em>\n    Geltzer v. Brizinova,\n   </em>\n   based on those five statements, which was denied.\n   <em>\n    Geltzer v. Brizinova (In re Brizinova\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272775\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/565/488/\">\n    565 B.R. 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr.

Brizinova\n   </em>\n   violated a stipulation approved in the Ng Adversary Proceeding on November 6, 2014 (the \"Ng Stipulation\"). The Trustee also asserts that sanctions are warranted because Dahiya violated the order referring this adversary proceeding to mediation (\"Mediation Order), which stated that the mediation shall be governed by Local Bankruptcy Rule 9019-1 (\"LBR 9019-1\"), which provides for the confidentiality of statements made during the mediation process. This bankruptcy case and this adversary proceeding were reopened under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20350\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   on April 21, 2017, and on October 5, 2017, the Trustee filed the instant motion for sanctions. For the following reasons, the Sanctions Motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    JURISDICTION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This Court has jurisdiction of this core proceeding under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A) and \u00a7 1334(b), and the Eastern District of New York standing order of reference dated August 28, 1986, as amended by Order dated December 5, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Trustee seeks sanctions against Dahiya for statements made in a motion to dismiss in\n   <em>\n    Geltzer v. Brizinova\n   </em>\n   . The Trustee asserts that five statements in the motion to dismiss are highly objectionable and offensive. Those statements are:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Geltzer having realized that he has gotten money from the sons, he could extract more, he has begun his extortionist journey again.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [A]s stated earlier, trustee warns to threaten a family into further submission.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   They had sued the sons and settled with them. Seeing the promptness of the settlement Geltzer has to devise ways to reach deeper to extort more settlement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-17\">\n   This Trustee Robert Geltzer, has been known to never file an estate closure reports on an expeditious basis but for keeping it open. Why? Unexpected Accretion!\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Geltzer Brought a lawsuit against the sons of the debtors, Nick Soshkin and Igor Soshkin on grounds very frivolous ... This settlement, became a source of inspiration to Geltzer to dig more.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (Mot. for Sanc. 22, ECF No. 56).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, the Trustee argues that Dahiya violated\n   the Mediation Order by disclosing a confidential communication made during court-ordered mediation in that case. (Mot. For Sanc. 2, ECF No. 56.) In particular, the Trustee states that Dahiya's statement in a reply brief filed in\n   <em>\n    Geltzer v. Brizinova\n   </em>\n   that Dahiya signed the Ng Stipulation only after the mediator stated that sometimes \"it takes a stronger person to walk away, so [I, Dahiya] walked away,\" was sanctionable. (Mot. For Sanc. 38-39, ECF No. 56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Geltzer v. Brizinova\n   </em>\n   , the Trustee asserted the statements set forth above violated the Ng Stipulation, the Mediation Order, LBR 9019-1, and the New York Rules of Professional Conduct (\"Rules of Conduct\"), and sought sanctions pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20105\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and the Court's inherent power. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Adv. Pro. No. 15-1073, ECF No. 19.) The court denied the sanctions motion in\n   <em>\n    Geltzer v. Brizinova\n   </em>\n   on March 3, 2017, addressing the motion in two parts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   First, the court held that the question of whether Dahiya violated the Ng Stipulation, or the Mediation Order, and if so, whether a finding of contempt was appropriate, was more properly addressed to this Court.\n   <em>\n    Geltzer v. Brizinova\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272775\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/565/488/\">\n    565 B.R. at 503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the court denied the Trustee's motion for sanctions, to the extent that the motion sought sanctions for violations of the Ng Stipulation or the Mediation Order, without prejudice to allowing the Trustee to seek relief from this Court.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272775\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/565/488/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272775\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/565/488/\">\n    at 503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, the court held that the Trustee failed to show that sanctions were warranted under Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 105, the Court's inherent authority, LBR 9019-1, or the Rules of Conduct.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272775\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/565/488/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In so doing, the court found that \"the Trustee has not established by clear evidence that Dahiya acted in bad faith in employing such strident words or that his conduct was entirely meritless and undertaken for improper purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272775\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/565/488/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272775\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/565/488/\">\n    at 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court also found that the statements in question \"are more accurately viewed as rhetorical flourishes than as knowing and material statements that are false.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272775\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/565/488/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272775\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/565/488/\">\n    at 509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On March 13, 2017, the Trustee moved this Court, unopposed, to reopen the Ng Adversary Proceeding in order to pursue this sanctions motion. (Mot. to Reopen, ECF No. 54.) On April 21, 2017, the Court reopened this case and the Ng Adversary Proceeding. (Order Granting Mot. to Reopen, ECF No. 55.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The portion of the Ng Stipulation at issue states that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-24\">\n   12. Dahiya apologizes to the Trustee for the Circumstances that led to the Motion for an Order Imposing Sanctions against Karamvir Dahiya, Esq. and/or Dahiya Law Offices, LLC pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201927\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as well as for those statements contained in his Opposition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-25\">\n   13.

Brizinova\n   </em>\n   , the Trustee requests this Court to find Dahiya in contempt and to sanction Dahiya pursuant to 11 U.S.C \u00a7 105(a), 28 U.S.C \u00a7 1927, and Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure 9014 and 9020. (Mot. for Sanc. 1, ECF No. 56.) The Trustee argues that Dahiya should be found in contempt and sanctioned for violating the Ng Stipulation because in that stipulation, he agreed to practice in accordance with the Standards of Civility, adopted by this Court pursuant to administrative order # 568, dated October 28, 2010 (\"Civility Standards\"), and the Rules of Conduct. (Mot. for Sanc. 2, ECF No. 56.) The Trustee argues that in making the five statements Dahiya violated the Civility Standards and the Rules of Conduct, and should therefore be held in contempt of the Ng Stipulation and sanctioned for such contempt. The Trustee also argues that sanctions should be imposed on Dahiya under 11 U.S.C \u00a7 105 and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201927\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as well as the Court's inherent authority. The Trustee further seeks sanctions for violation of the Mediation Order based upon Dahiya's statement that he entered into the Ng Stipulation only upon being told that \"it takes a stronger person to walk away.\" (Mot. for Sanc. 41-42, ECF No. 56.) The Trustee takes the position that, because the Mediation Order provided for the mediation to be governed by LBR 9019-1, Dahiya's disclosure of a statement made in the mediation not only violated the local rule in question, but also constitutes contempt of the Mediation Order, for which he should be sanctioned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Dahiya argues that the statements are not sanctionable. (Mem. in Opp'n, ECF No. 59.) In addition, Dahiya asserts that the Sanctions Motion is barred by issue preclusion and by claim preclusion. (Mem. in Opp'n 10-11, ECF No. 59.) The Court understands Dahiya, in making this argument, to be invoking the doctrines of collateral estoppel and res judicata.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Collateral Estoppel\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Dahiya argues that Judge Stong's decision denying the Trustee's motion in\n   <em>\n    Geltzer v. Brizinova\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272775\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/565/488/\">\n    565 B.R. 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , must be given preclusive effect in the context of the Sanctions Motion. (Reply in Opp'n 10, ECF No. 59.) Collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, \"means simply that when an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be litigated by the same parties in a future lawsuit.\"\n   <em>\n    Schiro v. Farley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"232397\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/222/#p232\">\n    510 U.S. 222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 232,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"232397\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/222/#p232\">\n    114 S.Ct. 783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"232397\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/222/#p232\">\n    127 L.Ed.2d 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Trustee agrees that collateral estoppel is relevant to this action, but contends that collateral estoppel precludes Dahiya from asserting collateral estoppel as a defense to this motion. (Reply in Supp. 9, ECF No. 66.) The Trustee argues that Dahiya's failure to raise a collateral estoppel defense in the opposition to the motion to reopen prevents him from doing so now. (Reply in Supp. 9, ECF No 66.) The Trustee also maintains that collateral estoppel is inapplicable to the Sanctions Motion because 1) in\n   <em>\n    Geltzer v. Brizinova\n   </em>\n   , Judge Stong denied without prejudice his motion to sanction Dahiya for violating the Ng Stipulation or the Mediation Order, and 2) this motion seeks sanctions for violations of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201927\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which was not sought in\n   <em>\n    Geltzer v.

These claims are also asserted in this case, as well as the claim that Dahiya, through the same statements, engaged in conduct that is sanctionable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201927\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and violated the Ng Stipulation and the Mediation Order, giving rise to additional grounds for sanctions. (Mot. for Sanc., ECF No. 56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Under principles of collateral estoppel, the determination in\n   <em>\n    Geltzer v. Brizinova\n   </em>\n   precludes this Court from making the same inquiry. The court in\n   <em>\n    Geltzer v. Brizinova\n   </em>\n   determined that the Trustee has not demonstrated 1) that sanctions were warranted under \u00a7 105 or the Court's inherent authority, 2) that Dahiya violated Local Rule 9019-1, or 3) that Dahiya violated New York's Rules of Professional Conduct.\n   <em>\n    Brizinova\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272775\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/565/488/\">\n    565 B.R. 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This Court therefore will not revisit these issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Trustee's argument that principles of collateral estoppel prevent Dahiya from asserting the defense of collateral estoppel must be rejected. In the context of the Trustee's unopposed motion to reopen, this Court was not called upon to determine the merits of the Sanctions Motion or any potential defense to it. This case and adversary proceeding were reopened solely based on finding that cause existed to reopen to permit the Trustee to file this motion. (Order Granting Mot. To Reopen, ECF No. 55.) Because the issue of collateral estoppel was not actually and necessarily determined at that time, the Trustee's attempt to preclude Dahiya from invoking that doctrine must fail.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Montana\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6180409\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/440/147/#p153\">\n    440 U.S. at 153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6180409\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/440/147/#p153\">\n    99 S.Ct. 970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    c.f.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Phares v.

For the reasons explained at length in that decision, Dahiya's statements, while intemperate, and offensive to the Trustee, do not justify sanctions under \u00a7 105, the Court's inherent power, or the Rules of Conduct. To the extent that the Trustee seeks sanctions separately under the Ng Stipulation based upon Dahiya's statement therein that he \"reaffirms his commitment to do practice in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code, the Bankruptcy Rules, the Local Rules of this district, the New York Rules of Professional Conduct, and the Chief Judge's Standards for Civility,\" his argument must be rejected. Neither the Ng Stipulation nor the order approving it creates a basis for sanctions where sanctions would not otherwise be called for under applicable law. In addition, and more broadly, the\n   statements at issue, while strident, provocative, and offensive to the Trustee, do not warrant sanctions under \u00a7 105, the court's inherent power, or\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201927\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which are reserved for situations where there is clear evidence that \"(1) the offending party's claims were entirely meritless and (2) the party acted for improper purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    Revson v.

That order, which referred the parties to mediation, and directed that the mediation be governed by LBR 9019-1, did not create an independent basis for sanctions where sanctions would not otherwise be awarded. While courts recognize that confidentiality is fundamental to the mediation process, case law reflects that sanctions are appropriately applied where the disclosure reflects an effort to undermine the mediation process, or was otherwise in bad faith.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Savage &amp; Assocs., P.C. v.
