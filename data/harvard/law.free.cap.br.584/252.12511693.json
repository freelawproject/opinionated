His modified chapter 13 plan was confirmed on October 16, 2017. It requires the Debtor to make monthly payments of $100.00 for 60 months to the chapter 13 Trustee, Thomas Vaughn. He scheduled a $13,000.00 non-priority unsecured debt owed to the City of Chicago for parking tickets on his schedule E/F, part 2, of creditors who have unsecured claims. Bankruptcy Case 17-25141, Docket No. 1, p. 25. Unsecured creditors were set to receive 10% of the amounts owed them. Docket No. 28, p. 4. On October 30, 2017 an order was entered increasing the monthly plan payment to $420.00.

The Debtor filed another chapter 13 case, 17-03665, on February 8, 2017. That case was dismissed on July 19, 2017 for failure to pay filing fee. Docket No. 38. Attorney John A.

Instead of objecting to its treatment in the plan before it was confirmed on October 16, 2017 or appealing the confirmation order, the City of Chicago simply refused to release the Debtor's vehicle unless it was paid 100% of its claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On December 29, 2017 the Debtor filed a Motion to Modify Plan in which he admitted that this case was filed to obtain release of his 1975 Buick Regal vehicle which had been impounded by the City of Chicago, He alleges that \"[i]n order for the City of Chicago to release the vehicle, the Debtor's plan needs to pay the claim of the City of Chicago as secured.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Modify Plan, Docket No. 54, p. 1, \u00b6 3.

It is bound by the terms of the confirmed plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On January 22, 2018 the court issued a Rule to Show Cause directed to the City of Chicago to show cause why it should not be sanctioned for refusing to release the vehicle pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Thompson v.

According to the Seventh Circuit the secured creditor therein exercised control over a vehicle in violation of the automatic stay by refusing to return it upon request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The City of Chicago has excepted itself from the operation of federal bankruptcy law by not objecting to its treatment in the plan before confirmation and refusing to return the debtor's vehicle unless its claim gets paid in full as a secured claim. In addition, the City is assuming that all of its claims are excepted from the imposition of the automatic stay by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4) which states that the automatic stay does not cover the commencement or continuation of proceedings by governmental units to enforce its police and regulatory power including the enforcement of a judgment other than a money judgment.

If the creditor's interest declines in\n   value while the debtor possesses it, the debtor or the bankruptcy estate must offset the decline. Adequate protection payments may be calculated by examining the value of the collateral during the month the bankruptcy petition was filed and the month immediately after.\n   <em>\n    In re Marks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3779095\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/394/198/#p202\">\n    394 B.R. 198\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 202 (Bankr.

The City of Chicago has not asked the court to order the debtor to provide adequate protection nor has it complained that its treatment in plan(s) proposed by the Debtor was improper for any reason under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201322\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2) regarding plan treatment of its secured claim, or under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5) regarding the Bankruptcy Code's lien retention provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The City of Chicago is usurping the court's authority and responsibility to decide whether and how debtors have to provide adequate protection. In addition, the City of Chicago is ignoring its duty to return vehicles under the\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    Possessory Liens Under Illinois Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The City argues that it has a possessory lien which allows it to refuse to return vehicles unless its claim gets paid in reliance on\n   <em>\n    In re Avila\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272794\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/566/558/#p561\">\n    566 B.R. 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 561 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 2017). This court disagrees. According to the Illinois Appellate Court, Illinois recognizes common-law possessory liens in limited situations. Illinois law at 810 ILCS 5/9-333 states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (a) \"Possessory lien.\" In this Section, possessory lien means an interest, other than a security interest or an agricultural lien:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (1) which secures payment or performance of an obligation for services or materials furnished with respect to goods by a person in the ordinary course of the person's business;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (2) which is created by statute or rule of law in favor of the person; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (3) whose effectiveness depends on the person's possession of the goods.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The City of Chicago does not have a possessory lien as it has not supplied the Debtor with goods or services and it does not cite to a statute or rule of law in its favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A District Court ruled that federal bankruptcy law does not preempt Municipal Code of Chicago (hereinafter \"MCC\") \u00a7 9-92-80. That ordinance states that \"Any vehicle impounded by the City or its designee shall be subject to a possessory lien in favor of the City in the amount required to obtain release of the vehicle.\" MCC \u00a7 9-92-80(f). That Court stated that \"[t]he General Assembly recently amended MCC \u00a7 9-92-80 to provide that 'any vehicle impounded by the City or its designee shall be subject to a possessory lien in favor of the City in the amount required to obtain release of the vehicle.' \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baines v.

March 22, 2018). The legislation mentioned therein was enacted by the Chicago City Council, not the Illinois General Assembly. The City of Chicago, which enjoys authority as a home rule body, can not expand on Illinois lien law at 810 ILCS 5/9-333.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Illinois Constitution provides that home rule units, those with a population in excess of 25,000:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \"Except as limited by this Section... may exercise any power and perform any function pertaining to its government and affairs including, but not limited to, the power to regulate for the protection of the public health, safety, morals and welfare; to license to tax; and to incur debt.

First, it decided whether the exercise of power by the municipality pertained to its government and affairs. Second, it decided whether the legislature had specifically limited the local exercise of the power in issue or whether the legislature had specifically declared the State's exercise to be exclusive, totally preempting a home rule unit's exercise of its constitutional power. That Court also decided that if no specific action had been taken, it had to determine the proper relationship between the local ordinance and state law. That Court held an Oakbrook Terrace zoning ordinance invalid because it precluded a just compensation remedy available to defendants under the Eminent Domain Law, 735 ILCS 5/7-101.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The City of East St. Louis enacted an ordinance that prohibited non-wage garnishment of City funds on deposit at institutions within the City.
