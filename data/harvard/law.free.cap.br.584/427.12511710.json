He alleges breach of fiduciary duty (Count I), civil conspiracy (Count II), fraud (Count III), breach of contract (IV), breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing (Count V), violation of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77a\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (Count VI), violation of the Massachusetts Uniform Securities Act (\"MUSA\"), Mass.

R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) and Rule 12(b)(7).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   D. 25.

Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On a motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), the Court must determine \"whether the well-pleaded factual\n   allegations, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, state a claim for which relief can be granted.\"\n   <em>\n    Germanowski v.

To do so, the Court performs a two-step analysis.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Saldivar v.

Second, taking the well-pled facts as true and \"drawing all reasonable inferences in the pleader's favor,\" the Court determines if the facts \"plausibly narrate a claim for relief.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3723950\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/669/50/#p55\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The following facts are based upon the allegations in Yiming's amended complaint, D. 16, and are accepted as true for the consideration of the motion to dismiss. Bling Defendants are the controlling members of Bling, a Massachusetts limited liability company \"formed for the stated purpose of developing and operating a luxurious, state-of-the-art bar, karaoke, and restaurant facility in Malden, Massachusetts.\" D. 16 \u00b6\u00b6 1, 17. Liu and Huang are married and Wang is their cousin. D. 16 \u00b6\u00b6 8-9. In June 2013, Defendants Liu and Wang (and two others) incorporated Bling. D. 16 \u00b6 17. Liu was Bling's manager. D. 16 \u00b6 18. Huang was not identified in Bling's filing papers, but he ran Bling's day-to-day operations and was later identified as its co-manager. D. 16 \u00b6 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Yiming is a Chinese citizen who was seeking to obtain legal permanent resident status in the United States for himself and his wife through the United States Customs and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\") EB-5 Program. D. 16 \u00b6 20. The EB-5 Program requires an investment of \"at least $1 million into an eligible business that is designed to promote job growth in the targeted area,\" and that the applicant \"take an active management role with the business.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3723950\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/669/50/#p55\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   At some point in 2014, Wang learned \"[t]hrough a mutual acquaintance\" that Yiming was seeking an eligible business for an EB-5 investment and Wang discussed it with Liu and Huang. D. 16 \u00b6\u00b6 22-23. Yiming communicated to Wang that he only wanted to invest in a company that was on strong financial footing and had other EB-5 investors. D. 16 \u00b6 25. Wang communicated this sentiment to Liu and Huang.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3723950\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/669/50/#p55\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On or around May 21, 2014, Yiming and his wife met with Wang at Huang's business office. D. 16 \u00b6 27. Huang did not participate in the meeting, but Yiming alleges that Huang assisted Wang in preparing for the meeting and was on the premises when the meeting occurred.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3723950\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/669/50/#p55\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Wang told Yiming that Huang was running day-to-day operations and would be responsible for the project's management. D. 16 \u00b6 29. Yiming asked to speak with Huang, but Wang declined, insisting instead that he represented both Huang and Liu, who knew and approved Wang's statements at the meeting. D. 16 \u00b6 31. At the meeting, Wang presented Bling's business plans, stating that \"the Project was already sufficiently funded with an aggregate investment of $5 million-$1.5 million from the Bling Defendants combined, an additional $1.5 million from the other two original members, and $1 million each from two other individuals who Mr. Wang represented were EB-5 investors.\" D. 16 \u00b6 28. He told Yiming that the facility was to be completed in December 2014 and that because the project was \"nearing its final\n   stages,\" Yiming's $1 million investment was needed \"only to add the final, high-end upgrades\" and he would need to invest soon if he wanted to use it for the EB-5 program. D. 16 \u00b6 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Wang showed Bling's business plan to Yiming, stating it was prepared by Huang and Liu. D. 16 \u00b6 30.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Yiming alleges the business plan \"repeated many of the representations made by Wang verbally during this meeting.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3723950\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/669/50/#p55\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The business plan lists Bling's budget as $4,500,000, \"which will be sourced from three (3) EB-5 investors\"-including Yiming-\"each of whom have invested/will invest a minimum of $1,000,000.\" D. 16-1 at 3, 16-17. It states that the remaining $1.5 million was composed of investments by the four founding members. D. 16-1 at 3, 16-17. Yiming alleges that the business plan also contained financial projections \"that were completely made up and lacked any basis in reality or any sort of risk analysis.\" D. 16 \u00b6 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Yiming sought legal representation to assist him with his EB-5 application and Wang referred him to Tian and MT Law. D. 16 \u00b6 36. These parties had a pre-existing relationship with the Bling Defendants, but agreed to guide Yiming in the immigration petition process and \"review all legal documents from the Project.\" D. 16 \u00b6\u00b6 37, 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In August 2014, Yiming invested $1 million in Bling and received a five percent ownership interest in the company. D. 16 \u00b6 42. Yiming \"has since learned\" that at the time of his investment, the original members had invested only $470,340.39 total, and that of the additional $2 million purportedly invested by EB-5 investors, only one $500,000 investment had been received. D. 16 \u00b6 44. Additionally, Huang \"later admitted to Yiming [that] the remaining $1.5 million\" of these EB-5 investments were not equity investments, but were, instead, loans that Huang and Liu \"used to justify Liu's substantial ownership interest and management powers in Bling.\" D. 16 \u00b6 45. Yiming alleges that Huang admitted that Liu and Huang \"were responsible for falsely inflating the number, source, and amount of these purported investments and that he was responsible for preparing the Company's business plan.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3723950\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/669/50/#p55\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Nevertheless, Bling Defendants submitted documentation to USCIS in September 2014 representing that Bling had been funded with $3.5 million prior to Yiming's investment. D. 16 \u00b6\u00b6 50, 52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Yiming entered into an Escrow Agreement with Bling that required \"expressly or implicitly\" that the Company would use Yiming's investment \"only for construction-related expenses.\" D. 16 \u00b6 53. Instead of using Yiming's investment for construction-related expenses, however, Yiming contends Bling Defendants paid themselves, through \"highly suspicious payments\" that were \"funneled through Bling's operation.\" D. 16 \u00b6\u00b6 54-55. Bling Defendants also fabricated documents such as forged letters by \"non-existent investors and distributors\" to support Yiming's EB-5 petition and \"avoid the repayment obligation to him if the petition failed.\" D. 16 \u00b6 59. For example, in January 2016, Bling provided information to USCIS on Yiming's behalf that falsely represented a forthcoming investment of $3 million. D. 16 \u00b6 60. Yiming alleges that, based on Huang's \"history with Bling,\" Huang and Liu's status as co-managers and their signatures on these documents, they \"were personally responsible for creating and fabricating these fraudulent documents.\" D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   16 \u00b6 61. In a June 2016 meeting with the Bling Defendants, Huang admitted to Yiming that he created the document detailing the false $3 million investment for the sole purpose of getting Yiming's petition approved. D. 16 \u00b6 64. Yiming alleges that the terms of his investment required Bling to repay him if USCIS denied his immigration petition. D. 16 \u00b6 61. Yiming's immigration petition was conditionally approved, but neither he nor his wife have taken further steps to obtain a green card through the EB-5 Program. D. 16 \u00b6 73.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Despite initial estimates that work would be completed in December 2014, the \"Project remains far from complete, with no work having been performed in nearly a year.\" D. 16 \u00b6 58. Bling Defendants now assert the company's budget needs to double to complete the project.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3723950\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/669/50/#p55\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On December 5, 2016, Yiming sent a letter to Bling Defendants demanding an accounting. D. 16 \u00b6 65. They refused and instead stated there was a new investor willing to invest in Bling, but only if Yiming would sign a release of claims against Bling Defendants.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3723950\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/669/50/#p55\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Wang instituted this action on December 22, 2016. D. 1. Wang filed the amended complaint on March 17, 2017. D. 16. On March 29, 2017, Bling filed a petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. D. 22; D. 26 at 2 n.1;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bling Entertainment, LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-11058 (Bankr. D. Mass.). In accordance with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), claims against Bling in this case were automatically stayed pending the bankruptcy proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D. 22. Bling Defendants have now moved to dismiss all claims against them. The Court heard the parties on the pending motion and took the matter under advisement. D. 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Considering a Stay as to Bling Defendants\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As an initial matter, Bling Defendants argue the Court must stay this case pending Bling's ongoing proceedings in bankruptcy court. D. 26 at 19. Bling Defendants explain \"complete relief cannot be afforded\" in Bling's absence-specifically the $1 million rescission Yiming seeks-and embezzlement claims fall upon the Chapter 7 Trustee to investigate. D. 26 at 2-3, 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As Yiming notes, however, the stay does not automatically extend to the Bling Defendants under Section 362.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6524697,10516508\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/994/956/\">\n    994 F.2d 956\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 969 (1st Cir. 1993) (explaining that Section 362(a)'s automatic stay provisions \"apply only to the debtor in bankruptcy\").

The Court may consider whether \"judicial resources of the parties will be conserved if th[e] case proceeds as a whole, not piece meal.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Bangor v.

Pending bankruptcy proceedings of a defendant company may justify staying litigation against co-defendants where, for example, the allegations against codefendants are derivative of claims against the company and allowing the litigation to proceed would be adverse to the interests of judicial economy.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Villafa\u00f1e-Colon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3884548\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/932/274/#p281\">\n    932 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   281 ;\n   <em>\n    Celico v.

Notably, these factual allegations-embezzlement, self-dealing and falsification of documents-are nearly identical to those he listed as factual allegations supporting his fraud claim.\n    <em>\n     Compare\n    </em>\n    D. 29 at 4\n    <em>\n     with\n    </em>\n    D. 16 \u00b6 83.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    He also alleges they continued to engage in fraud after Yiming's investment through self-dealing and document falsification. D. 16 \u00b6 83. Yiming has not pled that he relied upon any alleged fraudulent activity following his investment in the company.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    D. 26 at 10. Despite his suggestion otherwise, D. 29 at 5-6, citing \"actual fraud\" cases, which, unlike this case, involved a cause of action under bankruptcy law in\n    <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(2)(A), reliance is a required element of fraud claims. Thus, the only false representations that are relevant to this claim are those pre-investment claims, as they are the only claims upon which Yiming could have reasonably relied.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    The Court has considered the fact that it has now dismissed the Securities Act claim, the federal claim against Bling Defendants. Although the claims against Bling are stayed pending the company's bankruptcy proceedings, the Court still has jurisdiction over the federal claim against Bling and, therefore, retains supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state claims against Bling Defendants.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
