In the draft complaint, H &amp; W charged FTB with serious wrongdoing and alleged that FTB's actions destroyed Debtors.

The cases are\n   <em>\n    In re Rivastigmine Patent Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%202319005\">\n    2005 WL 2319005\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (S.D.N.Y.

Ill. 2008). In all of the cases, the courts found that there was no common legal interest but, instead, a commercial, rooting interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   It is worth noting that one of the Defendants' arguments is that FTB should be considered to be a litigation financing lender. The Trustee and H &amp; W argue that FTB is not, and that even if it were, the communications between FTB and the Trustee and H &amp; W continue to be privileged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    The Court's Ruling\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Initially, the Court notes that FTB is not a litigation financing lender. FTB settled with the Debtors and will receive a percentage of the proceeds from this litigation but it did not advance funds for the litigation. Instead, FTB is a secured creditor of the bankruptcy estate which the Trustee is administering.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   However, the fact that FTB is not a litigation financing lender does not bear upon the Court's ruling. That ruling is that FTB shares a financial interest in common with the Trustee. It does not share a common legal interest with the Trustee. The Court reaches its conclusion from case law and a common sense approach to the issue. The Court can certainly understand why the Trustee and H &amp; W oppose the Motion. They do not want to produce the documents to the Defendants. But they are wrong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Court begins its discussion with a seminal decision in the Third Circuit,\n   <em>\n    In re Teleglobe Commc'ns Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1091072,3510189\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/493/345/\">\n    493 F.3d 345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 2007). The Third Circuit first discussed the importance of the attorney-client privilege and concluded its discussion of that portion of the opinion with the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Thus following\n   <em>\n    Upjohn's\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   lead in not applying the privilege mechanically does\n   not counsel in favor of applying the privilege anytime it might increase the flow of information; rather,\n   <em>\n    Upjohn\n   </em>\n   counsels a more nuanced inquiry into whether according a type of communication protection is likely to encourage compliance-enhancing communication that makes our system for resolving disputes more operable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Teleglobe\n   </em>\n   the Third Circuit soon turned to the \"Community-of-Interest (or Common-Interest) privilege.\" The Third Circuit concluded that \"members of the community of interest must share at least a substantially similar legal interest.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1091072,3510189\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/493/345/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1091072,3510189\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/493/345/\">\n    at 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Next is\n   <em>\n    Grochocinski v.

Ill. 2008)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   , in which the court held that the plaintiff's communications with Spehar Capital, a firm that had provided financing, were not privileged because the two shared a common financial rather than legal interest. More specifically, Spehar Capital would merely receive a percentage of plaintiff's recovery. The Trustee argues that the case has no bearing on the present matter because: \"Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Grochocinski\n   </em>\n   , FTB's [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] holds allowed claims against the estate, and FTB's interest in the litigation against Defendant's is purely aligned with the Trustee's interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Objection of the Chapter 7 Trustee and Hunton &amp; Williams\n   </em>\n   , p. 11 (D.I. 130). However, FTB, unlike Spehar Capital, is not and cannot be a party in litigation involving the same or similar claims as the Trustee asserts here. Instead, FTB will receive money if the Trustee prevails and that equates with a financial rather than a legal interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Other case decisions also make the distinction between common legal interest and common financial interest. The privilege pertains only to the common legal interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   For example, in\n   <em>\n    In re Rivastigmine Patent Litigation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%202319005\">\n    2005 WL 2319005\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 22. 2005), the court found that the common legal interest applied only when the parties' interests were identical.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4. In the patent suit, the common interest lasted only until the patents were transferred. The court expressed doubt that a common interest continued after the patents were assigned. Although one of the parties had royalty rights, the court found that \"[s]uch economic rights, standing alone, are generally not sufficient to support application of the common interest doctrine.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    In re Cherokee Simeon Venture I, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%2012940975\">\n    2012 WL 12940975\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. D. Del. May 31, 2012), the Court upheld the privilege because the parties involved shared a common interest in defending against a bad faith claim. The Court found that the parties' communications were \"in furtherance of their common effort both to prosecute the case and then to defend against [the] bad faith claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. The Court also found a second reason to uphold the privilege, namely \"the purposes of the communications were to develop privileged legal strategies ... and to prepare for the Hearing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. The parties' interests were, in other words, legal in nature and not financial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    In re Vitamin C Antitrust Litigation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%20197583\">\n    2011 WL 197583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D.N.Y.

The communications did not involve legal matters. Also, the parties to the communications did not have identical interests. The court therefore denied a protective order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   As noted earlier, the court in\n   <em>\n    In re Leslie Controls, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3776330\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/437/493/#p496\">\n    437 B.R. 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. D. Del. 2010) upheld the privilege. The debtor had shared communications with an\n   <em>\n    ad hoc\n   </em>\n   committee of asbestos plaintiffs and proposed future claimant's representative.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3776330\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/437/493/#p496\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3776330\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/437/493/#p496\">\n    at 496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court found that the parties shared a common interest.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3776330\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/437/493/#p496\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3776330\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/437/493/#p496\">\n    at 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The insurers, who were challenging the common interest, argued that because the common interest parties were negotiating they lacked commonality. The court found a common interest in that \"the parties shared a common interest in maximizing the asset pool, which would include insurance proceeds.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3776330\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/437/493/#p496\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3776330\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/437/493/#p496\">\n    at 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The parties met their burden of establishing the requirements for a common interest: (1) the communication was made by separate parties in the course of a matter of common interests, (2) the communication was designed to further that effort, and (3) the privilege was not otherwise waived.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3776330\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/437/493/#p496\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3776330\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/437/493/#p496\">\n    at 503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   There are many other cases the Court could discuss. It remains clear to the Court that the common interest which the Trustee and FTB share is financial, not legal. FTB has no legal exposure to the Trustee or Defendants. Instead, FTB sits on the sidelines and hopes that the Trustee, with H &amp; W's help, will achieve success, collect on a judgment, and pay FTB its share of the proceeds. Surely that is a financial interest, not a legal one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   There is added texture and importance to Defendants' effort to obtain the 191 withheld documents. FTB was at one time the \"bad guy,\" the target of the Trustee's and H &amp; W's lawsuit. The complaint which H &amp; W drafted named FTB as the sole defendant and the cause of Debtors' downfall. FTB was accused in the draft complaint of destroying Debtors' going concern value and causing in excess of $5 million of WARN Act liability. Defendants want to better understand what happened to flip the case from FTB to Defendants as being responsible for Debtors' misfortune. The withheld documents may or may not explain what happened, but the Defendants must know.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Court finds that FTB and the Trustee and H &amp; W share a common financial interest rather than a common legal interest. Accordingly, the Court will order the\n   Trustee and H &amp; W to produce to Defendants the 191 withheld documents.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Defendants requested five categories of documents.
