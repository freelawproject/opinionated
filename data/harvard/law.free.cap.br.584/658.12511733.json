This helps achieve the purpose of Chapter 11 by facilitating the reorganization and rehabilitation of the debtor as an economically viable entity. At the same time, the rehabilitation process served by the channeling injunction supports the equitable resolution of asbestos-related claims. In theory, a debtor emerging from a Chapter 11 reorganization as a going-concern cleansed of asbestos liability will provide the asbestos personal injury trust with an \"evergreen\" source of funding to pay future claims. This unique funding mechanism makes it possible for future asbestos claimants to obtain substantially similar recoveries as current claimants in a manner consistent with due process.

Shrader argues that nothing in \u00a7 524(g)(1)(B) limits the application of \u00a7 524(g) injunctions once asbestos trusts pay claimants, but since the Plaintiffs only seek recovery from funds that asbestos trusts have already paid to claimants, Plaintiffs' claims cannot be enjoined and channeled to the trusts under \u00a7 524(g).

Shrader fails to cite any authority in support of its contention that \u00a7 524(g)(3)(A)(ii) or any other part of \u00a7 524(g) precludes claims such as those asserted in this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The two opinions that Shrader cites in support of its argument that \u00a7 524(g)(3)(A)(ii) protects it from liability are inapposite as both opinions are orders confirming plans of reorganization that merely state that the parties being protected by the relevant channeling injunctions satisfy the statutory requirements for receiving protection including those set forth in \u00a7 523(g)(3)(A)(ii).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re G-I Holdings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4132748\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/420/216/#p274\">\n    420 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   274 ;\n   <em>\n    In re Armstrong World Industries\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3717118\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/348/136/#p153\">\n    348 B.R. at 153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, since Plaintiffs seek recovery from funds that have been paid by the trusts for claims made by Shrader on behalf of its clients, the funds at issue have passed from the trusts and out of the jurisdiction of the courts that issued \u00a7 524(g) injunctions. Shrader has not cited any authority holding either that a channeling injunction or the jurisdiction of a court issuing such an injunction follows funds paid by a trust to a claimant's attorney. Because the funds from which Plaintiffs seek recovery are funds that have passed out of an asbestos trust in payment of claims made against the trust, the court concludes that the claims asserted in this action are not subject to dismissal either because they implicate recoveries from asbestos trusts that are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts establishing the trusts or because \u00a7 524(g) deprives the court of jurisdiction.

In December 2003, as part of the Medicare Modernization Act (which was best known for adding a prescription drug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries), Congress amended the Medicare Secondary Payer Act to accommodate Medicare's failed litigation position. For our purposes, Congress made two important changes. First, Congress expressly defined a \"self-insured plan\" as \"[a]n entity that engages in a business, trade, or profession ... if it carries its own risk (whether by a failure to obtain insurance, or otherwise) in whole or in part.\" Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, Pub.L. No. 108-173, \u00a7 301(b)(1), 117 Stat. at 2221-22 *290 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(b)(2)(A) ). This amendment reflected Congress's clear intention to make tortfeasors liable under the Act. Although when stripped from its context, this new statutory definition seems an odd way to create tortfeasor liability, it makes perfect sense against the legislative backdrop: Medicare's insistence in court that tortfeasors were \"self-insured plans.\" Indeed, the statutory definition of a \"self-insured plan\" mirrored the definition in a pre-existing federal regulation, to which the Fifth Circuit refused to give\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference (despite Medicare's protestations) in\n   <em>\n    Goetzmann\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9106727\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/337/489/#p496\">\n    337 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   498 &amp; n. 25, 501-02. Moreover, the limited legislative history makes clear that Congress sought specifically to abrogate those cases, like\n   <em>\n    Goetzmann\n   </em>\n   , that narrowly defined \"self-insured plan\" and, thus, prevented tortfeasor liability under the Act; the legislative history even mentions\n   <em>\n    Goetzmann\n   </em>\n   by name.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   H.R.Rep.

Focusing instead on whether the settlement was funded by a primary plan, the court found that \"the uncontroverted record evidence demonstrates that Kaiser did have what [the 2003 amendments] clarifie[d] will suffice to constitute a self-insured 'primary plan'-an\n   <em>\n    ex ante\n   </em>\n   arrangement to pay for liability claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9232807\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/374/253/\">\n    374 F.3d at 262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Shrader argues that the claims asserted in these counts are subject to dismissal for failure to state a claim because the Plaintiffs seek declaratory judgment on matters subsumed within their unmeritorious claims for relief, and because Plaintiffs are not entitled to a declaration that Shrader must disclose to them the identities of Shrader's present\n   and former clients.\n   <footnotemark>\n    76\n   </footnotemark>\n   Shrader cites\n   <em>\n    In re Vioxx Products Liability Litigation (Vioxx I)\n   </em>\n   , No. MDL 1657,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%203285912\">\n    2008 WL 3285912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *14 (E.D.

R. Civ. P. 12(b)(7). Analysis under Rule 19 is bifurcated. First, the court determines under Rule 19(a) whether \"a person\" is necessary, i.e., \"required to be joined if feasible.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a). In pertinent part Rule 19(a) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-167\">\n   <strong>\n    (a) Persons Required to Be Joined if Feasible.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-168\">\n   <strong>\n    (1) Required Party.\n   </strong>\n   A person who is subject to service of process and whose joinder will not deprive the court of subject-matter jurisdiction must be joined as a party if:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-169\">\n   <strong>\n    (A)\n   </strong>\n   in that person's absence, the court cannot accord complete relief among existing parties; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-170\">\n   <strong>\n    (B)\n   </strong>\n   that person claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that disposing of the action in the person's absence may:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-171\">\n   (i) as a practical matter impair or impede the person's ability to protect the interest; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-172\">\n   (ii) leave an existing party subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations because of the interest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a)(1). Second, if a person is necessary under Rule 19(a) but cannot be joined, the court must determine under Rule 19(b) whether the person is indispensable-or, in the Rule's terms, \"whether, in equity and good conscience, the action should proceed among the existing parties [without the necessary person] or should be dismissed.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(b). If litigation cannot be properly pursued without the absent party, that party is \"indispensable\" and the court must dismiss the litigation.\n   <em>\n    Hood ex rel.

Rather, it bases its entire argument upon that portion of the ERISA plans' claims seeking to enforce their rights against the constructive trust. To the extent that such\n   recovery is sought from settlements that Shrader has already disbursed (although it surely retains at least a portion, namely the percentage it kept as a fee), the client has no current, direct interest in those funds. To the extent that such recovery is sought from \"current\" settlement proceeds actually (or soon to be) in Shrader's possession, the court can consider whether the Matched Claimants covered by ERISA plans have an interest in those funds sufficient to warrant their inclusion in this litigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    85\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that the Matched Claimants are not required parties because they seek neither to litigate the Matched Claimants' contractual obligations nor to obtain funds that belong to the Matched Claimants, but this argument is contradicted by allegations in their Amended Complaint that \"[a]ll health benefit plans offered or administered by [the Plaintiffs] provide [them] a contractual right to reimbursement equal to the total amount paid by them for treatment of their Plan Members' Asbestos Injuries,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    86\n   </footnotemark>\n   they \"seek the imposition of a constructive trust over a portion of the total Asbestos Recoveries made by each Matched Claimant equal to the amount necessary to fully reimburse the [Plaintiffs'] Health Plans for all health benefits provided to or an behalf of that Matched Claimant,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    87\n   </footnotemark>\n   and they \"seek the imposition of an equitable lien to enforce their contractual rights to reimbursement pursuant to the terms of the health benefit plans under which they provided health benefits to Matched Claimants.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    88\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, Plaintiffs' argument ignores the fact that whether the parties who received the benefits for which reimbursement was being sought were necessary parties under Rule 19 was not at issue in either\n   <em>\n    Longaberger\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Griffin\n   </em>\n   because the ERISA plan members who received the medical benefits for which the plaintiffs in those cases sought to be reimbursed were, in fact, named defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   While Plaintiffs correctly argue that to the extent the Plaintiffs are only seeking the percentage of a recovery that Shrader kept as a fee for proceeds that have already been disbursed, Shrader's clients have no current, direct interest in the funds they seek, the Plaintiffs' claims are not limited to funds that Shrader kept as a fee. In response to Shrader's motion to dismiss, Plaintiffs candidly acknowledge that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-184\">\n   [t]he ERISA Plans are seeking a constructive trust over any Asbestos Recoveries that remain in Shrader's possession, custody, or control, and an injunction to prevent the further distribution of those amounts and any amounts that may come into Shrader's possession while this action is pending.\n   <footnotemark>\n    89\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   Plaintiffs also acknowledge that \"[t]o the extent that such recovery is sought from 'current' settlement proceeds actually (or soon to be) in Shrader's possession, the court can consider whether the Matched\n   Claimants covered by ERISA plans have an interest in those funds sufficient to warrant their inclusion in this litigation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    90\n   </footnotemark>\n   But Plaintiffs have not provided the court either allegations of fact or evidence from which the court can decide such an issue. Nor have Plaintiffs cited any case in which an ERISA plan fiduciary seeking reimbursement for medical benefits provided to a plan member brought an action seeking imposition of a constructive trust on settlement proceeds without naming the plan member who received the medical benefits as a defendant. Because neither the Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint nor the Plaintiffs' Response to Shrader's motion provide the court information sufficient to distinguish the Matched Claimants that have no current interest in settlement proceeds in Shrader's possession from those that do, the court is forced to conclude that the Plaintiffs' seek funds that belong not only to Shrader but also to the Matched Claimants. Because the Matched Claimants claim an interest in the subject matter of the Plaintiffs' action,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the recoveries that Shrader has obtained for their asbestos injuries, the court concludes that the Matched Claimants are required and that proceeding without them would not only impair the Matched Claimants' ability to protect their interests in their asbestos recoveries, but also would subject Shrader to substantial risk of incurring inconsistent obligations,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that the Matched Claimants would demand from Shrader the same funds that Plaintiffs are demanding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   (b) The Current Record is Not Sufficient for the Court to Determine Whether Joinder is Feasible\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   Because the court has concluded that the Matched Claimants are required parties, the court must determine whether joining them is feasible.

While they may have filed their lawsuits in Illinois, the communications they had with their counsel to evaluate those claims and prepare those complaints likely involved substantial contact with individuals in Texas. Moreover, presumably all of them have received, or will receive, their settlement proceeds through Shrader. Accordingly, regardless of the basis, ERISA's nationwide service of process provision or basic principles of personal jurisdiction, this Court has personal jurisdiction over each of Shrader's clients.\n   <footnotemark>\n    94\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   Even though ERISA provides a statutory grant of jurisdiction allowing nationwide service of process, the court is unable to conclude that joinder of all the Matched Claimants would be feasible because Plaintiffs have not identified which of the Matched Claimants allegedly owe reimbursements to ERISA plans and which owe reimbursements to Medicare Advantage Plans. Nor have Plaintiffs identified which Matched Claimants reside in Texas and which reside elsewhere, or cited any case holding that an out-of-state resident's retention of a Texas law firm to provide representation in out-of-state litigation provides a sufficient basis for this court to assert personal jurisdiction. Because the Plaintiffs' allegations demonstrate that all of the Matched Claimants are required parties, but provide no basis for the court to determine whether joinder of all the Matched Claimants is feasible, the court concludes that the current record is insufficient to determine which, if any, of the Matched Claimants are indispensable parties. Accordingly, Shrader's Motion to Dismiss for failure to join indispensable parties will be denied without prejudice to being reurged once Plaintiffs have identified (1) the Matched Claimants and their states of residence, (2) the plans pursuant to which each Matched Claimant allegedly owes reimbursement, (3) the terms of those plans that entitle Plaintiffs to reimbursement, and (4) as to each Matched Claimant, the extent to which Plaintiffs seek recovery from current settlement proceeds actually or soon to be in Shrader's possession, and the extent to which Plaintiffs seek recovery only from those portions of settlement proceeds that Shrader has withheld for its fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   After Shrader filed the pending Motion to Dismiss, the Plaintiffs responded thereto, and Shrader replied, the parties sent a letter to the court dated May 2, 2017 (Docket Entry No. 71), describing disputes that they were having over certain provisions of a draft protective order, and asking the court to resolve the disputes and enter a protective order. The disputes over the draft protective order involve three paragraphs that concern Plaintiffs' ability to review information produced by Shrader about its clients. In the May 2, 2017, letter to the court, the parties explain that Plaintiffs seek a protective order containing their proposed language for the disputed paragraphs because\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-194\">\n   [i]n order to identify additional Shrader clients who have recovered or will recover settlement payments for their asbestos-related injuries, i.e., match Shrader's clients' information with Plaintiffs' internal plan member information, and thus, determine the full extent of Plaintiffs' claims against Shrader, Plaintiffs' in-house counsel, officers, directors, and/or employees must have access to the information\n   produced by Shrader about its clients. Without access to this information, Plaintiffs[ ] will have no way to match newly discovered claimants with their records.\n   <footnotemark>\n    95\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   The parties also explain that Shrader seeks a protective order containing its proposed language for the disputed paragraphs because\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-196\">\n   [e]ntering the [Plaintiffs'] proposed protective order-without Shrader's suggested edits-would permit disclosure of personal and confidential information to the [Plaintiffs] about countless individuals with whom the [Plaintiffs]\n   <em>\n    have no contractual relationship whatsoever\n   </em>\n   -and thus no conceivable basis for access to such information-in the hopes that this confidential data dump will yield information about\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   individuals whom the [Plaintiffs] did insure and against whom the [Plaintiffs] may wish to assert a claim. In other words, the [Plaintiffs] seek to conscript Shrader in building a case\n   <em>\n    against its own clients\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    96\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   On May 12, 2017, the court held a hearing on the protective order disputes and ordered the parties to provide briefing on the various issues (Hearing Minutes, Docket Entry No. 75). On July 26, 2017, the parties entered a Temporary Protective Order (Docket Entry No. 81). Soon thereafter Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Docket Entry No. 82), which was withdrawn on October 3, 2017, pursuant to Plaintiffs' Notice of Withdrawal of Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Docket Entry No. 89). Nevertheless, the exhibits attached to Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction appear to contain information relevant to the question of whether the Matched Claimants are indispensable parties. The parties will therefore be ordered to advise the court within fourteen (14) days from the entry of this Memorandum Opinion and Order whether they now have all the information needed to fully address the indispensable-parties issue and, if not, what information they still need, from what source they expect to obtain the needed information, how much time will be required to obtain that information, and whether the Temporary Protective Order now in place suffices for purposes of disclosing information about the Matched Claimants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Motion to Sever\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   Citing Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 20, and\n   <em>\n    In re Vioxx Products Liability Litigation (Vioxx II)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%204681368\">\n    2008 WL 4681368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (E.D.

October 21, 2008), Shrader argues that \"[j]oinder of plaintiffs is inappropriate in this action because the [Plaintiffs'] claims do not share common questions of law or fact and do not arise out of the same transaction or occurrence.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    97\n   </footnotemark>\n   Shrader argues that the Plaintiffs' claims do not share common issues of law or fact because each plaintiff\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-200\">\n   brings different claims against Shrader; those claims are premised on different health benefit plans (i.e., different ERISA plans, different Medicare Advantage plans ...), between different parties, containing different language. Moreover, each plan beneficiary received (or may receive) different recoveries based on the individual circumstances surrounding that beneficiary's exposure to asbestos, and received (or may receive) unique medical care that may or may not relate to asbestos exposure and thus that may or may not support a reimbursement claim based on asbestos-related recoveries.

Shrader's severance argument takes too strict an approach to this liberal two-prong test, which the court finds is met at least in this early stage of the case. The first prong is met because Plaintiffs' claims all arise out of the same allegedly illegal practices,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs' allegations that \"Shrader has continually, over a period of years, collected and disbursed tort settlements without first accounting for the Health Plans' rights.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    104\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, Plaintiffs' claims share several common questions of both law and fact, and thus the second prong of the Rule 20 test-which requires only one such common question-appears to be met.\n   <em>\n    Acevedo\n   </em>\n   , 600 F.3d at 521. The common questions of law shared by the Plaintiffs' claims concern the reach and scope of the Secondary Payer Act and ERISA, and the common questions of fact concern Shrader's knowledge about the health plans' rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   The primary case on which Shrader relies,\n   <em>\n    Vioxx II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%204681368\">\n    2008 WL 4681368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , is distinguishable. In\n   <em>\n    Vioxx II\n   </em>\n   a group of ERISA health plan sponsors and administrators (the \"Plan Plaintiffs\") filed a complaint against the Vioxx Settlement Claims Administrator seeking to enjoin distribution of settlement funds to Vioxx claimants in order to protect reimbursement rights allegedly provided in various plan documents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vioxx II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%204681368\">\n    2008 WL 4681368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3-*4. Granting the Claims Administrator's motion to sever under Rule 20, the court held that the Plan Plaintiffs' ERISA claims did not share common questions of law or fact because (1) the terms of each\n   benefit plan required \"distinct legal analyses,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%204681368\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at *5-*6, and (2) the reimbursement claims were dependent \"on individual facts and circumstances related to each health plan and its individual beneficiaries.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7. The court rejected the Plan Plaintiffs' argument that their claims arose \"from a single transaction-the Vioxx settlement fund.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court explained that the \"settlement itself did not give rise to the Plaintiffs' claims; rather, the claims arose out of reimbursement provisions in the health plans' contracts with an unknown number of unidentified claimants.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8. The court emphasized that the Plan Plaintiffs entered into separate policies with each of their beneficiaries and, consequently, the reimbursement claims arose out of each policy and thus were predicated on different transactions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   Shrader argues that this case is factually and legally indistinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Vioxx II\n   </em>\n   because each plaintiff brings different claims against it, those claims are premised on different health benefit plans containing different language, and each claim arises out of a separate transaction-the individual health plan applicable to each Matched Claimant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    105\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint does not contain facts that allow the court to determine whether the individual health plans applicable to each Matched Claimant are, in fact, different and contain different language. Accordingly, Shrader's motion to sever will be denied without prejudice to being reurged once plaintiffs have made the identifications listed at the end of the preceding section.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     Conclusions and Order\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   Defendant Shrader &amp; Associates LLP's Motion to Dismiss, for a More Definite Statement, and to Sever (Docket Entry No. 63) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-210\">\n   (1) For the reasons discussed in \u00a7 II.A, above, Shrader's motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and motion for a more definite statement are\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-211\">\n   (2) For the reasons discussed in \u00a7 II.B, above, Shrader's motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim for which relief may be granted is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   as to Plaintiffs' claims for unjust enrichment/money had and received and is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   in all other respects.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-212\">\n   (3) For the reasons stated in \u00a7 II.C, above, Shrader's motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(7) for failure to join indispensable parties is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-213\">\n   (4) For the reasons stated in \u00a7 III, above, Shrader's motion to sever is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   For the reasons stated in \u00a7 II.C and \u00a7 III, above, the parties are\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   to advise the court within fourteen (14) days, whether they now have all the information needed to fully address the indispensable parties and severance issues (e.g., identifications of (1) the Matched Claimants and their states of residence, (2) the plans pursuant to which each Matched Claimant allegedly owes reimbursement, (3) the terms of those plans, and (4) as to each Matched Claimant, the extent to which plaintiffs seek recovery from current settlement proceeds actually or soon to be in Shrader's possession, and the extent to which Plaintiffs seek recovery only\n   from those portions of settlement proceeds that Shrader has withheld for its fees).
