As a result of these state court actions, GCRMC filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 1 in Case No. 11-13686-j11. The UTC removed forty-seven pending state court actions to this Court during GCRMC's bankruptcy case thereby commencing the adversary proceedings referenced in the above caption (the \"Adversary Proceedings\").\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Notice of Removal of State Civil Action under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201367\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (A) and 1452(A) and Rule 9027(A) of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure at Docket No. 573 in Case No. 11-13686. Prior to confirmation of a chapter 11 plan in the bankruptcy case, GCRMC, the physicians, and others\n   settled with the UTC, leaving QHR as the remaining defendant in the Adversary Proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Otero Cty.

In phase one, the Court held an 11-day trial on the duty and breach of duty elements of the UTC's negligence claims against QHR (\"Phase I\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Otero\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4041214\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/527/719/#p726\">\n    527 B.R. at 726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (hereinafter, \"\n   <em>\n    In re Otero Phase I\n   </em>\n   \"). The Court determined QHR owed the members of the UTC a duty of care that included: \"(1) the duty to appropriately involve medical staff in evaluating medical issues; and (2) the duty to inform the board and the medical staff about issues relating to patient safety known or that should be known by the hospital management company.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Otero Phase I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4041214\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/527/719/#p726\">\n    527 B.R. at 767\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Court concluded that QHR's breach of the duty of care arose out of GCRMC's interim Chief Executive Officer's actions in response to a letter he received from Dr. Schlicht sent to Hospital Administration \"responding to a letter in which Dr. Masel asserted that Dr. Schlicht was not a Spine Specialist and was improperly performing 'experimental surgery' on patients of the Hospital\" (the \"Masel Letter\").\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4041214\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/527/719/#p726\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4041214\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/527/719/#p726\">\n    at 771\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In light of: the Masel Letter; the fact that Dr. Masel was Dr. Schlicht's proctor charged with reviewing his performance; the fact that no disinterested member of the Hospital medical staff had the expertise to evaluate the PDA procedure; and the fact that the Hospital medical staff were not conducting a formal investigation into Dr. Masel's assertions, the Court concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Under the circumstances, QHR through its interim CEO should have informed the Board or its Executive Committee of Dr. Masel's assertion, made a written request of the MEC to conduct a focused review of the matter pursuant to Section 6.2 of the Medical Staff Bylaws, and then informed the Board or its Executive Committee that such request had been made ... The CEO had the authority and responsibility to request a focused review of Dr. Schlicht's conduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4041214\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/527/719/#p726\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4041214\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/527/719/#p726\">\n    at 773-774\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In addition, during Phase I, the Court determined that comparative fault, and not joint and several liability, would apply to QHR because the UTC had failed to prove any of the statutory exceptions to comparative fault.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4041214\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/527/719/#p726\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4041214\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/527/719/#p726\">\n    at 777\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court did not\n   believe the assertion of \"experimental surgery\" was \"sufficient for the interim CEO to invoke the summary suspension provision under the Medical Bylaws\" to halt the PDA procedure.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4041214\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/527/719/#p726\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4041214\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/527/719/#p726\">\n    at 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After taking into account, among other things, that no patients were complaining about the PDA procedure and the CEO was a highly experienced, competent CEO who consulted medical staff at the Hospital and was satisfied the Masel Letter was written because of a business dispute between Dr. Masel and Dr. Schlicht and not because of an immediate dangers to Hospital patients, the Court concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   QHR did not have the ability to stop Dr. Schlicht or Dr. Bryant from performing the PDA procedure. A summary suspension of Dr. Schlicht's or Dr. Bryant's privileges to perform the PDA procedure on patients based on the nature of the procedure would require the exercise of professional medical judgment. QHR was not capable of making those judgments and had no responsibility to do so. That was the responsibility of the Hospital's medical staff and Board.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4041214\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/527/719/#p726\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4041214\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/527/719/#p726\">\n    at 779\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court, having determined that the public policy exception to applying comparative fault did not apply, held that comparative fault and not joint and several liability would apply if damages were awarded.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4041214\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/527/719/#p726\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4041214\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/527/719/#p726\">\n    at 778-779\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In Phase II, after a 4-day trial on the merits, the Court determined causation and allocated QHR's comparative fault.\n   <em>\n    In re Otero Cty.

D.N.M. Dec. 23, 2016) (hereinafter \"\n   <em>\n    In re Otero Phase II\n   </em>\n   \"). The Court allocated QHR's fault at 16.5%.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207985365\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In determining causation, the Court found that had the QHR CEO requested the GCRMC Medical Executive Committee (\"MEC\" or \"GCRMC MEC\") and the Board to conduct a focused review after receiving the Masel Letter: (1) the MEC would have acted on the CEO's formal request; (2) the MEC would have sought a physician outside of the Hospital to perform the review; (3) the reviewer would have told the MEC that the PDA procedure was dangerous; and (4) the MEC would have acted on that information and stopped the PDA procedure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Otero Phase II\n   </em>\n   , at *7-8. As such, the Court found that the CEO's failure to request the focused review caused the UTC to suffer harm by (1) having the experimental PDA procedure; or (2) undergoing a procedure where Dr. Schlicht as the lead physician committed medical negligence by performing procedures beyond the scope of his credentials.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *9. The Court limited causation to \"the UTC's injuries resulting from (1) PDA procedures Dr. Schlicht or Dr. Bryant performed after September 21, 2007; and (2) non-PDA procedures Dr. Schlicht performed as lead physician after September 21, 2007 that breached the applicable standard of care.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Otero Phase II\n   </em>\n   at *22. The Court reasoned and inferred based on the evidence presented in Phase II that an outside focused review of the PDA procedure \"would have taken two months.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Phase III of the trials will determine damages for individual members of the UTC (\"Phase III\"). The parties agreed to\n   try damages issues in four of the Adversary Proceedings first with the intent to use the damages as test cases for mediation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended Pretrial Order for Damage Trial at Docket No. 593. The parties selected four of the Adversary Proceedings and the Court held a 9-day trial on the issue of damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Nos. 668, 669, 670, 671, 674, 675, 676, 677, &amp; 682. The Court took the matter under advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    THE PENDING MOTIONS TO RECONSIDER AND/OR REOPEN EVIDENCE AND THE COURT'S RULINGS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Four Motions consist of: (1) Motion for Reconsideration and/or Relief from Judgment and Motion to Reopen Evidence (\"UTC Motion to Reconsider and Reopen Evidence\") at Docket No. 629; (2) Motion to Amend and/or for Reconsideration of Order and Memorandum Opinion Regarding Comparative Fault and Causation (\"UTC Zuniga Evidence Motion\") at Docket No. 720; (3) Quorum Health Resources, LLC's Cross-Motion to Amend and/or for Reconsideration of Memorandum Opinion Regarding Comparative Fault and Causation (the \"QHR Zuniga Evidence Motion\") at Docket No. 743;\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (4) Supplemental Motion to Amend and/or for Reconsideration of Order and Memorandum Opinion Reg[a]rding Comparative Fault and Causation (the \"UTC Defense Counsel Misconduct Motion\") at Docket No. 783.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    (1) The UTC Motion to Reconsider and to Reopen Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In the UTC Motion to Reconsider and Reopen Evidence, the UTC ask the Court to admit new evidence with respect to three members of the UTC who underwent surgeries not involving PDA to show that Dr. Schlicht was the lead physician performing surgery and to reopen the evidence to show that a fourth UTC member underwent the PDA procedure. The UTC also ask the Court to reconsider its ruling affecting eight members of the UTC that the PDA procedure would not have been stopped until September 21, 2007. Those eight members of the UTC underwent procedures prior to September 21, 2007. QHR opposes the UTC Motion to Reconsider and Reopen Evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Quorum Health Resources, LLC's Response to UTC Motion for Reconsideration and/or Relief from Judgment and Motion to Reopen Evidence at Docket No. 637. The Court heard oral argument on the UTC Motion to Reconsider and Reopen Evidence on June 19, 2017 and took the matter under advisement. For reasons explained below, the Court will grant the UTC Motion to Reconsider and Reopen Evidence only with respect to Thomas T. Sullivan and his spouse and otherwise deny motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    (2) The Zuniga Evidence Cross-Motions for Reconsideration\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   After the UTC filed the UTC Motion to Reconsider and Reopen Evidence, the parties filed cross-motions for reconsideration based on newly discovered evidence from Dr. Zuniga.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Scheduling Order at Docket No. 733. In its cross-motion the UTC ask the Court to reconsider three issues in light of this newly discovered evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTC Zuniga Evidence Motion at Docket No. 720. First, the UTC ask the Court to change the date by which the Schlicht surgeries would have stopped following the CEO's receipt of the Masel Letter. Second, the UTC ask the Court to apply joint and several liability instead of comparative\n   fault. Third, the UTC ask the Court to increase the apportionment of fault attributed to QHR. QHR opposes the UTC Zuniga Evidence Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Quorum Health Resources, LLC's Opposition to the UTC's Motion to Amend and/or for Reconsideration of Order and Memorandum Opinion Regarding Comparative Fault and Causation at Docket No. 742.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The QHR Zuniga Evidence Motion also asks the Court to reconsider its rulings on causation and apportionment of fault.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   at Docket No. 743. QHR asks the Court to apply a subjective standard in determining causation and to dismiss the claims against QHR for a lack of causation. In the alternative, QHR asks the Court to reduce the apportionment of fault to QHR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Court held an evidentiary hearing on the Zuniga Evidence Cross-Motions on December 6, 2017 and took the matter under advisement. The evidence admitted at that hearing is admitted for all purposes in the Adversary Proceedings. For reasons explained below, the Court will grant in part the UTC Zuniga Evidence Motion with respect to admitting new evidence and with respect to the time by which Dr. Schlicht's procedures would have been stopped and otherwise will deny the UTC Zuniga Evidence Motion. The Court will deny the QHR Zuniga Evidence Motion, except for admitting new evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    (3) The UTC Defense Counsel Misconduct Motion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Last, the Court will consider the UTC Defense Counsel Misconduct Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 783. The UTC ask the Court to reconsider applying joint and several liability or to increase QHR's apportionment of fault based on their allegation of misconduct on the part of QHR's defense counsel. QHR opposes the UTC Defense Counsel Misconduct Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Quorum Health Resources, LLC's Brief in Response to the UTC's Motion to Reopen Evidence Regarding Apportionment of Liability and the Application of Joint and Several Liability, Based on QHR's Alleged Collusion and Joint Defense with GCRMC at Docket No. 797. The Court held an evidentiary hearing on the UTC Defense Counsel Misconduct Motion on January 5, 2018 and took the matter under advisement.

The exemplary program, really top notch, pain management is basically the diagnosis and treatment of pain states. And the diagnosis and treatment of pain states takes the form of A, imaging, okay-history, imaging, and diagnostic injections, therapeutic injections, and then pain interventions. Okay? That scope has been expanded from the standpoint of simply putting in spinal stimulators and pumps to doing percutaneous intervention called kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty in the treatment of vertebral compression fractures. So I, myself, representative of a company, Medtronic, and another company, I forgot the name of which at this time taught anesthesiologists how to put tubes through the percutaneous, through the back into the vertebral body-the robust portion of the spine to basically expand, if you will, okay that fracture which creates a wedge. And the-Your Honor, can appreciate what that is. You've seen commercials for osteoporosis where the women, through age, they go like this, and those are wedge compression fractures. There's a large controversy as to whether you need balloon arthroplasty or just inside tubes, but the poignant fact is they're capable of doing that. I draw the line, very simply between the surgery made necessary, because anytime you do an intervention that you cut the skin, which is pain intervention in some form or fashion, putting in an implant like a stimulator or a pump, you're cutting the skin, but you're nowhere near the spine. You're nowhere near the nerve roots. You're not doing any of those things. That's the purview of specialty training, which in my case was six years. And other people's cases of six or seven years. So that's really the difference\n   from that standpoint. I hope that give you the information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Phase I, Testimony of Dr. Rashbaum, p. 59, line 16 through page 61, line 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Dr. Rashbaum's testimony supports a finding that Dr. Schlicht performed procedures on members of the UTC that he was not qualified to do, and that the PDA procedure he performed was not appropriate. From this the UTC would have the Court conclude that any time Dr. Schlicht participated in a surgical procedure for which he was not qualified, the UTC have established causation. And because Dr. Harvie's report indicates that Dr. Schlicht participated in the non-PDA procedures performed on Mr. Durden, Ms. Crawford, and Mr. Guerrero, the UTC assert that they have established causation for those UTC members. The Court is not persuaded that it should change its ruling based on this testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The UTC had the burden to prove that QHR's breach of duty in failing to request a focused review of Dr. Schlicht caused each member of the UTC harm. Dr. Rashbaum's testimony is insufficient evidence to establish causation with respect to individual members of the UTC who had a non-PDA procedure. Dr. Bryant was a trained surgeon. Dr. Rashbaum did not testify that Dr. Schlicht performed surgery outside the scope of his qualification in any of the non-PDA procedures in which Dr. Bryant was lead surgeon and Dr. Schlicht assisted Dr. Bryant. Instead, Dr. Rashbaum gave generalized testimony regarding Dr. Schlicht's qualifications and the inappropriateness of his performing any type of surgery. As explained below, the evidence the UTC have offered to demonstrate that Dr. Schlicht acted as the lead physician for the non-PDA procedures performed on Ms. Crawford, Mr. Durden, and Mr. Guerrero is inconclusive. Thus, the UTC's alternative argument that seeks to establish causation as to Ms. Crawford, Mr. Durden, and Mr. Guerrero based on Dr. Rushbaum's testimony fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <em>\n    (3) Whether the Court Should Reopen the Evidence to Admit Additional Exhibits\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The UTC ask the Court to reopen the evidence to offer the following additional exhibits in support of the claim of Mr. Sullivan that he underwent a procedure involving PDA and the claims of Mr. Guerrero, Mr. Durden, and Ms. Crawford that Dr. Schlicht was the lead surgeon for the procedures they underwent:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    Table 3: The UTC's proffered evidence for the UTC Members QHR sought to dismiss for lack of evidence\n   </strong>\n   The Court finds that the evidence should be reopened with respect to Mr. Sullivan to admit the January 23, 2008 Operative/Procedure Report attached to Docket No. 629 at Exhibit A. The timing of the request to reopen, made shortly after the completion of Phase II but before the entry of a final order, is reasonable and weighs in favor of reopening the evidence. The additional evidence the UTC seek to offer with respect to Mr. Sullivan conclusively establishes that he underwent a PDA procedure that the Court determined in Phase II caused harm. Allowing the UTC to reopen the evidence for this limited purpose will not unduly prejudice QHR. Indeed QHR concedes that this additional evidence demonstrates that Mr. Sullivan had a PDA procedure. In fairness, the Court will allow the UTC to reopen the evidence to offer a single exhibit to establish that Mr. Sullivan underwent a PDA procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   However, the evidence should be not reopened with respect to the claims of Mr. Guerrero, Mr. Durden, and Ms. Crawford to admit the newly proffered documentary evidence that purports to show that Dr. Schlicht was the lead physician for the procedures they underwent. Although the documentary evidence UTC proffers suggests that Dr. Schlicht was the lead physician, QHR points to other documentary evidence that suggests Dr. Schlicht was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   the lead physician. If the Court reopened the evidence to admit UTC's proffered documentary evidence, the Court would also reopen the evidence to admit the documentary evidence QHR proffered in response to UTC's motion. The Court would then find the evidence to\n   be inconclusive regarding whether Dr. Schlicht or Dr. Bryant was the lead physician performing surgery and conclude that the UTC had not satisfied its burden of proof with respect to the claims of Mr. Guerrero, Ms. Crawford and Mr. Durden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   QHR points to several documents that contradict the UTC's proffered evidence of who acted as lead physician in performing a non-PDA procedure on Mr. Guerrero, Ms. Crawford, and Mr. Durden. For example, QHR attached a copy of the Operative/Procedure Report dated September 16, 2008 for a procedure performed on Frank Guerrero reflecting Dr. Bryant as \"surgeon\" and Dr. Schlicht as \"assistant.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 637 at Ex. C. As to Ms. Crawford, QHR attached a copy of the Operative/Procedure Report dated June 19, 2008 reflecting Dr. Bryant as \"surgeon\" and Dr. Schlicht as \"assistant.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 637 at Ex. G.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Mr. Durden is the most problematic. The UTC proffer an Operative/Procedure Report that identifies Dr. Schlicht as the primary surgeon with no assistant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 629 at Ex. G. The UTC also proffer a Surgical Services Report that identifies Dr. Bryant as \"Surgeon-Other.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4328707\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/308/410/#p435\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The surgical procedure identified in the Operative/Procedures Report is \"Left L5-S1 hemilaminectomy, discectomy.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 629 at Ex. F. The Surgical Services Report similarly identifies the \"actual procedure\" as \"Lumbar Discectomy L5/S1 Lt. Side.\" Docket No. 629 at Ex. G. QHR offers contradictory evidence in the form of a patient consent form dated 6/26/08 authorizing Dr. Bryant to perform a \"lumbar discectomy lumbar five-sacral one left side\" and a discharge summary for the procedure performed on 6/26/08 showing only Dr. Bryant as the treating physician.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 637 at Ex. D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   From the conflicting evidence, it is possible to infer that Dr. Bryant performed the procedure even though the Operative Report identifies Dr. Schlicht as the primary surgeon, because the consent form authorized Dr. Bryant to perform the procedure described in the Surgical Services Report as the \"actual procedure.\" QHR also direct the Court's attention to testimony from Dr. Bryant which suggests that he was present and participated in the procedure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 637 at Ex. G.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Because the newly proffered documentary evidence is inconclusive regarding whether Dr. Schlicht or Dr. Bryant was the lead physician who performed surgery on Mr. Guerrero, Ms. Crawford and Mr. Durden, and UTC bears the burden of proof on that issue, admitting the new evidence would not change the Court's decision with respect to the claims of these UTC members. The Court will therefore deny the UTC Motion to Reconsider and Reopen Evidence insofar as it asks the Court to reopen the evidence with respect to the claims of Mr. Guerrero, Ms. Crawford, and Mr. Durden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <em>\n    (4) Whether the Court Should Reconsider the September 21, 2007 cutoff date based on testimony of Dr. Pollard and Mr. Heckert\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The UTC ask the Court to reconsider the finding that a focused review would have been completed by September 21, 2007 based on testimony from Dr. Pollard and Mr. Heckert admitted during the Phase II trial. The UTC argue that this testimony shows the PDA procedure would have been suspended on July 21, 2007 pending the outcome of the focused review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The UTC point to no new evidence on this issue as their basis for the Court to reconsider its finding. Instead, the UTC rely on the testimony from Dr. Pollard and Mr. Jim Heckert about what happened\n   after patients experienced complications from the PDA procedure in 2008 to argue there was sufficient evidence before the Court that had the CEO timely requested the MEC to conduct a focused review of Dr. Schlicht on receipt of the Masel Letter, the PDA procedure would have immediately been stopped on July 21, 2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Dr. Pollard and Mr. Heckart testified regarding the need for immediate suspension of the PDA procedure after patients were complaining of complications in 2008. Dr. Pollard recalled stating, \"Hey, you guys need to put a hold on this until we figure out what is going on.\" William Pollard, M.D. Dep. 13:4-5, Jan. 22, 2015 (\"Pollard Dep.\"). Dr. Pollard also determined along with Mr. Heckert, the GCRMC CEO in 2008, that \"this has to stop until we get an outside evaluation of what the hell is going on.\" Pollard Dep. 13:23-25. As CEO, Mr. Heckert immediately suspended the PDA procedure in 2008.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   In July 2007, no patients were complaining and the complications from the PDA procedure had not yet surfaced. The Court is not persuaded by evidence of what Dr. Pollard and Mr. Heckert believed and did once complications from the PDA became known to establish what would have occurred in July 2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The UTC also argue that because the Hospital's medical staff bylaws allow a non-physician CEO to immediately suspend privileges and because Dr. Masel's assertions against Dr. Schlicht were so serious, an immediate suspension pending the outcome of a focused review would have occurred. The UTC again point to Dr. Pollard's and Mr. Heckert's testimony to establish that it was more likely than not that the Hospital would have put an immediate stop to the PDA procedure pending completion of the focused review. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Article VI, Section 6.6.A of the Medical Staff Bylaws of Gerald Champion Regional Medical Center (\"Medical Staff Bylaws\") effective as of July 2007 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   The Chief of Staff, the Vice Chief of staff when acting for the Chief of Staff, the MEC, the Chief of Department of which the affected medical Staff member is a member, or the President and CEO is empowered to restrict or suspend summarily without benefit of a hearing or personal appearance any or all privileges of a member of the Medical staff\n   <em>\n    if there is cause to believe that the Medical Staff member's conduct requires that immediate action be taken to protect the life of any patient or to reduce the likelihood of imminent danger to the health or safety of any individual\n   </em>\n   . (emphasis added).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The Court already weighed the evidence presented in Phase II and expressly found that there was insufficient evidence from which the Court would infer that the MEC would have suspended Dr. Schlicht's or Dr. Bryant's privileges to perform the PDA procedure or any other procedure pending the outcome of a focused review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Otero Phase II\n   </em>\n   at *17. The UTC did not call a single member of the MEC to testify about what it would have done had Mr. Richardson requested a focused review. The Court found further that \"[t]he CEO could not summarily suspend Dr. Schlicht's privileges pending the outcome of the focused review\" because \"doing so would require a medical judgment the CEO could not make.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4328707\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/308/410/#p435\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The UTC urge that immediate suspension does not require medical judgment\n   because the Medical Staff Bylaws only require that the CEO have \"cause to believe that the Medical Staff member's conduct requires that immediate action be taken to protect the life of any patient or to reduce the likelihood of imminent danger to the health or safety of any individual.\" However, the Court found that in the circumstances existing at the time suspending Dr. Schlicht's privileges to perform the PDA procedure pending the outcome of the focused review would have required medical judgment regarding the propriety of the PDA procedure itself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Otero Phase I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4041214\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/527/719/#p726\">\n    527 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   734 and 751.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   During Phase II, the Court heard how the then CEO of the hospital, Mr. Richardson, met with senior medical staff at the Hospital other than Dr. Bryant and Dr. Schlicht following his review of Dr. Schlicht's letter to discuss the matter contained in the letter. Mr. Richardson met with Dr. Jones, Chair of the Credentials Committee and Dr. Austin, Vice-President of Medical Affairs. Mr. Richardson spoke with Dr. Bryant, who was the Chief of Staff and performing the PDA procedure alongside Dr. Schlicht. Mr. Richardson also reviewed Dr. Schlicht's privileging and credentials file. Mr. Richardson was convinced that the matters addressed in the letter reflected a business dispute between doctors and did not pose a threat to patients. At that time, there were no patient complaints about the PDA procedure or Dr. Schlicht, and patients undergoing the procedure were generally pleased. Mr. Richardson was a highly experienced, competent hospital CEO. Under the circumstances existing on July 21, 2007 only a qualified physician could make a judgment that Dr. Schlicht's \"conduct require[d] that immediate action be taken to protect the life of any patient or to reduce the likelihood of imminent danger to the health or safety of any individual\" as required by the Medical Bylaw to summarily suspend the PDA procedure at the Hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   In sum, in the UTC Motion to Reconsider and Reopen Evidence, the UTC have presented no new evidence in support of their request that the Court reconsider the September 21, 2007 cutoff date. The Court has already considered the evidence the UTC assert establishes that the PDA procedure would have (or should have) stopped pending the outcome of the focused review. The Court found to the contrary. Evidence of what Dr. Pollard and what Dr. Heckert did after serious complications from the PDA procedure became known fails to establish what a MEC, CEO, or hospital board, or even GCRMC's MEC or board without knowledge of any complications from the PDA procedure, would have done pending the outcome of a focused review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   When the Court has thoroughly analyzed the very points a party requests the Court to revisit, the Court need not engage in revising its earlier decision.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson Living,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4328707\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/308/410/#p435\">\n    308 F.R.D. at 433-434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (observing that a court can refuse to entertain a motion to reconsider, and suggesting that the court \"should restrict its review of a motion to reconsider a prior ruling in proportion to how thoroughly the earlier ruling addressed the specific findings or conclusions that the motion to reconsider challenges.\"). In this motion the UTC ask the Court for a second bite at the apple, which the Court will not allow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Phase II of this litigation determining causation and comparative fault addressed the timing of the two breaches of duty the Court found following Phase I of the trial. The UTCs' arguments in the UTC Motion to Reconsider and Reopen Evidence are the essentially same arguments the Court previously considered and rejected in determining that the PDA procedure would not have been suspended on July 21, 2007\n   pending the outcome of the focused review. Therefore the Court denies the request for reconsideration in the UTC Motion to Reconsider and Reopen Evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    The UTC and QHR cross-motions for reconsideration based on newly discovered evidence from Robert Zuniga, M.D.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The Court will now consider the cross-motions for reconsideration based on the new evidence from Dr. Zuniga and other related new evidence. At the evidentiary hearing on the cross-motions, the Court admitted Dr. Robert Zuniga's, Monica Arrowsmith's, and Pamela Kushmaul's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   At the oral argument held June 19, 2017, the UTC stated that Dr. Zuniga, a treating physician for one or more of the UTC members in the damages trials, recently gave deposition testimony that could affect the Court's earlier decisions. Believing that Dr. Zuniga's testimony might be privileged under the Review Organization Immunity Act (\"ROIA\"), the parties suspended questioning Dr. Zuniga about those matters to give GCRMC the opportunity to assert the ROIA privilege. GCRMC asserted the privilege pending its investigation into the applicability of the privilege.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 660. GCRMC ultimately dropped its claim the ROIA privilege due to a lack of supporting evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order Determining that the Review Organization Immunity Act Privilege is Inapplicable at Docket No. 731.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   After further discovery the UTC and QHR filed the Zuniga Evidence Cross-Motions for reconsideration. The newly discovered evidence includes Dr. Zuniga's testimony regarding his review of patient records and his conversations with a female administrator at GCRMC in 2007 concerning Dr. Schlicht and the propriety of the PDA procedure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 720, &amp; Docket No. 743. The newly discovered evidence also includes testimony by Senior Vice President, Quality, Legal and Regulatory Compliance, Monica Arrowsmith and by Pamela Kushmaul, counsel for GCRMC. The Court held an evidentiary hearing on the Zuniga Evidence Cross-Motions on December 6, 2017, admitted the testimony of Dr. Zuniga, Ms. Arrowsmith and Ms. Kushmaul, and took the matter under advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   In the UTC Zuniga Evidence Motion, the UTC ask the Court to reconsider the following: (1) the date by which the Schlicht procedures would or should have been stopped; (2) applying joint and several liability instead of comparative fault; and (3) the apportionment of fault attributed to QHR. The QHR Zuniga Evidence Motion asks the Court to apply a subjective standard in determining causation and dismiss the claims against QHR for a lack of causation. In the alternative, QHR asks the Court to reduce its apportionment of fault. As discussed below, the Court will not change its ruling based on the Zuniga Evidence Cross-Motions on the application of joint and several liability, the apportionment of fault, or causation, except with respect to the length of time needed to conduct a focused review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <em>\n    (1) The evidence is too inconclusive for the Court to make any finding regarding whether Dr. Zuniga spoke with Sue Johnson-Phillippe or a female administrator on the Hospital medical staff\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   The UTC ask the Court to find that Dr. Zuniga spoke with Sue Johnson-Phillippe,\n   the QHR-employed CEO at the Hospital, when he told a female administrator at the Hospital that the PDA procedure was dangerous and should be immediately stopped. QHR counters that Dr. Zuniga did not speak to Sue Johnson-Phillippe, and asks the Court to find that Dr. Zuniga had this conversation with a female administrator on medical side of the Hospital. If Dr. Zuniga spoke with Sue Johnson-Phillippe in July 2007 it could result in the Court changing its ruling that joint and several liability does not apply. If Dr. Zuniga spoke with a female administrator on the Hospital medical staff, it could result in the Court apportioning more fault to the Hospital. The Court finds the evidence too inconclusive to make either inference. It is simply unclear whom Dr. Zuniga spoke to at the Hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Dr. Zuniga was deposed as a treating physician for one of the UTC members in preparation for the Phase III damages trials.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Zuniga Dep. 5:16-8:12, Jun. 8, 2017 (\"First Zuniga Dep.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   The First Zuniga Dep. testimony was admitted in evidence.

Dr. Zuniga could not remember whether he spoke with the Hospital CEO or someone else, and his memory was vague regarding the time in 2007 when the conversations occurred. The conversation occurred nearly ten years before Dr. Zuniga was asked about it in the deposition. Dr. Zuniga did not keep any notes or other records of the conversation, any of the charts he reviewed, or any other records to refresh his recollection about with whom he spoke or when. Further discovery by the parties did not fill in these gaps.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   The Court has evidence that the female administrators who then worked o on the Hospital medical staff, namely Monica Arrowsmith, Jodi Duprez, Diana Green Mary Harding, Monica Contreras, Sharon McCoy, Dianna Melendrez, and Ellen Skrak do not recall an informal review of the PDA procedure or sending any records to Dr. Zuniga.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kushmaul Dep. 11:16-19:6, Nov. 9, 2017 (\"First Kushmaul Dep.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   Ms. Johnson-Phillippe left the Hospital in mid-July 2007. Dr. Zuniga initially testified in late 2017 that his conversation with the female administrator \"was probably mid to late 2007,\" Second Zuniga Dep. 6:1, and when pressed later testified \"I want to say late-I want to say late 2007.\" Second Zuniga Dep. 33:12-13. When asked \"November, December?\" he responded \"I couldn't tell you,\" and then when asked again he said \"Yeah, somewhere in there.\" Second Zuniga Dep. 33:14-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   Neither party deposed Ms. Johnson-Phillippe or called her as a witness regarding the event about which Dr. Zuniga's testified.

Even though the UTC could have taken Ms. Johnson-Phillippe's deposition during discovery on their own behalf, the UTC did not receive\n   adequate notice of QHR's intent to offer the SJP Affidavit at the hearing to have a fair opportunity to meet it. And because Ms. Johnson-Phillippe did not appear to testify at the hearing in person, the UTC were not able to cross-examine her regarding the statements contained in the SJP Affidavit. The Court will, therefore, exclude the SJP Affidavit from evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   Other avenues to identify the female administrator were fruitless despite diligent efforts by counsel for GCRMC to track down any physical evidence. The Hospital's records from the audit system for copying or printing patient charts were damaged and cannot be accessed to identify who copied the records to send to Dr. Zuniga.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jason Clay Judah Dep. 9:7-21:14, Nov. 21, 2017.

H at pp. 11-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   The UTC argue the new evidence shows the QHR employed CEO, Sue Johnson-Phillippe was the only individual at the Hospital that had access to the medical records, an incentive to inquire about the procedure, and the means to bury any evidence of Dr. Zuniga's informal chart review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 720. They urge the Court to infer that Dr. Zuniga spoke with Sue Johnson-Phillippe before she was terminated on July 13, 2007 and ask the Court to hold that the PDA procedures should have been stopped by July 13, 2007. The evidence does not support these requested findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   Because the new evidence fails to establish that Dr. Zuniga ever spoke with Sue Johnson-Phillippe, the Court declines to apply joint and several liability or increase the apportionment of fault to QHR. Likewise, because the new evidence fails to establish that Dr. Zuniga spoke with a female administrator on the Hospital medical staff, the Court will not grant QHR's request to reapportion a greater percentage of fault to the Hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   <em>\n    (2) The new evidence provides further support for the Court's finding that the MEC would have conducted a focused review and stopped the PDA procedure if Mr. Richardson had a focused review.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   QHR argues that the new evidence from Dr. Zuniga shows the GCRMC MEC would not have acted to suspend the PDA procedure even if the interim CEO, Mr. Richardson, had requested a focused review. QHR reasons that because the PDA procedures were not stopped in 2007 when Dr. Zuniga told a female administrator at the Hospital that the PDA procedure was dangerous and should be stopped, such evidence of what in fact happened is the best evidence of what the MEC would have done had Mr. Richardson asked it to perform a focused review. The Court disagrees. The Court has declined to make a finding that Dr. Zuniga spoke with a female administrator on the Hospital medical staff because the new evidence is too inconclusive to make that inference. The Court further declines to find that the MEC was aware of Dr. Zuniga's conversations with a female administrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   The testimony of Ms. Arrowsmith and Dr. Zuniga, admitted in evidence at the hearing on the Zuniga Evidence Cross-Motions, provides further support for the Court's findings that had Mr. Richardson made a formal request of the MEC to\n   conduct a focused review of Dr. Schlicht performing the PDA procedure, the MEC would have done so, would have engaged an independent outside reviewer, and would have stopped the PDA procedure after learning of the reviewer's conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   Monica Arrowsmith, R.N., M.S.N., J.D. was employed by the Hospital during the relevant time period as the Hospital's Senior Vice President, Quality, Legal and Regulatory Compliance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition to her nursing credentials, Ms. Arrowsmith also has a juris doctor degree. She was an administrator on the Hospital medical staff. She testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-205\">\n   So a typical process and I don't remember this specifically for Gerald Champion, but a typical process is ... if the Medical Executive Committee feels like we need outside peer review for one or two reasons, one if there's no other specialist available who would have the qualifications to review it, because sometimes there's a single specialty or no one else has that same set of privileges. Or if they feel like sometimes they just need outside expertise for a variety of reasons, political, dynamics, whatever, sometimes you just want to go get a third opinion ... then there are organizations and agencies that actually have medical review panels available for outside review. And so typically, you would send those through an existing agency because they sort of vetted their people, they have the qualifications, they have the insurance protection, et cetera ... what happens is they then issue a formal report, that then the Medical Executive Committee or if it's been delegated to a peer review committee reviews and then determines what steps they need to take after that, if any ... If I were doing it, I would just go to one of my go-to agencies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   Arrowsmith Dep. 17:11-19:8, Nov. 15, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   The Hospital had no specialist in-house with the qualifications to review the PDA procedure, other than Dr. Bryant and Dr. Schlicht who were performing the procedure. The nature of the assertion by Dr. Schlicht's outside proctor, charged with reviewing his performance, that Dr. Schlicht was performing experimental surgery certainly would have prompted the MEC to seek an outside opinion had the CEO of the Hospital made a formal written request of the MEC to conduct a focused review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   Robert Zuniga, M.D. specializes in anesthesiology and pain management. In 2007 he was an assistant professor and served as the Director of Pain Management Services at the University of New Mexico Hospital.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 358 at \u00b6 2. In this capacity he was responsible for training the anesthesiology residents and the pain management fellows.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Zuniga Dep. 7:4-10. In his role, he received calls from attorneys, administrators, and companies regarding pain management. Second Zuniga Dep. 46:19-47:1. When Dr. Zuniga reviewed the PDA procedure taking place at GCRMC, Dr. Zuniga concluded after reviewing only a few of the 12 to 15 patient charts he was given that the procedure was dangerous and should be stopped immediately.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is almost inconceivable\n   that the MEC would not have suspended the procedure immediately if presented with such a conclusion by an outside expert such as Dr. Zuniga as part of a focused review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   QHR argues in its cross-motion that the Court should have applied a subjective standard to evaluate whether the GCRMC MEC would have conducted a focused review upon the request of the CEO, and if it had done so, to determine whether the MEC would have stopped the PDA procedure. QHR argues that the best evidence of what the MEC would have done is what it actually did after Dr. Zuniga completed his review, which was to allow the PDA procedure to continue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   Regardless of whether the Court were to apply an objective or subjective standard, the Court's decision on this issue would be the same. The fact that GCRMC MEC did not act following the completion of Dr. Zuniga's review does not show what the MEC would have done had it been aware of Dr. Zuniga's conclusions. The Court has found the evidence too inconclusive to determine whether Dr. Zuniga reported his conclusions to Sue Johnson-Phillippe or to a female administrator on the Hospital medical staff. The evidence does not show that the MEC was aware of Dr. Zuniga's conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   In addition, based on the testimony at trial and the additional testimony from Monica Arrowsmith and Dr. Zuniga described above, the Court finds (a) that the GCRMC MEC, as well as any medical executive committee acting responsibly, would have conducted a focused review had the CEO of the Hospital made a formal written request that it conduct the review based on the information contained in Dr. Schlicht's response to the Masel Letter;\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   (b) after receiving the CEO's formal written request for it to conduct a focused review of the PDA procedure being performed at the Hospital, the MEC would have conducted a focused review and as part of the review would have sought an outside opinion regarding the PDA procedure Dr. Schlicht was performing at the Hospital; and (c) the MEC would have stopped the PDA procedure upon the outside reviewer reporting his or her conclusions to the MEC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   <em>\n    (3) Based on the new evidence, the Court will revise its ruling regarding how long it would have taken the MEC to suspend the PDA procedure had Mr. Richardson asked the MEC to conduct a focused review.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   Based on the new evidence from Dr. Zuniga and Ms. Arrowsmith, the Court will revise its previous ruling that the PDA procedure would have stopped by September 21, 2007 had Mr. Richardson requested the MEC to conduct a focused review and\n   reported the matter to the Hospital board or the executive committee of the board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   In the Phase II trial, Mr. Michael Peterson testified that a medical executive committee's focused review process, where outside expertise is required, can be done in a matter of days, or it can take months particularly if more than one outside reviewer is engaged and literature searches are needed. Mr. Peterson's best estimate of how long it would have taken the GCRMC MEC to conduct a focused review of the PDA procedure was two months. The Court previously found that if the MEC had conducted a focused review of the PDA procedure at Mr. Richardson's request it would have taken 60 days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   Based on Dr. Zuniga's and Monica' Arrowsmith's testimony summarized above, the Court now finds that an outside reviewer engaged by the MEC would have come to the same conclusions as Dr. Zuniga after reviewing only a few patient charts and without conducting a literature search and would have promptly communicated those conclusions to the MEC. The Court also finds that upon receiving the report from the outside reviewer that the PDA procedure was dangerous and should be stopped immediately, the GCRMC MEC would have immediately put a stop to the PDA procedure pending the outcome of a further investigation. The Court finds that the MEC would have suspended the PDA no later than two weeks (fourteen days) after the request was made of the MEC to conduct a focused review:\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   by August 4, 2007.

The UTC argue that the misconduct and tainted evidence warrants the imposition of joint and several liability on QHR because the UTC was and is prejudiced in proving joint and several liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   More specifically, the UTC allege that counsel for QHR and GCRMC secretly colluded in: (a) foisting fault onto the Hospital (who had settled) by allowing QHR to point the finger at the Hospital medical staff; (b) conducting a coordinated collective trial strategy and undisclosed joint defense strategy; (c) manipulating witnesses; (d) acting together to fail to produce documents and evidence to the UTC while sharing that information between themselves; (e) acting together to give QHR greater access to witnesses than to the UTC; and (f) engaging in other misconduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supplemental Motion to Amend and/or for Reconsideration, Docket No. 783 at pp. 2-3 and UTC's corrected Brief in support of the Misconduct Motion, filed December 1, 2017 and December 4, 2017, Docket No. 784 (hereinafter the \"Brief in Support.\"). The UTC assert further that as part of a cover up counsel for QHR knowingly kept silent while counsel for the Hospital lied in a deposition on November 9, 2017 about the meetings she had with Mr. Klecan and the number of number of e-mails she exchanged with counsel for QHR. The UTC allege that QHR's collusion with GCRMC was willful\n   and deliberate and done with full knowledge that it was improper.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Nos. 783 &amp; 784.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   QHR counters that: (1) all communications between counsel for GCRMC and counsel for QHR were ethically sound; (2) QHR's litigation strategy to limit its liability by blaming the Hospital was apparent from the start of litigation; (3) the UTC had the same access to witnesses but did not take advantage of informal discovery opportunities; (4) all but two documents in question were produced by GCRMC to UTC and the documents the UTC did not receive were cumulative; (5) and to QHR's counsel's knowledge, Ms. Kushmaul testified truthfully at the deposition about the number of e-mails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   <em>\n    (1) The Court will look to Rule 60(b)(3) for guidance in deciding the UTC Defense Counsel Misconduct Motion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   The UTC Defense Counsel Misconduct Motion is analytically distinct from the other motions to reconsider. The UTC complain of unfair litigation tactics and unethical conduct by defense counsel. The UTC ask the Court to consider new evidence relating to this alleged attorney misconduct and apply joint and several liability on the ground that because of the misconduct the UTC was unable to fully and fairly present their case and the evidence was tainted.

She was subsequently deposed about to her efforts to investigate the applicability of the ROIA privilege to Dr. Zuniga's testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Kushmaul Dep.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   The UTC contend that at the deposition Ms. Kushmaul intentionally-for the purpose of concealing the collusion between QHR and GCRMC-gave false testimony. The UTC contend Ms. Kushmaul lied when she testified: (1) that there were less than ten e-mails between counsel for QHR and counsel for the UTC, although, in fact, there were at least 547 e-mails; and (2) that she had no meetings with Mr. Klecan (counsel for QHR), whereas, in fact, there were many. The UTC contend further that Mr. Klecan's knowing failure to correct the false testimony is further evidence of the QHR and GCRMC's collusion. In their Brief in Support, the UTC characterize the import of this deposition testimony and Mr. Klecan's silence as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-233\">\n   The strongest proof that QHR and GCRMC knew their collusion was improper is found in Ms. Kushmaul's testimony from her first deposition. As shown above, Ms. Kushmaul testified she had never had any meetings with Mr. Klecan.... The same motive explains why Ms. Kushmaul also chose not tell the truth about the fact that there were at least 547 e-mails-not 10-that were sent between her and counsel for QHR....

After this deposition, John D.

Ms. Kushmaul's answer to the question posed to her about the number of meetings she had with Mr. Klecan was asked right after a question posed to her about the number of hours she spent with John Wheeler\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   about the investigation GCRMC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-271\">\n   conducted following Dr. Zuniga's testimony at his first deposition.

Similarly, Ms. Kushmaul's answer to the question posed to her about the number of e-mails she exchanged with anyone representing QHR specifically references \"the investigation\" the Hospital conducted following Dr. Zuniga's first deposition and about which she had just testified at length.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-272\">\n   The Court finds Ms. Kushmaul's deposition testimony, and Mr. Klecan not correcting that testimony, does not show any attorney misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-273\">\n   <em>\n    (b) Alleged efforts by GCRMC to give QHR greater access to fact witnesses\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-274\">\n   The UTC complain that the e-mails show QHR was given greater access to fact witnesses for informal interviews and preparation for trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 784. The bulk of the e-mails in evidence relate to scheduling informal interviews, depositions, or trial preparation for fact witnesses who are associated with the Hospital. The evidence suggests that counsel for GCRMC made the fact witnesses available to the UTC as well as to QHR. The following e-mail exchange between Mr. Klecan and Ms. Kushmaul addresses the UTC's and QHR's access to Hospital employed witnesses to conduct informal interviews:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-275\">\n   <strong>\n    Mr. Klecan:\n   </strong>\n   Here is their witness list for the next phase. Pam, have they talked to you about any of these?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-276\">\n   <strong>\n    Ms. Kushmaul:\n   </strong>\n   They have not talked to me, but they did ask to meet with John [Wheeler] last Thursday and asked him for assistance getting to the MEC members. He told them that to the degree we assist in making witnesses available to QHR we would make them available to the UTC. Grieg [Coates] said, \"Well, you didn't last time\" to which John said, \"we made them available for one interview but when you began asking for 2 and 3 we did not.\" Vic [Poulous] was trying to be the peacemaker and agreed with John on that point.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-277\">\n   Ex. 337 at p. 611. Neither party presented testimony from the Hospital's counsel, John Wheeler. There is no evidence that QHR directed or encouraged counsel for the Hospital to limit the UTC's informal discovery or impede its access to fact witnesses. There is also no evidence that the UTC ever took advantage of the Hospital's offer to make MEC members available for one interview each.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-278\">\n   The Court finds the evidence relating to access to witnesses does not show any attorney misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-279\">\n   <em>\n    (c) Alleged efforts by QHR to get Dr. Austin to falsify his testimony\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-280\">\n   The UTC strenuously argues that QHR's entreaty to Ms. Kushmaul to refresh Dr. Austin's recollection regarding his testimony about the Masel Letter is evidence of attorney misconduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit 337 at pp. 673-684. The UTC contend that \"refresh\" was code for \"manipulate.\" QHR asserts that it is not misconduct for it to go through GCRMC's counsel when trying to refresh a Hospital employed witness's recollection and that refreshing the recollection of a fact witness in preparation for trial is specifically contemplated in the Rules of Professional Responsibility. Because the Court does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   find that counsel for QHR or counsel for GCRMC did anything to assist or encourage Dr. Austin to testify falsely, the Court finds and concludes that the evidence relating to refreshing\n   Dr. Austin's recollection does not show any attorney misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-281\">\n   The Third Restatement of the Law Governing Lawyers \u00a7 116 states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-282\">\n   In preparing a witness to testify, a lawyer may invite the witness to provide truthful testimony favorable to the lawyer's client. Preparation consistent with the rule of this Section may include the following: discussing the role of the witness and effective courtroom demeanor; discussing the witness's recollection and probable testimony; revealing to the witness other testimony or evidence that will be presented and asking the witness to reconsider the witness's recollection or recounting of events in that light; discussing the applicability of law to the events in issue; reviewing the factual context into which the witness's observations or opinions will fit; reviewing documents or other physical evidence that may be introduced; and discussing probable lines of hostile cross-examination that the witness should be prepared to meet. Witness preparation may include rehearsal of testimony. A lawyer may suggest choice of words that might be employed to make the witness's meaning clear. However, a lawyer may not assist the witness to testify falsely as to a material fact.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-283\">\n   Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers \u00a7 116 (2000).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-284\">\n   The e-mails relating to refreshing Dr. Austin's recollection were sent because Dr. Austin had testified at the Phase I trial that he did not recall learning that Dr. Schlicht was performing experimental surgery, and QHR was hoping to refresh his recollection to the contrary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Otero Phase I,\n   </em>\n   at 750 (\"Dr. Austin was aware that Dr. Masel had raised some concerns about Dr. Schlicht's medical judgment, but he was not aware that Dr. Masel had accused Dr. Schlicht of performing experimental surgery. No one at the hospital ever told Dr. Austin that Dr. Schlicht was performing experimental surgery.\"). QHR's counsel sought to refresh Dr. Austin's recollection by asking GCRMC's counsel to show him a credentialing file unavailable to QHR because of a ROIA privilege, making Dr. Austin aware of certain trial testimony, and finding out what Dianna Melenedrez recalled and perhaps asking her to talk to Dr. Austin.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 337 at pp. 673-684.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-285\">\n   An attorney refreshing a witness's recollection in an effort to have a witness recall events more favorably to the attorney's client is not misconduct so long as counsel does not assist the witness to testify falsely as to a material fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers \u00a7 116 (2000). The evidence does not establish that counsel for QHR or counsel for GCRMC by attempting to refresh Dr. Austin's recollection were attempting to assist or encourage him to testify falsely. Nor did QHR's counsel do anything wrong by asking Ms. Kushmaul, the Hospital's lawyer, to refresh the recollection of a Hospital employee rather than doing so himself in an informal interview or deposition. The efforts by counsel for QHR and counsel for GCRMC to attempt to refresh Dr. Austin's recollection did not constitute attorney misconduct\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-286\">\n   <em>\n    (d) Alleged concealment of important documents\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-287\">\n   In regards to the documents produced, the UTC allege and argue at length in their Brief in Support that because of misconduct by QHR's counsel the UTC did not receive twenty-six important documents that GCRMC secretly provided to QHR, and that the concealment of the documents is further evidence of collusion between QHR and GCRMC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 786 at pp. 9-14. In its Response, QHR attaches e-mails showing that QHR sent\n   eighteen of the twenty-six documents to counsel for the UTC on March 3, 2014, well before the Phase I trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 797 at Ex. A. The UTC identified another document that it claimed it never received as UTC's Trial Exhibit 101. In their Reply filed December 20, 2017, the UTC never acknowledge their error in asserting that UTC did not receive twenty-six important documents, even though the UTC, in fact, received nineteen of those documents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 798.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-288\">\n   QHR has represented in open court that it did not receive four of the other seven documents and that another of the documents, contained in a locked file, had nothing to do with matters at issue in the Adversary Proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-289\">\n   That leaves two of the twenty six documents not yet accounted for. The UTC did not receive the GCRMC Pain Management 3-year Plan from 2006 or the GCRMC Pain Management 3-year Plan REVISED from 2006 (together, the \"Three Year Plans\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 784; and Exhibit No. 337 at pp. 270-273(referencing those documents). Although, a failure to provide documents in response to discovery requests can constitute misconduct under Rule 60(b)(3), Courts are reluctant to apply Rule 60(b)(3) when there is no specific discovery request or order compelling production of the document.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zurich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8920720\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/426/1281/#p1290\">\n    426 F.3d at 1290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The UTC had served GCRMC (but not QHR) with a request for production that was broad enough to cover the Three Year Plans. GCRMC produced the final version of the Three Year Plans, entitled \"Pain Management Physician Economic Model 3 Year Plan\" to the UTC but did not produce the underlying documents used in its creation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 359. QHR did not send the Three Year Plans to the UTC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-290\">\n   There is no evidence that counsel for QHR encouraged the Hospital to withhold the documents or was aware that the UTC had not received the documents from GCRMC. Given the thousands of pages of exhibits before the Court, it is conceivable that GCRMC inadvertently failed to produce the Three Year Plans to the UTC. Certainly, QHR's failure to send these underlying documents to the UTC does not rise to the level of a deliberate plan or scheme to withhold evidence in this case, and the Court does not believe it was the result of attorney misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-291\">\n   <em>\n    (e) Alleged improper collusive litigation strategy\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-292\">\n   The UTC urge that QHR's misconduct also lay in a collusive effort between QHR and GCRMC to cast blame on the Hospital by manipulating witness testimony, concealing important documents from the UTC, and giving the QHR better access to interview Hospital employed witnesses informally. The Court does not believe QHR committed misconduct by advancing its litigation strategy to attribute liability to the Hospital or in connection with the cooperation GCRMC gave to QHR in QHR's preparation of its defense. As previously discussed, the Court has found no improper witness manipulation, concealment of documents, or unequal access to witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-293\">\n   In a case in which a court is applying the doctrine of comparative fault, defendants tend to cast blame on others, particularly other defendants who have settled. QHR's litigation strategy to place liability and blame on the Hospital and Drs. Bryant and Schlicht has been apparent since the beginning of this litigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-294\">\n   The UTC allege that the number of e-mails, the tone of the e-mails, and the access to witness and documents counsel for GCRMC gave to counsel for QHR, demonstrate misconduct in the form of a cooperative collusive conspiracy. The e-mails between counsel for GCRMC and counsel for QHR cover a variety of topics including: (1) scheduling witnesses who were associated with GCRMC for informal interviews, depositions, and witness preparation; (2) responses to formal and informal discovery requests; and (3) updates on the progress of the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit No. 337. The e-mails also show Ms. Kushmaul responded to formal discovery requests by e-mailing documents to QHR.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8920720\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/426/1281/#p1290\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The e-mails show that a friendly professional rapport existed between counsel for QHR and counsel for GCRMC. At times, counsel for GCRMC congratulates QHR's counsel on the Court's rulings and is enthusiastic about QHR's prospects in the case.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 337 at p. 545. The e-mails show that counsel for GCRMC was rooting for QHR's success in the context of the litigation and cooperated with QHR in connection with its preparation of its defense; however, that alone is not evidence of misconduct on the part QHR's counsel. The Court finds the evidence before the Court relating to litigation strategy and GCRMC's cooperation with QHR does not show any attorney misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-295\">\n   Overall, the UTC failed to meet its burden of showing that counsel for QHR engaged in any misconduct during the litigation. As the UTC did not prove misconduct, the Court will not reach the question of whether QHR's actions interfered with the UTC's ability to fully and fairly present their case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-296\">\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-297\">\n   The Court grants in part and denies in part the UTC Motion to Reconsider and Reopen Evidence. The Court will allow the UTC to reopen the evidence to offer one document that shows Mr. Sullivan had a PDA procedure and now finds that Mr. Sullivan underwent a PDA procedure. The Court will not allow the UTC to reopen the evidence in regards to the other plaintiffs whose claims are at issue in that motion. The Court will not revise its ruling to hold that the interim CEO should have summarily suspended the PDA procedure on July 21, 2007. The Court will enter a separate order consistent with this ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-298\">\n   The Court grants in part and denies in part the UTC Zuniga Evidence Motion. The Court reopens the evidence to admit the testimony of Dr. Zuniga, Monica Arrowsmith, and Pamela Kushmaul, and the other evidence admitted in evidence at the hearing. The Court does not admit the affidavit of Sue Johnson-Phillippe offered in evidence at the hearing. Based on Dr. Zuniga's testimony, the Court will revise the September 21, 2007 date by which the GCRMC would have stopped PDA procedure at the Hospital had Mr. Richardson asked the MEC to conduct a focused review of Dr. Schlicht performing the PDA procedure. The Court now holds the PDA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-299\">\n   procedure would have been stopped by August 4, 2007. As a result of this ruling the claims following plaintiffs at issue will not be denied based on the date the PDA procedure would have stopped: Annabelle Lindley and Jearl Lindley, M.D. (Adversary Proceeding No. 12-1205), Shirley Hubert (Adversary Proceeding No. 12-1210), Kathy J. Swope and Jimmy L. Swope (Adversary Proceeding No. 12-1243), William Rogers (Adversary Proceeding No. 12-1251), and Barbara Olson (Adversary Proceeding No. 12-1278). The Court will not revise its rulings regarding the application of comparative fault or the apportionment of fault to QHR. The Court will enter a separate order consistent with these rulings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-300\">\n   With respect to the QHR Zuniga Evidence Motion, the Court has admitted the new testimony from Dr. Zuniga, Monica Arrowsmith, and Pamela Kushmaul, and the other evidence admitted in evidence at the hearing. The Court does not admit the affidavit of Sue Johnson-Phillippe offered in evidence at the hearing. The Court has supplemented its findings and conclusions regarding what the GCRMC MEC would have done had Mr. Richardson requested a focused review. The Court will not otherwise revise its finding of causation and the Court will not revise its apportionment of fault to QHR. The Court will enter a separate order consistent with this ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-301\">\n   The Court denies the UTC Defense Counsel Misconduct Motion and will not revise its ruling regarding the applicability of the doctrine of comparative fault based on that motion.
