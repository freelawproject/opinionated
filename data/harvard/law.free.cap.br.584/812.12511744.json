Likewise, in looking at the Colliau's motion, and viewing the facts cited by the Trustee in a light most favorable to the non-movant (the Trustee), there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to the Colliaus' intent, and so the Colliaus' motion must be denied on this issue as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20548\">\n      11 U.S.C. \u00a7 548\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (a)(1)(B) -Received less than reasonably equivalent value\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The trustee can also recover transfers that were made for \"less than a reasonably equivalent value\" at a time when the debtor was insolvent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Colliaus admitted to insolvency, and so both briefs addressed the issue of reasonably equivalent value, and in particular the term \"value,\" which is defined as satisfaction of a present or antecedent debt of the debtor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Is an estimated tax payment a payment of \"present or antecedent debt,\" or is it a payment of future debt? If an estimated tax payment is a payment of an antecedent or present debt, then the transfer in satisfaction of the tax debt would be a dollar-for-dollar exchange, and would be for a reasonably equivalent value. If an estimated tax payment is a payment of future debt, then it would not meet the definition of value, and could be avoidable as a fraudulent transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   According to the Internal Revenue Code, the \"due dates\" for payment of 25% of the \"required annual payment\" are: April 15, June, 15, September 15, and January 15 (of the following taxable year).\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is self-evident that if a payment is \"due\" under the terms of a statute, it is a \"present\" debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The real question in this case, and not addressed by the parties, is:\n   <em>\n    how much\n   </em>\n   was due when the $28,000 payment was made? According to the Colliaus' brief, the \"federal income tax withheld from Forms W-2 and 1099 was $1,927, which was less than 90% of the tax due for 2015 ($46,918), and less than 100% of the tax due for 2014 ($13,084)\".\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under Internal Revenue Code section 6654(d), the \"required annual payment\" is the lesser of (a) 90% of the tax for the year in question (here .9 X $46,918, or $42,226) or (b) 100% of the tax for the previous year (here, $13,084).\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the Colliaus owed $3,271 on each of April 15, June 15, and September 15, less the $1,927 already withheld. As of September 2, 2015, when the $28,000 payment was made, only $4,615 ($6,542-$1,927) was \"due.\" Thus,\n   only $4,615 was paid on a \"present or antecedent debt\" and the balance of the payment ($23,385) was not paid for a reasonably equivalent value. Also, if in fact only $4,615 was due, but $28,000 was paid, this would tend to support the Trustee's actual intent theory; although that fact would have to be considered together with all other facts and circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   However, since neither party addressed the calculation of the actual amount due on the date the transfer was made, discretion will be exercised\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   to allow the parties to address the fact of what was actually due on those dates.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Summary Judgment will be denied to both parties by separate order.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    Compl. 2, ECF No. 1; United States Answer 2, ECF No. 3.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    <em>\n     In re Colliau\n    </em>\n    , No: 15-11166, Pet., ECF No. 1.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    Compl, ECF No. 1.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    Mot. to Intervene, ECF No. 4; Order Allowing Intervention, ECF No. 13.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    Mot. to Intervene 2, ECF No. 4.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    Mot.
