Plaintiff's motion argues that summary judgment is appropriate solely because the Court should reject Defendant's argument that the prepetition payment from Debtor to Defendant constituted \"new value\" under \u00a7 547(c)(1). The parties each oppose the other's motion. [Docs. 21, 22, 23, 24.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Because the Court finds that the payment by Debtor to Defendant did not constitute new value under \u00a7 547(c)(1), the Court will enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff under \u00a7 547(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The parties have stipulated and/or the record reflects the following facts. From 2008 through May 5, 2016, Debtor was employed as Defendant's office manager. [Docs. 16 at \u00b6 1, 21 at \u00b6 1.] Because her responsibilities included managing Defendant's finances, Debtor had access to and was a signatory on Defendant's bank accounts, through which she paid not only Defendant's business expenses, but also, without permission and in violation of her employment, a number of her personal expenses, including her home mortgage, her car, and her credit cards. [Docs. 16 at \u00b6\u00b6 2-5, 21 at \u00b6\u00b6 2-5.] As a result of her admission that she embezzled $120,000.00 from Defendant, Debtor was fired by Defendant. [Docs. 16 at \u00b6\u00b6 7-8; 21 at \u00b6\u00b6 7-8.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Debtor was prosecuted by the State of Tennessee for embezzlement and charged with theft of property over $60,000.00 in violation of Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7 39-14-103, a Class B felony, which subjected Debtor to a potential prison sentence of eight to twelve years. [Docs. 16 at \u00b6\u00b6 10-11, 21 at \u00b6\u00b6 10-11.] She entered into a plea agreement prior to a trial on the merits, through which the State of Tennessee agreed to allow her to avoid jail time by serving a Community Corrections sentence. [Doc. 14-3, \u00b6\u00b6 8-9.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ] Debtor's plea included an agreement that she would repay $120,000.00 in restitution to Defendant. [Docs. 19 at \u00b6 3, 22 at \u00b6 3.] In connection with her plea, Debtor signed an agreement on September 9, 2016, and tendered a check payable to Defendant for $70,000.00 on that same date. [Docs. 19 at \u00b6\u00b6 3-5, 19-2, 22 at \u00b6\u00b6 3-5.] The $70,000.00 payment was partially funded by the sale of Debtor's residence. [Docs. 16 at \u00b6 21, 21 at \u00b6 21.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Debtor filed her Chapter 7 bankruptcy case on November 16, 2016, and received a discharge on March 1, 2017. [Docs. 19 at \u00b6 1, 19-1, 19-5 at \u00b6 4.a.] Seven days after discharge was entered, Defendant filed\n   <em>\n    Metal Craft Fabrication and Sales, LLC v. Janice L. Davis\n   </em>\n   , Adv. Proc. No. 3 :17-ap-03004-SHB, seeking a determination that it did not receive notice of Debtor's bankruptcy case and that the debt owed as a result of her embezzlement was not dischargeable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Defendant's adversary proceeding against Debtor resulted in the April 19, 2017 entry of an Agreed Judgment Determining Dischargeability of Debt by which Defendant was granted a nondischargeable judgment against Debtor in the amount of $120,000.00, which includes the $70,000.00 that Plaintiff seeks to avoid in this adversary proceeding.

Subsection (c) provides a number of statutory defenses including the following, as asserted by Defendant:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (c) The trustee may not avoid under this section a transfer-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (1) to the extent that such transfer was\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (A) intended by the debtor and the creditor to and for whose benefit such transfer was made to be a contemporaneous exchange for new value given to the debtor; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (B) in fact a substantially contemporaneous exchange[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). A trustee who alleges a preferential transfer bears the burden of proving each element, and the party asserting a \u00a7 547(c) statutory defense bears the burden of proving each element. The elements of both the claim and defense must be satisfied by a preponderance of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Particularly important to the instant case, the Bankruptcy Code expressly provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \"[N]ew value\" means money or money's worth in goods, services, or new credit, or release by a transferee of property previously transferred to such transferee in a transaction that is neither void nor voidable by the debtor or the trustee under any applicable law, including proceeds of such property, but does not include an obligation substituted for an existing obligation[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Based on the record before it, the Court finds that Plaintiff has proved-and Defendant has offered nothing adequate to refute-that the requirements of \u00a7 547(b) have been satisfied. That is, the undisputed facts establish that Debtor paid $70,000.00 to Defendant within the ninety-day period before Debtor filed for bankruptcy; Debtor was insolvent at the time she made the transfer; the payment was on account of an antecedent debt; and the transfer put Defendant in a better position than it would have been in Debtor's Chapter 7 bankruptcy case had it not received the $70,000.00. Defendant argues that \u00a7 547(c)(1) applies. Specifically, Defendant asserts that Debtor received new value when she paid $70,000.00 toward her restitution debt in exchange for a sentence that did not include incarceration. Thus, the \"key question is whether the Debtor's freedom constitutes 'new value' as set forth under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).\" [Def.'s Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. [Doc. 14] at p. 6.] Based on relevant case law and the statutory definition of \"new value\" itself, the Court finds that Debtor's payment of restitution under the plea agreement was not \"new value\" as contemplated by the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

There, the court held that allowing restitution to fall within the \u00a7 547(c)(1) defense does not \"comport[ ] with the underlying reason for recognizing a new value defense to a preference claim.\" The\n   <em>\n    Instrumentation &amp; Controls\n   </em>\n   court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   The \u00a7 547(c)(1) defense is rooted in one of the core purposes of bankruptcy preference law, which is to permit the trustee to recover certain transfers made shortly before the filing of the bankruptcy case in order to promote the orderly, equality of distribution among creditors ...[.] Thus, if the bankruptcy estate was not depleted or diminished by a transfer because\n   <em>\n    the estate\n   </em>\n   received back new value equivalent to the value of the outgoing transfer, there is no detriment to the other creditors, no bankruptcy purpose is achieved by setting aside the\n   transfer, and \u00a7 547(c)(1) provides a defense to the preference claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    In re Grooms\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269243\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/572/559/\">\n    572 B.R. at 578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Instrumentation &amp; Controls, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3825145\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/506/677/#p679\">\n    506 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   679 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Moreover, the\n   <em>\n    Grooms\n   </em>\n   court correctly relied on the statutory definition of \"new value,\" analyzing the plain language of \u00a7 547(a)(2) and agreeing with other courts that intangible benefits, such a reduction in sentence, do not fit within the definition.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Whatever a reduction in sentence may be, it is not money, goods, new credit, or a property release. Possibly it could be argued that a reduction in sentence constitutes a \"service,\" the sole remaining category recognized in the statutory definition, but that seems a stretch.... It would appear to the Court that a reduction in a sentence is just the sort of esoteric or intangible benefit that will not be recognized as new value, and that furthermore any benefit received went only to the Debtor personally and did not redound in any way to the benefit of the estate and the creditors, generally.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    In re Grooms\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269243\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/572/559/\">\n    572 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   578-79 (citing\n   <em>\n    Aero-Fastener, Inc. v.

Aside from the fact that Defendant\n   will receive a pro rata distribution from the recovered asset by Plaintiff, it also has obtained a nondischargeable judgement in this Court for the entire $120,000.00 that was embezzled by Debtor. Avoiding the $70,000.00 prepetition, preferential payment from Debtor to Defendant does not alleviate Debtor's requirement to pay the entire restitution amount to Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Debtor's Interest in the $70,000.00 Payment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Defendant alternatively argues that at the time Debtor paid $70,000.00 to Defendant, she had no interest in the funds because they were ill gotten gains from her embezzlement such that the funds did not fall within the scope of \u00a7 547. In support of this argument, Defendant cites to Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7 40-20-116(a), which provides,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the value of property stolen shall be ascertained and restitution made, and \u00a7 40-35-304, which allows a court to direct a criminal defendant to pay restitution as a condition of probation. Defendant urges the Court to find that the $70,000.00 was not actually property of Debtor but was property of Defendant, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Debtor did not have an interest in any part of the fraudulently obtained $120,000.00, which she embezzled, including the $70,000.00 paid on September 9, 2016. The superior interest remained at all times with the Defendant. As a result, the Debtor did not have an interest in the transfer, and the Trustee may not recover it for the benefit of the estate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   [Def.'s Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. [Doc. 14] at pp. 12-13.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Court disagrees with this line of reasoning. Although \u00a7 547 only authorizes the trustee to avoid any transfer \"of an interest of the debtor in property,\" numerous courts, including the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, have held that debtors retain an interest in property even if the property was obtained illegally.\n   <em>\n    McLemore v.
