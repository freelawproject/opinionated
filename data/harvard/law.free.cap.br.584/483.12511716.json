On January 31, 2018, counsel for Miguel Garcia (\"Debtor\") filed a chapter 7 petition without schedules. (ECF Doc. # 1.) Neither the Debtor nor his counsel appeared at the 341 meeting of creditors scheduled for February 27, 2018. On March 8, 2018, the U.S. Trustee filed a motion to dismiss, or to extend the time to object to the Debtor's discharge, because of the failure to file schedules or appear for the 341 meeting. (ECF Doc. # 9.) A hearing on that motion was scheduled to be heard on May 8, 2018, and was resolved without dismissal of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On March 18, 2018, no doubt in response to the U.S. Trustee's motion to dismiss, the Debtor's counsel filed the missing schedules. (ECF Doc. # 12.) Schedule A/B lists the Debtor's ownership of property located at 633 West 185\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Street, New York, NY 10033 (the \"Property\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) But a review of those schedules shows that failing to timely file schedules may create additional difficulties for a debtor. The Schedules included a Statement of Intention to retain the Property and \"Enter Loss Mitigation to Secure Loan Modification.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29.) This statement of intention to retain the Property is untimely. Section 521(a)(2)(A) requires that \"if an individual debtor's schedule of assets and liabilities includes debts which are secured by property of the estate-(A) within 30 days after the date of the filing of a petition under chapter 7 of this title or on or before the date of the meeting of creditors, whichever is earlier, [the debtor must] file with the clerk a statement of his intention with respect to the retention or surrender of such property....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20521\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A). The issue of consequences\n   of an untimely statement of intention is not currently before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On April 5, 2018, counsel for Rushmore Loan Management Services (\"Rushmore\"), as servicer for U.S. Bank National Association (\"U.S. Bank\"), as Trustee for the RMAC Trust Series 2016-CTT, alleged to be the holder of the note and mortgage on the Debtor's Property filed a motion for relief from the automatic stay (the \"Motion\" ECF Doc. # 13-1). It is this Motion that is pending and is the subject of this Opinion. The Motion is supported by the Note, Mortgage, and Assignment (\"Exhibit A,\" ECF Doc. # 13-2), a Declaration by Gloria Rocha, a Vice President at Rushmore (\"Exhibit B,\" or the \"Rocha Declaration,\" ECF Doc. # 13-3), and a Broker Price Opinion (\"BPO,\" Exhibit C, ECF Doc. # 13-4). The Debtor's counsel did not file any opposition to the Motion, which in light of the Statement of Intention to enter Loss Mitigation seems like a dereliction of duty by counsel. Less than two hours before the hearing on the Motion, Debtor's counsel filed a Loss Mitigation Request.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF Doc. # 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As explained below, the Motion to lift the automatic stay is also defective in failing to provide evidence that Rushmore has standing to foreclose. While the Mortgage includes an assignment of the\n   <em>\n    mortgage\n   </em>\n   from Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., the original mortgagee, to U.S. Bank (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ex. A at 34), no assignment, allonge, or delivery of the Note endorsed in blank is shown in any evidence submitted in support of the Motion. Indeed, the Note shows that Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., endorsed the Note in blank. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) No affidavit or declaration, or any document submitted in support of the Motion, establishes that U.S. Bank, on whose behalf Rushmore is acting, holds the original Note endorsed in blank. As explained below, this error by Rushmore's counsel is all too common, as a review of prior decisions of this Court clearly shows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   But even if Rushmore had established its standing, and if the Loss Mitigation Request had not been filed before the hearing, the Court has reservations whether the stay should be lifted now. The record raises questions whether the Debtor has a sufficient equity cushion in the Property to justify denial of the Motion at least for a sufficient period to allow the Debtor time to pursue Loss Mitigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   For the reasons explained below, the Motion to lift the stay is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On January 31, 2018 the Debtor filed a voluntary petition under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. (ECF Doc. # 1.) The Debtor's Schedule A/B lists the current value of the Debtor's Property at $1,351,537.00 (ECF Doc. # 12 at 3), claiming a homeowner's exemption of $165,550.00 with respect to the Property (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9), identifying Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. as holding a mortgage debt on the Property of $926,777.17 (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11), and including a Statement of Intention to retain the Property and \"Enter Loss Mitigation to Secure Loan Modification\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 29). By the Motion, Rushmore seeks to enforce U.S. Bank's right to continue an action to foreclose on the Property, stating that there is cause to lift the automatic stay under 11 U.S.C. 362(d) because adding the homeowner's exemption along with broker fees, Trustee fees, and open real\n   estate taxes, \"it is clear that no equity remains in the property.\" (Mot. \u00b6 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Rushmore has not indicated the date on which the Debtor paid his last mortgage payment, but the Rocha Declaration states that the Debtor's pre-petition indebtedness to U.S. Bank was $997,660.68. (Rocha Decl. at 3.) This figure apparently includes $601,584.07 in principal, $340,144.39 in interest, $46,850 in taxes and insurance, and $324.52 in late fees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Post-petition payment defaults include $4,606.84 payments due on February 1, 2018 and on March 1, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) As of the date of the Motion, the Debtor owed $997,739.68. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.) Rushmore also attached as Exhibit C a BPO by \"Asset Val\" estimating the fair market value of the Property at $1,150,000.00 as of January 18, 2018. (Ex. C.; Mot. \u00b6 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Motion alleges that U.S. Bank holds a note and mortgage concerning the Property. (Mot. \u00b6 1.) On or about August 3, 2007, the Debtor borrowed $617,500.00 from Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.) On the same day, the Debtor executed a note evidencing indebtedness to Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (\"Note\") (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ex. A at 2), and the Debtor and co-mortgagor delivered a mortgage securing repayment of the Note (the \"Mortgage\") against the Property. The Mortgage was then assigned by Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. to U.S. Bank by a written assignment dated September 28, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. A at 34.) The Note shows an endorsement in blank from Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a result of the blank space between \"PAY TO THE ORDER OF\" and \"WELLS FARGO BANK, N.A.\" in the endorsement). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) As already indicated, no evidence was provided in support of the Motion that U.S. Bank holds the original Note endorsed in blank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARDS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Bankruptcy Code imposes an automatic stay of nearly all litigation against the debtor.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

As described above, no evidence has been offered to support that U.S. Bank holds the Note endorsed in blank. The Mortgage originally held by Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. was assigned to U.S. Bank by a written assignment dated September 28, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. A at 34.) However, no assignment of the Note is shown in the documents submitted in support of the Motion. Instead, the Note shows an endorsement in blank from Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a result of the blank space between \"PAY TO THE ORDER OF\" and \"WELLS FARGO BANK, N.A.\" in the endorsement). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4). In addition, no affidavit or declaration (or any document submitted in support of the Motion) establishes that U.S. Bank holds the original Note endorsed in blank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   This Court has repeatedly emphasized that this fundamental error by Rushmore's counsel cannot support standing to lift the automatic stay to continue a foreclosure action. In\n   <em>\n    Mims\n   </em>\n   , for example, this Court held that Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. lacked standing to seek relief from the automatic stay because it failed to advance proof that it was the owner of a promissory note given with a mortgage, as it did not provide evidence that \"the Note was physically delivered or assigned pursuant to a written agreement.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3777888\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/438/52/#p55\">\n    438 B.R. at 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Likewise, in\n   <em>\n    Lippold\n   </em>\n   , this Court held that U.S. Bank failed to establish its standing to lift\n   the automatic stay, as it failed \"to provide satisfactory proof of its status as the owner or holder of the note at issue.\" 457 B.R. at 299. In\n   <em>\n    Idicula\n   </em>\n   , the Court once again outlined the requirements for establishing standing to foreclose on property.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4162353\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/484/284/#p288\">\n    484 B.R. at 287-88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There, the movant, servicing agent Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc., argued that U.S. Bank held the right to enforce a promissory note securing the property at issue because the note was transferred to U.S. Bank by way of an allonge.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4162353\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/484/284/#p288\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4162353\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/484/284/#p288\">\n    at 286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court held that the purported allonge could not support U.S. Bank's standing because the allonge was never submitted in evidence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4162353\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/484/284/#p288\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4162353\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/484/284/#p288\">\n    at 289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, U.S. Bank lacked standing because it did not establish that the note at issue, which was endorsed in blank, was physically delivered and currently possessed by U.S. Bank.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4162353\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/484/284/#p288\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And most recently, in\n   <em>\n    Sterling\n   </em>\n   , the Court once again emphasized the standing requirement and the various methods by which to establish standing.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20313085\">\n    2018 WL 313085\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2-3. The law on this issue is well-settled, and it is clear under this Court's precedents that the Motion fails to support the movant's standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The filing of the Loss Mitigation Request would, in any event, require adjournment of the lift stay motion.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   note 1. But even had Rushmore established standing, and the Loss Mitigation Request not been filed, the Court has doubts whether the stay should be lifted now. The Motion does not make a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   showing under 362(d) that the Debtor does not have sufficient equity in the property to provide the secured creditor with adequate protection while Loss Mitigation is pursued. In his schedules, the Debtor estimates the value of the Property at $1,351,537. (ECF Doc. # 12 at 9.) Rushmore submitted a BPO, which is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   competent evidence of the property's value. Rushmore's BPO by \"Asset Val\" estimates the fair market value of the property at $1,150,000 as of January 18, 2018. (Ex. C; Mot. \u00b6 6.) The Motion alleges that the balance of the mortgage debt at the petition date was $997,660.68. Using either the Debtor's estimate of the value of the Property, or the estimate in the \"Asset Val\" BPO, the record raises questions whether the Debtor has a sufficient equity cushion in the Property to support denial of the Motion at least for sufficient time to allow the Debtor to pursue Loss Mitigation if properly triggered. One thing is clear; a foreclosure sale of the Property most likely would not maximize the value of the Property to the Debtor's estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Motion is accordingly\n   <strong>\n    DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    This Court's procedures for a Loss Mitigation Request are set forth in General Order M-451. The effect of filing a Loss Mitigation Request is that a lift stay motion filed before the entry of a Loss Mitigation Order shall be adjourned to date after an order terminating loss mitigation.
