Hagenau, U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge\n   <strong>\n    THIS MATTER\n   </strong>\n   is before the Court on Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment (the \"Motion\"). Plaintiff seeks to avoid and recover a transfer of property set out in a divorce decree. The Court has jurisdiction of this matter pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1334, and this matter is a core proceeding under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A), (K), and (O).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff filed the Motion on February 9, 2018 and included a Statement of Undisputed Facts. Defendant Benjamin T. Polk (\"Polk\") did not respond to the Motion and did not dispute the Statement of Undisputed Facts and has therefore admitted the facts identified therein. BLR 7056-1(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Debtor and Polk purchased real property at 3291 Zingara Road NE, Conyers, Rockdale County, Georgia 30094 (the \"Property\"). The property was titled in both their names, and the warranty deed was recorded on the real property records with the Superior Court of Rockdale County on October 23, 2002. The Property was encumbered by two security deeds, the first of which has been declared unenforceable and not a valid lien on the Property and any sales proceeds. (Doc. No. 17.) The second lien represents a revolving line of credit and has a loan payoff of approximately $34,760. The Debtor valued the Property at $108,000 in her bankruptcy schedules. Plaintiff alleges the Property has been valued between $121,785 and $146,040.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The parties divorced and the Superior Court of Rockdale County entered an Amended and Final Judgment and Decree on June 12, 2015 (the \"Divorce Decree\"). The Divorce Decree provides: \"The marital home located at 3291 Zingara Road, Conyers, Rockdale County, Georgia 30012, which is titled solely in the Husband's name, is hereby awarded to the Husband ... free and clear of any clam by the Wife.\" While the Divorce Decree contemplates a conveyance of Debtor's one-half interest to Polk (the \"Transfer\"), Debtor did not execute and did not record a quit claim deed to Polk conveying her one-half interest in the Property. Neither the Divorce Decree nor a notice of\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   was recorded in the real estate records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Debtor filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition on March 15, 2016. Plaintiff filed the Complaint on September 7, 2016 and an Amended Complaint on June 29, 2017. Plaintiff alleges any interest Polk acquired in the Property under the Divorce Decree is subject to avoidance. Plaintiff seeks to avoid the Transfer pursuant to sections 544(a)(3) and 548(a)(1)(B) of the Bankruptcy Code ; to find Polk liable for the Transfer pursuant to section 550 of the Bankruptcy Code ; to preserve the Transfer for the benefit of the estate pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20551\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; authorization to sell the Property pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20363\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h) ; and an order directing Polk to turn over the Property to Plaintiff. Polk answered the Complaint and the Amended Complaint asserting he is the sole owner of the Property pursuant to the Divorce Decree and Plaintiff has no interest in the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Although the Motion is deemed unopposed pursuant to Local Rule 7007-1(c), the Court must determine the propriety of granting the motion.\n   <em>\n    Nishimatsu Constr.

For example, in\n    <em>\n     Roost v.

In\n    <em>\n     Anderson\n    </em>\n    , at the time he filed bankruptcy, the debtor held sole title to real estate and the debtor's spouse had no recorded interest in the properties. The parties then executed and recorded a divorce decree post-petition that awarded the debtor's ex-wife title to real property. The Court concluded, at the time of bankruptcy, debtor held sole title to the real estate at issue and any interest in specific real estate the debtor's spouse may have claimed as marital property was superseded by the Chapter 7 trustee's powers under section 544(a)(3).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    In this case, the Divorce Decree was not recorded in the real property records. No\n    <em>\n     lis pendens\n    </em>\n    was filed. Polk has not identified an applicable Georgia statute to indicate the Divorce Decree created any sort of trust enforceable against a hypothetical lien holder. Accordingly, on the petition date, anyone who checked the Debtor's title in the Property would have found the Debtor holding title to the Property with Polk, and no evidence of Polk solely holding title to the Property. There was no actual and no constructive notice to Plaintiff of the Transfer to Polk. Therefore, while the Divorce Decree may be binding upon the Debtor and Polk, it had no effect on their third party creditors, including the Trustee as a hypothetical lien creditor. Accordingly, the Court finds there are no genuine issues of material fact as to Count II of the Amended Complaint.

The Property is a single-family home and Polk has admitted partition in kind of the Property is not practicable. Therefore, the Court finds Plaintiff has satisfied the first prong of section 363(h).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Second, Plaintiff must prove the sale of the estate's one-half interest in the Property would recognize significantly less value for the estate than the sale of the property free of the Polk's interest. \"It is widely accepted that a sale of a single family residence subject to a co-owners one-half interest in such property 'chills any prospective purchase of the estate's one-half interest,' and the estate would realize more value from the sale of the co-owner's interest along with that of the estate.\"\n    <em>\n     Pullen\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205591919\">\n     2013 WL 5591919\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *11, 2013 Bankr.

Plaintiff asserts the sale of the estate's one-half interest in the Property would recognize significantly less value for the estate than sale of the entire property.

Accordingly, the second element of section 363(h) is satisfied.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Third, Plaintiff must prove the benefit to the estate of a sale of the Property free of Polk's interest outweighs the detriment to Polk.

Polk does not dispute the Property has value. Debtor valued the Property at $108,000 at the time she filed her bankruptcy petition, and Plaintiff alleges the Property has been valued at approximately $121,785-$146,040. Plaintiff filed a report of assets and request to set claim deadline; only one claim for $14,596.22 was filed by U.S. Bank, N.A. A sale of the Property would allow the Trustee to pay the claim, and Polk would also receive one-half of any net sale proceeds. Polk has not presented any evidence of detriment. While he could be displaced by a sale of the Property, he has not presented any evidence of serious hardship.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    Further, Polk has a safeguard-he can purchase the estate's interest in the Property. Section 363(i) gives a co-owner the right of first refusal to purchase the Property at the price at which the sale is to be consummated.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20363\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (i) (\"Before the consummation of a sale of property to which subsection (g) or (h) of [\u00a7 363 ] applies, ... the ... co-owner of such property ... may purchase such property at the price at which such sale is to be consummated.\"). This section mitigates potential economic and emotional detriment because it provides Polk a right of first refusal before Plaintiff can consummate a sale of the Property under section 363(h). Where there is equity in the property, the co-owner can also likely secure new financing.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Ivey\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6529944\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/10/230/#p232\">\n     10 B.R. 230\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 233 (Bankr.

The final factor of section 363(h) is therefore met.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    The Trustee has met his burden and satisfied all of the requirements of section 363(h). Accordingly, the Trustee is authorized to sell both the estate's interest and Polk's interest in the Property pursuant to section 363(h), provided any contract to sell is subject to Court approval, after notice and a hearing, and all liens and ownership interests will attach to the proceeds of the sale.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    <strong>\n     d.
