Whether a hospital management company such as QHR owes a duty of care to patients of the hospital and if so the scope of the duty is a question of law, and is a matter of first impression involving a matter of public importance. On that basis, certification for direct appeal is required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   During the first half of 2011, the UTC commenced individual actions against Dr. Christian Schlicht, Dr. Frank Bryant, Otero County Hospital Association, Inc., d/b/a Gerald Champion Regional Medical Center (the \"Hospital\"), QHR, and other defendants in state court alleging medical malpractice and other acts of negligence relating to an alleged experimental surgical procedure (the \"PDA procedure\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   members of the UTC underwent at the Hospital. Due in large part to the filing of the state court actions, the Hospital filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code on August 16, 2011.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Case No. 11-13686-j11 (\"Bankruptcy Case\")-Docket No. 1. The UTC commenced the related adversary proceedings referenced in the above caption (together the \"Adversary Proceedings\") by removing forty-seven state court actions to this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As part of the Hospital's bankruptcy case, the Hospital, UTC, QHR, one of its insurers, and other parties reached a partial settlement. The settling parties entered into a term sheet and a later settlement agreement, which were incorporated into the Hospital's confirmed Chapter 11 plan of reorganization.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bankruptcy Case-Docket No. 712. Following the partial settlement, QHR remained the sole remaining defendant in the related Adversary Proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Court created a master docket (Miscellaneous Case No. 13-00007) for the Adversary Proceedings and tried the Adversary Proceedings in phases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the first two phases, the Court tried issues common to all of the Adversary Proceedings. In Phase I, the Court tried the duty and breach elements of the UTC's negligence claims against QHR. The Court determined that QHR owed a direct duty to the UTC that included \"(1) the duty to appropriately involve medical staff in evaluating medical issues; and (2) the duty to\n   inform the board and the medical staff about issues relating to patient safety known or that should be known by the hospital management company.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Otero Phase I\n   </em>\n   , 527 B.R. at 767.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Court concluded that QHR breached that duty in two respects: (1) in connection with the granting of temporary privileges to Dr. Christian Schlicht; and (2) by failing to make a formal request that the Hospital's medical executive committee initiate an investigation of Dr. Schlicht (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   a focused review under the medical staff bylaws) after learning that Dr. Schlicht's outside proctor\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   asserted Dr. Schlicht was performing experimental surgery on patients of the hospital, and failing to apprise the Hospital's board of the proctor's assertion.\n   <em>\n    In re Otero Phase I,\n   </em>\n   527 B.R. at 780.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In Phase II, the Court determined causation and allocated QHR's comparative fault.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Otero Cnty. Hosp. Ass'n, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   No. 11-11-13686 JL,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207985365\">\n    2016 WL 7985365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. D.N.M. Dec. 23, 2016) (\"\n   <em>\n    In re Otero Phase II\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    \"\n   </em>\n   )-Docket No. 545.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   In determining causation, the Court found that had the Chief Executive Officer employed by QHR (the \"QHR CEO\") requested the Hospital's medical executive committee (\"MEC\") to conduct a focused review, (1) the MEC would have acted on the QHR CEO's formal request; (2) the MEC would have sought a physician outside of the Hospital to perform the review; (3) the reviewer would have told the MEC that the experimental surgical procedure was dangerous; and (4) the MEC would have acted on that information and stopped the PDA procedure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Otero Phase II,\n   </em>\n   at *7-8. Based on these findings, the Court concluded that the QHR CEO's failure to request a focused review caused the UTC to suffer harm by (1) having the PDA procedure; or (2) undergoing a procedure where Dr. Schlicht as the lead physician committed malpractice by performing procedures beyond the scope of his credentials.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207985365\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at *9 and *22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In considering cross-motions for reconsideration of its prior rulings, the Court determined that the additional testimony and documentary evidence relating to Dr. Robert Zuniga and the previous testimony of Monica Arrowsmith, R.N., M.S.N., J.D. provided further support for the Court's findings that had the QHR CEO made a formal request of the MEC to conduct a focused review of Dr. Schlicht performing the PDA procedure, the MEC would have done so, would have engaged an outside reviewer, and would have stopped the PDA procedure upon learning the reviewer's conclusions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memorandum Opinion (\"Reconsideration Memorandum Opinion\"), p. 36-Docket No. 816. As part of its Reconsideration Memorandum Opinion, the Court concluded that regardless of whether it applied an objective or subjective standard to determine causation, its decision would be the same.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In Phase III, the Court determined\n   damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memorandum Opinion (\"Memorandum Opinion-Phase III\")-Docket No. 827. So far, the Court has issued final judgments in four of the Adversary Proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Adversary Proceeding No. 12-1257 J (Patricia E. Rue and Gary T. Rue)-Docket No. 60; Adversary Proceeding No. 12-1240J (Ivan S. Jackson)-Docket No. 60; Adversary Proceeding No. 12-1255J (Desiree Smith and Henry Smith)-Docket No. 60; and Adversary Proceeding No. 12-1278J (Kelly Robbins and Herbert Robbins)-Docket No. 84. QHR has appealed each of these four judgments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibits A and B to Motion-Docket No. 874.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On joint request by QHR and the UTC, the Court also decided the issue of whether QHR is entitled to an offset for the amounts it or its insurers have already paid to the UTC (the \"Offset Issue\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memorandum Opinion (\"Offset Memorandum\")-Docket No. 620. In considering the Offset Issue, the Court first construed the provisions of the term sheet and settlement agreement, which provided that the UTC agreed to enforce any judgment ultimately awarded against QHR in the Adversary Proceedings solely against the available insurance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Offset Memorandum-p. 10.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lexington Insurance Company (\"Lexington\") issued the only remaining insurance policies available to pay any judgment the UTC may obtain against QHR in these Adversary Proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 5. Lexington is not a party to the Adversary Proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 12. UTC and QHR are involved in ongoing litigation with Lexington in a Tennessee state court regarding insurance coverage (the \"Insurance Coverage Litigation\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Although the Court determined that QHR may be entitled to an offset or credit against any judgment the UTC may ultimately obtain against QHR, the Court concluded that it could not quantify the amount of any offset or credit because such a determination would require the Court to interpret the Lexington insurance policies, an issue not before the Court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Following the entry of an order in the Insurance Coverage Litigation determining that QHR's payment and a payment by Nautilus Insurance Company, taken together, satisfied the self-insured retentions applicable to the two Lexington insurance policies at issue, QHR asked the Court to reconsider its Offset Memorandum.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   During a status conference on QHR's Motion for Reconsideration of Offset Issue, held February 2, 2018, counsel for QHR made the following representation to the Court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Our view is ... that the policies are really before the Tennessee court and that the mechanics of actually applying these various judgments and offsets with respect to the various UTC claimants is best handled by the Tennessee Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Based in part on this representation, the Court concluded that the Offset Issue necessarily involved interpretation of the Lexington insurance policies, and that enforcement of any judgment entered following the damages trials in Phase III was an issue to be decided in the Insurance Coverage Litigation where the amount of any offsets will be determined. Both QHR and the UTC agreed that the Court should issue final judgments. The Court reconsidered its Offset Memorandum to the extent necessary to enter final judgments following the damages trials in Phases III, but denied QHR's request to apply a credit or offset.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memorandum Opinion (\"Offset Reconsideration Memorandum\")-Docket No. 846.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   QHR filed its notice of appeal of the four judgments entered following the damages trials on March 21, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 861. On March 23, 2018, QHR filed the Motion requesting certification of the judgments for direct appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 873. On April 4, 2018, QHR filed its Statement of Issues to be Presented on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 885. QHR has identified fourteen separate issues, including whether QHR owed a duty to the UTC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Section 158(d) of Title 28 authorizes a bankruptcy court\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   to certify a judgment for direct appeal to the circuit court if:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (i) the judgment, order, or decree involves a question of law as to which there is no controlling decision of the court of appeals for the circuit or of the Supreme Court of the United States, or involves a matter of public importance;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (ii) the judgment, order, or decree involves a question of law requiring resolution of conflicting decisions; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (iii) an immediate appeal from the judgment, order, or decree may materially advance the progress of the case or proceeding in which the appeal is taken[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20158\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   If the Court determines that the circumstances described in any one of the three provisions outlined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20158\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(A) exist, direct certification of the appeal to the circuit court of appeals is mandatory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20158\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2)(B) (\"If the bankruptcy court ... determines that a circumstance specified in clause (i), (ii), or (iii) of subsection (A) exists ... then the bankruptcy court ...\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   make the certification described in subparagraph (A).\") (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Certification to\n   the circuit court bypasses intermediate appellate review by the district court or the bankruptcy appellate panel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Woolsey,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4156779,5864877\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/1266/\">\n    696 F.3d 1266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1268 (10th Cir. 2012) (\" \u00a7 158(d)(2)(A) gives us [the circuit court] the authority to hear appeals straight from the bankruptcy court, leapfrogging over the district court or bankruptcy appellate panel in order to speed up the resolution of dispositive legal questions.\") (citation omitted).

Phrasing the question for certification in such a generic manner fails to provide any substantive basis for the Court to determine whether certification for direct appeal is appropriate. Second, QHR's recitation of the relevant facts necessary to understand the question presented is phrased in terms of the issues themselves and the errors QHR believes the Court made in issuing its decisions. Such an approach arguably conflates the separate requirements of Bankruptcy Rule 8006(f)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Notwithstanding the Motion's technical deficiencies, it is clear that QHR requests certification for direct appeal of the following issues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   1.

This Court found that under the settlement agreement QHR (and insurance companies other than Lexington on its behalf) paid monies to settle both claims covered and claims not covered by the Lexington policies. Construing the settlement agreement, the Court determined that QHR's settlement payments are to be allocated to covered claims or uncovered claims in the manner that will maximize UTC's recovery from the Lexington policies. Further construing the settlement agreement, this Court concluded that QHR is entitled to an offset against judgments this Court enters on UTC's negligence claims only to the extent QHR's settlement payments to UTC are applied toward satisfaction of a self-insured retention under a Lexington policy, and the self-insured retention can only be satisfied by allocating the payment to claims covered by the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Under the Court's ruling, to determine whether or in what amount QHR is entitled to an offset requires interpretation of the two Lexington insurance policies. Although QHR has asked this Court to certify the Offset Issue for direct appeal to the Tenth Circuit, QHR's counsel-without waiving any right to appeal this Court's decisions-agreed in open Court that applying offsets to the judgments is best handled in the Insurance Coverage Litigation, where Lexington is a party. Under these circumstances, none of the alternative grounds exists for certification of the Offset Issue for direct appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The question of whether QHR owes a duty to the UTC and if so the scope of the duty is a legal question involving a matter of public importance requiring certification for direct appeal to the Tenth Circuit. The Court is aware that the appeal raises many other issues, including issues that do not form the basis for QHR's requested certification for direct appeal, and many issues for which factual questions predominate. However, the question of duty is a threshold legal question, resolution of which could have a broader effect on hospital\n   management practices in New Mexico and throughout the country.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Court will enter a separate order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    QHR is a national, for-profit hospital management company, specializing in providing hospital administrative services to rural hospitals.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    The Exhibits to the Motion consist of the following:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n    Final Judgments Entered in Adversary Proceeding Nos. 12-1240j; 12-1278j; 12-1257j; and 12-1255j\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n    Notices of Appeal and Statement of Election filed in Adversary Proceeding Nos. 12-1240j; 12-1278j; 12-1257j; and 12-1255j\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    <em>\n     In re Otero Cnty.
