PALLMEYER, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   These nine cases all arise from the decade-old bankruptcy of Sentinel Management Group, Inc. The facts surrounding Sentinel's collapse have been described in more than a dozen published opinions dating back to 2010. In short, Sentinel's managers failed to segregate client funds and securities in violation of federal law, regulations, and customer agreements. Instead, Sentinel pledged its clients' funds as collateral for loans from the Bank of New York (\"BONY\"), which Sentinel used to purchase even more securities on its own \"house\" account for the benefit of corporate insiders. When the financial markets began to crumble in the summer of 2007, Sentinel was unable to both repay the BONY loan and return its clients' money to them. Sentinel declared bankruptcy on August 17, 2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Defendants are all financial institutions and former Sentinel clients assigned to its \"SEG 1\" customer group (collectively, \"the SEG 1 Defendants\"). The SEG 1 Defendants consist of FCStone, LLC (Case No. 09-cv-136); Penson Financial Futures, Inc. and Penson Futures f/k/a Penson GHCO (together, No. 09-cv-101); IFX Markets, Inc. and IPGL, Ltd. (together, No. 09-cv-115); Farr Financial, Inc. (No. 09-cv-120); Cadent Financial Services (No. 09-cv-127); Country Hedging, Inc. (No. 09-cv-130); Velocity Futures, LP (No. 09-cv-135); American National Trading Corp. (No. 09-cv-137); ABN AMRO Clearing Chicago LLC f/k/a Fortis Clearing\n   Americas, LLC (No. 09-cv-138).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff Frederick J. Grede, is the Liquidation Trustee administering Sentinel's remaining assets. Soon after his appointment, the Trustee filed essentially identical five-count complaints against all of the SEG 1 Defendants seeking: the avoidance and recovery of various post-petition transfers under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20549\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Count I); the avoidance and recovery of preferential pre-petition transfers under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Count II); a declaratory judgment as to the ownership of reserve funds (\"the Property of the Estate Reserves\" or \"the Reserves\") held by the Trustee under the confirmed bankruptcy plan (\"the Plan\") (Count III); unjust enrichment (Count IV); and reduction or disallowance of claims (Count V).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Amended Complaint in\n   <em>\n    Grede v.

All the SEG 1 Defendants raised the same core defenses in opposition to these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In light of the identical claims and common factual and legal issues, then-presiding Judge Zagel decided to proceed with the SEG 1 litigation on a test-case basis. The parties selected\n   <em>\n    Grede v. FCStone,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 09-cv-136, as a test case for all the SEG 1 cases. After multiple appeals and reversals by the Seventh Circuit, all five counts in the Second Amended Complaint [99] have been resolved in FCStone's favor. It now falls on this court to enter judgment as to all the SEG 1 Defendants pursuant to the Seventh Circuit's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Grede v. FCStone, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275396,12270165\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/767/\">\n    867 F.3d 767\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 2017) (\"\n   <em>\n    FCStone II\n   </em>\n   \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The outcome of the test case has swung wildly with each new decision. At a bench trial, Judge Zagel originally found in favor of the Trustee on Counts I, II, III, and V-dismissing only the Trustee's unjust enrichment claim in count IV as preempted by federal bankruptcy law.\n   <em>\n    Grede v. FCStone, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4164157\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/485/854/#p888\">\n    485 B.R. 854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 888-890 (N.D. Ill. 2013). Defendant FCStone appealed,\n   and the Seventh Circuit reversed the judgments in favor of the Trustee.\n   <em>\n    Grede v.

The panel found that the post- and pre-petition transfers underlying Counts I and II, respectively, fell within \"safe harbors\" in the Bankruptcy Code and were not subject to avoidance.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4029296,4240940\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/746/244/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4029296,4240940\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/746/244/\">\n    at 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This decision had the further effect of rendering Count V (seeking disallowance of certain claims) moot. Absent any avoidable transfers to FCStone, the Trustee no longer had any legal grounds to disallow FCStone's claims against the estate under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20502\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grede v.

The Reserves are the focus of an ongoing dispute over whether certain funds are properly considered the property of the estate, or instead customer property held in trust for the benefit of specific clients. The Trustee alleged that the Reserve funds were property of the estate, and thus owed to all Sentinel's creditors on a\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   basis.\n   <em>\n    FCStone II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275396,12270165\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/767/\">\n    867 F.3d at 779\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Judge Zagel noted, however, that the Seventh Circuit had not reversed his ruling on Count III, and he therefor reaffirmed his original judgment on that count in favor of\n   the Trustee.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344110\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/556/357/#p366\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344110\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/556/357/#p366\">\n    at 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He noted that the SEG 1 and SEG 3 customers were both protected by statutory trusts, and concluded that \"equity prevent[ed] [the court] from favoring one statutory trust claim over another.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344110\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/556/357/#p366\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344110\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/556/357/#p366\">\n    at 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Furthermore, Judge Zagel believed any attempt to trace customer funds would be difficult, \"if not impossible,\" given Sentinel's extensive comingling across different accounts.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344110\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/556/357/#p366\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In\n   <em>\n    FCStone I\n   </em>\n   , the Seventh Circuit had proposed that courts faced with competing statutory trust claimants should \"require trust claimants to trace without the benefit of tracing conventions, but [ ] place trust claimants who fail to trace in a class ahead of at least unsecured creditors, giving them priority in bankruptcy proceedings.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4029296,4240940\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/746/244/\">\n    746 F.3d at 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Judge Zagel found this rule inapplicable, however, because as he saw it \"[t]he dispute raised in Count III is [ ] not a dispute between two statutory trust claimants, nor is it a dispute between statutory trust claimants and a pool of unsecured creditors.

Judge Zagel also stated that the Plan gave him broad discretion to distribute the funds as he saw fit under Section 7.20(c)(i), which stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   In the event the Court determines that the property in any of the Property Of The Estate Reserves is not property of the estate, Sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the Plan shall be deemed modified to provide that Customer Property shall be distributed to the rightful owners of such property or to the Estate, as determined by the Court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344110\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/556/357/#p366\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting Fourth Amended Chapter 11 Plan of Liquidation, Section 7.20(c)(i), Ex. 1 to Trustee's Supplemental Objection to FCStone Mot. [330-1] (\"Liquidation Plan\"), 40.) Judge Zagel interpreted this section as granting him the \"discretion to distribute the Reserves to the estate even if the Reserves are found\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to be property of the estate.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344110\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/556/357/#p366\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   At each step along the way, the Trustee and the SEG 1 Defendants reacted to the most recent decision in the test case by filing motions for judgment in their respective cases. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Motions for Judgment [46, 67, 69, 88, 91, 109] in\n   <em>\n    Grede v. IFX Markets\n   </em>\n   , No. 09-cv-115.) On March 28, 2016, Judge Zagel issued a blanket denial of all of these outstanding motions in the cases against the SEG 1 Defendants. (Denial and Stay Order [156] in\n   <em>\n    Grede v.

This time squarely addressing the Reserves that are the subject of Count III, the panel found that because the SEG 3 defendants had opted out of their trust claims by voting for the Plan and \"agree[ing] to be treated as unsecured creditors,\" the issue of \"parallel statutory trusts\" was avoided.\n   <em>\n    FCStone II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275396,12270165\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/767/\">\n    867 F.3d at 781-83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he SEG 1 Objectors alone preserved their right to recover trust property held in reserve, and the plan specifically contemplates that such property may be restored to those customers.

(Judgment Order of 3/30/16 [290] in\n   <em>\n    Grede v. FCStone\n   </em>\n   , No. 09-cv-136.) The Seventh Circuit has now directed this court to enter judgment in FCStone's favor on Count III and thereby conclude the case. The amount due to FCStone from either of the Reserve funds is not in dispute, but the parties have been unable to reach an agreement on either the form or substance of the judgment order. (FCStone Mot. \u00b6 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The other SEG 1 Defendants' requests for judgment present different challenges. The SEG 1 Defendants seek judgment in their favor on all counts in their respective complaints, based on a theory of collateral estoppel and by virtue of all parties' agreement to treat FCStone's dispute as a test case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Test Case:\n    <em>\n     Grede v. FCStone,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     LLC\n    </em>\n    , No. 09-cv-136\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Despite the straightforward nature of the remaining dispute, the parties have been unable to submit an agreed order. FCStone believes that any judgment must include two additional terms beyond a simple order directing distribution of its\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   share of the Reserves. First, FCStone wants the district court to enter an order retaining jurisdiction over the dispute to (a) enforce the terms of the judgment order and (b) adjudicate any future issues relating to the distribution of FCStone's share of the Reserves. (FCStone Mot.) Second, FCStone requests that the court enter an injunction directing the Trustee to pay FCStone its share within seven days of the entry of judgment, while reserving FCStone's right to challenge the amount due. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Trustee describes these provisions as unjustified \"bells and whistles\" that seek to circumvent the Plan and exceed the Seventh Circuit's mandate. (Trustee's Objection to FCStone Mot. [322], 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   This court sees no reason to include either of FCStone's additional terms. FCStone's request that this court retain jurisdiction over future disputes is inconsistent with the language of the confirmed Plan. The Plan states that the Bankruptcy Court retains jurisdiction over \"any dispute arising under or related to the implementation, execution, consummation, or interpretation of the Plan and/or Confirmation Order, and the making of distributions hereunder and thereunder[.]\" (Liquidation Plan Art. 9.1(f), 42.) As the Seventh Circuit stated regarding this exact same document in\n   <em>\n    FCStone II\n   </em>\n   , confirmed plans of reorganization are binding agreements with \"consequences that we cannot overlook.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275396,12270165\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/767/\">\n    867 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   781-82 (citing\n   <em>\n    Ernst &amp; Young LLP v.

Even if the Plan did not say so explicitly, the Bankruptcy Court shepherded the dispute central to all the SEG 1 cases (Sentinel's bankruptcy), approved the Plan, and continued to address Plan-related disputes throughout these proceedings. The parties withdrew the reference in this case to resolve questions concerning specific property of the estate, not to override the Plan entirely. If FCStone had issues with the jurisdictional provisions of the Plan, it should have objected to them at the time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ernst &amp; Young\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11401922,11359166\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/304/753/\">\n    304 F.3d at 755-56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   FCStone's second request is no more convincing. FCStone has not made the requisite showing necessary to support an injunction. Nor has it shown a compelling reason for the seven-day time limit it seeks to impose on the Trustee. FCStone's Proposed Injunctive Order is appears to be the sort of opportunistic piling-on that F.R.C.P. 58 was designed to avoid.\n   <em>\n    See 11\n   </em>\n   Wright, Miller, &amp; Kane,\n   <em>\n    Fed.

The panel's more detailed language stating that, for example, \"the Section 7.20(b) funds should be liquidated and the funds dispersed\" merely describes the consequences of a judgment in the SEG 1 Defendants' favor.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275396,12270165\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/767/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It is not a command to hold the Trustee's feet to the fire absent additional reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Overall, FCStone directs most of its arguments at why this court\n   <em>\n    can\n   </em>\n   enter its requested relief, but offers little support for why the court\n   <em>\n    should.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FCStone, LLC's Reply in Favor of FCStone Mot. [326] (\"FCStone Reply Br.\"), 9) (devoting a single page to explain why \"the proposed orders are necessary at this time\" and providing no legal support). FCStone is entitled to a judgment order on Count III of the Second Amended Complaint and nothing more. FCStone asserts that its \"Proposed Orders merely provide for a suggested timetable to accomplish the Seventh Circuit's mandate,\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4), but from the court's perspective, the existing post-judgment procedures are perfectly adequate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FED. R. CIV. P. 60 (Relief from a Judgment or Order), 69 (Execution).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Furthermore, the Plan itself establishes a timeline for distributions. As the Trustee points out, \"Section 7.10 of the Plan governs\n   <em>\n    when\n   </em>\n   the Trustee will make distributions on account of 'Disputed Claims.' \" (Trustee's Supplemental Objection to FCStone Mot. [330], 3) (emphasis in original). Section 7.10 states that distributions on account of \"Disputed Claims\" must be made \"as soon as practicable after an order, judgment, decree or settlement ... becomes a Final Order[.]\" (Liquidation Plan \u00a7 7.10, 35.) The Plan defines \"Final Orders\" as an order or judgment for which \"the time to appeal, petition for certiorari, or seek review or rehearing has expired and as to which no appeal, petition for certiorari, or petition for review or rehearing was filed, or, if filed, remains pending[.]\" (Id. at \u00a7 1.1, 10.) The Trustee asserted that he intended to file a petition for a writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court by January 2, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trustee's Supplemental Objection to FCStone Mot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   3.) That date has since been extended to February 1, 2018. (Letter Granting Extension of Time to File Petition for Writ of Certiorari of 12/20/17 [69] in\n   <em>\n    Grede v. FCStone, LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-1896.) FCStone is entitled to judgment on Count III, but it must wait to see if the Supreme Court either denies certiorari or issues an opinion in the case before being entitled to recover.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   FCStone, for its part, argues that the Reserve funds are not \"Disputed Claims\" within the meaning of Section 7.10, so it cannot control the timing of Reserve distributions. Instead, FCStone claims that Section 7.20(c)(i) controls due to the holding in\n   <em>\n    FCStone II\n   </em>\n   that the Reserves are property held in trust for customers. (FCStone's Response to Trustee's Supplemental Objection to FCStone Mot. [331] (\"FCStone Sur-Response\"), \u00b6\u00b6 5-6.) In the court's view, FCStone's reliance on this section is misplaced. Section 7.20 covers the \"Resolution of the Property of the Estate Issues\" and establishes the SEG 1-3 Reserves and the Section 7.20(b) Disputed Claims Reserve. Section 7.20 does not provide any indication as to when distributions of the Reserves should be made. The disputed passage states only that, after a determination that the Reserves are not property of the estate, \"Customer Property shall be distributed to the rightful owners of such property or to the Estate, as determined by the Court.\" (Liquidation Plan \u00a7 7.20(c)(i), 40.) This language dictates to whom the distributions should be made, not when they should be made. It does not obviously contradict Section 7.10. Furthermore, even if Section 7.10 instructions to delay distributions until all avenues of appeal have been exhausted are inapplicable, Section 7.20(c)(i) clearly leaves the question of distribution to the court's reasonable discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   It appears that FCStone believes that once its property interest in the Reserves was established through litigation, it was removed from the Plan's purview. (FCStone Sur-Response \u00b6\u00b6 5-6.) But this argument makes little sense. At the time the Plan was made, all of the Reserve funds were \"disputed.\" The Plan accordingly outlines a procedure for what do to once those disputes end-in Section 7.10. A contextual reading of the Plan supports this view: in particular, the connection between the Section 7.20(b)\n   <em>\n    Disputed Claims\n   </em>\n   Reserve and the timeline established in Section 7.10 for the \"Distribution of\n   <em>\n    Disputed Claims.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sections 4.4 and 4.5 regarding customer claims, which Section 7.20(c)(i) is said to modify in the event a claim is said to be \"Customer Property,\" also use the language of \"Disputed\" or \"Allowed Claims\" to describe the distribution process. Since the Plan provides no directives on when to distribute funds later found to be \"Customer Property\" (despite that term's presence throughout the Plan and definition in Section 1.1), it appears clear to this court that property only determined to be \"Customer Property\" after a dispute still falls within the scope of Section 7.10's instruction to wait until that determination becomes a \"Final Order.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Count III sought a judgment \"declar[ing] that all of the cash held by the Trustee in accounts denominated as SEG 1, SEG 2, or SEG 3 accounts is property of the Debtor's estate under \u00a7 541 of the Bankruptcy Code.\" (FCStone Complaint 28.) A judgment in FCStone's favor on Count III simply declares that the property\n   held in the Reserve accounts is trust property held for FCStone's benefit. The court therefore grants FCStone, LLC's Motion for Judgment on Count III [317], but declines to include the additional provisions suggested by FCStone. The Plan governs distributions of such funds, and the court is confident that the Trustee will not require additional arm-twisting before turning over funds to which no other party is entitled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

(\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Penson Mot. 2-3.) The issues raised in their motions were identical, and the Trustee responded to all of the SEG 1 Defendants-apart from IFX Markets and IPGL, Ltd., which will be addressed in the following section-in a single, Omnibus Objection brief. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trustee's Omnibus Objection to Defendants' Motions for Entry of Judgment [71] in\n   <em>\n    Grede v. Penson\n   </em>\n   , No. 09-cv-101 (\"Trustee's Omnibus Objection\").) The SEG 1 Defendants assert that collateral estoppel binds the Trustee across all the SEG 1 cases. The Trustee does not dispute the binding nature of the\n   <em>\n    FCStone\n   </em>\n   test case. Nor are the Reserve accounts involved or the amounts due in question. As they did with respect to the form of judgment sought by Defendant FCStone, however, the parties have now asserted new issues as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   One of the arguments can be easily rejected. The SEG 1 Defendants argue for the same additional judgment terms that FCStone sought to include: namely, the injunction requiring the Trustee to disperse the funds within one week, and an order retaining the district court's jurisdiction over future Reserve disputes. (Penson Mot. 11-12; The SEG 1 Defendants' Omnibus Reply in Support of their Motion for Entry of Judgment [72] in\n   <em>\n    Grede v. Penson\n   </em>\n   , No. 09-cv-101 (\"Defendants' Omnibus Reply\"), 8-11.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the same reasons discussed above, those requests are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Trustee, however, raises a unique issue against the SEG 1 Defendants. While recognizing the preclusive effect of the Seventh Circuit's two\n   <em>\n    FCStone\n   </em>\n   decisions in its other disputes, the Trustee claims that the stay order imposed by Judge Zagel in 2016 has not yet run its course, and will not expire until the Supreme Court acts in response to the Trustee's planned petition for a writ of certiorari. (Trustee's Omnibus Objection 1-2.) Alternatively, the Trustee urges the court to withhold judgment in these cases until the Supreme Court takes action in two other, unrelated lawsuits the Trustee believes could impact the SEG 1 cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Trustee's argument that the stay remains in effect is without merit. This court has already permitted the parties to\n   refile their motions. And regardless of whether the language of the stay contemplated a petition for a writ of certiorari or merely through direct appeal to the Seventh Circuit (the SEG 1 Defendants argue for the latter interpretation), the Seventh Circuit's instructions in\n   <em>\n    FCStone II\n   </em>\n   are clear: \"FCStone and the other SEG 1 Objectors are entitled to share pro rata in the [ ] reserve[s].\"\n   <em>\n    FCStone II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275396,12270165\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/767/\">\n    867 F.3d at 790\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Though the Trustee attempts to link the two in support of his position, Judge Zagel's stay order is independent of the Trustee's duty to disperse funds under the Plan. As discussed, the Plan states that\n   <em>\n    distributions\n   </em>\n   shall only be made once a claim is established by a Final Order-which involves the exhaustion of all avenues of appeal. (Liquidation Plan \u00a7 7.10, 35.) Entering\n   <em>\n    judgment\n   </em>\n   now will not run afoul of the Plan, nor force the Trustee to claw back funds in the event he is victorious before the Supreme Court. The Trustee argues that entering judgment now \"will only result in forcing the Trustee to appeal every judgment that is entered to the Seventh Circuit in order to preserve his claims\" in the event the Supreme Court reverses\n   <em>\n    FCStone II.\n   </em>\n   (Trustee's Omnibus Objection 2.) That may indeed be required, but this court is not at liberty to ignore the directions of the Court of Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Trustee's alternative argument for delaying judgment warrants even less attention. As recognized by the SEG 1 Defendants, the Trustee has not met his burden of establishing why delay is proper here. (Defendants' Omnibus Reply 5.) The Supreme Court states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   It is our settled practice to grant a stay only when three conditions are met: First, there must be a reasonable probability that certiorari will be granted (or probable jurisdiction noted). Second, there must be a significant possibility that the judgment below will be reversed. And third, assuming the applicant's position on the merits is correct, there must be a likelihood of irreparable harm if the judgment is not stayed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    Philip Morris USA, Inc. v.

The Trustee has failed to make a case for why\n   <em>\n    he himself\n   </em>\n   would be prejudiced if the court enters judgment at this time. Furthermore, the Trustee makes only bare assertions that Supreme Court is likely to rule in a way favorable to him in\n   <em>\n    Merit Management Group, LP v.

(Defendants' Omnibus Reply 5-8.) In short, the Trustee's seemingly endless string of \"what ifs\" does not provide a sound basis for delaying judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The court will enter judgment in favor of the SEG 1 Defendants (apart from IFX Markets and IPGL, Ltd.) on Counts I-V of the Second Amended Complaint.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   IFX Markets, Inc. and IPGL, Ltd.'s Reply in Support of IFX Mot. [157] (\"IFX Reply.\"), 8-9.) This argument is not convincing. While the District Court opinion did indeed acknowledge that the contracts in\n   <em>\n    Peregrine\n   </em>\n   gave the broker power\n   to commingle investor's funds and use them for its own purposes-a key distinction between\n   <em>\n    Peregrine\n   </em>\n   and the contracts the SEG 1 Defendants signed with Sentinel-there is no support for IFX's proposition that the contractual language was the dispositive factor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Secure Leverage Group\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4345346\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/558/226/#p250\">\n    558 B.R. at 238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, the District Court observed that statutory trust protection was the critical question in the case\n   <em>\n    precisely because\n   </em>\n   no contractual protection existed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   The Agreement, which was used with respect to all Peregrine accounts, does not define when funds in a customer account constitute customer property and when they do not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     That\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   question is answered not by the Agreement, but by reference to the statutory and regulatory context that governed the types of financial instruments Peregrine traded. The Agreement states that the parties \"shall be bound by all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, including the commodity exchange act,\" and these laws shed light on what can reasonably be considered customer property under the Agreement. [Citation to record omitted.] The Commodities Exchange Act requires that futures accounts are segregated, which strongly indicates that equitable title to those futures is never transferred to the broker. See In re Dreier LLP,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5887865\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/544/760/#p769\">\n    544 B.R. 760\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 769 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2016). Because title is never transferred, those futures contracts remain \"customer property.\" Appellants' retail forex accounts, by contrast, are not required to be held in segregated accounts and could be comingled with other funds and used to pay Peregrine's liabilities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 237-38 (emphasis in original). Furthermore, the Bankruptcy Court had noted earlier that the contractual language at issue simply echoed CFTC statements that warned Forex customers that the laws and regulations protecting customers trading in futures contracts did not apply to Forex transactions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Peregrine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4072833\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/510/190/#p191\">\n    510 B.R. at 201-02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The District Court's extended discussion of the CEA's language and legislative history reinforces this point.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Secure Leverage Group\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4345346\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/558/226/#p250\">\n    558 B.R. at 239-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Funds derived from Forex transactions do not fall within the statutory trusts created by the CEA and given priority under the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Defendants also argue that, even if\n   <em>\n    Peregrine\n   </em>\n   does establish what the Trustee claims, the Trustee has waived his right to object to IFX's motion for entry of judgment by failing to raise this earlier on in litigation and by entering into stipulations that proactively waived most potential defenses. (IFX Reply 7, 11-13.) Neither of these attacks sway the court. First, none of the numerous cases IFX cites for the \"law of the case\" doctrine or the mandate rule are applicable here. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7) (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v. Adams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4241125\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/746/734/#p744\">\n    746 F.3d 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 744 (7th Cir. 2014), and\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The\n   <em>\n    FCStone\n   </em>\n   test case never addressed whether or not Forex funds qualified for statutory trust protection. The Seventh Circuit may have held that \"the funds in the SEG 1 Reserve account are trust property belong to FCStone and other SEG 1 Objectors,\"\n   <em>\n    FCStone II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275396,12270165\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/767/\">\n    867 F.3d at 779\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , but that is only because it-and the litigants-were still under the impression that all of the SEG 1 Defendants were, in fact, similarly situated. Furthermore, contrary to IFX's assertion that the Trustee knew about\n   <em>\n    Peregrine\n   </em>\n   for \"months\" yet did nothing, (IFX Reply 8), the Trustee could not have raised this issue before. Grede's action against IFX was stayed by Judge Zagel's order until\n   recently, and the Seventh Circuit decided\n   <em>\n    Peregrine\n   </em>\n   just one week before it decided\n   <em>\n    FCStone II.\n   </em>\n   The controlling authority did not exist throughout most of this litigation, so earlier missed \"opportunities\" (such as the Trustee's failure to raise it as an issue unique to the IFX case in a hearing on May 17, 2017) are not relevant. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   IFX Reply 6 n.2; Transcript of Proceedings, Ex. L to IFX Reply [157-6], 7:12-28:14.) The Trustee appears to have acted prudently. He raised it in the first motion he could, and in the proper context: against the lone SEG 1 Defendant to whom the defense applied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   IFX's appeals to the stipulations signed by the Trustee in August 2010 are also misguided. (IFX Reply 12; Stipulation and Order Fixing Amount of Claim Nos. 154, 156, and 164, Ex. N to IFX Reply [157-8] \"Stipulations\"). IFX claims that it and the Trustee entered into three stipulations \"so as to avoid '[unnecessary costs] and expenses associated with\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   litigation pertaining to the Claim.' \" (IFX Reply 12) (quoting Stipulations 2) (alterations in original). IFX reads too much into these documents. The Stipulations merely \"calculate and fix the claims in an amount consistent with the terms of the Plan.\" (Stipulations 2.) IFX argues that \"[n]othing in the stipulations permits the Trustee to challenge [IFX's] assertion that [IFX's funds were held in trust],\" but nothing in the Stipulations stops the Trustee from doing so either. (IFX Reply 12.) In the end, the Stipulations are irrelevant to this dispute. Judge Zagel already rejected a similar argument advanced by Defendant FCStone in the test case, stating that the Stipulations themselves even included language that they were to \" 'have no effect on' nor 'be admissible or constitute evidence' in this lawsuit.\"\n   <em>\n    Grede v. FC Stone, LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 09-cv-136,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%203263986\">\n    2012 WL 3263986\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 9, 2012) (quoting Stipulations \u00b6 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Finally, IFX asserts that its funds are nevertheless protected by \"an express written trust\" per the terms of its investment agreements with Sentinel. (IFX Reply 1, 9-11.) This begs the question that this litigation must answer.\n   <em>\n    FCStone II\n   </em>\n   held that the SEG 1 Defendants whose funds were protected by statutory trusts are entitled to recover their\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   portions of the Reserves based on the Defendants' abilities to trace their initial investments to those Reserves.\n   <em>\n    FCStone II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275396,12270165\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/767/\">\n    867 F.3d at 779\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These trusts were established by the requirements of the CEA, and the tracing fictions adopted by the Seventh Circuit apply only to those protected funds. Without those statutory trusts, the issues of dueling trusts and trust priority that led to the second\n   <em>\n    FCStone\n   </em>\n   appeal resurface. Because the Trustee argues-and\n   <em>\n    Peregrine\n   </em>\n   clearly states-that IFX is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   entitled to that same trust protection, it would be improper for this court to grant judgment based on the test case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The SEG 1 Defendants all relied on the doctrine of collateral estoppel in filing their motions for judgment. But if the issues addressed are not truly identical, then collateral estoppel does not apply to bind the Trustee in this dispute. See\n   <em>\n    Matrix IV, Inc. v. American Nat. Bank and Trust Co. of Chicago\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4183448,5714015\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/649/539/\">\n    649 F.3d 539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 547 (7th Cir. 2011) (describing the elements of collateral estoppel). By using its reply brief to argue for the existence of an express written trust under Illinois state law, IFX sends a clear signal that additional proceedings are required. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4183448,5714015\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/649/539/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) For his part, the Trustee admits that IFX may well be protected by an express written trust, but notes that IFX still must establish that fact \"after discovery and a trial or summary judgment proceedings.\" (Trustee's Sur-Reply to IFX Mot.
