See [10] (consolidating cases for \"all purposes\" and requiring \"all further filings [to] be made in the lead case 17-cv-4926\"). Plaintiffs Joseph Baines (\"Baines\") and Kenasia Daniels (\"Daniels\") (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") seek declarations that a provision of the City's municipal code, which creates a statutory possessory lien in their vehicles for unpaid traffic tickets, is preempted by federal law because it \"frustrate[s] Congress' intent to give people a new, fresh start by virtue of filing bankruptcy.\" [12] at 11. Currently before the Court is the City's motion [11] to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. For the reasons explained below, the City's motion [11] is granted. Case No. 17-cv-4926 and Case No. 17-cv-4929 are both dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STATEMENT\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following facts are alleged by Baines and assumed to be true for purposes of the City's motion to dismiss. See Amended Adversary Complaint, Docket Entry 20, Case No. 17-00242 (Bankr. N.D. Ill.) (the \"Complaint\"). The City impounded Baines' vehicle based on his accumulation of unpaid parking tickets. When Baines' vehicle was impounded, the vehicle became subject to a statutory possessory lien in favor of the City pursuant to \u00a7 9-92-80 of the Municipal Code of Chicago (\"MCC\"). The General Assembly recently amended MCC \u00a7 9-92-80 to provide that \"[a]ny vehicle impounded by the City or its designee shall be subject to a possessory lien in favor of the City in the amount required to obtain release of the vehicle.\" [11-1] at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Baines subsequently filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. Despite the statutory lien, his Plan proposes that the City be paid as a general unsecured creditor. While the bankruptcy case was pending, Baines sought to have his vehicle released without paying his parking tickets. The City refused to release Baines' vehicle because the automatic stay does not require it do so, as the Bankruptcy Court determined in\n   <em>\n    In re Avila\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272794\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/566/558/\">\n    566 B.R. 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr.

The City continues in possession of Baines' vehicle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Baines' complaint alleges that MCC \u00a7 9-92-80 is preempted by federal law because it stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purpose of the Bankruptcy Code, which he contends is \"to give Debtor[ ]s a new opportunity in life and a clear [field] for future effort, unhampered by the pressure and discouragement of preexisting debt.\" Complaint \u00b6 23. Baines further alleges that MCC \u00a7 9-92-80 frustrates the purpose of the Bankruptcy Code because it \"hold[s] the Debtor hostage to their pre-petition parking tickets by forcing the Debtor to pay back these tickets at 100% or in the alternative not retrieve possession of the vehicle.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. Daniels' complaint asserts the same basic preemption argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The City moves to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). A Rule 12(b)(6) motion challenges the legal sufficiency of the complaint. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). To survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), a plaintiffs complaint must allege facts which, when taken as true, \" 'plausibly suggest that the plaintiff has a right to relief, raising that possibility above a speculative level.' \"\n   <em>\n    Cochran v.

MCC \u00a7 9-92-80 defines the City's interest in impounded vehicles as a statutory possessory lien. The Bankruptcy Code does not prohibit the City from defining its interest in this way. If Congress had included within the Code a provision disallowing possessory liens as obstacles to a \"fresh start\" policy objective, state law of course would yield to that command under the Supremacy Clause. But the Code contains no such provision, so state and local laws still hold sway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Furthermore, beyond the absence of any Code provision to support his position, Plaintiffs' argument squarely conflicts with fundamental bankruptcy principles.
