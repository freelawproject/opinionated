Round Table 1 LLC (\"\n   <strong>\n    Round Table\n   </strong>\n   \") was among the general unsecured creditors whose debts Niko scheduled in his case. Its scheduled indebtedness is related to a Loan (as defined below) that Round Table made to entities affiliated with members of Niko's extended family. Niko executed a Loan guaranty (the \"\n   <strong>\n    Guaranty\n   </strong>\n   \") on behalf of himself and on behalf of his brother Constantine (\"\n   <strong>\n    Gus\n   </strong>\n   \") Gianopoulos, as Gus's attorney-in-fact, pursuant to a general power of attorney. Round Table received notice of Niko's\n   bankruptcy case and the deadlines applicable therein. It did not object to Niko's bankruptcy discharge, or to the dischargeability of its scheduled claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Loan is in default. In 2014, Round Table sued Gus in New York State Supreme Court, New York County (the \"\n   <strong>\n    State Court\n   </strong>\n   \") to enforce the Guaranty. In that litigation, which is pending, Gus denies that he is liable under the Guaranty, and maintains that he did not authorize Niko to execute it on his behalf. Round Table contends that it would not have made the Loan without Gus's guaranty, and that if what Gus says in that litigation is true, then Niko fraudulently induced Round Table to make the Loan. In 2016, Round Table sued Niko in State Court (the\n   <strong>\n    \"State Court Action\n   </strong>\n   \") to recover approximately $3.5 million in damages caused by Niko's alleged fraud. Niko denies liability and also asserts that his indebtedness to Round Table-including that arising from the alleged fraud-was discharged in his chapter 7 case. He made that and other arguments in the State Court in support of his unsuccessful motion to dismiss the complaint in the State Court Action. Niko is appealing that ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The matter before the Court is Niko's motion (the \"\n   <strong>\n    Motion\n   </strong>\n   \") pursuant to section 350(b) of the Bankruptcy Code,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20350\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), for an order reopening his chapter 7 case, so that he can obtain an order of this Court staying Round Table from prosecuting the State Court Action and sanctioning Round Table and its counsel for violating the Discharge Order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Round Table opposes the Motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, the Motion is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Jurisdiction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This Court has jurisdiction over the Motion pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and 157(a) and the Amended Standing Order of Referral of Cases to Bankruptcy Judges of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (M-431), dated January 31, 2102 (Preska, C.J.).

The Loan is evidenced by an agreement dated November 13, 2007 (the \"\n   <strong>\n    Loan Agreement\n   </strong>\n   \") and four promissory notes (the \"\n   <strong>\n    Promissory Notes\n   </strong>\n   \"). Niko executed the Guaranty both on his own account and on behalf of Gus, as Gus' attorney-in-fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Guaranty (R31-65).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As support for the Guaranty, Niko submitted an affidavit to Round Table dated November 7, 2007 (the \"\n   <strong>\n    Niko Affidavit\n   </strong>\n   \"), in which he represented that pursuant to a Durable General Power of Attorney dated April 12, 2006 (the \"\n   <strong>\n    Power of Attorney\n   </strong>\n   \"), a copy of which he provided to Round Table, Gus designated Niko as his attorney-in-fact, and that the Power of Attorney had not been revoked or repudiated, and was still in full force and effect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Affidavit That Power of Attorney Is In Full Force (R29), \u00b6\u00b6 1, 2;\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Power of Attorney (R25-27). In doing so, Niko confirmed the following representation and warranty contained in the Guaranty:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Niko, as attorney in fact for Gus pursuant to the certain power of attorney dated April 12, 2006, has all requisite power and authority to execute the Loan Documents and this Guaranty on behalf of Gus.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Guaranty, \u00b6 (C)(3)(d)(iv). Finally, in the Niko Affidavit, Niko stated, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   I make this affidavit for the purpose of inducing [Round Table] to make the loan set forth in that certain Loan Agreement dated as of November 13, 2007 to accept delivery of the following Instrument(s), as executed by me in my capacity as the ATTORNEY-IN-FACT, with full knowledge that this affidavit will be relied upon in accepting the execution and delivery of the Instrument(s) and in paying good and valuable consideration therefor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Niko Affidavit, \u00b6 3. The Instruments referenced in the affidavit were the Loan Agreement and Promissory Notes underlying the Guaranty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On September 13, 2010, Niko filed his voluntary chapter 7 petition herein. In amended Schedule F to his petition, Niko listed Round Table as a creditor holding an unsecured debt (the \"\n   <strong>\n    Round Table Debt\n   </strong>\n   \") that arose in 2007 on account of a \"Personal/Business Loan\" in an \"unknown\" amount. [ECF No. 16]. Judge Peck fixed December 6, 2010 (the \"\n   <strong>\n    Objection Deadline\n   </strong>\n   \") as the last day of the period (the \"\n   <strong>\n    Objection Period\n   </strong>\n   \") in which creditors could file objections to Niko's bankruptcy discharge, and for filing complaints objecting to the dischargeability of debts of the sort designated in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). [ECF No. 7]. The Clerk of this Court provided all scheduled creditors, including Round Table, with notice of Niko's bankruptcy and the Objection Deadline. On January 31, 2011, the chapter 7 trustee in Niko's case filed a no-asset report of distribution. Neither Round Table nor any other party in interest objected to Niko's discharge in bankruptcy or to the dischargeability of any particular debt. On February 9, 2011, Judge Peck entered the Discharge Order and final decree [ECF No. 25], and thereafter, closed Niko's no asset chapter 7 case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Borrowers defaulted under the Loan Agreement. In 2014, Round Table filed multiple actions against Gus in the State Court seeking to enforce the Guaranty. In support of his motions to dismiss those actions, Gus submitted substantially identical affidavits in which he denied any knowledge of the Guaranty, and asserted that he did not \"ever give [his] consent to anyone to sign the ... Guaranty on [his] behalf.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Affidavit of Constantine Gianopoulos, sworn to July 21, 2014 (R76-84), \u00b6 6. Moreover, after noting that \"[his] signature does not appear anywhere on the ... Guaranty,\" he contended that \"Round Table has not provided any evidence whatsoever to show that [he] authorized [Niko] ... to sign the ... Guaranty on [his] behalf.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    at \u00b6 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The gravamen of the Complaint is that if what Gus says in his affidavits is true, \"then Niko fraudulently swore to and signed false instruments in order to induce Round Table to loan almost $3.5 million without any plan or intention for Round Table to be paid back.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    at \u00b6 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    at \u00b6 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[I]f Niko lied, as his brother's sworn testimony indicates, then Niko committed fraud to induce Round Table to loan millions of dollars that neither brother had any intention of paying.\").

Although Round Table acknowledges that Niko has filed for personal bankruptcy and obtained a discharge of his obligations, it nonetheless alleges that the \"bankruptcy did not discharge Niko from fraud under applicable bankruptcy law, nor specifically from the fraud claim that arises in this case, as the fraud could not have been and was not discovered (or discoverable) until July 21, 2014 when Gus first swore under oath that no one had authority to bind him to the Guaranty (long after Niko's bankruptcy proceeding was concluded), thereby calling into question for the first time Niko's authority to sign the Guaranty on Gus'[ ] behalf, as well as the Niko Affidavit where Niko swore under oath that he had full power to bind Gus in connection with the Round Table Loan.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    at \u00b6 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    at \u00b6 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alleging that \"Niko's fraud could not have been discovered in the exercise of reasonable diligence, as such fraud did not come to light until Gus testified against Niko's interest by swearing that Gus did not give consent to be bound the Guaranty.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Niko did not answer or otherwise respond to the Complaint. Accordingly, on September 9, 2016, Round Table moved for the entry of an Order and Judgment pursuant to Rule 3215 of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules (the \"\n   <strong>\n    CPLR\"\n   </strong>\n   ) directing entry of a default judgment against Niko for all the relief requested by Round Table in the Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Motion for Default Judgment (R1-139). In response thereto, Niko filed (i) a cross-motion to vacate the default, and (ii) a motion to dismiss the Complaint (the \"\n   <strong>\n    Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n   \")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (R140-244). Round Table opposed both motions. The State Court vacated the default, but denied the Motion to Dismiss. Only the latter is germane to the matter before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Niko sought to dismiss the Complaint pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(2), (5) and (7), on the grounds that the State Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the State Court Action, the action was barred by the Discharge Order, and the Complaint failed to state a claim for relief against him, respectively. Niko argued that by application of \u00a7\u00a7 523(a)(2) and 523(c) of the Bankruptcy Code, fraud claims like the one asserted in the State Court Action, are discharged in a bankruptcy case, unless the bankruptcy court (and only the bankruptcy court) determines otherwise pursuant to a timely filed objection (here, prior to the Objection Deadline) to the dischargeability of that claim. He contended that since there is not dispute that Round Table had notice of the Objection Deadline, and that it did not object to the dischargeability of the Round Table Debt, it follows that the Round Table Debt (including any liability based on fraud) was discharged pursuant to the Discharge Order. Moreover, he asserted that, in any event, the State Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to determine whether that debt was procured by fraud, because the bankruptcy court has the exclusive jurisdiction to make that determination. In opposing Niko's motion, Round Table contended that under state law, it has two claims against Niko associated with the Guaranty. One is a contract claim to enforce the Guaranty (the \"\n   <strong>\n    Contract Claim\n   </strong>\n   \"). The other is the fraud claim (the \"\n   <strong>\n    Fraud Claim\n   </strong>\n   \") which is based upon Niko's alleged misrepresentations \"outside the four corners of the loan documents,\" that allegedly induced Round Table to make the Loan. In focusing on whether the Fraud Claim had been discharged in Niko's chapter 7 case, Round Table contended that the Discharge Order did not extend to that claim because, as alleged in the Complaint, Round Table was unaware of the Fraud Claim, and could not have discovered it until 2014. Round Table maintained that to find otherwise, would deny it its rights to due process. Round Table also contended that because the Fraud Claim was not impacted by the bankruptcy case, the State Court had jurisdiction to adjudicate the merits of that claim. On June 8, 2017, the State Court heard argument on the Motion to Dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Transcript of June 8, 2017 hearing (R427-464) (\"\n   <strong>\n    Transcript\n   </strong>\n   \"). At the close of the argument, and by order of that date (the \"\n   <strong>\n    June 8 Order\n   </strong>\n   \"), the State Court denied Niko's motion to dismiss the State Court Action, and directed Niko to answer the Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   June 8 Order (R424).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   On July 14, 2017, Niko filed\n   a notice of appeal of the State Court Order in the Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Judicial Department.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Appeal, Schriever Decl., Ex. 9.

I do think that there is a distinction between Niko acting on his own behalf, a guarantee that he did list in his bankruptcy proceeding, and Niko acted on behalf of another. So, in essence, he was two people: One of them, a good actor, one of them, a bad actor.... And so, under all these circumstances and the way the complaint is phrased, if the Court were to take as true that Niko knew at the time that he wore the hat as having the power of attorney, that he did not have the power of attorney, that he gave this assurance that the power of attorney was in effect and permitted him to do what he was doing on behalf of Gus, that that would be stating a fraud claim, and that is not protected under [section 523(a).] .... So, under those circumstances, I am going to allow the action to continue, give you an opportunity to file an answer to the complaint. And, clearly, the issue to be decided is whether or not Niko knew that he did not have the authority to enter into the guarantee on behalf of Gus. And because that is a central issue, it must be joined with the action as against Gus ...\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Transcript. at 32:16-33:17.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    Section 523(c)(1) states, as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n    Except as provided in subsection (a)(3)(B) of this section, the debtor shall be discharged from a debt of a kind specified in paragraph (2), (4), or (6) of subsection (a) of this section, unless, on request of the creditor to whom such debt is owed, and after notice and a hearing, the court determines such debt to be excepted from discharge under paragraph (2), (4), or (6), as the case may be, of subsection (a) of this section.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (c)(1).
