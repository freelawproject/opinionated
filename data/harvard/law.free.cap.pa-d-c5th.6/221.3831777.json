Plaintiff Grooms was hit from the rear by defendant Ems so there was no contest as to liability. This case was tried between October 31, 2005 and November 2,2005, before this court with a jury. On November 2, 2005, the jury rendered a verdict in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">This court believes that the jury was unfairly influenced by the prejudicial question of defendant\u2019s counsel propounded to plaintiff Grooms on cross-examination concerning the amount that she purportedly received in a 1998 workers\u2019 compensation action. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel moved for a mistrial which this court took under advisement. This court, believing that said jury verdict could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>not be allowed to stand, granted a new trial to plaintiff Grooms.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">In response to this court\u2019s order pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) dated January 20, 2006, the defendant has filed a statement of matters complained of on appeal. However, the defendant has not filed a concise<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> statement as Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) requires. Therefore, this court will set forth the issue essentially raised in the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">ISSUE PRESENTED</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Whether this court improperly granted a new trial to plaintiff based on the prejudicial question that defendant\u2019s counsel asked the plaintiff on cross-examination?</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">LAWDISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">The grant of a new trial is a matter peculiarly within the competence of the trial court. The trial court\u2019s discretion is considerable and its action will not be disturbed on appeal except where there has been a clear abuse of discretion, <em>Cooley </em>v. <em>Jefferson Bank, </em>355 Pa. Super 1, 512 A.2d 713 (1986). In an action where damages are sought, any statement to the jury by counsel that calls the jurors\u2019 attention to claims or amounts not supported by the evidence is prejudicial, <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>437 Pa. 254, 258 A.2d 657 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">Here, defendant\u2019s counsel brought into the trial a spurious question as to whether the plaintiff had received a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>payment of $100,000 in a prior workers\u2019 compensation case entirely unrelated to the current action. Knowledge of this sum of money received by plaintiff could only prejudice the plaintiff\u2019s case in front of the jury. In naming an amount which had previously been paid to plaintiff, counsel was suggesting to the jury something which in their minds takes the place of evidence. This question was clearly inflammatory and made the grant of a new trial by this court necessary because of the injustice of the jury\u2019s verdict. The jury was obviously influenced by this prejudicial question.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">In <em>Clark v. Essex Wire Corporation, </em>361 Pa. 60, 63 A.2d 35 (1949), the Supreme Court said at pages 65 and 37, respectively:</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">\u201cThis court has said that the propriety of counsel\u2019s arguments and remarks to the jury is to be determined by the trial court under all the existing facts and circumstances at trial and that an application... [for a mistrial] ... is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court, and the refusal of a motion to that effect, because of objectionable remarks to the jury by counsel, is reviewable for abuse of discretion only.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">Under all the existing facts and circumstances at this trial, this court could not allow the jury\u2019s verdict to stand because of defense counsel\u2019s prejudicial question.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">Accordingly, the grant of a new trial for p) aintiff should be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b236-10\">. Defendant Steven Coleman was the owner of the vehicle and not the driver. Accordingly, he was dismissed from the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b236-11\">. Plaintiff Jesse Grooms had a claim for loss of consortium but failed to appear at the arbitration hearing. Therefore, this court dismissed his claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b237-10\">. The statement filed by defendant is five pages long with 15 enumerated paragraphs.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
