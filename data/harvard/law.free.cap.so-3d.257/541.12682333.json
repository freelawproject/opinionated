This Court treated the petition as one for writ of certiorari and denied it by order. In response, Ruffenach filed a lengthy motion for rehearing, rehearing en banc, clarification, certification, and/or written opinion. He was not entirely without justification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In his motion, Ruffenach correctly presents that he did not seek relief under certiorari review because the law clearly provides that the striking of a demand for jury trial is not reviewable by certiorari.\n   <em>\n    Jaye v. Royal Saxon, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11805178\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/720/214/#p215\">\n    720 So.2d 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 215 (Fla. 1998). The merits panel was well aware of the case law and reviewed the relief sought as it was fashioned. The final order should have reflected that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   However, our review led us to the same conclusion: the lower court's decision to strike the request for a jury trial is a non-appealable, non-final order not subject to mandamus review. Mandamus was designed to compel the performance of a specific, imperative ministerial duty, not to review allegedly erroneous judicial decisions.\n   <em>\n    Migliore v. City of Lauderhill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9532340\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/415/62/#p63\">\n    415 So.2d 62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 63 (Fla. 4th DCA 1982),\n   <em>\n    aff'd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9538851\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/431/986/\">\n    431 So.2d 986\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 1983).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Contrary to Ruffenach's argument, no other district court of appeal has held otherwise. Ruffenach's reliance on a footnote in\n   <em>\n    Department of Natural Resources v. Estech, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7572314\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/515/758/\">\n    515 So.2d 758\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 759 n.2 (Fla. 2d DCA 1987), is misplaced.\n   <em>\n    Estech\n   </em>\n   , which also addressed a challenge to the striking of a demand for a jury trial, was decided in the context of a petition for writ of certiorari, and in light of the Florida Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Jaye\n   </em>\n   , is no longer good law. Further, citation to a footnote speculating as to whether mandamus would have been a proper vehicle for the challenge hardly constitutes authority for that proposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The appellate landscape has changed dramatically from the days of common law writs. We now primarily look to the Florida Constitution and the appellate rules for a determination of jurisdiction. Neither provides a basis for relief from the order entered below. The lower court's ruling interpreted the language of a contract containing a clause waiving the right to a trial by jury. If the lower court erred in its interpretation, and if Ruffenach does not prevail following trial and entry of a final judgment, his remedy will follow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Accordingly, we grant the motion for rehearing, motion for clarification, and motion for written opinion. We deny the petition for mandamus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   EISNAUGLE and HARRIS, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
