For the reasons that follow, we reverse the Civil Service Commission's ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For nine (9) years, Officer Cunningham, was a permanent, classified employee who served as a police officer with the New Orleans Police Department (\"NOPD\"), most recently assigned to the gang unit. On the evening of January 12, 2015, Officer Cunningham, his girlfriend Tiffany Junot (\"Ms. Junot\"), and a female friend visited different restaurants and bars to eat dinner and enjoy live music. After a disagreement with Officer Cunningham,\n   Ms. Junot left the restaurant and returned to \"her\" apartment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Shortly thereafter, Officer Cunningham arrived at Ms. Junot's apartment and used his keys to unlock the outer metal door and the front door deadbolt. However, he was unable to gain entry into the apartment because Ms. Junot had engaged two metal security latches on the front door that prohibited the door from opening more than a few inches. Officer Cunningham rang the doorbell numerous times and yelled to Ms. Junot, but she did not respond. Next, Officer Cunningham forced his way into the apartment, using his hip and legs to break through the security latches, which damaged the door frame. According to Officer Cunningham, upon his entry into the apartment, Ms. Junot physically attacked him by scratching his face with her fingernails and punching him in the face; he testified that he kept his arms at his sides and did not strike Ms. Junot.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Officer Cunningham further testified that he exited the apartment briefly, then re-entered the apartment; at that point, Ms. Junot called the police, began hitting and kicking him, and instructed him to leave. Officer Cunningham waited outside the apartment for NOPD to arrive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Upon their arrival, Officer Cunningham was transported to University Hospital to receive medical treatment for his injuries; however, Officer Cunningham refused medical treatment for his facial lacerations. While at the hospital, Officer Cunningham submitted to Reasonable Suspicion Alcohol and Drug Testing (breathalyzer), which showed his blood alcohol content was 0.125%, an amount in excess of the legal limit allowed for operating a motor vehicle. NOPD placed Officer Cunningham on emergency suspension. He was transported to the Public Integrity Bureau where he met with his attorney and declined to provide a statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On January 13, 2015, Officer Cunningham was arrested and charged with violating La. R.S. 14:35, to wit, simple battery and La. R.S. 14:62.8, to wit: home invasion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Orleans Parish District Attorney's Office refused the charges. NOPD conducted an internal disciplinary investigation and found him to be in violation of the following: (1) Moral Conduct Rule 2, Paragraph 1 Adherence to Law, specifically La. R.S. 14:35 - Simple Battery;\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Moral Conduct Rule 2, Paragraph 1 Adherence to Law, specifically La. R.S. 14:62.8 - Home Invasion; and (3) Professional Conduct Rule 3, Paragraph 9 Use of Alcohol/Drugs Off-duty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 2, 2016, a disciplinary hearing was held, but Officer Cunningham declined to attend. On March 17, 2016, NOPD, through its Superintendent of Police, Michael Harrison, issued Officer Cunningham a discipline letter advising him of his termination based on the aforementioned three (3) violations. Thereafter, Officer Cunningham filed an appeal with the Civil Service Commission (\"CSC\"). On June 29, 2017, the CSC conducted a hearing in this matter and rendered its opinion on October 17, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The CSC held that NOPD failed to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Officer Cunningham violated Moral Conduct Rule 2, Paragraph 1 Adherence to Law, specifically La. R.S. 14:35 - Simple Battery, as well as, Moral Conduct Rule 2, Paragraph 1 Adherence to Law, specifically La. R.S. 14:62.8 - Home Invasion. However, the CSC held that Officer Cunningham violated Professional Conduct Rule 3, Paragraph 9 Use of Alcohol/Drugs Off-duty and upheld NOPD's discipline of termination. It is from the CSC's October 17, 2017 ruling that Officer Cunningham filed the instant appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In summary, Officer Cunningham's assignments of error address whether the CSC abused its discretion and acted arbitrarily and capriciously by upholding NOPD's termination for his violation of Professional Conduct Rule 3, Paragraph 9 Use of Alcohol/Drugs Off-duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In consideration of an appeal from a ruling by the CSC, the Louisiana Supreme Court has pronounced that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [a]n employee with permanent status in the classified civil service cannot be subject to disciplinary action by his employer except for cause expressed in writing.

When reviewing the Commission's findings of fact, the appellate court must apply the clearly wrong or manifestly erroneous standard.

The CSC reasoned that Officer Cunningham's BAC exceeded 0.08%, the maximum allowable amount to operate a motor vehicle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Also, Officer Cunningham admitted to consuming alcoholic beverages; however, it is worth noting that Officer Cunningham has not been accused of operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   At the hearing, NOPD had the burden of proving that Officer Cunningham's conduct impairs the efficiency of the department and that his conduct bears a real and substantial relationship to the efficient operation of the department.

For a first offense, this violation carries a penalty range of a thirty (30) day suspension to dismissal. By contrast, the NOPD Penalty Schedule defines category 2 as a moderate offense that \"(a) [m]ay affect the rights or liberties of another; (b) [i]nvolves only an administrative investigation or violation; and/or (c) [m]ay affect job performance.\" For a first offense, this violation carries a penalty range of a five (5) to thirty (30) day suspension. Finally, the NOPD Penalty Schedule defines category 1 as a minor offense that \"(a) [d]oes not affect the rights or liberties of another; (b) [i]nvolves only an administrative investigation or violation; and/or (c) [d]oes not affect job performance.\" For a first offense, this violation carries a penalty range from a reprimand to a ten (10) day suspension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   After our review of the record, we find that the CSC erred in failing to amend Officer Cunningham's violation of Professional Conduct Rule 3, Paragraph 9 Use of Alcohol/Drugs Off-duty from a category 3 offense to a category 1 offense because he did not commit a serious criminal violation, as well as this being Officer Cunningham's first offense. As stated previously, public intoxication is either a municipal code violation or a misdemeanor. Under no circumstance, however, does it rise to the level of a serious criminal charge. Moreover, nowhere in the record before this Court has it been identified that Officer Cunningham ever operated a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Thus, his self-admitted public intoxication can only be one of two violations, to wit: disturbing the peace, a misdemeanor offense, or public intoxication, a municipal code violation. Therefore, we hold that the CSC abused its discretion and acted arbitrarily and capriciously in finding that NOPD's termination of Officer Cunningham was the proper discipline for violating Professional Conduct Rule 3, Paragraph 9 Use of Alcohol/Drugs Off-duty. For that reason, we reverse the CSC's termination of Officer Cunningham. Further, it is ordered that NOPD reinstate Officer Cunningham, subject to a ten (10) day suspension, which is the penalty outlined in the NOPD's disciplinary hearings and penalty schedule for a first offense municipal, off-duty violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DECREE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   For the aforementioned reasons, we find that the CSC abused its discretion and acted arbitrarily and capriciously. Accordingly, we reverse the CSC's upholding of NOPD's termination of Officer Cunningham. Further, it is ordered that NOPD reinstate Officer Cunningham, subject to a ten (10) day suspension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    REVERSED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   ATKINS, J., CONCURS WITH REASONS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   ATKINS, J., CONCURS WITH REASONS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   I agree with the majority's opinion and write to assign additional reasons why I believe a lesser form of disciplinary action is appropriate in the case of Officer Cunningham.

Applying\n   <em>\n    Michel\n   </em>\n   , a 10-day suspension would have been more appropriate for Consumption of Alcohol Off-duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Likewise, in\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   , 2016-0677 (La.

Officer Bell was charged with two violations - Hit and Run and Consumption of Alcohol while Off Duty - and the Appointing Authority succeeded in proving that Bell had \"consumed alcoholic beverages ..., was intoxicated, and seriously damaged her car and that of another while driving home late at night.\" 2016-0677, p. 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12364515\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/216/819/\">\n    216 So.3d at 824\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the majority opinion in the present case notes, however, there is no evidence that Officer Cunningham operated a motor vehicle while intoxicated, and the CSC determined that the Appointing Authority did not succeed in proving any additional charges against Cunningham.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

Officer Brown was charged with lack of professionalism, improper use of alcohol while off-duty, and failure to adhere to law (municipal battery) and was dismissed. Brown was not terminated merely for consuming alcohol off-duty; he was terminated for his aggressive behavior. 2008-0466, pp. 9-10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8187857\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/999/1178/\">\n    999 So. 2d at 1183-84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In sum, where the Appointing Authority has succeeded in proving compound infractions of Departmental policy, this Court has determined that termination is not an arbitrary and capricious imposition of discipline. Where there is a single instance of Consumption of Alcohol while Off-duty with no additional charges proven, the discipline imposed is not commensurate with the infraction, and termination was arbitrary and capricious. For these additional reasons, I concur in the result finding that Officer Cunningham should be reinstated.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    At the time of the incidents giving rise to his dismissal, Officer Cunningham and Ms. Junot agreed to reside together at her apartment.
