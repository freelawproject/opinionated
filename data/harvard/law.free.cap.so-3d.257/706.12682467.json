In the \"First Supplemental and Amending Petition,\" Glenn Richardson and Laci Soileau joined as additional Plaintiffs adopting all claims made by the original Plaintiffs and seeking the same relief for damages. Plaintiffs filed a \"Motion to Certify Class\" seeking to convert this suit to a class action pursuant to the provisions of La. Code Civ.P. art. 591, asserting there are approximately 11,700 potential putative class members who have sustained injuries as a result of Defendant's alleged actions and inactions concerning their supplying water to the local population served by (CWC). After a full hearing on the matter the trial court rendered judgment granting Plaintiffs' motion for class certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The trial court defined the class as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   All persons, businesses, or entities who belong to at least one of the following three groups, and who as a direct result of receiving their water service from Cecelia Water Corporation between December 1, 2010 and February 2015, have at least one of the following claims: mental and emotional distress; non-reimbursed personal expenses, non-reimbursed business expenses; loss of personal income; loss of business income; nuisance, annoyance, discomfort, and inconvenience; trespass; personal injury including fear of contraction of disease or illness; economic damages or property damage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   1.

Owners and/or occupants of businesses, schools or health care facilities who at any time between December 1, 2010 and February 28, 2015, were receiving their water supply to that business, school, or health care facility from the Cecelia Water Corporation;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   3. Lessor/Lessees of residential and/or commercial property who at any time between December 1, 2010 and February 28, 2015, were receiving their water supply to that property from the Cecelia Water Corporation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The trial court also confirmed Jacqueline Berard and Glenn Richardson as representatives of the class and confirmed Jacques Pierre Soileau and W. Glenn Soileau as counsel for the Class. Further, the trial court prohibited any contact between defense counsel and the class representatives or class members regarding this class action suit \"unless otherwise approved by [the] Court in advance.\" The trial court rendered an eight-page written reasons for judgment setting forth its findings of fact and detailing its reasons for concluding Plaintiffs satisfied the numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy requirements of La. Code Civ.P. art 591(A) as well as its reasons for identifying an objectively definable class of claimants. Plaintiffs also presented evidence satisfying \"one or more criteria of La.C.C.P. art. 591(B)\" according to the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendants appeal the trial court's order granting class certification and the trial court's definition of the class, asserting the trial court failed to \"perform a rigorous analysis of the claims and defenses presented.\" They also assert Plaintiffs failed to establish commonality, predominance and superiority \"because they cannot prove breach, causation, and damages on a class-wide basis.\" Additionally, Defendants maintain the trial court erroneously based its finding of \"numerosity\" on the \"number of potentially aggrieved parties\" rather than on the \"number of individuals actually aggrieved.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    LAW AND ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The supreme court has made clear \"any errors to be made in deciding class action issues should be in favor of and not against the maintenance of the class action.\"\n   <em>\n    McCastle v.

The record is replete with evidence which wholly supports the trial court's well-reasoned decision regarding class certification and its thoughtful definition of the class. Further, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court's ultimate decision to grant certification of this matter as a class action. We are impressed with the trial court's detailed reasons for judgment and quote at length its findings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs, customers of Cecelia water Corporation (\"Cecelia\"), have brought this suit against Cecelia alleging continued problems with water quality and quantity. They have alleged that over the course of several years Cecelia has provided water of inadequate quality and quantity. As of 2014 the Defendant Cecelia Water Corporation had roughly 3,776 customers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   As to water quantity, Plaintiffs have alleged that water is regularly rendered by Cecelia to their homes as low to no water pressure. The evidence shows that the Cecelia Water Corporation has had continual and ongoing problems with water pressure and providing water to its customers in adequate amounts. In 1996 an extensive engineering report was written documenting Cecelia's inability to meet demand and Cecelia's low water pressure problems. The 1996 report recommended that a new plant be built on the Western end of the system at the D'Augerau Road location. Recognizing this continuing low-pressure problem, Cecelia has continued to discuss building a new plant at the D'Augerau Road location over the years. However, to date no new plant has been built.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Despite the documented demand problems, Cecelia has continued adding water lines and customers to its system throughout the years. Cecelia applied for a rate increase to the Louisiana Public Service Commission (LPSC), again noting the demand problems with their system and their inability to provide adequate amounts of water to the existing customer base. The proposed rate increase would cover the cost of a new plant at the D'Augereau Road location. This solution had been identified and proposed sixteen (16) years earlier in the 1996 engineering report. The 2011 rate increase to build the new plant was ultimately granted by the LPSC. Cecelia customers have been paying for a new plant now for over five years now. (sic) That plant has still not even begun to be built.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   In 2015 Cecelia applied for a second rate increase with the LPSC, again citing the problems with demand and the need to build a new plant at the D'augereau Road location. The LPSC denied Cecelia's second rate increase application. The LPSC stated that one rate increase had already been granted for the new plant and Cecelia had still not even begun the construction of that plant. Customers had bene paying for the new plant all the while.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Separately, in 2014 Cecelia applied for a USDA loan in order to build the new plant. With that loan application Cecelia's engineer, Dale Leblanc, submitted a 2014 engineering report again detailing the pressure and demand problems with the Cecelia water system. Dale Leblanc testified that he began working for Cecelia in 2006, and that he has been discussing building the new plant with the Cecelia board since he began working there.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Corroborating the continuous pressure and demand problems documented by Cecelia's records, the class representatives and customers across the system have testified to regular water pressure problems. Aside from the regular pressure problems generally, the class representatives and other Cecelia customers have testified that they experienced specific no or low water pressure events in 2010, 2013, and 2014. During these events customers had little to no water. Customers could not bathe, flush toilets, and had to purchase bottled water. Alan Blanchard, a representative of St. Martin Parish School Board, testified that in 2014 all four of the public schools in Cecelia had to close because of low water pressure. Cathy Miles-Castille, the owner of the Holiday Inn in Cecelia, testified that many of the businesses around her hotel had to close in 2014 due to the low or no water pressure event. She testifies that her customers had no water and had to get buckets of water from the hotel swimming pool in order to flush their toilets. She also testified that she had to load up all of the hotel linens and bring them to a laundromat for cleaning during this event. Further, she had to supply all of her customers with bottled water during the periods of outage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   The customers' testimony describing these events are consistent with Cecelia's own records indicating that in 2014 two separate Boil Advisories had to be issued due to the low-pressure events. Additionally, in 2014 Cecelia sent out a low-pressure letter to all of its customers detailing the low-pressure problems. The letter explained that the low-pressure event was the result of tremendous strain on the system, which resulted in malfunctioning wells at the plant. Likewise, Cecelia's board minutes document a 2013 low pressure event that is consistent with the customers' testimony who have indicated that they experienced a low or no water pressure event during this time period. Cecelia also sent out a water conservation letter to all customers during this time period directing its customers to conserve their water usage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Customers testifying to the pressure problems, also testified to discolored water, excessive water sediments, and foul-smelling water. Customers and business owners have testified to having ice machine damage because of excessive water sediment, and clothes ruined because of the discolored water. Customers also testified that they were concerned with the levels of Arsenic in Cecelia's water. Cecelia has been issuing water quality reports (\"Consumer Confidence Reports\") to all of its customers since at least 2010 indicating that the Arsenic in Cecelia's water exceeds regulatory levels. These annual reports also warn all customers that consuming water with Arsenic could cause cancer and other serious health problems. Some customers have testified that they buy bottled water in order to avoid these health risks. The Court finds the testimony of these customers credible and consistent with Cecelia's records.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The trial court then continued to explain its finding based on the evidence presented\n   in each of the categories set forth on La. Code Civ.P. art. 591. Our review of the record discloses no abuse of discretion by the trial court. The record supports more than a reasonable basis for the findings of fact chronicled in accurate detail by the trial court as set forth above. In fact, the most compelling evidence and testimony supporting the reasonableness of the trial court's findings is supplied by Cecelia's own records and witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In its various engineering reports, applications for rate increases, and boil water notices Cecelia acknowledged its \"problems with low pressure\" system-wide and that both its storage and distribution/treatment capability \"is not adequate to handle demand.\" It further acknowledged its system \"does not meet the current Louisiana Department of Health Hospital requirements\" nor is the system up to the \"Ten States Standards\" and is \"not adequate to serve all of [its] existing customers.\" Cecelia further acknowledged that the current demand for water by its customers \"has exceeded supply of\n   <em>\n    both pressure and quantity\n   </em>\n   \" requiring it to purchase water from its neighbor, Breaux Bridge. But, it admits in its reports, that even this effort has not resulted in \"increase[ing] the total system pressure.\" In fact, Cecelia's own engineering report refers to its purchase of water from Breaux Bridge as \"only a temporary solution\" to its multiple problems and lack of ability to adequately and safely supply its customers. Two boil water notices were issued to\n   <em>\n    all of its customers\n   </em>\n   after the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals \"document[ed] low water pressure in the water system.\" Additionally, minutes of Cecelia's board meeting chronicle issues with low water pressure. Finally, even Cecelia admits that if the evidence at trial shows that Arsenic contamination is in fact present at levels exceeding regulatory standards, this poses a serious health threat to all who have consumed water supplied by Cecelia during the operative time frame defined by the trial court. Clearly, class action, as a procedural device, is appropriate in this case where such pervasive system-wide problems admittedly exist and affect all customers.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Louisiana courts are authorized to reference both federal and state class action jurisprudence in the interpretation and application of the statutory requirements for class actions.\n   <em>\n    Duhe v.

This prerequisite shall not be satisfied if it is necessary for the court to inquire into the merits of each potential class member's cause of action to determine whether an individual falls within the defined class.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   B. An action may be maintained as a class action only if all of the prerequisites of Paragraph A of this Article are satisfied, and in addition:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (1) The prosecution of separate actions by or against individual members of the class would create a risk of:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (a) Inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which would establish incompatible standards of conduct for the party opposing the class, or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (b) Adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which would as a practical matter be dispositive of the interests of the other members not parties to the adjudications or substantially impair or impede their ability to protect their interests; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (2) The party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (3) The court finds that the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy. The matters pertinent to these findings include:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   (a) The interest of the members of the class in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   (b) The extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already commenced by or against members of the class;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   (c) The desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation in the particular forum;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   (d) The difficulties likely to be encountered in the management of a class action;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   (e) The practical ability of individual class members to pursue their claims without class certification;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   (f) The extent to which the relief plausibly demanded on behalf of or against the class, including the vindication of such public policies or legal rights as may be implicated, justifies the costs and burdens of class litigation; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   (4) The parties to a settlement request certification under Subparagraph B(3) for purposes of settlement, even though the requirements of Subparagraph B(3) might not otherwise be met.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   C.

To the contrary, as demonstrated in the lengthy quote from the trial court's reasons for judgment, all of which are amply supported by the record as we have detailed above, it is clear to us the trial court delved deeply into Plaintiffs' allegations, heard a significant amount of testimony, and viewed compelling documentary evidence, especially Cecelia's own documents.

This means it affects all of Cecelia's customers, both individual residents as well as local schools, businesses and churches. Evidence was presented demonstrating that through the years individual residents as well as witnesses for the school and the Holiday Inn hotel all complained of problems with low or no water pressure and the resulting difficulties including health risks, inconvenience, and added costs. It may be that some consumers are unaware of the problems with the water system or the cause of the problem or it may be that some will not want to file a lawsuit or even join in this class action. But that is not determinative of the question of certification of this litigation as a class action. Defendants say that predominance is also not met here for the interwoven reason that damages suffered by Plaintiffs and class members are or will be individualized and thus prevents a finding of common issues that will be resolved in the class action. This argument, too, is without merit. The allegations of arsenic contamination endangering the health of any and all who drank or bathed in the water, poor water quality, and low or no water pressure resulting in what are really common inconveniences and a common threat to the health of all of the customers results from the admitted systemwide problem.
