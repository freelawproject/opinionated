On August 17, 2015, the indictment was amended from one count of first degree murder to one count of second degree murder, in violation of La.R.S. 14:30.1(A)(2), and Defendant waived a formal reading of the bill of indictment. Through his counsel, Defendant entered a plea of not guilty, and requested a trial by jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A \"Motion for Psychiatric Examination of Defendant for Competency and for Insanity and Notice of Insanity Defense\" and a \"Motion and Order for Sanity Commission\" were filed by Defendant's counsel on September 22, 2015. On the same date, Defendant's counsel also filed a \"Motion to Change Plea,\" and Defendant changed his plea to not guilty by reason of insanity. Defendant was evaluated, and the results were submitted to the court, after which Defendant was found competent to stand trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 26, 2017, following a trial by jury, Defendant was convicted of both the second degree murder and obstruction of justice charges. At the September 11, 2017 sentencing hearing, Defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment without the benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence as to the second degree murder charge and forty years at hard labor as to the obstruction of justice charge, to run consecutively to the second degree murder sentence, and Defendant was given credit for time served.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On September 14, 2017, Defendant filed a \"Motion for Appeal and Designation of Record\" in the trial court, which was granted on the same date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On February 21, 2015, Vermilion Parish Sheriff's deputies responded to a call regarding a burned vehicle in an isolated area about ten miles from Lake Arthur, Louisiana, in Gueydan, Louisiana. Based on paperwork recovered from the vehicle, it was traced to Charles Raymond Talen, a seventy-four-year-old man who lived in Lake Arthur, Louisiana. Jefferson Davis Parish deputies where contacted, and they went to Mr. Talen's home to check on him. There they discovered his body lying on the floor covered in blood, and his hands and feet were duct taped and tied with rope.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Authorities determined that Defendant and Brett Hebert planned to rob Mr. Talen. After waiting for hours outside of his home, they called Mr. Talen and told him that he had a package at his gate, which he went outside to retrieve. Defendant and Hebert then confronted Mr. Talen, hit him, and entered the home with Mr. Talen at gunpoint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Mr. Talen grabbed a revolver out of his desk and pointed it at Hebert. Armed with an AK-47, Hebert shot at the floor. Defendant then hit Mr. Talen several times, and Mr. Talen hit his head as he fell. Defendant and Hebert found Mr. Talen's safe and used one of his vehicles to take it from the home. They were able to open the safe with a crow bar and hammer. After retrieving gold coins and paperwork from the safe, they dumped it into a river. They also attempted to get rid of their clothes by dumping them into the river as well. They then placed the duct tape, ski masks, and other items they had used into Mr. Talen's car and set it on fire in an attempt to destroy the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ERRORS PATENT\n    </em>\n    :\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In accordance with La. Code Crim.P. art. 920, all appeals are reviewed by this court for errors patent on the face of the record. After reviewing the record, we find that there are no errors patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR NUMBERS ONE AND TWO\n    </em>\n    :\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We will combine these assigned errors as they are interrelated. As such, we will adjudicate them under one heading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In Defendant's first assignment of error, he alleges that the trial court erred when it ordered an eighteen-year-old offender to serve excessive consecutive sentences of life in prison without benefits for the second degree murder conviction and a maximum sentence of forty years at hard labor for the obstruction of justice conviction. He separates this assignment into three parts: a) the denial of parole for the second degree murder conviction was excessive; b) the maximum sentence of forty years for the obstruction of justice conviction was excessive; and c) the consecutive sentences are not justified by the record, the trial court failed to give reasons to support imposing consecutive sentences, and the imposition of consecutive sentences is excessive. We find no merit to Defendant's arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In his second assignment of error, Defendant stated that should we find that his first assignment of error was precluded from review or limited to a bare excessiveness claim for failure to file a motion to reconsider sentence, then he was denied effective assistance of counsel because of this failure. We find that Defendant's claim is limited, so discussion of this and Defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel follow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   This court recently discussed a similar claim in\n   <em>\n    State v.

Failure to file a motion to reconsider sentence in itself does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.

Although the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Monceaux\n   </em>\n   did not point specifically to the denial of parole as the reason for excessiveness, he did allege that because of his youth and diminished mental capacity the imposition of a mandatory life sentence without benefits of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence was unconstitutionally excessive, and his attorney's failure to file a motion to reconsider sentence constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Monceaux\n   </em>\n   , this court noted that the defendant pointed to \"no jurisprudence indicating\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   is applicable to anyone other than juveniles.\"\n   <em>\n    Monceaux\n   </em>\n   , 17-1052, p. 3.

Further, like the defendants in\n   <em>\n    Monceaux\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Little\n   </em>\n   , Defendant's argument here is based on his youth. In both of those cases, just as here, the defendants were examined by commissions to determine their competence to stand trial, and all were found competent to proceed.\n   <em>\n    Monceaux\n   </em>\n   , 17-1052.\n   <em>\n    Little\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12182011\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/200/400/#p403\">\n    200 So.3d 400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In light of the second circuit's ruling in\n   <em>\n    Little\n   </em>\n   , this court determined that the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Monceaux\n   </em>\n   also failed to prove that his circumstances necessitated a downward departure from the statutorily mandated life sentence. Given this court's ruling in\n   <em>\n    Monceaux\n   </em>\n   , we find that Defendant has not proven that his youth creates circumstances to make the mandatory denial of parole for a second degree murder conviction unconstitutionally excessive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   At the sentencing hearing the trial court gave its reasons for imposing the sentences, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   The court has considered the following factors, as well as the nature of the present offense, in determining an appropriate sentence ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   According to the Presentence Investigation, on February 21st, 2015, deputies from the Jefferson Davis Parish Sheriff's Department responded to the residence of Charles Raymond Talen on a welfare check requested by Vermilion Parish authorities after they discovered a brunt [sic] car with papers inside indicating it belonged to Mr. Talen. When they finally entered the house, they found Mr. Talen bound and bloody on the floor. They were unable to locate a pulse. Numerous interviews were conducted, and the Forensic Investigation Unit from Calcasieu Parish assisted in processing the crime scene. You were later arrested and charged with second degree murder and obstruction of justice. Several other people were charged in connection with this crime. On June 26th, 2017, you were found guilty by the Jefferson Davis petit jury of second degree murder and obstruction of justice. I'm going to file the Presentence Investigation into the record for further reference, if necessary.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   In Reviewing the Presentence Investigation, the Court takes note of the fact that you are 21 years of age, that you have a young son, and that this is your first felony conviction. This has been taken into consideration in mitigating against imposition of the maximum sentence in this matter. However, the Court can find no other mitigating factors. The Court will take notice that you still have failed to admit any responsibility or - - or involvement in this crime despite your conviction and despite forensic evidence linking you to the crime scene.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Therefore, the Court sentences you to the Department of Corrections, State of Louisiana, to life imprisonment without the benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence on the second degree murder. The Court has considered the factors. I was here when the evidence was presented. It was - - the burning of the car, the throwing away clothes, the dumping of the safe, the hiding of the money, and no remorse whatsoever in your actions, the Court is going to order that you serve 40 years at hard labor, the maximum sentence on the obstruction of justice, which sentence is to run consecutive to the sentence I have previously imposed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In reviewing an excessive sentence claim, we look to the nature of the crimes. Second degree murder is classified\n   as a crime of violence under La.R.S. 14:2. At sentencing, the trial court specifically noted that authorities found the victim \"bound and bloody, on the floor.\" Further, expert testimony during trial revealed that the victim died from \"blunt force injuries of the head and neck\" and detailed at least fifteen to twenty injuries to the victim, including bruises on his head, neck, and abdomen and lacerations on his scalp.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   As set forth in La.R.S. 14:130.1, obstruction of justice is punishable by a maximum of forty years in prison if it involves a criminal proceeding in which the defendant could be sentenced to death or life imprisonment. This is a very lengthy sentence which indicates that obstruction of justice involving a very serious crime, like second degree murder, is also a serious offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Next, we look to Defendant's nature and background. The trial court ordered a pre-sentence investigation (PSI) which revealed that the defendant was twenty-one years of age at the time of the hearing, had a young son, had no juvenile criminal history, and had no adult criminal history. The trial court stated that it could find no other mitigating factors. Although Defendant was only eighteen at the time of the offense and had no prior criminal history, the trial court pointed to his refusal to take any responsibility or admit any involvement in the commission of the second degree murder, despite there being \"forensic evidence\" linking him to the scene as the reasons for imposing a life sentence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The trial court noted Defendant's actions during the commission of the offense, such as burning the victim's car, throwing Defendant's clothes into the river, disposing of the victim's safe, and burying the victim's money, and Defendant's lack of remorse, in sentencing Defendant to the maximum sentence of forty years for obstruction of justice to run consecutively to the life sentence. Although Defendant's background was favorable, as he had no prior criminal history, his lack of remorse and refusal to take any responsibility along with his conduct during the commission of the offenses is also a reflection of his nature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Finally, we look at the sentences imposed for similar crimes. Louisiana Revised Statutes 14:30.1(B) mandates a sentence of life imprisonment at hard labor without benefits for a conviction of second degree murder, so it follows that the vast majority of sentences imposed for other second degree murder convictions will be the same. This court has previously ruled in many cases that mandatory life without benefits for second degree murder is not unconstitutionally excessive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.
