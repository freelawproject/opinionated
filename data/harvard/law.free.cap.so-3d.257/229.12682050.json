Also residing in that home was their daughter, toddler Zinlee Dotson, as well as Ms. Marshall's teenage daughter, Jasmine Moses. At the end of the Thanksgiving 2015 break for school, the children got their school gear together and the family had supper. Day-Min and Jasmine each went to bed. When Jasmine woke up the next day, she noticed her mother and brother were not present, and the living room appeared to be in disarray.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   When Jasmine saw Defendant, he appeared flustered and was repeatedly going outside and coming back inside. He told Jasmine that they had to pack and leave, and also told her that her mother and Day-Min were in Shreveport. The teenager packed for herself and her younger sister. Defendant then removed the gaming systems and video games. When Jasmine took Zinlee out of her playpen and went outside, she saw their mother's corpse on the ground, wrapped in blue bubble wrap. Defendant tried to load the body into his truck with an engine hoist; when that didn't work, he told Jasmine that she had to help him load the body. Jasmine stated Defendant threatened her and told her he had killed her mother and brother. Defendant was armed with a pistol. Eventually, they drove down a logging trail, put her mother's body in a ditch and put a piece of plywood over it. After that, they drove to a GameStop, where Defendant sold the gaming systems and games. They then left the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Ms. Marshall's mother became concerned after not hearing from her and contacted police. During the subsequent investigation, police located Day-Min's corpse in a car in the backyard of the residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On February 11, 2016, a Vernon Parish grand jury indicted Defendant on two counts of first degree murder, in violation of La.R.S. 14:30. On September 18 and 19, 2017, a jury was selected. Trial began on September 20, and after a two day trial, the jury found Defendant guilty as charged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 30, 2017, the district court sentenced Defendant to life imprisonment for each count. Defendant now seeks review by this court, asserting two assignments of error. For the following reasons, we affirm Defendant's convictions and sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 1\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In his first assignment of error, Defendant argues the evidence adduced at trial was insufficient to support his convictions for first degree murder. He claims the State lacked any physical evidence linking him to the crimes and the case was wholly based on circumstantial evidence. His chief argument is that the State did not establish his identity as the killer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   This court, in\n   <em>\n    State v.

As shown in the analysis just cited, a single witness's testimony can support a conviction. Defendant suggests that Jasmine was not credible because she did not try to escape from Defendant while they were traveling together and because she testified pursuant to an immunity agreement. However, the assessment of any witness's credibility is within the province of the factfinder. Further, the State notes Defendant told relatives that he had done something worse than robbing a bank or \"something really bad\" but did not want to mention any details that would make them accessories to the crime. Defendant's argument that the evidence merely demonstrated that he and Jasmine were accessories after the fact is negated by Jasmine's testimony regarding his confession to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Near the end of his argument, Defendant briefly claims that the evidence did not establish that the killing of Ms. Marshall was a first-degree murder, as the State failed to prove Defendant had the specific intent to kill more than one person or that Misty Marshall was a witness to any crime.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the evidence indicated that Defendant killed the mother and son at their residence on the same night, and this was a sufficient basis for reasonable jurors to conclude Defendant had the requisite intent.

The court in this case engaged in a thoughtful and detailed examination of each photograph and excluded 7 of the 22 photographs the state sought to introduce. The defendant shows no abuse of discretion on the part of the district court in admitting the remaining photographs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

Uh, as I noted before in other photographs there is - there are elements of this crime that he's charged with that can be established in various ways but one of them will be to have actual photographs to depict the kinds of wounds that were inflicted upon the body to allow the jury to determine whether that - that element has been proved. Uh, there's also photographs on the - the mother depicting the tattoos which would be pertinent as to identification for one thing and then other, uh, evidence that would corroborate further testimony (unintelligible). So, there's probative value in all these photographs, and, so, I will overrule the objection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In viewing the images at issue, they are unquestionably graphic and gruesome. However, gruesome images are often likely to be introduced in murder cases. Although certain photographs of the child Day-Min's head wounds and Ms. Marshall's corpse are particularly graphic,\n   they aided the pathologist's testimony relating to wounds. After reviewing the record, we cannot say the district court abused its discretion in balancing the probative value of these photographs against their prejudicial effect. Therefore, this assignment of error lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    DECREE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Defendant's convictions and sentences are affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Killing a witness to a crime is a violation of La.R.S. 14:30(A)(9).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    The statute states, in pertinent part:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n    A.
