Here, the defendant was inarguably not in physical possession of the narcotics at issue; thus, the state had to prove that the defendant had constructive possession. That is, the state had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant exercised \"dominion and control\" over the narcotics.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Trahan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9557808\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/425/1222/#p1226\">\n    425 So.2d 1222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1226 (La. 1983). The fact that a defendant had physical presence in an area of the contraband is found does not prove he exercised \"dominion and control\" over that contraband.\n   <em>\n    State v. Toups\n   </em>\n   , 01-1875 (La. 10/15/02),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9390519\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/833/910/#p913\">\n    833 So.2d 910\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 913. For the reasons assigned by Judge Holdridge in his dissent, I question whether the evidence in this case establishes constructive possession under these well-established standards, and I would grant the writ to examine whether the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   would grant for the reasons assigned by Judge Holdridge and additionally avers: there was no evidence that defendant was in possession of any drugs, drug paraphernalia, any large sum of money, or any evidence associated with drug use or trafficking; there was no proof or connection between defendant and the cocaine found in the BBQ grill; the BBQ grill was not defendant's grill; the grill where the drugs were found was not seized as evidence, nor identified from any photograph at trial; defendant did not live on the property where the grill was located; and, there were no witnesses to this event. At best, this is a circumstantial evidence case. In circumstantial evidence cases, La.R.S. 15:438 requires the State to exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence. This, I find, the State failed to do.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-14\">\n    This is not inconsistent with this Court's per curiam in\n    <em>\n     State v. Moultrie\n    </em>\n    , 15-2144 (La. 6/29/17),\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12379988\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/224/349/\">\n     224 So.3d 349\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . At that stage, the Court was examining the validity of a warrantless search, and found there was no reasonable expectation of privacy in the grill at issue. This writ is not concerned with the Fourth Amendment standards for a warrantless search, but rather with whether there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction under\n    <em>\n     Jackson v. Virginia\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182418\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/307/\">\n     443 U.S. 307\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182418\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/307/\">\n     99 S.Ct. 2781\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182418\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/307/\">\n     61 L.Ed.2d 560\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1979).
