The crimes occurred in 1991 when Michel was sixteen years old. After a jury convicted him of first-degree premeditated murder and armed robbery, he was sentenced to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole after 25 years with a concurrent sentence for the armed robbery that has since expired. The Fourth District affirmed Michel's judgment and sentence on direct appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Michel v.

The motion asserted that he was sentenced to life in prison for a homicide and, because he was under eighteen at the time of the crime, he was entitled to relief under\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   . The State argued that\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   was inapplicable because Michel had the opportunity for release on parole. The trial court summarily denied the motion for the reasons stated in the State's response. On appeal, the Fourth District reversed, interpreting this Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Atwell v.

What the State must do, however, is give defendants like Graham some meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation. It is for the State, in the first instance, to explore the means and mechanisms for compliance. It bears emphasis, however, that while the Eighth Amendment prohibits a State from imposing a life without parole sentence on a juvenile nonhomicide offender, it does not require the State to release that offender during his natural life. Those who commit truly horrifying crimes as juveniles may turn out to be irredeemable, and thus deserving of incarceration for the duration of their lives. The Eighth Amendment does not foreclose the possibility that persons convicted of nonhomicide crimes committed before adulthood will remain behind bars for life. It does prohibit States from making the judgment at the outset that those offenders never will be fit to reenter society.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n    at 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Then, in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    567 U.S. 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the United States Supreme Court extended its categorical rule prohibiting life sentences without parole for juvenile offenders convicted of nonhomicide crimes to juvenile offenders convicted of homicide.

Feb. 14, 2018). Accordingly, it appears that neither this Court nor the district courts of appeal have found\n   <em>\n    Atwell\n   </em>\n   to be unworkable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Turning to the second factor required to be considered when determining whether the presumption against stare decisis has been overcome, any contention that\n   <em>\n    Atwell\n   </em>\n   could be cast aside without serious injustice or creating instability in the law is belied by this Court and district courts of appeals' reliance on\n   <em>\n    Atwell\n   </em>\n   to grant juvenile offenders relief. As previously explained, this relief comes in the form of resentencing under chapter 2014-220, section 3, Laws of Florida, which allows those juvenile offenders to argue for a sentence as low as forty years' imprisonment with the opportunity of judicial review and consideration of the other\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   factors. For example, the plurality's decision is patently unfair to Michel. Michel, who was sixteen years old at the time of his crimes, was sentenced to a mandatory life sentence with the possibility of parole after twenty-five years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   plurality op. at 4-5. This is the exact same sentence that we held was unconstitutional when imposed upon sixteen-year-old Angelo Atwell.\n   <em>\n    Atwell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6787436\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/197/1040/\">\n    197 So.3d at 1041\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Additionally, because district courts have widely relied on this Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Atwell\n   </em>\n   for guidance, the plurality's decision\n   today creates a serious disruption in the law. Without a full majority with respect to the plurality's legal analysis, it is unclear which portions of the plurality opinion, namely the plurality's decision to disregard\n   <em>\n    Atwell\n   </em>\n   , constitute controlling law. As a result, district courts of appeal will be left guessing as to which juvenile defendants should be entitled to relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Finally, turning to the third factor, even though the plurality fails to mention the test for when binding precedent can be disregarded, it is clear that it relies heavily on this factor as the basis for refusing to apply\n   <em>\n    Atwell\n   </em>\n   . The majority claims that a new case from the United State Supreme Court,\n   <em>\n    Virginia v.

The plurality claims that\n   <em>\n    LeBlanc\n   </em>\n   \"clarified that the [\n   <em>\n    Atwell\n   </em>\n   ] majority's holding does not properly apply United States Supreme Court precedent.\" Plurality op. at 6.

The plurality uses this exceedingly narrow holding as a direct statement regarding United States Supreme Court precedent that\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   was never intended to apply to prisoners who are sentenced to life with the possibility of parole in the State of Florida.

First, the plurality fails to mention that the United States Supreme Court was considering only whether the Fourth Circuit\n   had improperly intruded on the authority of the Virginia Supreme Court to conclude that its program satisfied the Eighth Amendment.

Accordingly, even if the United States Supreme Court believed that the Virginia Supreme Court's decision was in error, this still would not have been enough to overturn the state court decision. Instead of looking at the\n   <em>\n    LeBlanc\n   </em>\n   decision in its proper context through the rigorous standard of review, the plurality uses the United States Supreme Court opinion to adopt the dissent written by Justice Polston in\n   <em>\n    Atwell.

Indeed, when describing how presumptive parole release dates are determined in\n   <em>\n    Atwell\n   </em>\n   , this Court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   In most respects, a sentence of life with the possibility of parole for first-degree murder, based on the way Florida's parole process operates under the existing statutory scheme, actually resembles a mandatorily imposed life sentence without parole that is not \"proportionate to the offense and the offender.\"\n   <em>\n    Horsley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6876340\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/160/393/#p395\">\n    160 So.3d at 406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Based on Florida's objective parole guidelines, an individual who was convicted of a capital offense under section 775.082, Florida Statutes (1990), as Atwell was, will have a presumptive parole release date of anywhere from 300 to 9,998 months in\n   the future. Fla. Admin. Code R. 23-21.009 (2014). Importantly, the statute requires \"primary weight\" in the consideration of parole to be given \"to the seriousness of the offender's present offense\"-here, the most serious offense of first-degree murder-\"and the offender's past criminal record.\" \u00a7 947.002, Fla. Stat.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   If an offender convicted of first-degree murder has a high salient score, that offender's range of months for the presumptive parole release date could span from hundreds of months to nearly ten thousand months. Fla. Admin. Code R. 23-21.009 (2014). This range of months, which encompasses hundreds of years, could be lawfully imposed without the Commission on Offender Review even considering mitigating circumstances. The Commission is only required to consider mitigating and aggravating circumstances if it wishes to impose a presumptive parole release date that falls outside the given range of months. Fla. Admin. Code R. 23-21.010 (2010). Further, the enumerated mitigating and aggravating circumstances in rule 23-21.010 of the Florida Administrative Code, even if utilized, do not have specific factors tailored to juveniles.

The Commission indicated that another review would be conducted in July 2004.

Both conflict cases recognize that it is highly unlikely that either juvenile offender would be released from prison during his lifetime. However, under the plurality's reasoning today, even Stallings and Williams, whom the district courts acknowledge could potentially be entitled to resentencing pending the determination of a presumptive parole release date, would now not be entitled to resentencing, regardless of any presumptive parole release date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   For all of the reasons explained above and because our precedent compels such a result, I would conclude that a presumptive parole release date should not be considered when determining whether the constitution entitles a juvenile to resentencing. Specifically, I would not reject\n   <em>\n    Atwell\n   </em>\n   and would instead hold that\n   <em>\n    Atwell\n   </em>\n   , which faithfully interpreted the United States Supreme Court's decisions, requires that all juvenile offenders sentenced to life with the possibility of parole after twenty-five years be resentenced pursuant to section 921.1401 regardless of a presumptive parole release date, if one has been set. This result would not guarantee Michel any particular term of years sentence less than life but would require the sentencing court to consider all of the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   factors when resentencing Michel and would allow the sentencing court the discretion to impose a forty-year sentence with an entitlement to judicial review, and all of those benefits previously explained, after twenty-five years from his initial sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Accordingly, I dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   QUINCE and LABARGA, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    We have jurisdiction.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    art.
