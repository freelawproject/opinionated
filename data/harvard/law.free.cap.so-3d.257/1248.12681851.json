We have jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fla. R. App. P. 9.140(h)(4). In denying Elias's motion for post-trial release, the trial court was required to enter a written order setting forth the factual basis on which the court reached its decision and the reasons for its denial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.691(b) ; Fla. R. App. P. 9.140(h)(3). The lower court committed reversible error in failing to enter such a written order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Metayer v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7036305,7036273\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/52/691/\">\n    52 So.3d 691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 692 (Fla. 4th DCA 2010) ;\n   <em>\n    Montgomery v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11084735\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/788/274/#p275\">\n    788 So.2d 274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 275 (Fla. 4th DCA 2000) ;\n   <em>\n    Buckhalter v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9566780,9566679\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/416/862/\">\n    416 So.2d 862\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 862 (Fla. 1st DCA 1982). Accordingly, we grant Elias's motion for review, reverse the denial of Elias's motion for post-trial release, and remand for the lower court to reconsider Elias's motion in accordance with the applicable criminal and appellate rules within three days of the date of this opinion. If the lower court again denies post-trial release, it must make the necessary written findings to support the denial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
