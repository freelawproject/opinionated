Hereafter, unless he can show that one of the narrow exceptions authorizing the filing of a successive application applies, relator has exhausted his right to state collateral review.

Here, although none of the defendant's previous nine felony convictions are \"crimes of violence\" as defined by La. R.S. 14:2, the defendant is a proven recidivist to whom the application of a 20-year habitual offender sentence-which is notably the minimum possible sentence under La. R.S. 15:529.1(A)(4) for an adjudicated fourth felony offender-is not unconstitutionally excessive.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
