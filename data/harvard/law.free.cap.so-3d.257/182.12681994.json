Touchet\n   </em>\n   , 1993-2839 (La. 9/6/94),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7470071\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/642/1213/\">\n    642 So.2d 1213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In my view, this Court is missing a valuable opportunity to provide guidance on the best practice for trial courts across the State in conducting hearings in this unprecedented area of the law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McCoy v. Louisiana\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611469\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1500/\">\n    138 S.Ct. 1500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611469\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1500/\">\n    200 L.Ed.2d 821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). Under the trial court's present ruling, the State will\n   be present while the court poses questions to the defendant, with the possibility that defendant may disclose defense strategy or make inculpatory statements, thereby giving the State an unfair advantage. Again, while I find no error in the trial court's ruling and absolutely do not presume the trial court will commit error during its hearing, I simply believe this Court should exercise its supervisory jurisdiction in this capital case in order to address this new frontier for all lower courts.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Krogmann v.
