Dysart\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In this lawsuit involving the breach of an agreement to purchase property, defendant-appellant, Shi Gang Zheng a/k/a Tony Zheng, appeals a judgment in favor of plaintiffs-appellees, Robin Burgess and\n   Terence Blanchard (\"the Blanchards\"), awarding the Blanchards contractual stipulated damages and attorney's fees. The Blanchards answered the appeal, seeking an increase in the amount of attorney's fees awarded. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the trial court judgment in all respects and decline to increase the amount of the award for attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   According to their Petition for Damages (\"Petition\"), the Blanchards were the owners of property located in English Turn in New Orleans, which they listed for sale. On July 31, 2015, their agent, Britt Galloway, received an offer from Mr. Zheng's agent, Delisha Boyd, to purchase the property for $990,000. The offer contemplated an \"all cash sale\" which expired on August 1, 2015. In response, the Blanchards made a counteroffer which incorporated the terms of Zheng's offer but added additional terms.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mr. Zheng accepted the counteroffer and emailed a copy of a check for the $10,000 deposit to Ms. Boyd, who forwarded it Mr. Galloway. He then submitted proof of funds and had the home inspected on August 7, 2015. In anticipation of the September 30, 2015 closing on the sale of the home, the Blanchards moved out of the home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Because he was allegedly out of town, Mr. Zheng, through Ms. Boyd, requested additional time for the closing, and the Blanchards agreed to grant an additional fifteen days for the closing provided that Mr. Zheng pay an additional deposit of $25,000 or provide his agent with a power of attorney to complete the sale. Ultimately, Mr. Zheng did not appear for the closing on September 30, 2015 and the title company prepared a\n   <em>\n    proces verbal\n   </em>\n   documenting the failure of the sale to be completed. The Blanchards then sent Mr. Zheng a notice of default on October 1, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This suit followed. In their Petition, filed on November 4, 2015, the Blanchards sought to enforce the liquidated damages provision of the purchase agreement. More specifically, they sought payment of $99,000 (10% of the sale price), the $10,000 deposit, a $49,500 broker fee (5% of the sale price), and attorney's fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In response to the Petition, Mr. Zheng filed a third party demand against Ms. Boyd and several other parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In it, he alleged that he had retained Ms. Boyd to act as his agent with respect to the purchase of the English Turn property. At that time, he informed Ms. Boyd that he needed to obtain financing for the purchase. However, Ms. Boyd prepared the all-cash offer, which she requested that he sign, and submitted it to Mr. Galloway. He then received the counteroffer. Although he executed the counteroffer, Mr. Zheng again advised Ms. Boyd that he required financing, and provided no proof of funds as required by the purchase agreement. He did, however, provide a letter from Golden Bank advising that he was eligible for a $900,000 loan, subject to final approval from the bank. Mr. Zheng was ultimately unable to obtain the financing or purchase the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The third party demand makes allegations of negligence and negligent misrepresentation against Ms. Boyd on the basis\n   that she prepared the all-cash contract without including a contingency for financing and that she forwarded the Golden Bank letter to show that Mr. Zheng was in the process of obtaining finances to purchase the property. Mr. Zheng alleged that, due to Ms. Boyd's negligent misrepresentation, he suffered damages because it purported to \"satisf[y] a condition of the Contract which could not have otherwise been satisfied.\" The third party demand sought judgment against the third party defendants in the event that plaintiffs obtained a judgment against Mr. Zheng.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Blanchards then filed a Motion for Summary Judgment seeking: (1) a determination that Mr. Zheng had breached his obligations under the purchase agreement and (2) a determination that they were entitled to the stipulated damages as set forth in the agreement. A hearing was held on the motion and, by judgment dated April 26, 2016, the trial court granted summary judgment in plaintiffs' favor, finding that Mr. Zheng had breached the agreement. The judgment found, however, that there remained the issue of damages sustained as a result of the breach. The Blanchards sought a review of that part of the judgment which denied the summary judgment on the issue of damages. This Court denied the writ application on July 6, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Burgess, et al. v. Zheng\n   </em>\n   , 16-0496 (La. App. 4 Cir. 7/6/16)(unpubl).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A bench trial on the matter took place on April 7, 2017. By judgment dated April 17, 2017, the trial court ruled in the Blanchards' favor and against Mr. Zheng for the following damages: $109,000, with legal interest and costs; $15,000 in attorney's fees; and $5,000 for brokerage fees. The judgment further dismissed Mr. Zheng's claims against Ms. Boyd with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Mr. Zheng timely filed a suspensive appeal of the judgment, which was then converted to a devolutive appeal. As noted, the Blanchards answered the appeal, seeking an increase in the award of attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At the outset, we note that the majority of Mr. Zheng's appellate brief focuses on whether the trial court erred in finding that there was a breach of contract (purchase agreement) in this case, and, more particularly, whether the alleged failure of a suspensive condition contained within the purchase agreement voided his obligations under the purchase agreement. The issue of whether there was a breach of the contract was addressed by the trial court when it partially granted the Blanchards' motion for summary judgment on April 26, 2016. That judgment is not properly before this Court, given that Mr. Zheng appealed only the April 17, 2017 judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Furthermore, the April 26, 2016 judgment does not contain sufficient decretal language for it to be considered a final judgment. Our jurisprudence indicates that \"for the language of a judgment to be considered 'decretal,' it 'must name the party in favor of whom the ruling is ordered, the party against whom the ruling is ordered, and the\n   <em>\n    relief\n   </em>\n   that is granted or denied.' \"\n   <em>\n    Tsegaye v.

State Univ. and Agric. and Mech. Coll. v. Mid City Holdings, L.L.C.\n   </em>\n   , 14-0506, p. 3 (La. App. 4 Cir. 10/15/14),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6905443\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/151/908/#p910\">\n    151 So.3d 908\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 910.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Here, the April 26, 2016 judgment simply states that \"[i]t is ordered, adjudged and decreed that the Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED on the breach by defendant/buyer, Shi Gang Zheng a/k/a Tony Zheng as buyer of the August 1, 2015 Agreement to Buy or Sell\" leaving \"[t]he only remaining issue [of] damages.\" While it grants summary judgment, it does not state what relief was granted. However, as the\n   <em>\n    Board of Supervisors\n   </em>\n   Court indicated, when a judgment \"is lacking in definitive decretal language necessary for the exercise of our appellate jurisdiction, the appellant is not entitled as of right to appellate review, but may nonetheless invoke our supervisory jurisdiction, which is discretionary with us to grant\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6905443\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/151/908/#p910\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , 14-0506, p. 3,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6905443\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/151/908/#p910\">\n    151 So.3d at 910\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, we find it appropriate to exercise our supervisory jurisdiction because the April 17, 2017 judgment is intertwined with the April 26, 2016 judgment; that is, the April 17, 2017 judgment is dependent on a finding of a breach of contract, which was the issue in the summary judgment motion. Moreover, we find that judicial economy will best be served by exercising our supervisory jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Thus, there are two judgments at issue in this appeal - one granting summary judgment on the issue of a breach of contract; and one awarding damages pursuant to the contract. However, while Mr. Zheng technically appealed the April 17, 2017 judgment, the assignments of error and the issues raised in his appeal only address the breach of contract issue. The only mention of the April 17, 2017 judgment is the request that this Court \"vacate the Trial Court's April 17, 2017 Judgment in favor of the Plaintiffs and against Zheng.\" Mr. Zheng does not challenge the amount of the damages awarded in the April 17, 2017 judgment or otherwise raise any issue with respect to that judgment. Similarly, while the trial court's judgment dismissed all claims made against Ms. Boyd, no issue is raised as to this ruling on appeal. Thus, any issues concerning damages or the dismissal of the claims against Ms. Boyd are not before this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, we only address the merits of the April 26, 2016 judgment in this appeal, which granted summary judgment in the Blanchards' favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Appellate review of the grant of a summary judgment is\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   , using the same criteria district courts consider when determining if summary judgment is proper.\n   <em>\n    Madere v. Collins\n   </em>\n   , 17-0723, p. 6 (La. App. 4 Cir. 3/28/18),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12666086\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/241/1143/#p1147\">\n    241 So.3d 1143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1147. In that regard, we look to determine whether \"the motion, memorandum, and supporting documents show that there is no genuine issue as to material fact and that the mover is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" La. C.C.P. art. 966 A(3). The Blanchards, as the movers, bore the burden of proof, but were not required to \"negate all essential elements of the adverse party's claim, action or defense, but rather to point out to the court the absence of factual support for one or more elements essential to the adverse party's claim, action, or defense.\" La. C.C.P. art. 966 D(1). Mr. Zheng, as the adverse party to the motion bore the burden \"to produce factual support\n   sufficient to establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact or that the mover is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12666086\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/241/1143/#p1147\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The contract at issue in this case is a standard-form Louisiana Residential Agreement to Buy and Sell (\"Agreement\") with an act of sale that was to take place on September 30, 2015. The Agreement contained a provision indicating that the sale was an \"all cash sale,\" and a statement that \"the BUYER has cash readily available to close the sale of the Property.\" The Agreement provided the following with respect to a default of the agreement by the buyer:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   In the event of any default of this Agreement by the BUYER, the SELLER shall have at the SELLER'S option the right to declare this Agreement null and void with no further demand, or to demand and sue for any of the following: 1) Termination of this Agreement; 2) Specific performance; 3) Termination of this Agreement and an amount equal to 10% of the Sale Price as stipulated damages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Further, the SELLER shall be entitled to retain the Deposit. The prevailing party to any litigation brought to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall be awarded their attorney fees and costs. The BUYER may also be liable for Broker fees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Agreement further provided additional terms and conditions, including a $5000 deposit and the requirement that the buyer \"supply proof of funds within 48 hours of acceptance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Mr. Zheng presented the Agreement to the Blanchards as an offer to purchase the property. The Blanchards then submitted a counter-offer which increased the deposit amount to $10,000, required an appraisal to be performed within twenty days of the acceptance of the offer and reiterating that \"[p]urchaser to provide proof of funds within 48 hours of acceptance of this offer.\" Mr. Zheng accepted the counter-offer as evidenced by his signature dated August 1, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Pursuant to the Agreement, Mr. Zheng timely conducted an inspection of the property. Thereafter, there were issues with respect to the closing date and extending the date for the closing, and there were issues with respect to Mr. Zheng's provision of \"proof of funds.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Zheng was unable to obtain financing for the purchase and, ultimately, the closing did not take place on the scheduled date, September 30, 2015. The Blanchards then elected to enforce the Agreement's provision which allowed for the termination of the Agreement and an award of 10% of the purchase price, as well as a forfeiture of the deposit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Prior to the trial on damages, the issue of the breach of contract was resolved by way summary judgment in April, 2016, at which time, the trial court simply found that there had been a breach. No reasons for judgment were issued at that time. When the trial court rendered judgment after trial, however, the trial court then issued written Reasons for Judgment which expounded on its finding of a breach of the Agreement. It first noted that it had (previously) \"granted the summary judgment\n   on liability, holding that Mr. Zheng failed to provide the proof of funds within 48 hours of the signed Agreement.\" The trial court continued to explain its finding regarding a breach of the Agreement; relying on La. C.C. art. 2623,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   the trial court found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiffs placed two additional conditions in their counter-offer to Mr. Zheng: that he verify proof of funds within 48 hours of the signed agreement to purchase; and that the property be appraised for more than the purchase price. This Court finds that these were suspensive conditions. Mr. Zheng submitted his offer as an all-cash offer. Plaintiffs responded by adding that Mr. Zheng show proof of his ability to pay the purchase price. La. Civ. Code. art. 1772 provides \"[A] condition is regarded as fulfilled when it is not fulfilled because of the fault of a party with an interest contrary to the fulfillment.\"\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schollian v.

It is undisputed that Mr. Zheng failed to provide proof of funds within 48 hours. This Court held, in denying the Motion for Summary Judgment [as to damages], that the application of the stipulated damage clause depended upon Mr. Zheng's good faith in procuring a proof of funds and/or financing. (internal footnote omitted).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In support of his argument that the trial court's April 26, 2016 judgment should be reversed, Mr. Zheng maintains that the purchase agreement in this case contained a suspensive condition which was not timely met; accordingly, \"the obligations imposed by the purchase agreement were not binding\" and there \"was no breach of contract.\" He advances two arguments: (1) that the Blanchards did not prove that Mr. Zheng was at fault for the failure of the suspensive condition to have been met; and (2) that Mr. Zheng made a good faith effort to obtain the funds necessary to purchase the home and, therefore, was not at fault for the failure of the suspensive condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   While we agree with the trial court that Mr. Zheng breached the Agreement, we do not find that the provision in the Agreement which required Mr. Zheng to provide proof of funds was a suspensive condition, the failure of which had any bearing on the breach of the Agreement. Nor do we find that Mr. Zheng's faith, good or bad, in providing proof of funds to be at issue in finding a breach in the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In so holding, we employ the well-settled rule that \"[a] contract is the law between the parties, and courts are obliged to give them legal effect according to the common intent of the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    1100 S.

Thus, the court found no breach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In the present case, there was no provision in the Agreement which conditioned the sale on Mr. Zheng's ability to obtain financing. To the contrary, the sale was an \"all-cash sale.\" The Agreement did contain a section whereby Mr. Zheng could have chosen a \"financed sale\" which specifically indicated that the sale would be \"conditioned upon the ability of BUYER to borrow with this Property as security for\" an unspecified loan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, this option was not selected by Mr. Zheng, who warranted that he \"ha[d] cash readily available to close the sale\" of the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   While the Agreement did require Mr. Zheng to supply \"proof of funds\" within 48 hours, we find this to be merely a term of the sale, and not a suspensive condition as contemplated by our case law.

C.C. art. 1767.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Because we have found that there was no suspensive condition, we need not address Mr. Zheng's good faith efforts to obtain financing. We recognize that our jurisprudence provides that \"a provision making a sale of real property contingent upon the purchaser's obtaining a loan imposes a duty upon the purchaser to make a good faith application for the loan\" and that the issue of \"[w]hether or not a party has acted in good faith depends on the facts and circumstances peculiar to each case.\"\n   <em>\n    Liuzza v.

Two issues are presented; (1) whether the Blanchards are entitled to an increase in the amount of attorney's fees and (2) whether Mr. Zheng should be ordered to pay all costs of the appeal. With respect to the first issue, the Blanchards maintain that the trial court erred in failing to award attorney's fees of 33 1/3% of the judgment, the percentage set forth in the contingency agreement signed with their attorney. Other than referring to that agreement, the Blanchards\n   make no argument and cite no case law supporting their position that they should receive an amount equal to their contingency agreement. As to the second issue concerning the costs of the appeal, in their brief, the Blanchards make no argument in support of this Court's assessing the costs of this appeal to Mr. Zheng; they simply request an order from this Court assessing all costs to Mr. Zheng.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Blanchards maintain that the trial court's error in failing to award attorney's fees of 33 1/3% is due to its misconception that the contingency agreement is not contained in the record.
