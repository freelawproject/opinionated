We reverse for a new sentencing proceeding because Lee had a right to be present and to be represented by counsel at the resentencing hearing in which the trial court had discretion in determining the new sentence to be imposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Lee was originally sentenced to forty years' imprisonment for attempted second-degree murder with a firearm, together with a twenty-year mandatory minimum for discharge of a firearm during the commission of that crime.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court ordered that the twenty-year mandatory minimum sentence for that count be served consecutively to the twenty-year mandatory minimum sentences imposed in two other counts (two counts of aggravated assault with a firearm, each involving discharge of a firearm). At the time of Lee's original sentencing, the trial court believed it had no discretion and was required to order that the mandatory minimum sentences be served consecutively.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morgan v.

Although the original sentence of forty years (and the corrected sentence of thirty years) would appear to demonstrate the trial court's intent to impose the maximum allowable sentence, the absence of Lee and his counsel from the resentencing deprived Lee of the opportunity to present evidence and argument to the trial court that some sentence less than the maximum is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Further, since the time of Lee's original sentence, our decision in\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   , and the Fourth District's decision in\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   , have been quashed by the Florida Supreme Court, and the law is now clear that the trial court has the discretion to order the twenty-year mandatory minimum portion of Lee's sentence to be served concurrently with, rather than consecutively to, the other mandatory minimum sentences imposed in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   , 42 Fla.

Indeed, the trial court's resentencing order acknowledges this clarification of the law, but concludes that the mandatory minimum portion of the sentence should be served consecutively to the mandatory minimum sentences imposed for the aggravated assault convictions. Nevertheless, because this determination involves the exercise of the trial court's discretion, Lee and his counsel were entitled to be present at the resentencing and to present evidence and argument to the trial court on the issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We therefore vacate the corrected sentence imposed for Lee's conviction for attempted second-degree murder, and remand for the trial court to conduct a resentencing proceeding on that count and thereafter impose sentence. Lee shall be present for that proceeding and shall be represented by counsel. We express no opinion with regard to what sentence should be imposed at resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 775.087(2)(d), Fla.

Thus, at this resentencing proceeding, Lee and his counsel will be afforded the opportunity to present to the trial court, for the first time, evidence and argument in support of a concurrent, rather than a consecutive, mandatory minimum sentence on this count.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Mason v.
