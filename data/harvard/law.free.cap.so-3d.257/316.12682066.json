For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the judgment in part, reverse the judgment in part, and remand the cause for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The wife filed a complaint for a divorce in the trial court on July 19, 2016. In her complaint, the wife asserted that she and the husband had been ceremonially married on July 30, 2011. She also asserted that the parties \"had resided together as husband and wife for some years prior\" to their ceremonial marriage. The wife also asserted that the parties had a 10-year-old child, that she should receive sole physical custody of the child, that the husband should be ordered to pay child support, that she should receive one-half of the husband's prospective worker's compensation benefits, and that she should receive one-half of the husband's retirement benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 20, 2016, the wife moved for a default judgment. The wife attached to her motion an affidavit from her attorney in which he testified, among other things, that the husband had been personally served by the Dallas County Sheriff on August 23, 2016, with a copy of the summons and complaint for a divorce and that the husband had failed to answer or otherwise defend the wife's complaint. On November 1, 2016, the wife submitted an affidavit entitled \"Default Testimony\" in which she testified, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \"While [the husband] and I were ceremonially married on July 30, 2011 ... we had resided together as husband and wife for at least five (5) years prior to that. During that time, we held ourselves out as husband and wife. Out of this marriage, one child was born, ... date of birth was May 23, 2006.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \"There exists a complete incompatibility of temperament between [the husband] and myself, that we can no longer live together as wife and husband. [The husband] has not worked for some period of time and has no income. He does nothing to help me around the house. He verbally abuses me. I have been paying all the bills for many months. [The husband] states that when he receives his workmen's compensation settlement, he is going to leave me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \"I am a fit and proper person to have the care, custody and control of our minor son and do not believe that [the husband] is a fit and proper person to have such permanent custody and care over our child. I should be granted physical custody of said child and [the husband] should have reasonable visitation rights.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \"As stated above, [the husband] is currently unemployed and claims to be disabled but I believe that he is capable of employment and earning an income and paying reasonable child support. As stated above, he is presently prosecuting a workmen's compensation claim .... [The husband] has informed me that he is meeting with his attorney in Montgomery on October 24, 2016 and will perhaps settle his workmen's compensation case on that date or on the court date which is October 25, 2016. I now understand the case has been put off until a later date. I do not know the amount of any settlement that he may obtain but I contend that I should be\n   awarded one-half (1/2) of any workmen's compensation amount payable to him for the maintenance, care and support of our minor child.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \"In addition to the above, [the husband] has a vested retirement with International Paper Company, one of his former employe[r]s, with a current value of approximately $18,500.00 as shown by International Paper Retirement Plan Statement dated June 30, 2016, a copy of which is attached hereto.... I believe that I should be awarded at least one-half (1/2) of this retirement plan as alimony in gross or property settlement and that a lien should be imposed on the remainder to secure payment by [the husband] of future child support.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \"I employed J. Garrison Thompson P.C. of Selma, Alabama as my attorney in this matter and he is representing me throughout these proceedings. Today, I have paid him the total sum of $855.00 which includes all court costs incurred to date. I do not have sufficient funds to pay Mr. Thompson an adequate fee for representing me in this cause and believe that [the husband] should be required to reimburse me for what I have paid plus a reasonable attorney's fee to Mr. Thompson.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On November 1, 2016, the trial court entered a \"default decree\" that divorced the parties based on incompatibility of temperament and granted sole physical custody of the parties' child to the wife. The trial court also ordered, among other things:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \"5. As child support herein, the [the husband] is ordered to pay [the wife] (1/2) of any and all workmen's compensation benefits which he may receive in that certain workmen's compensation action filed by him against Lear Corporation EEDS and Interiors, being case number CV-2013-901029 in the Circuit Court of Montgomery County, Alabama.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \"6.

In the motion, the husband claimed that he and the wife had been living together during the proceedings, that a hearing had been held on the wife's application for a default judgment without the knowledge of the husband, and that the wife had concealed the existence of that hearing. The husband also asserted, among other things, that he had not been properly served with the complaint and that the judgment violated \u00a7 25-5-86(2), Ala. Code 1975, with regard to the award of worker's compensation benefits. Only the first page of the husband's motion is contained in the record on appeal. On November 11, 2016, the trial court entered an order granting the husband's motion to set aside the default judgment and setting a hearing for January 30, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On January 26, 2017, the wife filed a motion seeking to have the trial court reconsider its order granting the husband's motion to set aside the default judgment. On January 30, 2017, the trial court entered an order stating that a hearing had\n   been held and directing the parties to submit proposed orders within 10 days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On February 3, 2017, the trial court entered the following order:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \"This matter coming on to be heard upon the [wife's] Motion to Reconsider this Court's Order granting [the husband's] Motion to Set Aside the Default Judgement of Divorce entered herein on November 1, 2016; and,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \"The parties being present before the Court, together with their respective attorneys, and the Court having considered the Motions above described, the representations made by counsel, and the entire record in said cause, does find as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \"1.

We also note that the husband does not address the factors a trial court should analyze in considering whether to set aside a default judgment as announced in\n   <em>\n    Kirtland v. Fort Morgan Authority Sewer Service, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11339134\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/524/600/\">\n    524 So.2d 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 605 (Ala. 1988). Accordingly, we will not address those issues on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The husband argues on appeal that service of process of the divorce complaint upon him was \"fraudulent\" and that the judgment was entered without supporting evidence. The husband also argues that there is no evidence to support the child-custody, child-support, and alimony awards and the division of the husband's retirement and worker's compensation benefits. The husband further argues that, even if the evidence was sufficient to support the judgment, the trial court's award of one-half of undetermined prospective worker's compensation benefits as child support, the division of his retirement benefits without evidence indicating that the parties had been married the requisite 10 years, and the award of attorney's fees must be reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    I. Service of Process\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   With regard to the husband's argument that service of process upon him was \"fraudulent,\" the husband has cited no authority in support of his position. It is well settled that \"[t]his court will address only those issues properly presented and for which supporting authority has been cited.\"\n   <em>\n    Asam v.

Civ. App. 1996). \"Rule 28(a)(10)[, Ala. R. App. P.,] requires that arguments in briefs contain discussions of facts and relevant legal authorities that support the party's position.

In addition, the husband makes factual assertions in his brief related to the wife's alleged actions that are not contained in the record. An appellate court is \"bound by the record, and cannot consider evidence set out in [a party's] brief, but not found in the record.\"\n   <em>\n    Bonds v. Cooke &amp; Wood Constr.

Evidence to Support the Default Judgment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Regarding the argument that the judgment of divorce was entered without supporting evidence, we note that, pursuant to Rule 55(e), Ala. R. Civ. P., \"[n]o judgment by default shall be entered against ... parties to an action for divorce or annulment of marriage unless the claimant establishes the party's claim or right to relief by evidence.\" In support of his argument, the husband cites\n   <em>\n    Plummer v.

The issue on appeal in\n   <em>\n    Plummer\n   </em>\n   involved whether the trial court should have granted the husband's Rule 60(b), Ala. R. Civ. P., motion to set aside the judgment as void. This court held that, because the trial court's judgment was entered after a hearing at which the wife testified, and because the husband did not include a transcript of that proceeding on appeal, this court would \"conclusively presume\" that the evidence not contained in the record supported the judgment.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9712547\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/361/592/\">\n    361 So.2d at 593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , the trial court, on the husband's motion, entered a default judgment that divorced the parties, granted sole physical custody of the parties' child to the husband, and ordered the wife to pay child\n   support. This court reversed the judgment, finding that the record contained no testimonial evidence to support the judgment and noting that the trial court had stated that the judgment was entered \" 'on consideration of the pleadings and hearing held for sanctions,' and not upon any other evidence.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6861073\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/168/61/\">\n    168 So.3d at 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Tucker\n   </em>\n   , this court reversed a trial court's default judgment in favor of the wife in a divorce proceeding, finding that \"the wife did not introduce any evidence to establish facts that would support the specific division of property, the award of child support, the custody determination, or any other specific relief that the wife was awarded in the divorce judgment.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7035046\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/60/891/\">\n    60 So.3d at 898\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Therefore, the trial court could have been clearly convinced that the parties had been in a common-law marriage before their ceremonial marriage and that the length of the marriage was greater than 10 years.

On appeal, the husband does not point to any deficiencies in the wife's affidavit to support the judgment granting her physical custody of the child but, instead, argues without a citation to authority that a hearing should have been held.

Child Support and Worker's Compensation Benefits\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The husband challenges the trial court's judgment awarding the wife one-half of the husband's undefined prospective worker's compensation benefits to fulfill an undetermined child-support obligation. In support, the husband cites \u00a7 25-5-86(2), Ala. Code 1975, which provides that \"[c]laims for compensation, awards, judgments, or agreements to pay compensation owned by an injured employee or his or her dependent shall not be assignable and shall be exempt from seizure or sale or garnishment for the payment of any debt or liability.\" This court has held that \" \u00a7 25-5-86 does not exempt workmen's compensation from garnishment for the satisfaction of [a parent's] child support obligation.\"\n   <em>\n    McCall v.

In\n   <em>\n    McCall\n   </em>\n   , the trial court determined that the child-support obligor owed a specific child-support arrearage and this court determined that the obligor's worker's compensation benefits were not exempt from satisfying that arrearage.
