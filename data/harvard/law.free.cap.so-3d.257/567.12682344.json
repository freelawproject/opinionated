Purdy\n   </em>\n   , 43 Fla. L. Weekly S321, --- So.3d ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204345959\">\n    2018 WL 4345959\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. Aug. 30, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Accordingly, we affirm the sentence imposed by the trial court following the sentence review hearing on Appellant's conviction for first-degree murder. We also affirm the trial court's determination that it did not have the authority or discretion to modify Appellant's previously imposed 112.7-month sentences for his armed robbery and armed carjacking convictions that were run concurrently with each other but consecutively to Appellant's sentence for first-degree murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Appellant raised two other claims on appeal that were unrelated to the certified question answered by the Florida Supreme Court. First, as previously conceded by the State, the three-year minimum mandatory provisions that were part of Appellant's 112.7-month prison sentences for the armed robbery and armed carjacking convictions are to run concurrently. There was conflicting language in separate, contemporaneously rendered sentencing documents on this issue when Appellant was first sentenced. Therefore, the trial court is directed to clarify and correct the judgment and sentences on remand, if it has not already done so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Lastly, at the sentence review hearing, the trial court found that Appellant was not eligible for gain time on his sentence for the first-degree murder. The authority to regulate gain time resides exclusively with the Department of Corrections, not the trial court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

On remand, the trial court is directed to strike as surplusage any language in the sentencing documents regarding gain time.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11082005\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/789/316/#p319\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"If, in sentencing, a court attempts to bar or grant gain time, such language has been treated as surplusage or stricken.\" (citing\n   <em>\n    Shupe v.
