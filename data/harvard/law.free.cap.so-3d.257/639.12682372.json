Baker, who was sixteen years old at the time of the offense and nineteen years old during sentencing, shot a police officer at an apartment complex. The jury found that the victim was a law enforcement officer engaged in the lawful performance of a legal duty, that Baker possessed and discharged a firearm, and that as a result, he inflicted great bodily harm. Baker is currently serving a fifty-four-year sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In initially affirming Baker's sentence, this Court followed its precedent in\n   <em>\n    Henry v.

However, the Florida Supreme Court overturned our precedent in\n   <em>\n    Henry v.
