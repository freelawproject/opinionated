We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On the morning of May 2, 2012, Vanessa Zapata got ready for work and briefly saw her four-year-old daughter Ava, who was eating breakfast. Zapata left for work sometime before 9:00 a.m., leaving Ava in the care of her boyfriend Contreras.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   At trial, Zapata testified that around 1:30 p.m., she came home during her lunch hour and found that Ava had vomited on herself. Zapata bathed Ava and went back to work. When she returned home, Zapata found Ava lying on her bedroom floor. It appeared to Zapata that \"[Ava] was starting to get sick. She didn't seem as energetic or interested in anything.\" Ava eventually went to bed without eating. At some point, Ava woke up and called out to Zapata. Zapata carried Ava to the bathroom because Zapata thought that Ava was going to vomit again. Ava passed out and hit her head on the floor. Zapata telephoned emergency 911 and Ava was transported to East Alabama Medical Center in Opelika.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At some point, Ava was airlifted to Children's Hospital in Birmingham. After multiple surgeries, it was discovered that Ava suffered from an intestinal injury that was uncommon for her age group. As a result of her injury, Ava was removed from life support, and she later died. Her body was then transported to the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   An autopsy was performed on Ava by Dr. Steven Dunton, the senior State Medical Examiner and pathologist. Dr. Dunton testified that Ava died from brain swelling following complications of an abdominal injury caused by blunt-force trauma. Ava had a laceration on her liver, and her small intestine had been severed into two pieces, causing internal bleeding. Dr. Dunton determined that a blunt, \"impaling\" object crushed the intestine between the object and the spine causing it to tear and burst.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Contreras gave a statement to police, which was read into evidence. (R. 724.) According to his statement, Contreras was playing with Ava and another child in the living room about 10:00 a.m. when, Contreras said, he \"accidentally\" kicked Ava in the stomach. Contreras described the kick as \"more of a sweeping motion with [his] leg.\" Contreras stated that the first time that Ava got sick was about 1:30 p.m. when Zapata came home for lunch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Contreras admitted that he did not tell anyone what had happened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On appeal, Contreras argues that the circuit court erred by instructing the jury, over his objection, on felony murder predicated on the underlying felony of aggravated child abuse.

The State requested that the trial court instruct the jury on felony murder with aggravated child abuse as the underlying felony. Over Contreras's strenuous objections, the trial court so instructed the jury.

The majority appears to attempt to distinguish this case from\n   <em>\n    Barnett\n   </em>\n   in order to sidestep the fundamental holding of\n   <em>\n    Barnett\n   </em>\n   that \"felonious assaults that result in the victim's death merge with the homicide and therefore cannot serve as an underlying felony for purposes of the felony-murder rule.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11108939\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/783/927/\">\n    783 So.2d at 930\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The majority's attempt to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Barnett\n   </em>\n   is based on an isolated sentence from that case.

The majority states that the two elements of aggravated child abuse that are independent of the homicide are that the victim was under the age of 18 years, \u00a7 26-15-3.1, Ala.Code 1975; and that the accused was a \"responsible person\" in relation to the child, \u00a7 26-15-2, Ala.Code 1975.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   I disagree with the majority on several of the foregoing points.

Second, I disagree with the majority's identification of the \"critical inquiry\" based on\n   <em>\n    Barnett.\n   </em>\n   Third, even considering the majority's argument regarding the elements of aggravated child abuse in light of the \"underlying homicide,\" the purported distinctions do not affect the application of the merger doctrine in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The sentence in\n   <em>\n    Barnett\n   </em>\n   regarding the elements of the underlying felony that the majority cites and relies on as the basis of its decision here is but a mention within an extensive discussion of the legal analysis that supported our holding in\n   <em>\n    Barnett.\n   </em>\n   The majority, itself, quotes extensively from that discussion, and I do so here to illustrate one of the reasons I disagree with the majority's analysis and holding.

To allow such use of the felony-murder rule would effectively preclude the jury from considering the issue of malice aforethought in all cases wherein homicide has been committed as a result of a felonious assault-a category which includes the great majority of all homicides. This kind of bootstrapping finds support neither in logic nor in law.
