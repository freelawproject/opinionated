Two officers approached defendant, who stood on the sidewalk among a group of seven persons at night in a high crime area, because the group strongly smelled of burning marijuana, which gave the officers reasonable suspicion to conduct a brief investigatory stop pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Terry v.

Defendant here, during a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   stop based on reasonable suspicion, was found to be in possession of marijuana. Therefore, he was subject to arrest. Accordingly, we grant the state's application to reverse the district court's ruling that granted defendant's motion to suppress, and remand for further proceedings. In addition, the district court is directed to reconsider its ruling with regard to probable cause in light of the views expressed here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    REVERSED AND REMANDED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I respectfully dissent, finding the district court did not err in granting defendant's motion to suppress evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In this case, two officers were on patrol and came across a group of approximately seven individuals, including the defendant. Officers claimed that as they were driving by with their windows down, they detected an odor consistent with marijuana. As officers\n   approached the group, one individual allegedly responded \"We had smoked earlier.\" One of the officers claimed defendant made the statement, however defendant asserted the officer's body camera footage clearly indicated a woman made the statement. The officers then conducted a pat down and search of three members of the group, including the defendant. The officers recovered a bag of marijuana from the defendant after the pat down and placed him under arrest for possession of marijuana. A subsequent search incident to the arrest recovered individually wrapped bags of heroin and a digital scale. Defendant was also charged with one count of possession of heroin with intent to distribute. Defendant filed a motion to suppress the evidence on the basis the investigatory stop was not permissible, and the pat down was not justified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Under the Fourth Amendment, a police officer may briefly detain an individual for investigative purposes (\"\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   stop\") if the officer has a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the individual has committed or about to commit a crime.\n   <em>\n    Terry v.

In granting the motion to suppress, the court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The telling thing for the court is that no one in the group makes a motion to leave, no furtive movements, nothing else, it's a very calm situation. The officer is very polite, inquisitive, but polite. There's no issue that the officer either testified to...or...evidence on the body camera that the officer had any indication that he should be on alert, that perhaps someone had committed-expect for the smoking of the marijuana-had committed a crime, was committing a crime, was about to commit a crime.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   The court notes that the new marijuana laws...marijuana is now a summonsable offense. In fact, the issue is to issue a summons and not arrest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   It seems as though the officers in this case went directly from approaching and making inquisitions or asking questions into a straight pat-down, full pat-down, and search of all the individuals that were there for no real clear indication in\n   this court's opinion and therefore the court finds that there was not probable cause for the search and suppresses the evidence that was seized.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Based on the facts of this case, I do not find that officers had a particularized and objective basis for suspecting this defendant had committed a crime, was committing a crime, or was about to commit a crime. Further, I find the pat down of defendant was not justified in this case because the officers failed to point to particular facts from which they reasonably inferred defendant was armed and dangerous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 1, \u00a7 5 of the Louisiana Constitution protect citizens against unreasonable searches and seizures. However, all too often these constitutional protections are not respected by law enforcement in urban areas, especially those designated as \"high crime areas.\" The action of walking down the street in a group of people, even in a \"high crime area,\" without more, is insufficient to justify an investigatory stop and pat down. In my view, the officers' reliance on the smell of marijuana was certainly pre-textual in this case. Had officers merely smelled marijuana in a more affluent neighborhood or at one of our city's numerous outdoor festivals, I doubt they would begin to pat down everyone on the street or in the crowd. The same constitutional protections must apply to all of our citizens, regardless of the area of town.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   For these reasons, I see no error in the district court's ruling granting defendant's motion to suppress and I would deny the state's writ application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   GENOVESE, Justice, would deny.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
