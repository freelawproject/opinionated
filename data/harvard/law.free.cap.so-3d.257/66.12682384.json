The Rules Committees published the proposals for comment before filing them with the Court and made revisions to the proposals in response to the comments they received. The amendments before the Court were unanimously approved by the Board of Governors of The Florida Bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After the joint report was filed, the Court published the proposed amendments for comment. The Court received comments from Victoria Katz, a rules attorney for Aderant CompuLaw, as well as from several members of the original Joint Email Service Committee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Civil Procedure Rules Committee filed a response to the comments indicating its opposition to the proposed amendment to Rule of Judicial Administration 2.514(a)(1)(A), and suggesting additional amendments to the rule. The Rules of Judicial Administration Committee, the Criminal Procedure Rules Committee, and the Appellate Court Rules Committee filed a joint response addressing the concerns raised in the comments and declining to make any further revisions to the proposed amendments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After considering the proposed amendments, the comments filed, the Rules Committees' responses, and hearing oral argument, we adopt the amendments as proposed and set forth in the appendix to this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Rules of Judicial Administration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Subdivision (b) of Rule of Judicial Administration 2.514 (Computing and Extending\n   Time) is amended to remove \"or e-mail\" so that service by mail and e-mail are no longer treated identically. We also amend subdivision (a)(1)(A) of that rule so that time frames are calculated beginning from the next day following the event that triggers the time frame that is not a weekend or legal holiday. Subdivision (b)(1)(D)(iii) (Service; How Made; Service by Electronic Mail (\"e-mail\"); Time of Service) of rule 2.516 is amended to no longer allow parties an additional five days to respond following service of a document by e-mail. This amendment is consistent with the amendment to subdivision (b) of rule 2.514. Email, unlike postal mail, is now nearly instantaneous and no additional time should be permitted for responses to documents served by e-mail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Rules of Civil Procedure\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Rules of Civil Procedure 1.170 (Counterclaims and Crossclaims), 1.260 (Survivor; Substitution of Parties), 1.351 (Production of Documents and Things Without Deposition), 1.410 (Subpoena), 1.440 (Setting Action for Trial), 1.442 (Proposals for Settlement), and 1.510 (Summary Judgment) are amended to directly reference Rule of Judicial Administration 2.516 (Service of Pleadings and Documents) instead of referencing Rule of Civil Procedure 1.080 (Service and Filing of Pleadings, Orders, and Documents).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We further amend rule 1.351 to reduce the time frame for parties to serve by e-mail a notice of intent to serve a subpoena requesting production of documents and things from fifteen to ten days. Lastly, we also amend rule 1.510 in subdivision (c) (Motion and Proceedings Thereon) to treat summary judgment evidence submitted electronically or by e-mail the same as summary judgment evidence that is \"delivered,\" providing that while service by mail must take place at least five days prior to the day of the hearing, service by delivery, e-filing, and e-mail must take place no later than two days prior to the day of the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Rules of Criminal Procedure\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.040 (Computation of Time) is amended to remove the reference to subdivision (a) of Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.514, to conform with the amendment to that rule. As amended, the rule provides that computation of time shall be governed by Rule of Judicial Administration 2.514. Rule 3.070 (Additional Time After Service by Mail, When Permitted, or E-Mail) is deleted in its entirety. The rule provided its own time frames for service by mail and e-mail; specifically, it provided for an additional three days to be added to the deadline when a party had the right or was required to do some act or take some proceedings within a prescribed period after the service of a notice or other document on the party by mail or e-mail. Deleting rule 3.070 makes the Rules of Criminal Procedure consistent with the other amendments herein adopted. Computation of time in criminal proceedings is now governed by Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.514.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Rules of Appellate Procedure\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Rules Committees' proposed amendments to the Rules of Appellate Procedure all concern enlarging time frames. The Rules Committees' report indicates that in response to the proposed amendments to Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.514 removing the additional five days when service is made by e-mail, the Appellate Court Rules Committee originally proposed amending the Rules of Appellate Procedure to retain the additional five days for service by e-mail. The Board of Governors expressed concerns about the removal of the five days from the other bodies of rules when service is made by e-mail, while maintaining\n   the five days for e-mail service in the Rules of Appellate Procedure. The Board of Governors suggested that the Committees attempt to come to an agreement that would address its concerns and maintain one rule for computation of time. The amendments proposed here reflect a compromise among the Rules Committees to address the Appellate Court Rules Committee's concern about the loss of the five additional days to respond to service of a document by e-mail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We amend rules 9.100 (Original Proceedings), 9.110 (Appeal Proceedings to Review Final Orders of Lower Tribunals and Orders Granting New Trial in Jury and Nonjury Cases), 9.120 (Discretionary Proceedings to Review Decisions of District Courts of Appeal), 9.125 (Review of Trial Court Orders and Judgments Certified by the District Courts of Appeal as Requiring Immediate Resolution by the Supreme Court of Florida), 9.130 (Proceedings to Review Nonfinal Orders and Specified Final Orders), 9.140 (Appeal Proceedings in Criminal Cases), 9.141 (Review Proceedings in Collateral or Postconviction Criminal Cases), 9.142 (Procedures for Review in Death Penalty Cases), 9.146 (Appeal Proceedings in Juvenile Dependency and Termination of Parental Rights Cases and Cases Involving Families and Children in Need of Services), 9.180 (Appeal Proceedings to Review Workers' Compensation Cases), 9.200 (The Record), 9.210 (Briefs), 9.300 (Motions), 9.320 (Oral Argument), 9.330 (Rehearing; Clarification; Certification; Written Opinion), 9.331 (Determination of Causes in a District Court of Appeal En Banc), 9.350 (Dismissal of Causes), 9.360 (Parties), and 9.410 (Sanctions) to enlarge time frames as proposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We further adopt the Rules Committees' nonsubstantive editorial amendments to subdivisions (i) (Ineffective Assistance of Counsel for Parents Claims-Special Procedures and Time Limitations Applicable to Appeals of Orders in Termination of Parental Rights Proceedings Involving Ineffective Assistance of Counsel Claims), (i)(2) (Rendition), (i)(4)(A) (Ineffective Assistance of Counsel Motion Filed After Commencement of Appeal; Stay of Appellate Proceeding), and (i)(4)(C) (Ineffective Assistance of Counsel Motion Filed After Commencement of Appeal; Duties of the Clerk, Preparation and Transmittal of Supplemental Record) of rule 9.146, as proposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Accordingly, the Florida Rules of Judicial Administration, Rules of Civil Procedure, Rules of Criminal Procedure, and Rules of Appellate Procedure are hereby amended as reflected in the appendix to this opinion. New language is indicated by underscoring; deletions are indicated by struck-through type. The amendments shall become effective January 1, 2019, at 12:02 a.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   It is so ordered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   CANADY, C.J., and PARIENTE, QUINCE, POLSTON, LABARGA, and LAWSON, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   LEWIS, J., dissents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Attachment\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    APPENDIX\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   RULE 2.514.

If a subpoena does not specify a form for producing electronically stored information, the person responding must produce it in a form or forms in which it is ordinarily maintained or in a reasonably usable form or forms. A person responding to a subpoena may object to discovery of electronically stored information from sources that the person identifies as not reasonably accessible because of undue costs or burden. On motion to compel discovery or to quash, the person from whom discovery is sought must show that the information sought or the form requested is not reasonably accessible because of undue costs or burden. If that showing is made, the court may nonetheless order discovery from such sources or in such forms if the requesting party shows good cause, considering the limitations set out in rule 1.280(d)(2). The court may specify conditions of the discovery, including ordering that some or all of the expenses of the discovery be paid by the party seeking the discovery. A party seeking a production of evidence at trial which would be subject to a subpoena may compel such production by serving a notice to produce such evidence on an adverse party as provided in\n   <s>\n    rule 1.080\n   </s>\n   <em>\n    Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.516\n   </em>\n   .
