For the reasons that follow, we affirm Defendant's convictions, but remand for resentencing in accordance with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On September 30, 2012, New Orleans Police Department (\"NOPD\") Officer Tanya Watson responded to a report of a vehicle stolen in the 6300 block of Chef Menteur Highway in New Orleans. Officer Watson met with the victim, Mr. Ryan Cope, who reported his Ford pickup truck missing and executed a theft affidavit to that effect. Officer Watson obtained the truck's vehicle identification number and license plate and model numbers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Detective Debrah Normand entered the information gathered by Officer Watson into the National Crime Information Center database, and Mr. Cope's truck was recovered on the evening of October 2, 2012, in the 7400 block of Dartmoor Street in New Orleans East. During her investigation, Detective Normand learned that Mr. Cope's truck had been used during a series of crimes - an armed robbery and simple burglary of a vehicle, both occurring in the 200 block of Bellaire Street. Fingerprints obtained from the SUV burglarized on Bellaire Street led to the development of Byron Johnson as a suspect in the theft of Mr. Cope's truck. Witnesses to the vehicle burglary on Bellaire Street observed Johnson and two other individuals fleeing the scene in the truck, which was ultimately identified by its license plate number as the truck stolen from Mr. Cope.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On the night of October 2, 2012, Derek McArthur drove his 2004 F-250 truck to New Orleans from Florida, checked into a hotel, and secured his truck in the hotel's parking lot. When Mr. McArthur awoke the following morning, he discovered his truck missing. The police recovered Mr. McArthur's truck on October 4, 2012. Fingerprints lifted from the truck, which were analyzed by an NOPD fingerprint expert, Officer George Jackson, matched Defendant and Devante Billy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Christopher Becnel testified that on the night of October 2, 2012, at about 8:00 p.m., he drove into the driveway of his home in the 200 block of Bellaire Street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As Mr. Becnel prepared to exit his vehicle, he noticed an African American youth, between sixteen and twenty-one years of age, hiding behind a trash can. The youth stood up and, while brandishing a gun, charged Mr. Becnel's vehicle, and Mr. Becnel backed out of his driveway. The suspect fled on foot down the street. Mr. Becnel pursued the suspect and observed an armed robbery of his neighbor, Ms. Mary Cowan, in progress on Bellaire Street. The suspect that Mr. Becnel was following yelled and motioned to the two suspects robbing Ms. Cowan, and all of the suspects fled in a white truck parked in the 100 block of Bellaire Street. As the three suspects fled, Ms. Cowan told Mr. Becnel that she and her daughter had just been robbed at gunpoint. Mr. Becnel continued to pursue the fleeing suspects. During the chase, the suspects' truck was involved in a hit and run collision on Metairie Road. After that collision, the truck proceeded on Metairie Road in the direction of City Park Avenue, where it hit another vehicle and then entered the westbound lane of the I-10 at Metairie Road. Mr. Becnel lost sight of the truck and returned to alert his wife, Toni Ann Becnel, to the incidents. In the days following the incidents, Mr. Becnel viewed a photographic lineup from which he identified Byron Johnson as the youth who pointed a gun at him. Mr. Becnel testified that the suspect was not involved in the armed robbery of Ms. Cowan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Mrs. Becnel testified that after hearing the commotion on Bellaire Street, she examined her SUV and found one of its doors ajar and the contents of the vehicle tossed about. The glove box had been rifled through and its contents strewn everywhere. Mrs. Becnel's credit card was missing. She denied knowing Byron Johnson or the Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Detective Kristie Harper investigated the burglary of Mrs. Becnel's SUV. When she arrived on the scene, Mr. Becnel described what happened. A crime technician dusted the interior and exterior of the SUV and lifted thirteen prints, six of which were identified as matching Byron Johnson. In investigating the burglary of the SUV, Detective Harper learned of the armed robbery that occurred on the same night in the same area. Further, she learned that the armed robbery suspects and the suspect in the SUV burglary fled the scene together in the white Ford truck stolen from Mr. Cope. Detective Harper was present when police located Mr. Cope's stolen truck parked in the 7400 block of Dartmoor Street. She knew that a check bearing Ms. Cowan's name was found in the vehicle. Byron Johnson was not a suspect in the armed robbery of Ms. Cowan because Mr. Becnel's testimony placed him at the Becnel home burglarizing Mrs. Becnel's SUV at the time Ms. Cowan was robbed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Certified Latent Prints Examiner Officer George Jackson examined the fingerprints lifted from Mrs. Becnel's SUV. He ran the fingerprints in the Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS), which indicated a match to Byron Johnson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On the night of October 2, 2012, Ms. Mary Cowan recalled dining with friends and family members. When she returned to her home in the 200 block of Bellaire Street, she exited the front passenger seat of her sister's car and noticed someone to her right running down the sidewalk away from her. Right after that, she observed two males running toward her. One of the men was armed and demanded all of her belongings. Ms. Cowan testified that the person she initially noticed running down the street was different from the two men who robbed her, but that the three men left the area together in the same truck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Her neighbor, Mr. Becnel, pursued the suspects in his vehicle. The suspects took Ms. Cowan's purse when they fled. Ms. Cowan described one of her assailants as a slightly built, teen-aged, light-skinned black male, approximately five feet, nine inches tall with his hair in twists. In the ensuing days, Ms. Cowan viewed three six-person photographic lineups, but did not identify anyone from those lineups. In March 2013, Ms. Cowan met with Detective Kristen Krzemieniecki, who showed her a fourth photo lineup, from which Ms. Cowan identified the Defendant as the unarmed robber, who pulled her purse from her on the night of October 2, 2012. Ms. Cowan's purse and wallet were eventually returned to her, but their contents, including her credit card, were missing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Detective Krzemieniecki learned other officers believed the truck owned by Mr. Cope was used in both the Bellaire Street burglary of Mrs. Becnel's SUV and the armed robbery of Ms. Cowan on the night of October 2, 2012. Detective Krzemieniecki identified a surveillance video recorded at 7400 Dartmoor Street on October 4, 2012, in which the stolen trucks owned by Mr. Cope and Mr. McArthur are depicted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On the evening of October 2, 2012, Officer Walter Edmond was in the general area of Louisiana Avenue and Camp Street when he heard gunfire. Officer Edmond canvassed the area, and as he neared the intersection of Delachaise and Camp Streets, he heard screaming. Officer Edmond found Sanford Kaynor shot in the chest, lying in the driveway of his Camp Street residence. Mr. Kaynor told Officer Edmond that black males shot him and stole his vehicle. Officer Edmond relayed that information to Sergeant Jonathan Bulling. Sgt. Bulling assisted in processing the scene and collecting evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Detective Krzemieniecki was the lead detective in the investigation of the attempted second degree murder and armed robbery of Mr. Kaynor. The Defendant was developed as a suspect through DNA evidence collected from a black and white bandana discovered on the scene and from fingerprints recovered from Mr. Kaynor's stolen vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Grace Kaynor recounted that on the evening of October 2, 2012, she, her husband, and eight-year-old daughter were home at their Camp Street residence. Mrs. Kaynor retired about 9:00 p.m., leaving her husband and daughter watching television downstairs. She awoke to two policemen telling her that her husband had been shot in the driveway. She ran outside and found him lying on the ground in terrible pain. To comfort him she told him everything was going to be okay. He responded: \"No, it's never going to be all right. I can't feel my legs.\" When she attempted to find her driver's license, she realized someone had been in her house because her purse, wallet, house and car keys, and cellphone were missing from their usual place in the kitchen. At the same time, she noticed that her husband's computer and her daughter's iPad were gone. She noticed the kitchen door had been unlocked as a result of her husband having gone outside to his car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Mrs. Kaynor accompanied her husband to the hospital where doctors told her he likely would not live through the night because of the gunshot wounds. In the days following the shooting, her husband was in and out of a coma and underwent several surgeries. Mrs. Kaynor kept a diary of things her husband told her while he was hospitalized. He told her three black males, who were fifteen or sixteen years old, approached him and two of the robbers were armed with handguns. One of the three perpetrators wore a mask and the other two waited for the third to arrive. Eight days after being shot, Mr. Kaynor\n   suffered a massive brain hemorrhage, leaving him paralyzed, unable to speak and brain damaged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On October 4, 2012, the police searched Byron Johnson's 8841 Gervais Street residence and recovered Defendant's fingerprints in relation to the theft of Derek McArthur's truck, Ms. Cowan's debit card, and the cell phone stolen from the Kaynor residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Detective Krzemieniecki was recalled by the State to testify about her investigation of the armed robbery, attempted murder and aggravated burglary of Mr. Kaynor. Her investigation began with reviewing the initial report of the incident and speaking with Mrs. Kaynor. Detective Krzemieniecki learned that Mrs. Kaynor's purse, cell phone, wallet, vehicle keys, laptop, iPad and camera were stolen from the Kaynor residence the night Mr. Kaynor was shot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On October 4, 2012, Detective Krzemieniecki discovered that the armed robberies of Mr. Kaynor and Ms. Cowan were related when she was notified the police were executing a search warrant at Byron Johnson's residence in New Orleans East. Detective Krzemieniecki participated in the search, during which officers located an identification and credit cards belonging to Ms. Cowan and a digital camera and a laptop computer taken from the Kaynor residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On October 5, 2012, Detective Krzemieniecki returned to canvas the area around Byron Johnson's residence. Within a few blocks, Detective Krzemieniecki found insurance paperwork on the Cadillac and Mercedes-Benz vehicles belonging to Mr. Kaynor. Around this same time, Mr. Kaynor's stolen Cadillac was located pursuant to a call reporting an abandoned vehicle at an apartment complex at 8019 Trapier Street. Processing of the vehicle yielded Defendant's fingerprints. Supported by a Combined DNA Index System (\"CODIS\") hit on the black and white bandana recovered from the Kaynor crime scene, Detective Krzemieniecki obtained search warrants for DNA samples from Defendant and Byron Johnson. Testing identified the presence of DNA from both Defendant and Byron Johnson on the bandana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On October 6, 2012, police recovered Mr. Kaynor's stolen Cadillac. Sergeant Troy Dickerson of the NOPD Forensic Investigative Unit processed the vehicle for fingerprints and DNA evidence by swabbing the vehicle. Sgt. Dickerson lifted finger and palm prints, which were examined by Officer Joseph Pollard and compared with Defendant's prints. Officer Pollard's examination of the palm print lifted from the driver's side interior door handle indicated a match to Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Louisiana State Police Crime Lab Forensic DNA Analyst Rhalie Austin examined the DNA sample lifted from the black and white bandana recovered from the Kaynor residence. Ms. Austin compared the DNA sample from the bandana to Defendant's DNA and the DNA belonging to Byron Johnson. She concluded that neither Defendant nor Byron Johnson could be excluded as contributors of the DNA found on the bandana. Ms. Austin further testified that the odds of finding the same DNA profile of a random individual other than Defendant or Byron Johnson on that bandana were one in 1.77 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   NOPD firearms identification expert Meredith Acosta tested two spent shell casings related to the Kaynor investigation. Ms. Acosta's analysis determined the shell casings were .9 millimeter caliber and were fired by the same weapon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On October 19, 2012, Detective Bronson Gettridge responded to a report of a shooting in the 7800 block of Burke Avenue in New Orleans East. When he arrived on\n   the scene, Detective Gettridge observed a small car parked in the middle of the street. The driver's side window was shattered and both front doors were open. A non-responsive male victim, identified as Valon May, was in the front seat of the car with an apparent gunshot wound to the right side of the head.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Multiple pieces of evidence were recovered from the scene. Three or four bullet casings, which were found inside the vehicle, were submitted for ballistics testing. Crime technicians located an open wallet and baseball hat on the floor of the driver's side of the vehicle. The hat was submitted to the State Police Crime Lab for DNA testing, which revealed the presence of Devante Billy's DNA. The NOPD crime lab lifted five or six fingerprints from the victim's car which matched those of Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Tasia Williams testified that she and Mr. May were friends and that on the day he died, he gave her a ride to a friend's house. As Mr. May drove, he received a call from \"Yanny,\" asking him to meet her on Burke Avenue. Ms. Williams told him she feared for his safety and asked him not to meet Yanny. Detective Darryl Doucette was assigned to investigate the victim's murder, and Ms. Williams met with Detective Doucette the day after the victim was killed. She told Detective Doucette that Yanny called Mr. May while she was with him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Mr. May's cellphone records indicated he did, in fact, receive phone calls approximately thirty minutes prior to the shooting from two individuals, Aalilyah Cobb and Marvielle \"Yanny\" Smith. However, both denied having any knowledge of the shooting, and denied making any phone calls. Detective Doucette reviewed Ms. Smith's social media postings, and learned that Devante \"Tae Banga\" Billy and Defendant, Charles \"Chuck\" Carter, were two of her associates. Upon uncovering the foregoing information, Detective Doucette once again interviewed Ms. Smith and Ms. Cobb, both of whom implicated \"Tae\" and \"Chuck\" in the murder and armed robbery of Mr. May. Ms. Smith identified Defendant from a confirmation photo presented by Detective Doucette. Ms. Cobb told Detective Doucette that she saw Devante Billy fleeing the scene armed with a gun, and Defendant running from the victim's car carrying a GPS device. Detective Doucette verified the information supplied by Ms. Cobb through the recordings of Defendant's jailhouse calls, which implicated Devante Billy as the person who shot Mr. May and Defendant as the man who robbed him at gunpoint. During a third interview with Detective Doucette, Ms. Cobb and Ms. Smith viewed six-person lineups from which each identified Devante \"Tae Banga\" Billy as the shooter. Further, Ms. Cobb and Ms. Smith indicated that at the time of the shooting, Defendant was wearing an Oakland Raiders vest, black jeans and black and white Adidas tennis shoes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Detective Doucette obtained an arrest warrant for Defendant and a warrant to search his residence. The search produced clothing as described by Ms. Cobb and Ms. Smith, a non-operational GPS device, consistent with the type stolen from the victim's vehicle, and one bullet which matched the type of ammunition used to shoot Mr. May.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Following Defendant's arrest, he gave a statement to Detective Doucette in which he admitted to having been present when Mr. May was shot. He explained that just prior to the shooting, he was talking to Mr. May about a marijuana purchase. He also stated that a female, unknown to him, was seated in the front passenger seat of the victim's car. As Mr. May spoke to Defendant, an individual named \"Don Tavis\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   shot and robbed the victim. Detective Doucette testified that he was not able to locate anyone by the name of \"Don Tavis,\" nor was there any evidence of anyone by that name linked to this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Ms. Smith testified that she was a friend of Mr. May and witnessed the shooting. Initially, she did not tell the police everything she knew because she feared retaliation from Devante \"Tae Banga\" Billy. She knew Defendant was one of \"Tae's\" friends.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Ms. Smith stated that she had known Mr. May for about two months prior to the murder. He would often drive her to wherever she wanted to go. On the night of the shooting, she met her friend, Ms. Cobb, in Algiers. They rode the bus to New Orleans East and met \"Tae\" and his friend, \"Chuck\" sometime between 6:00 and 7:00 p.m. and went to the baseball park. From there, she, Ms. Cobb, \"Tae,\" \"Chuck,\" \"Ki Ki\" and \"Trey\" walked to \"Chuck's\" house. Ms. Smith noticed that \"Chuck\" was carrying a gun in his pants. At some point in the evening, Ms. Smith called Mr. May, who was with Ms. Williams at the time, and asked him to drive her and Ms. Cobb to a party. When Mr. May arrived at \"Chuck's\" residence, he was alone. At the same time he arrived, Ms. Smith received a call from her boyfriend \"Joker,\" who was incarcerated. She handed her phone to Ms. Cobb to talk to \"Joker\" because she did not want \"Joker\" to know she was with \"Tae.\" Ms. Smith got into the front passenger seat of Mr. May's car, Ms. Cobb stood near the rear of the car, and \"Chuck\" walked to the driver's side door, pointed a gun at Mr. May and demanded money. Mr. May gave Defendant his wallet. As that happened, \"Tae\" got into the front seat and removed the GPS device from the car. He then walked to the back of the car and sat in the back seat. \"Tae\" asked Mr. May about money again, and Mr. May responded he had none. Defendant handed \"Tae\" the gun and told him to shoot Mr. May. \"Tae\" shot him in the back of the head while Ms. Cobb was standing at the rear of the victim's car speaking to \"Joker\" on a cell phone. Defendant grabbed Mr. May's cellphone. \"Tae\" handed the GPS device to Defendant, and they fled on foot. \"Tae\" brought the gun to a friend's house, and Defendant threw the GPS device over a fence. Because Ms. Smith and Ms. Cobb had witnessed the murder, \"Tae\" and Defendant refused to allow them to go home. The four proceeded to a party, and \"Tae\" told Ms. Smith that if the police spoke to her tell them Defendant had shot Mr. May.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On cross-examination, Ms. Smith admitted having a romantic relationship with \"Tae\" after the murder, but she explained she continued to see him because she feared he would kill her if he could not maintain some control over her. To further intimidate her, \"Tae\" told her that his brother killed a girl who was supposed to testify against \"Tae.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Ms. Cobb testified that she knew Mr. May for about one year prior to his death. She witnessed his murder on Burke Avenue. She stated that she saw two suspects, one with a gun and the other carrying a GPS device, fleeing the scene after the shooting. Ms. Cobb spoke to the police a number of times, and at first, she did not tell the police about the murder. She denied being at the scene and denied knowing who committed the crime, but stated she did so out of fear for her safety. During another interview with Detective Doucette in her mother's presence, she told the detective she indeed witnessed the events as described above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   She recalled that, on October 19, 2012, she and Ms. Smith met \"Tae\" and \"Chuck\" for the first time that evening. They all went to a baseball game and then to\n   \"Chuck's\" house in New Orleans East. She and Ms. Smith intended to go to a party, but when it got late, Ms. Smith called Mr. May asking for a ride home. The victim met them on Burke Street, but before he arrived, Ms. Smith received a call from her boyfriend, \"Joker.\" She took the call because Ms. Smith did not want \"Joker\" to know she was out with other boys. Mr. May drove up while she was speaking with \"Joker,\" and Ms. Smith handed the phone to her. Ms. Smith approached the front passenger door, while \"Chuck\" approached the driver's side of the car. Someone got into the back seat, but she did not see who it was. She heard gunshots as she was speaking to \"Joker,\" and saw \"Chuck\" and \"Tae\" running from the car. \"Tae\" had a gun in his hand and \"Chuck\" was carrying the victim's cellphone and a GPS device.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   NOPD Crime Technician Shelita Hayes Benjamin photographed and processed the shooting scene for evidence. She retrieved an orange and black Mets cap, a black wallet containing a license and bank cards, and various business cards. She also recovered six latent fingerprints from the exterior of the driver's side door of the vehicle, four spent cartridge casings from the driver's seat and a receipt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In October 2012, Sergeant Marc Boudreau was a firearms examiner with the NOPD Crime Lab. He determined that the four bullet casings retrieved at the shooting scene were fired by the same weapon, a .38 caliber semi-automatic handgun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Officer Pollard testified he examined the fingerprints lifted in this case and confirmed that the print lifted from the driver's door matched that of Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Jim Huey testified that he worked at the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Department and was the custodian of records of inmate telephone calls. He stated that the phone calls of the inmates are recorded on an internet-based system and stored on a secured database. Mr. Huey testified that when an inmate makes a call, the inmate must use a pin/folder number that was issued to the inmate at the time of booking. One of Mr. Huey's duties is to provide law enforcement agencies with copies of an inmate's jailhouse telephone calls. Mr. Huey explained that when an inmate makes a call from the Orleans Parish Prison, the inmate is issued a warning that the call will be monitored and recorded. Mr. Huey also noted that a call detail sheet, which lists the specifics of an inmate call, such as the name of the caller, time, duration, number called, etc., accompanied the recording of jailhouse calls. Pursuant to the State's request, Huey supplied a disc containing two calls Defendant made while incarcerated in September and November 2015. The State played the recordings for the jury. In the first call, Defendant spoke to an unidentified male and learned that \"Wink,\" apparently Byron Johnson, accepted a forty-five-year plea deal. Defendant told the unidentified male he was going to try to get a plea deal for \"all\" of the crimes. In the second call, Defendant is heard telling a female that he wants to take twenty years for \"everything,\" but that the District Attorney would not agree to it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Errors Patent\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   A review for errors patent on the face of the record reveals none.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Assignment of Error No. 3\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   We first address Appellant's third assignment of error, which challenges the sufficiency of the evidence against him.

She was in front of the victim's vehicle when the armed Defendant approached the driver's side of the car and Devante Billy got into the front passenger seat. She heard Defendant order Mr. May to give him his wallet. As Mr. May complied, Devante Billy removed the car's GPS system and got into the back seat behind Mr. May. Ms. Smith saw Defendant hand Devante Billy a gun and tell him to shoot Mr. May. She was only feet away from the car when Billy shot Mr. May in the back of the head. As Defendant and Billy fled, Defendant was carrying the GPS device and Billy was holding the gun. Ms. Smith admitted she met with the police on several occasions after the murder and initially lied to them about the shooting. However, she explained that she lied to the police because Billy threatened to have her and Ms. Cobb murdered if they spoke to the police. Ms. Cobb's testimony also demonstrated Defendant's participation in the armed robbery and murder of Mr. May. On the night in question, she and Ms. Smith attended a baseball game with the Defendant and Billy, then went to Defendant's house. After the shooting, the four attended a party together. Although she did not actually hear the exchanges between Mr. May, Defendant and Billy, Ms. Cobb verified that Billy was in the back seat of the victim's car when she heard the gunshots. When she looked in the direction of the shots, Ms. Cobb observed Billy and Defendant running from the scene. Billy was carrying a gun and Defendant held a GPS device in his hand. Both witnesses identified Defendant from six-person lineups. Furthermore, a search of the residence occupied by Defendant revealed clothing which fit the description Ms. Cobb and Ms. Smith said Defendant wore on the night of the shooting, a non-operational GPS device, consistent with the type stolen from Mr. May's vehicle and one bullet which matched the ammunition used to shoot him. During an interview with Defendant and his parents, Defendant even placed himself at the scene, admitting he was present when the victim was shot, though claiming he was making a drug sale to the victim when \"Don Tavis\" walked up and shot the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Regarding the evidence supporting the armed robbery and attempted second degree murder of Sanford Kaynor, the State adduced the following: Officer Walter Edmond found Mr. Kaynor lying wounded in the driveway of his house on the night of October 2, 2012. Officer Edmond\n   was the first person on the scene, shortly after hearing the gunshots. Mr. Kaynor told Officer Edmond that he had been shot by two black males, who also stole his vehicle. Mrs. Kaynor testified that her husband told her three teenage males, one wearing a mask and two holding guns, were waiting for him in the driveway and shot him. When Mr. Kaynor's stolen vehicle was retrieved, the driver's side interior door handle contained Defendant's fingerprints. Testing of the black and white bandana retrieved in the Kaynor's driveway contained Defendant's DNA. The stolen truck used in the Kaynor armed robbery and shooting contained Defendant's fingerprints and was retrieved from the 7800 block of Burke Avenue, in close proximity to the residence where Defendant was staying at the time of the crimes. When the police searched Defendant's bedroom at 8841 Gervais Street, they located property belonging to the Kaynors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Lastly, regarding the evidence supporting the armed robbery of Ms. Cowan, the State adduced the following: Ms. Cowan testified that as she exited the front passenger seat of her sister's car, she noticed two black males running toward her. One demanded her belongings and assured her his companion was armed should she resist. The same individual pulled her purse from her shoulder, took her wallet and fled with his accomplice. Ms. Cowan described her assailant as a slightly built, teen-aged, light skinned black male, approximately five feet, nine inches tall with his hair in twists. In the days following the incident, Ms. Cowan viewed three six-person photographic lineups, but did not identify anyone from those lineups. In March 2012, Ms. Cowan met with Detective Krzemieniecki, who showed her a fourth photographic lineup. From that lineup, Ms. Cowan identified Defendant as the unarmed robber, who pulled her purse from her on the night of the incident. When police searched Defendant's bedroom at 8841 Gervais Street, they found Ms. Cowan's identification and credit cards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Considering the record as a whole as to each of the convictions, which includes eyewitness testimony and circumstantial evidence, and adopting a view of all of the evidence most favorable to the State, we find that the evidence was indeed sufficient for a rational trier of fact to find the Defendant guilty. While Defendant would characterize key eyewitness testimony against him as \"incredible,\" it is not the function of this Court to substitute its judgment of credibility for that of the jury. Accordingly, we find that this assignment of error lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Assignment of Error No. One\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Defendant claims he was denied a fair trial by the State's introduction of prejudicial hearsay evidence, specifically, the guilty pleas of his non-testifying co-defendant, Byron Johnson. Defendant argues the evidence was irrelevant to the question of his guilt. Defendant cites two instances which occurred during the State's opening statement, to which there was no objection lodged. In the first reference, the State stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   I'm going to point out right now Byron Johnson came in this court room a couple of months ago, looked that family in the eye, the family of Ms. Kaynor, and pled guilty as charged to every single count in this indictment. You will not hear me say a nice thing about Byron, but at least he had the decency to do that. He took a 45 year sentence for the crime spree on October 2, 2012. He pled guilty as charged to everything.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In the second reference, the State stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Now, as I told you ladies and gentlemen Byron Johnson stood in this courtroom with Ms. Kaynor present and pled\n   guilty to being a part of all this. He took 45 years in jail.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Defendant also points to two references made during the State's direct examinations of Detective Norman and Ms. Becnel, wherein they were asked whether Mr. Johnson pled guilty. The defense objected, and the district court sustained the objections.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Louisiana Code of Evidence art. 801(C) defines hearsay as \"a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the present trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\" As Byron Johnson did not testify at trial, evidence of his guilty pleas could indeed be deemed inadmissible hearsay, absent an applicable exception or exclusion. Thus, we must consider its effect on the jury in the context of the trial as a whole to determine whether the error was harmless or not. In other words, the verdict may stand if this Court finds that the guilty verdict rendered is unattributable to the error.\n   <em>\n    Sullivan v. Louisiana\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12227\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/275/#p279\">\n    508 U.S. 275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 279,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12227\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/275/#p279\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2078\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2081-82,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12227\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/275/#p279\">\n    124 L.Ed.2d 182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Apart from the State's allusion to Byron Johnson's pleas, the State presented substantial direct and circumstantial evidence of Defendant's guilt. Ms. Smith testified she witnessed Defendant's involvement in the shooting and robbing of Mr. May at gunpoint. Ms. Cobb said she saw Defendant fleeing the shooting scene carrying the GPS system removed from Mr. May's vehicle. Police obtained clothing from Defendant's bedroom that fit the descriptions given by the witnesses. Defendant's DNA was found on the black and white bandana retrieved from the Kaynor's residence and his fingerprints were lifted from Mr. Kaynor's vehicle. Mrs. Kaynor's purse, wallet and keys were discovered during the search of Defendant's residence. Furthermore, Ms. Cowan identified the Defendant from a photographic lineup as one of the men who robbed her at gunpoint. Defendant's jailhouse telephone calls revealed he admitted to a male friend and his girlfriend that he was willing to plea bargain with the State and take twenty years \"for all of the [indicted] charges.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In light of the foregoing, this Court concludes that while the admission of Byron Johnson's guilty pleas was improper, the jury's verdict was unattributable to the error. The disclosure of the pleas was corroborative of other, substantial evidence of the Defendant's guilt presented by the State. Accordingly, we find the error was harmless; thus, this assignment of error lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Assignment of Error No. 2\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Defendant next argues the trial court erred by denying his motion for mistrial based upon the State's alleged impermissible reference to Defendant's post-arrest silence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The United States Supreme Court, in\n   <em>\n    Doyle v.

Defense counsel complained that the prosecution's query about \"anyone\" supplying an alibi for Defendant would necessarily include Defendant himself, thereby rendering the reference an improper comment on his right to remain silent. The State claimed there was no intent to implicate Defendant, or an explicit mention of his post-arrest silence, and that the State's questioning referred only to Defendant's parents. Moreover, the State maintained that defense counsel's questioning of Detective Krzemieniecki on cross-examination, regarding whether she ever spoke to the Defendant's parents, \"opened the door\" for the questions on re-direct. The court denied the motion for mistrial based on questions from the defense regarding whether the detective had ever spoken to Defendant's parents, while acknowledging that it was a \"close\" call.

Accordingly, the Court deleted that portion of the defendant's sentence denying him parole eligibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Here, we have a Defendant who has committed a number of offenses, like the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   , but who was also sentenced to \"effective life sentences,\" which, standing alone, violate\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   for their failure to provide for parole eligibility. Specifically, as to counts four, nine, and sixteen, Defendant received sentences of 104 years each, without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence, despite being non-homicide offenses. While\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   stands for the proposition that Defendant's consecutive sentences may amount to an effective life sentence without violating\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   , it does not absolve the district court of imposing otherwise legal sentences on those counts for which\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   mandates that he be eligible for parole. We do note that the dissent suggests \"the facts of this case require a sentence in line with the reasoning of [\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ], wherein the Court concluded that\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   does not prohibit consecutive term of year sentences for\n   <strong>\n    multiple offenses\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    committed.\n   </strong>\n   \" (emphasis in original) It is not lost on this Court just how horrific the underlying facts of this case are. However, this Court is bound to follow the precedent of the Louisiana Supreme Court. In\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   , the Court reasoned that consecutive sentences amounting to an \"effective life sentence\" do not violate\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   , and this opinion does not hold that Defendant's consecutive sentences were improper. However,\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   clearly held that a juvenile may not be sentenced, on a single count, to an \"effective life sentence\" for a non-homicide offense. Here, that is what the district court did in sentencing Defendant to 104-year terms on his armed robbery convictions. That Defendant's conduct constitutes the \"worst of the worst\" does not permit this Court to gloss over this fact and ignore rulings of our Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   However, in all other respects, we find the sentence to not be cruel, unusual, or excessive punishment. Defendant victimized unsuspecting people steps from their homes, demanded their valuables, shot two of his victims, killing one and paralyzing the other. The judge's opinion that the Defendant was \"one of the worst\" is fully satisfied by the Defendant's vicious behavior. Furthermore, this Court and others have found like sentences for the same convictions to not be excessive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.
