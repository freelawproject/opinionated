Jackson appeals from a judgment entered by the Covington Circuit Court (\"the trial court\") awarding Jeannan C. Brewer (\"Brewer\") damages in the amount of $5,600, plus attorney's fees in the amount of $4,502.83, on Brewer's breach-of-contract claim. We affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 2, 2013, Brewer filed a complaint against Jackson, seeking damages for an alleged breach of a purchase agreement, which provided that John Brewer would purchase certain commercial property owned by Jackson. Brewer alleged that the property made the subject of the purchase agreement was a portion of a building owned by Jackson that was to be subdivided along an interior wall, with the property lying to the north of the interior wall to be sold to John Brewer and the property lying south of the interior wall to be retained by Jackson. Brewer alleged that she was the assignee of John Brewer and that she had paid a $5,000 deposit to secure the purchase agreement. Brewer asserted that Jackson had breached the purchase agreement by refusing to close on the sale of the property despite repeated requests from Brewer, and she requested damages and attorney's fees. Jackson apparently filed a counterclaim requesting that Brewer pay her attorney's fees based on the terms of the purchase agreement. Following a trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Brewer on May 26, 2016, and awarded her $5,600 in damages and reasonable attorney's fees \"as called for by the [purchase agreement],\" to be determined by the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 29, 2016, Jackson filed a motion essentially requesting that the trial court enter judgment as a matter of law in her favor; Jackson asserted that the purchase agreement was \"illegal and void due to its violation of the Andalusia City's Code subdivision regulations and \u00a7 11-52-30[,] Ala. Code 1975.\" Specifically, Jackson relied on the testimony of Micah Blair, the assistant director of Planning and Development for the City of Andalusia (\"the City\"), who had testified that Jackson's property could not be subdivided without approval of the City, that no one had applied to subdivide the property, and that the proper authorities had not approved the subdivision of the property. In support of her motion, on September 6, 2016, Jackson filed two additional motions seeking to supplement the record-one to admit the affidavit of Blair, in which he summarized his trial testimony, and a second to admit copies of certain ordinances of the City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On September 21, 2016, the trial court entered separate orders denying the motions to supplement the record and denying the motion for a judgment as a matter of law; it also entered a judgment in favor of Brewer, awarding her damages in the amount of $5,600 and attorney's fees in the amount of $4,502.83. On November 2, 2016, Jackson filed her notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On appeal, Jackson argues that the trial court erred in entering a judgment for Brewer despite the illegality of the purchase agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Before addressing the merits of the appeal, we first reject Brewer's contention that Jackson waived the illegality issue and that she was estopped to assert the illegality of the purchase agreement by relying on the agreement in her counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Because an illegal contract is void ab initio and will not support a cause of action or a judgment, a party can raise the illegality of a contract at any time.\n   <em>\n    Kilgore Dev., Inc. v.

Thus, we reject Brewer's contention that Jackson waived the illegality defense by failing to raise it until after the jury returned its verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Based on the same policy considerations, Alabama law holds that a party cannot be prevented from asserting the illegality of a contract based on the theory of estoppel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cooper v.

Brewer alleges that Jackson relied on the purchase agreement to support her counterclaim for attorney's fees. The record does not contain a copy of the counterclaim, so we cannot discern whether, in fact, Jackson was seeking to enforce an attorney-fee provision in the purchase agreement, although Jackson seems to acknowledge as much in her brief to this court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roberts v.

Nevertheless, we hold that, even if Jackson had relied on the purchase agreement as the foundation for her counterclaim, Jackson would not have been estopped to assert the illegality of the purchase agreement as a defense to the breach-of-contract claim filed by Brewer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Turning to the merits, Blair's testimony established that the building Jackson owned was located on one parcel of real property and that the building could not be subdivided without the approval of the City, which neither Jackson nor Brewer obtained. In her motion for a judgment as a matter of law, Jackson asserted that the purchase agreement was illegal and void under certain City ordinances that regulate the subdivision of property, which she sought to have admitted into the record by a motion to supplement. Jackson also relied on \u00a7 11-52-30, Ala. Code 1975. On appeal, Jackson relies on the same and additional City ordinances and on former \u00a7 11-52-33(a), Ala. Code 1975.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We cannot consider the argument based on the alleged violation of the City ordinances.

We take judicial notice of the fact that the population of the City of Andalusia is less than 300,000.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8335841\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/953/1264/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Without evidence of the contents of the City ordinances, we cannot conclude that they prohibited the purchase agreement at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We further reject Jackson's contention that this court must accept the testimony of Blair as conclusive on the meaning and application of the City ordinances. We note the general rule that a witness, whether a lay witness or an expert witness, should never be permitted to give his or her opinion on a question of law or upon the application of the law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Dial\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9585037\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/387/879/#p880\">\n    387 So.2d 879\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 880 (Ala. 1980). We need not decide, however, if Brewer waived the application of that general rule by failing to object to Blair's testimony. Jackson ordered only that part of the transcript of the trial proceedings containing Blair's testimony, leaving this court without access to the remainder of the testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Although Jackson asserts that no evidence was introduced to contradict Blair's testimony regarding the meaning, or application, of the City ordinances, in the absence of the remainder of the transcript, this court must presume that the missing portions support the verdict of the jury and the judgment of the trial court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

The amended version of \u00a7 11-52-33 does not prohibit parties from entering into an agreement to sell subdivided property before receiving official approval of the subdivision plat or map, but the amendment does not apply to this case because the parties' purchase agreement was made before April 7, 2014.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    We do not consider the propriety of that ruling because Jackson does not argue on appeal that the trial court erred in denying the motion. \"When an appellant fails to argue an issue in its brief, that issue is waived.\"\n    <em>\n     Boshell v.

Civ. App. 2005) (\"[T]his court is confined in its review to addressing the arguments raised by the parties in their briefs on appeal; arguments not raised by the parties are waived.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Out of an abundance of caution, we have also reviewed \u00a7 11-52-30(g), Ala. Code 1975, although Jackson does not rely on that statute on appeal. Section 11-52-30(g) prohibits the sale of property in a proposed subdivision outside the municipal limits of a city when the property sold is \"referenced to the map or plat, until and unless it has been first submitted to and approved by the municipal planning commission.\" Because \u00a7 11-52-30(g) uses wording similar to that in former \u00a7 11-52-33(a), it also requires proof that a sale has been transacted by reference to an unapproved plat or map, so Jackson also failed to prove a violation of \u00a7 11-52-30(g).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
