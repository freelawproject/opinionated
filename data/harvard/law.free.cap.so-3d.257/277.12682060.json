To encourage noncareer military service, the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) entitles uniformed service members to prompt civil reemployment upon completing service. When Tammy Webster completed her National Guard training, she requested the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks (MDWFP) renew her contract as a part-time dispatcher. When MDWFP refused to rehire her, Webster filed a USERRA claim in state court, successfully proving MDWFP violated her federal statutory right to reemployment. Though the prevailing party, Webster appeals, challenging both her compensation award of $7,589-one year's worth of lost part-time wages-and her attorney-fee award of $2,800.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. We hold that the trial court did not err in limiting Webster's compensation to one year of lost wages. Webster had been employed under yearly contracts that were not automatically renewable. While USERRA required MDWFP to reemploy her, it was under no statutory obligation to employ her\n   <em>\n    indefinitely\n   </em>\n   . So the compensation award is reasonably linked to what Webster lost due to MDWFP's failure to comply with USERRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3. That said, we reverse and remand the remainder of the judgment. First, the trial court failed to rule on Webster's liquidated-damages claim, even though Webster presented evidence MDWFP's USERRA violation was \"willful,\" as that term is used in the statute. Second, the trial court arbitrarily assigned $2,800 as a reasonable attorney fee, without considering the time spent by or hourly rate of Webster's counsel or any other relevant factor. Third, the trial court taxed Webster her respective court costs, even though USERRA prohibits claimants from being taxed with costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4. Therefore, we affirm in part and reverse and remand in part the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Background Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Webster's USERRA Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5. In 2011, Webster was working as a part-time dispatcher for MDWFP when she decided to enlist in the Mississippi Air National Guard. She was ordered to attend training for six months. Before she left, Webster informed MDWFP of her upcoming service. During training, she kept in contact with MDWFP, letting her supervisor know her orders had been extended two months. And when training finally ended eight months later in January 2012, she asked to be placed back on the dispatch schedule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6. But MDWFP did not renew her contract for 2012, citing scheduling conflicts with Webster's full-time, police-department job and a reduced need for part-time dispatchers. MDWFP refused to rehire Webster even when she informed her\n   supervisor, who had served in the National Guard thirty years, that MDWFP was violating USERRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7. USERRA is federal legislation enacted to encourage noncareer uniform service by eliminating the disadvantages such service has on civilian careers and employment.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204301\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) (2012).

Unlike a \u00a7 4311 discrimination claim, to prove her failure-to-reemploy claim, Webster did not have to show her service was a motivating factor in MDWFP's decision not to renew her contract.\n   <em>\n    Petty v.

All Webster had to prove-and did prove-is that (1) she gave advance notice of her service to her employer; (2) her cumulative length of absences did not exceed five years; and (3) she timely submitted an application for reemployment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sumrall v.

The burden then shifted to MDWFP to prove one of the two available\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   statutory affirmative defenses-(1) MDWFP's \"circumstances ha[d] so changed as to make such reemployment impossible or unreasonable\"; or (2) Webster had \"no reasonable expectation\" to continued employment because the position she left was for \"a brief, nonrecurrent period.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204312\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(A), (d)(1)(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9. MDWFP had argued both that the need for part-time dispatchers had decreased and that Webster had no reasonable expectation in reemployment since she knew part-time dispatcher's contracts were not automatically renewable. The trial court rejected MDWFP's first argument, finding MDWFP had \"offered little credible proof that the need for part-time dispatchers decreased.\" The trial court also found Webster's expectations of reemployment to be reasonable. Webster's annual contract had been renewed four times prior to her service. And during her service, MDWFP gave no indication her contract would not be renewed upon completing service. While at trial MDWFP pointed to Webster's deficient work habits and scheduling conflicts with her full-time job, the trial court found these excuses not to\n   rehire Webster to be \"superficial since no efforts to resolve the alleged issues were raised and/or resolved with Webster\n   <strong>\n    prior\n   </strong>\n   to her deployment.\" (Emphasis in original.) Having rejected MDWFP's defenses, the trial court held MDWFP strictly liable for its failure promptly reemploy Webster when her service ended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Trial Court's Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10. As relief, USERRA provides that a court may (A) order the employer to comply with the act, (B) award compensatory damages, and (C) if the court find the USERRA violation was \"willful,\" further award an amount equal to the compensatory damages as liquidated damages.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204323\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1) (2012). The court also has the discretionary authority to award a prevailing employee reasonable attorney fees and litigation expenses.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204323\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(2) (2012). Webster requested all these forms of relief-reinstatement, compensatory damages, liquidated damages, and attorney fees and expenses. Specifically, Webster claimed she was entitled to four-and-a-half years of back pay from the time her contract was not renewed in early 2012 to the time of the bench trial in mid-2016, which Webster calculated to be almost $44,000. Webster based her calculation on the $9,716.29 in part-time wages she earned in 2009-her highest earning year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 11. The trial court did not order Webster be reinstated, nor did the court award Webster four and a half years' worth of back pay. Instead, the trial court found Webster had been \"entitled to reemployment for the 2012 contractual year\" only. Specifically, the court found it had no authority to require MDWFP to reemploy Webster beyond the yearly contract term, because MDWFP could have decided not to renew Webster's contract after 2012 without violating USERRA. Using the amount of part-time wages Webster earned in 2010-her last full year of work before enlisting-the trial court awarded Webster $7,549 \"as liquidated damages.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12. The court also exercised its discretion to award reasonable attorney fees and expenses, \"opin[ing] that attorney fees in the amount of $2,800 is sufficient for all litigation costs and trial expenses.\" Finally, the judge taxed all court costs and fees \"to the respective parties.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Issues on Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 13. Though the successful party, Webster has appealed to this Court, challenging the trial court's monetary award. MDWFP has not cross-appealed. So the trial court's ruling that MDWFP violated USERRA by not renewing Webster's contract for 2012 is outside the scope of this Court's review. And this appeal is limited to reviewing the trial court's remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 14. As to that remedy, Webster claims:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (1) The trial court erred in awarding one year of back pay only instead of \"the normal recovery period under USERAA\" from non-reemployment to judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (2) The trial court erred in not awarding liquidated, or double, damages in light of the proof of MDWFP's willful violation of USERAA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (3) The trial court erred in\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   awarding an arbitrary amount of attorney fees and expenses without reviewing a statement of the attorney's hours and hourly rate and a bill of actual costs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (4) The trial court erred in not calculating legal fees based on the lodestar method.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 15. Because the court's judgment followed a bench trial, this Court applies the same deferential standard of review that it would for a chancellor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    City of Jackson v. Perry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11237272\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/764/373/#p376\">\n    764 So.2d 373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 376 (Miss. 2000).

But her legal rulings are reviewed de novo.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11237272\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/764/373/#p376\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Compensatory Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 16. To begin, while the trial court labeled the $7,549 award \"liquidated damages,\" it is clear from the context of the order that this award was not \"liquidated damages\" as envisioned by USERRA. The phrase \"liquidated damages\" refers to an award of double the compensatory damages for a\n   <em>\n    willful\n   </em>\n   violation of USERRA.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204323\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(C). The $7,589 was not double the compensatory damages. It\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   the compensatory damages. Despite the confusing label, the trial court clearly intended to compensate Webster $7,589 for wages she would have earned had MDWFP complied with USERRA and renewed her yearly contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204323\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 17. Webster argues the trial judge erred by limiting her \"back pay\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   to one year. Webster concedes the trial court was within its discretion to use her most recent year of wages, versus her highest year of wages, to calculate what she would have earned that year. But she strongly contests the trial judge's limiting her compensation to one year. Citing numerous Title VII cases,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Webster claims the recovery period in employment cases is the time between the discriminatory act and the date of the judgment, which in this case was five and a half years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 18. Because relatively few cases address USERRA damages, federal courts often look to other federal employment discrimination cases for guidance.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Hance v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3669168\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/571/511/#p519\">\n    571 F.3d 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 519-20 (6th Cir. 2009) (applying Title VII's burden of proof for proving damages). That said, this is not an employment-discrimination case. Webster did not bring a discrimination claim under \u00a7 4311. Instead, she brought a strict liability failure-to-reemploy claim under \u00a7\u00a7 4312 and 4313.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 19. This distinction is important for two reasons. One, back pay is intended to advance the statutory purpose \"of eradicating discrimination ... and making persons whole for injuries suffered through past discrimination.\"\n   <em>\n    Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9485\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/405/#p421\">\n    422 U.S. 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 421,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9485\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/405/#p421\">\n    95 S.Ct. 2362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9485\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/405/#p421\">\n    45 L.Ed.2d 280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1975). So without a discrimination claim, the reason to award back pay is not present. Second, USERRA's language specifically links available compensation to the \"loss of wages or benefits suffered by reason of such employer's failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204323\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(B). Thus,\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   MDWFP failed to comply with USERRA matters when determining if the trial court was within its discretion when awarding compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 20. MDWFP failed to comply with USERRA by not promptly reemploying Webster upon the completion of her service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Stated differently,\n   <em>\n    had\n   </em>\n   MDWFP complied with \u00a7\u00a7 4312 and 4313, it would have promptly renewed Webster's contract for 2012. As the trial court rightly recognized, that was all USERRA required. MDWFP had no obligation to employ Webster\n   <em>\n    indefinitely\n   </em>\n   based on her service. Instead, what USERRA does guarantee is reemployment for one year, absent cause for termination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Serricchio v. Wachovia Sec., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869499\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/556/99/#p108\">\n    556 F.Supp.2d 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 108 (D.

So the trial court was right. MDWFP \"might well have ended her contract after 2012\" without running afoul of USERRA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 21. Thus, the $7,589 award was not an abuse of discretion, because it reasonably reflects the \"loss of wages ... [Webster] suffered by reason of [MDWFP's] failure to comply with [ \u00a7\u00a7 4312 and 4313 ].\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204323\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 22. We note our conclusion would be the same, even if we were to apply, as Webster urges, the presumption that \"prevailing plaintiffs in employment discrimination cases are '... entitled to back pay until the date of judgment has been entered in the case.' \"\n   <em>\n    Hance\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3669168\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/571/511/#p519\">\n    571 F.3d at 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    EEOC v.

This is so because MDWFP's only obligation under USERRA was to renew her 2012 contract. Moreover, \"[i]n the Title VII context, ... the plaintiff bears the burden of proving damages and is 'entitled to the amount claimed unless the defendant can prove otherwise.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 519-20 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Wilson Metal Casket Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10510651\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/24/836/#p840\">\n    24 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   840 ). Though Webster claimed she was entitled to $9,716 in damages each year for every year between the time she was denied reemployment until the time of judgment, the trial judge essentially found her employer MDWFP had proven otherwise. Because Webster's annual contract was not automatically renewable, the trial judge determined Webster was entitled to a year's worth of lost part-time wages. This determination is entitled to deference, since it is supported by substantial evidence and does not contradict federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 23. Thus, we affirm the trial court's $7,589 compensatory-damages award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Liquidated Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 24. Again, despite the trial court's label, the $7,549 award was not \"liquidated damages.\" As used in USERRA, the term \"liquidated damages\" refers to the trial court's requirement that an employer pay \"an amount equal to the amount ... [awarded under \u00a7 4323(d)(1)(B) ] as liquidated damages, if the court determines that the employer's failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter was willful.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204323\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 25. The trial court did not award double damages. Nor did it expressly determine if MDWFP's failure to comply with USERRA was willful. Webster claims this was error. We agree.

Instead, we remand this issue to the trial court to determine, based on the evidence already presented at the bench trial, whether MDWFP's USERRA violation was \"willful,\" as that term is defined for USERRA purposes, and, if so, whether MDWFP should have to pay Webster an additional $7,589 as liquidated damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Here, the trial court's \"opinion that attorney fees in the amount of $2,800 is sufficient for all litigation costs and trial expenses\" may very well be reasonable. But the trial judge's order is void of any explanation for that figure. According to Webster's counsel, he was never asked to submit to the court the \"lodestar\" calculation figures-the number of hours worked on Webster's case and his hourly rate. Nor does it appear that the trial judge considered any of the factors in Rule 1.5 of the Mississippi Rules of Professional Conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 33. We reverse the $2,800 award and remand the attorney-fees-and-expenses issue to the trial court to reconsider what amount would be reasonable in light of the number of hours worked, Webster's counsel's hourly rate, and the eight factors listed in Rule 1.5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Court Costs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 34. Finally, the order taxed \"[a]ll court cost and fees ... to the respective parties.\" But USERRA prohibits taxing Webster with court costs. Under \u00a7 4323, \"No fees or court costs may be charged or taxed against any person claiming rights under this chapter.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204323\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(1). Taxing Webster with her respective costs not only runs afoul of the clear prohibition in \u00a7 4323(h)(1), but it also cuts against the pro-employee policy embodied in this provision, which encourages claimants to bring USERRA actions without fear of being taxed costs. So we reverse the portion of the order taxing Webster with her respective costs and remand this issue to the trial court to assess costs in a manner compliant with \u00a7 4323(h)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 35. The trial court was within its discretion to award $7,589, or the amount of part-time wages Webster lost when MDWFP failed to comply with USERRA and renew her contract for 2012. But the trial court abused its discretion when it failed to rule on Webster's liquidated-damages claim, arbitrarily awarded $2,800 in attorney fees without considering the lodestar method, and taxed Webster with costs. We thus affirm the $7,589 compensatory award, but we reverse and remand the issues of liquidated damages, attorney fees and expenses, and court costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 36.\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED AND REMANDED IN PART.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   WALLER, C.J., RANDOLPH AND KITCHENS, P.JJ., KING, COLEMAN, BEAM, CHAMBERLIN AND ISHEE, JJ., CONCUR.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    MDWFP conceded Webster's active-duty training in the Mississippi Air National Guard qualified her for USERRA's protections and benefits.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204303\">\n     38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4303\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (13) (2012) (defining \"service in uniformed services\") and\n    <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204303\">\n     38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4303\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (16) (2012) (defining \"uniformed services\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Section 4312 actually provides three affirmative defenses.
