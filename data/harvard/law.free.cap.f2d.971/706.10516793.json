Mylor contends that the district court\u2019s findings that (1) the offense involved two kilograms of cocaine and (2) Mylor played a managerial role in the offense are clearly erroneous. He also contends that the court abused its discretion when it refused to permit his attorney to argue his objections to the presentence investigation report (PSI) at the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-13\">We find no error in the district court\u2019s finding that the offense involved two kilograms of cocaine. On five occasions during Mylor\u2019s Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 hearing, when he pled guilty to count one, Mylor indicated that the drug transaction contemplated by the charged conspiracy involved two kilograms of cocaine. <em>See </em>Record, vol. 2, at 119 (\u201cSomebody brought me over two kilos_ I assume two kilos-\u201d), 120 (\u201cI gave him one kilo and I kept the one at the unit_ He was supposed to get the money ... and I give him the other kilo.\u201d), 132 (Question: \u201cyou got ... the two kilograms in your room, right?\u201d Answer: \u201cYes.\u201d), 133-34 (\u201cI said \u2018I got a guy that needs a couple of keys of cocaine.\u2019 \u201d), 134 (\u201cthe best I could do was two\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-18\">We do, however, find that the district court abused its discretion in precluding defense counsel from speaking, at the sentencing hearing, to the probation officer\u2019s determination (in the PSI) that Mylor should be given a two-level enhancement for his role as a manager in the offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). At the beginning of the hearing, the court indicated that it had \u201creviewed\u201d counsel\u2019s objections, and that it was \u201cgoing to overrule all the objections,\u201d save one <em>id., </em>not pertinent here. Record, vol. 3, at 3. Then, after engaging in an extended colloquy with the lawyers over the amount of cocaine involved in the offense, the court indicated again that it would hear no argument from the defense: \u201cMr. Bugay [Mylor\u2019s attorney] filed very detailed objections, so I don\u2019t need to hear any further argument on it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13-14. \u201cI don\u2019t need any further argument, and won\u2019t tolerate any either, Mr. Bugay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-19\"><em>United States v. Jones, </em>899 F.2d 1097, 1103 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 111 S.Ct. 275, 112 L.Ed.2d 230 (1990), requires the sentencing judge to elicit the parties\u2019 objections following the pronouncement of sentence. The district court ignored <em>Jones\u2019 </em>command, according neither side the right to object. Nonetheless, defense counsel tried to bring his concerns about Mylor\u2019s role in the offense to the court\u2019s attention, but to no avail.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-22\">Mr. Bugay: Okay. The only thing that concerns me, Judge, in regard, just as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>matter of housekeeping with the Court of Appeals, <em>on the adjustment for role in the offense, </em>you have overruled me, <em>so I didn\u2019t argue </em>\u2014 .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-4\">The Court: I have ruled on that. My role is done.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">We hold that the district court\u2019s role is not done. Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(a)(1) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAqV\">At the sentencing hearing, the court <em>shall </em>afford the counsel for the defendant ... an opportunity to comment upon the probation officer\u2019s determination [of the sentencing classifications and sentencing guideline range believed to be applicable to the case \u2014 here, the guideline range as affected by the Section 3Bl.l(c) adjustment to the base offense level] and on other matters relating to the appropriate sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-7\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The court did not accord defense counsel such right in this case \u2014 especially with respect to the section 3Bl.l(c) adjustment. Accordingly, we remand the case for a new sentencing hearing. The court shall conduct the hearing in conformance with Rule 32(a)(l)\u2019s requirements and, after pronouncing sentence, comply with <em>Jones\u2019 </em>mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
