Defendant\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that his six-month jail sentence was harsh and excessive. We disagree. Moreover, inasmuch as defendant has since completed this jail term, the argument is moot (see, <em>People v Karpinski, </em>233 AD2d 618; <em>People v Christensen, </em>199 AD2d 649).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-3\">Mercure, J.
