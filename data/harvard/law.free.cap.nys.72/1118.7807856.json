The plaintiff testified that at an interview with the defendant, the defendant said to him: \u201cMe stole your horse. How much do you want, Mr. Malfit?\u201d This was an admission by the defendant sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to recover, unless overcome by evidence on the defendant\u2019s behalf. Furthermore, error was committed in excluding the answers to the following questions addressed to the plaintiff: \u201cQ. Did you find out afterwards who took that horse? Q. Did you know what was the value of that horse on July 1, 1898? Q. Was there any money paid on that evening, August 15th, by Mr. Oppenheimer, by order of the defendant? Q. Were you down to the police court at the time he was arrested?\u201d The other errors assigned need not be discussed, as they may be cured on a new trial. Judgment appealed from reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-11\">CONLAN, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
