The papers excluded did not tend to prove agency, and none was established. Most of plaintiff\u2019s objections and exceptions are entirely without grounds assigned therefor, and cannot be considered by us upon appeal, while the others cannot avail as against the inherent weakness of appellant\u2019s ease. Judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-7\">CONLAN and O\u2019DWYBR, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
