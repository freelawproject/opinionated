Nevertheless, the attorneys for the respondent had the case placed on the calendar at the foot, and when it was reached entered judgment for affirmance upon default, taxing a full bill of costs, amounting to $62.25. 71 N. Y. Supp. 1141. The contention upon this motion is that this action of the respondent was improper, inasmuch as the order of May 27, 1901, practically operated as a dismissal of the .appeal, without any further action of this court, in the event of the appellant\u2019s failure to comply with the conditions specified therein; that is to say, the service of the case and the placing of the appeal upon the calendar.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-17\">We think this view is correct. The appellant was entitled to abandon the appeal if she saw fit, and suffer the costs of the dismissal, which this court had ordered; but there is no good reason why she should be mulcted further in costs by the entry of an unnecessary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-18\">The motion to vacate the judgment should be granted, without costs, and, to remove all possible doubt as to the statu.s of the case, the order should provide that the appeal be, and the Same is hereby, finally dismissed, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
