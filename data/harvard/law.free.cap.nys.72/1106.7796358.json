The ground of the arrest is fraud, and is sufficiently stated in the order. The complaint sufficiently\" states the sale and jjelivery of the goods. The order appealed from must be affirmed, but, in view of the fact that the respondents did not appear in the -hearing or file a brief, without costs. Order affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
