J.</author>\n<p id=\"As2\">The respondent Gross at a sale in partition became purchaser of the premises, making a deposit of $250 with the referee. He made a motion at special term to be relieved from his purchase, and that the referee pay him certain expenses. Among the objections assigned by him for his refusal to complete the purchase was the fact that George M. Schnizel was appointed guardian ad litem of certain infant defendants, being at the time of said appointment connected with the office of the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys. Rule 49 forbids the appointment of guardian ad litem of one \u201cwho is connected in business with the counsel or attorney of the adverse party.\u201d The record shows that Mr. Schnizel was a clerk in the office of the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys (though intending to 'dissolve his connection with them) at the date of his appointment as guardian of the infant defendants in this action. . For this reason the objection to the title' was well taken, and it was proper that the purchaser should be relieved from his purchase and repaid the amount of his bid, with interest, together with his expenses of examining title.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-13\">This order should be affirmed upon the doctrine of Hecker v. Sexton, 43 Hun, 593, 596. Although that was a mortgage foreclosure suit, the rule there announced seems to be equally applicable in partition. In so deciding, we shall not run any risk of disturbing titles based on partition sales where the same rule may have been violated, and no suggestion of that fact was made until after the title was passed. \u201cI am of the opinion,\u201d says Macomber, J., in the case cited, \u201cthat any person actually interested in a pecuniary way_ in having a clear and unassailable judgment record as the foundation of his title to real estate has the right to object, if done seasonably, as has been done by this purchaser, to a judicial proceeding prohibon a mere irregularity may well be, and, indeed, often ought to be, ited by the general rules of practice.\u201d An objection which is based sustained, when made in the very proceeding itself before the passing of title, where the same objection might not be deemed fatal to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>the title in the hands of a purchaser taking without knowledge of such irregularity. The order, however, contains an additional clause directing the payment to the purchaser of interest on $2,000 which he borrowed to enable him to complete his purchase. This clause of the order was without warrant. The order should be modified by striking out the clause in question, and, as modified, affirmed, without costs of this appeal to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Order modified, without costs, in accordance with the opinion of GOODRICH, P. J. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
