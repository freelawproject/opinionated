Lateer within 24 hours after proof of his death. The basis for the order of interpleader is a claim to the ownership of the policy, made by one Lewis W. Robinson, who is the son-in-law of the plaintiff. Mr. Robinson in his affidavit alleges that the plaintiff left lier husband in September, 1900, and about that time gave to him the policy in suit, and the receipt book accompanying the same, saying that she could keep it up no longer, and that if he would keep up the payments he could have the policy, and all benefits to be derived thereunder. This transaction, assuming that it took place precisely, as alleged in the affidavit, conveyed no title to the instru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>ment. The policy did not belong to Irene Lateer as the wife of the insured, nor had she any right to give it away. The instrument, as appears by the complaint, was issued and delivered to the insured husband himself, and by its terms was payable to his executors or administrators; and the wife\u2019s right to sue upon it now grows solely out of the fact that she has been appointed administratrix. Under these circumstances, the claim of the party who has been substituted utterly lacks that reasonable foundation which is necessary to warrant an order of interpleader. Stevenson v. Insurance Co., 10 App. Div. 233, 41 N. Y. Supp. 964.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">The order should be reversed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
