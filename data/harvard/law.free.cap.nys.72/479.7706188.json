These votes were canvassed by the board of canvassers, and the result declared. The application made was for a writ of mandamus to compel the said board of canvassers to reconvene, to recanvass the votes cast upon said propositions, and declare said votes illegal and void, and to file a certificate with the county treasurer of said county to the effect that no election was had in said town on said propositions, for the reason that the town clerk of said town did not print or publish, or cause to be printed or published, in a newspaper, the notice, or any notice, required to be published by him, in accordance with section 16 of the liquor tax law. The special term ordered the issuance of the writ, and from said order and judgment entered thereupon this appeal is taken.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b499-14\">.

Y. Supp. 613. With the reasoning o\u00ed the learned justices in that decision we entirely agree. The order and judgments appealed from should therefore be reversed, with costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Judgment and order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and application denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
