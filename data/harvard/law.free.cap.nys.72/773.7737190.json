Phelps is in possession of the property unlawfully and withholds the same from the plaintiff;z that the defendant Phelps claims the ownership under a deed of the premises given him by the county treasurer of Livingston county bearing date October 20, 1892, recorded in the clerk\u2019s office of that county October 24, 1892. The title of the plaintiff is alleged in the complaint to have been acquired by the purchase upon the foreclosure of a mortgage of the premises executed and delivered by Fred M. Inglehart to Annie E. Volger, bearing date May 22, 1893, recorded June 10, 1893; that Inglehart acquired his title by a conveyance made pursuant to a judgment of foreclosure \u00e1nd sale, from the sheriff of the county of Livingston, bearing date May 22, 1893, and recorded in Livingston county clerk\u2019s office June 9, 1893; that the mortgage from Inglehart to Volger was assigned by the latter on the 27th day of November, 1894, to the plaintiff, and subsequently foreclosed, and judgment of foreclosure and sale entered in said clerk\u2019s office March 18, 1897, and the premises sold therein upon the 8th day of May, 1887, and conveyed to the plaintiff, who has ever since claimed to be the dwner in fee and entitled to the possession of the premises. The facts are as alleged in the complaint, and the case further shows that the defendant Phelps, by his tenant, the defendant Wilcox, was in possession of the premises at the time the premises were conveyed to Inglehart, holding adversely under his deed from the treasurer of Livingston county, and had been in possession of the premises, claiming title thereto under said deed, from the time it was given to him, in 1892. These facts bring the case directly within the inhibition of the statute which provides that every grant of lands shall be absolutely void if at the time of the delivery thereof such lands shall be in the actual possession of a person claiming under a title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>adverse to that ot the grantor. 1 Rev. St. p. 739, \u00a7 147; Real Prop. Law (Laws 1896, c. 547) \u00a7 225. However defective the title under which the premises are held adversely may be, the statute is applicable. Sands v. Hughes, 53 N. Y. 287; Pearce v. Moore, 114 N. Y. 256, 21 N. E. 419. The opinion of Rapallo, J., in Sands v. Hughes, covers the case here precisely.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b794-5\">The point is made that \u201cdefendant is not in possession under claim of specific title,\u201d because the description of the premises in the deed to defendant Phelps \u201cdoes not fit the premises described in the complaint.\u201d It is sufficient to say in reply to this suggestion that the complaint alleges that the defendant Phelps \u201cis now in possession of said property [premises described in the complaint], and unlawfully withholds the same from this plaintiff\u201d; that said Phelps claims to be the owner of the same under and in pursuance of a deed given him of said premises by the county treasurer of Livingston county, which said deed bears date October 20, 1892, and is recorded in the county clerk\u2019s office of Livingston county in Liber 125 of Deeds, at page 546, and was so recorded on the 24th day of October, 1893. The defendant\u2019s deed, however, sufficiently describes the premises of which he is alleged in the complaint to be in possession. The premises are described in the deed a\u00a15 a \u201chouse and two acres of land on the north side of Seward street, in the village of Nunda, bounded east and' north by lands of J. Osgoodby estate, and west by land of Willard Wood.\u201d The premises are in fact a house and two acres of land bounded on the south by Seward street, on the east by lands of J. Osgoodby estate, and west by lands of Willard Wood. This would seem to be a sufficient description of the premises, even if the lane on the north did not belong to the J. Osgoodby estate, which does not clearly appear; there being no question as to the identity of the premises occupied by the defendant with those alleged in the complaint.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b794-6\">Without considering the case further, I am of the opinion that the complaint must be dismissed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b794-7\">Argued before ADAMS, P.
