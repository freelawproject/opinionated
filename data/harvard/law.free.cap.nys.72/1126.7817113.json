There was no sufficient proof of ownership in Horan at the time of Ryder\u2019s alleged acquisition of the property, or prior thereto; no sufficient proof of demand; no adequate or proper proof of value; no evidence of the requisites needful to maintain the alleged detention or conversion, to go to the jury. But what of competent evidence there was on both sides points to and confirms substantiation of the allegations of the defendant. Plaintiff did not successfully sustain the burden of proof, and we think it was error of the learned court below to refuse defendant\u2019s motion for nonsuit. Plaintiff\u2019s remedy would seem to he against Horan alone. Judgment should be reversed, and the complaint dismissed, with costs of appeal and of action to the appellant. Judgment reversed, and complaint dismissed, with costs to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-16\">OONLAN and O\u2019DWYER, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
