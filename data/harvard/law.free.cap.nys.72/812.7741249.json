Crane was attorney of record for the plaintiff in an action in the supreme court brought to recover damages for seduction under a promise of marriage. The defendant Leroy B. Crane is also an attorney, and was a brother to Royal S. Crane. The plaintiff claims that Leroy B. and Royal S. were partners, and as such equally interested in said\" action, and that they employed him as counsel to manage, conduct, and try the same. This action was originally brought against them for the services-rendered by plaintiff in the seduction action. Royal S. Crane died after the commencement of the action, and by order of the court it was continued against appellant as surviving partner. The trial court construed the complaint, in the light of plaintiff\u2019s testimony, as an action on a quantum meruit, and the case was tried and submitted to the jury upon that theory. Just as the action for seduction was being brought to trial it was settled for $15,000, and, pursuant to a contract between the plaintiff therein and her attorney of record by which he was to receive one-half of the recovery or amount paid in settlement, the sum of $7,500 was deducted, and $7,500 paid to the plaintiff therein as her share. The $7,500 so deducted was equally divided between Leroy B. and Royal S. Crane; the former claiming, however, that the amount received by him was to apply on an indebtedness owing his brother. The evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>offered on behalf of plaintiff tending to show the existence of the partnership between appellant and his brother was sufficient to take the case to the jury upon that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Upon the trial plaintiff gave evidence of the nature and extent of the services rendered by him, tending to show that he was to receive nothing for his services unless the plaintiff was successful in the action. Two attorneys were called as experts for plaintiff on the value of his services, and, in answer to a hypothetical question, gave their opinion as to the fair and reasonable value of the services rendered by him. This hypothetical question, after reciting at length the nature and extent of the services rendered, and the amount received on the settlement of the action, and the amount deducted for the services of the attorney of record, ended with the following clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-6\">\u201cAnd, assuming that the compensation of the lawyer so employed was entirely speculative and contingent upon success, what, in your opinion, would be the fair and reasonable value of the services as stated in that hypothetical \u25a0question?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">When this question was propounded to the first witness, defendant\u2019s counsel objected upon the ground, among others, that it recited facts which were not germane to the services upon which the witness was asked to pass, and that it assumed a number of facts not essential to the determination of the value of the services rendered as stated, and thereupon, addressing the court, said, \u201cYour honor has already stated that the question of speculative element is not germane to this .question,\u201d to which the court replied, \u201cI did not so state, and he has now remedied the vice which I found in the former question, and I will admit this question. It is only a matter of opinion, anyway.\u201d Defendant\u2019s counsel thereupon excepted, and the witness answered that a charge of 50 per cent, of the amount received by the lawyers who retained the counsel would be a fair and reasonable charge for the services, and added, \u201cI base that, I might saj, principally upon the fact that the payment was entirely speculative,\u2014very largely on that fact.\u201d When the hypothetical question was propounded to the second witness, defendant\u2019s counsel objected upon the same grounds, and upon the further ground \u201cthat under the pleadings and the proof the question is solely directed to the reasonable value of the services, or can only be directed to the reasonable value of the services rendered, without an element of speculation in it.\u201d This objection was overruled, and defendant\u2019s counsel excepted, and the witness answered, \u201cFrom one-half to two-thirds of the fee received by the attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">On the record before us, the question presented for determination was what was the fair and reasonable value of the services actually rendered, in view of the nature and importance of the litigation, the standing of the attorney in his profession \u201cfor learning, skill, and proficiency,\u201d and of the importance to the client of the result; and such value could not be augmented by the fact that plaintiff\u2019s services were to be performed gratuitously in the event that the action was not successful. Randall v. Packard, 142 N. Y. 47, 56, 36 N. E. <em>823; </em>Harland v. Lilienthal, 53 N. Y. <em>438; </em>Walbridge v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>Barrett, 118 Mich. 433, 76 N. W. 973; Robbins v. Harvey, 5 Conn. 335; Middleton v. Telegraph Co. (C. C.) 32 Fed. 524. It therefore follows that the court erred in not excluding from the hypothetical question the contingent element of the employment, and it is manifest from the nature of the answers given by the witnesses that the error was prejudicial to the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">The judgment and order appealed from should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
