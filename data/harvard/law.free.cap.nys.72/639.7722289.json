Y., for one year from May 1, 1898, at $15 a month, payable monthly in advance. All the negotiations were made by the defendant with the plaintiff\u2019s husband, who, by the authority of the plaintiff, signed the lease in the plaintiff\u2019s name. The rent was paid monthly by the defendant to the plaintiff\u2019s husband, who paid the same to the plaintiff. In the month of April, 1899, before the lease expired, the defendant stated to the plaintiff\u2019s husband that the defendant had decided to discontinue the business of its agency in Elmira, and that after the expiration of the lease it would rent the premises from month to month so long as it stayed. To this the husband consented, and the defendant continued in possession, paid the rent for the months of May, June, and July to the husband, who paid it to his wife; and on July 8, 1899, the defendant quit the premises and removed its property therefrom. The plaintiff testified that she never directed her husband to make a new contract, and did not know that there had been any modification. Her husband was dead when she commenced the action. The action was brought to recover for nine months\u2019 rent from August 1, 1899, and the jury rendered a verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">I think the court erred in denying the request of the defendant\u2019s counsel, made at the close of the testimony, that the court direct a verdict for the defendant. The plaintiff having clothed her husband with authority to lease the premises and to collect the rent therefor, the defendant had a right, in the absence of any notice of revocation of such authority, to presume that the agency continued and extended to the making of the new lease. She is estopped from denying that the authority on which she induced the defendant to act was real authority. Bodine v. Killeen, 53 N. Y. 93; Dillaye v. Beer, 3 Thomp. &amp; C. 218; Babin v.

Supp. 973.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">The judgment and order should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
