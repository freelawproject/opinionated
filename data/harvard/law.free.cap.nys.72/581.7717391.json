It also alleged, on information and belief, that the defendants had given plaintiff two conflicting statements as to the condition of the account. By affidavit, plaintiff averred that her stocks were sold out without notice to her. <em>Held, </em>that the application was properly denied, inasmuch as for the purpose of preparing the complaint it was immaterial whether the stock had been sold or not, providing the sale was unauthorized, and conflicting statements were immaterial, so far as the preparation of the complaint was concerned, it not appearing that the statements had any relation to the purchase.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b601-12\">Patterson, J., dissenting.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b602-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>Appeal from special term, New York county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-4\">Suit by Ida P.

Upon affidavits of one of the defendants and one of their employ\u00e9s the defendants moved to vacate this order, and in opposition to that motion an affidavit of the plaintiff was read, in which she stated that \u201cher stocks were sold out without notice to her, and that on that day she paid or caused to be paid one thousand dollars on account of margin, and stood ready and willing to put up further margins upon notice.\u201d Upon these papers we think that this examination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>was not needed to enable the plaintiff to prepare her complaint. Upon the facts, as stated by her, it is quite apparent that she has a good cause of action to recover the stocks that the defendants had purchased for her, or to recover damages for a conversion of such stocks. She does not dispute but that she ordered the stocks purchased, and that the defendants reported such purchases to her, and the defendants allege that the stocks were purchased for her account. For the purpose of preparing her complaint it is entirely immaterial whether the defendants sold her stock or not, provided such sale was unauthorized. After the case was at issue, the plaintiff might be entitled to an examination of the defendants before trial for the purpose of procuring evidence to be used upon the trial, but it is quite evident that such an examination is not at all necessary to enable her to prepare her complaint. The only allegation that conflicting statements have been made by the defendants is upon information and belief. That conflicting statements as to the condition of her account have been furnished would be entirely immaterial, so far as the preparation of the complaint is concerned, because she nowhere states that such statements had any relation to the purchase of the stocks, her sole cause of action, so far as stated, being to recover either the stock purchased for her account by the defendants, or damages for a conversion of such stocks.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">It follows that the order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs. All concur, except PATTERSON, J., who dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
