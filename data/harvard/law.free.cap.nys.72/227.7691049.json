Plaintiff\u2019s husband is dead, and the executor of his estate, it is alleged in the complaint, \u201cduly assigned to this plaintiff the above-mentioned chattel mortgage, and \u00bf11 claims the said John P. Mandigo had against this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>defendant.\u201d The answer of the defendant denies that the executor \u201cassigned the said chattel mortgage to plaintiff,\u201d but did not deny the remaining part of the allegation, \u201cand all claims the said John P. Mandigo had against this defendant.\u201d It is claimed that this is an admission of the assignment of the claim of John P. Mandigo for the fraudulent procurement of the $150. The question was submitted to the jury, which found a verdict for the plaintiff. Upon motion this was set aside and a new trial granted, under the provisions of section 999 of the Code of Civil Procedure, on the ground that the executor had not assigned the tortious cause of action to the plaintiff. The plaintiff appeals from the order setting aside the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">When the defendant denied the assignment of the chattel mortgage, because he had no knowledge of the fact, he may fairly be assumed to have intended to deny all of the matters alleged in connection with the averment. The assignment put in evidence in support of the plaintiff\u2019s allegation makes no mention of any claim against the defendant, with the exception of the chattel mortgage, \u2022which is alone \u201csold, assigned, transferred, and set over\u201d to the plaintiff. If it were necessary to support the order, the pleadings in the present case might be deemed to have been amended in harmony with the proof introduced by the plaintiff, as provided by section 723 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and in furtherance of justice the technical mistake of the defendant in not making his denial as broad as the averment of the complaint might be corrected under the provisions of the same \u2019section. We are of opinion, however, that the words \u201cand all claims the said John P. Mandigo had against this defendant\u201d were immaterial, and that the defendant was not bound to negative them.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"AKp\">HIRSCHBERG and JENKS, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b248-6\">GOODRICH, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AV2\">(dissenting). The action is for deceit in obtaining from plaintiff\u2019s husband a loan of $150, for which a chattel mortgage was given by the defendant as security. The chattels mortgaged did not belong to the defendant, and in another action to recover them the plaintiff was defeated on the ground that they belonged to some other person.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">In the present action the jury rendered a verdict for the plaintiff, which was set aside by the court on the ground that the claim for deceit had not been assigned to the plaintiff. The complaint alleged that the executor, etc., of the husband duly assigned to the plaintiff the chattel mortgage and all claims which the said Mandigo had against this defendant. The answer denied that the executor \u201cassigned the chattel mortgage to plaintiff,\u201d but did not in any other language deny the allegation that the executor assigned \u201call claims the said John P. Mandigo had against this defendant.\u201d The allegation as to assignment is separable. A denial of the first part of the allegation and a failure to deny the other constituted an admission that the executor had assigned to the plaintiff all other claims than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>the chattel mortgage. Hence the plaintiff was not put to her proof on that subject. I think that it was error to set aside the verdict, and that the order should be reversed, and judgment directed for the plaintiff on the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-3\">SEWELL, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
