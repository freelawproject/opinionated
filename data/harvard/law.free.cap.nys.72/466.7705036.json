This demurrer was by the special term sustained, and from the judgment entered upon the decision of the special term this appeal is taken.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b486-11\">Argued before PARKER, P.

If any other cause of action be alleged upon which the discharge in bankruptcy could operate, \u25a0then the defense was properly pleaded, notwithstanding there be also joined in the complaint a cause of action for embezzlement, as against which a discharge in bankruptcy would be ineffective. Upon examination of the complaint, it will be seen that there are allegations of plaintiff\u2019s ownership of this $65, and of his demand therefor upon the defendant, and of the defendant\u2019s refusal to deliver the same. Under such allegations, proof of a conversion of funds lawfully obtained by the defendant would seem to be competent, and the allegation of unlawful and fraudulent embezzlement and misappropriation could be treated as surplusage. But as a defense to a cause of action for conversion the discharge in bank<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>ruptcy is properly pleaded, and the demurrer to such plea as insufficient in law upon the face thereof should have been overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The interlocutory judgment should therefore be reversed, with costs, and the demurrer overruled, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
