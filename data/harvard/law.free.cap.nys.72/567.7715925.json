The municipal civil service commissioners acted under section io of chapter 370 of the Laws of 1899, which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-17\">\u201cThe mayor of each city in this state shall appoint and employ suitable persons to prescribe, amend and enforce rules for the classification of the offices, places and <em>employments </em>in the classified service of such city, and for appointments and promotions therein and examinations therefor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-18\">The power conferred by this section is clearly one which imposes upon the commissioners duties in their nature administrative, rather than judicial. It is one step in the proceeding for the' appointment of officers and employes of the municipal corporation. The statute under which the respondents acted is entitled \u201cAn act in relation to the. civil service of the state of New York and the cities and civil divisions thereof.\u201d Its intent is to provide for the proper and orderly appointment of officers and employ\u00e9s of the state and the municipal corporations therein. A classification of the officers is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>necessary to determine the method of appointment, and such a classification is no more a judicial determination than is the designation of the officer by the appointing power under the provisions of the statute. At common law or under the Code of Civil Procedure a writ of certiorari is only allowed where the object sought is to review a judgment or a judicial determination of an inferior tribunal, or of an officer acting under statutory authority exercising judicial power. \u201cThe writ lies only to inferior courts and officers exercising judicial powers, affecting the property or rights of the citizen.\u201d People v. Walter, 68 N. Y. 403; People v. Board of Com\u2019rs of Public Parks, 97 N. Y. 37; People v. Board of Health, 140 N. Y. 1, 35 N. E. 320, 37 Am. St. Rep. 522; People v. Board of Sup\u2019rs of Queens County, 131 N. Y. 468, 30 N. E. 488. In the latter case the court <em>say:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-5\">\u201cThe writ of certiorari is appropriate only to review the judicial action of inferior courts or of public officers or bodies exercising under the laws judicial functions, and there is no authority to be found in the Reports of this state sanctioning its use for any other purpose. When the action of a public officer or of a public body is merely legislative, executive, or administrative, although it may involve the exercise of discretion, it cannot be reviewed by certiorari.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">The civil service act (section 27) authorizes a taxpayer to bring an action to, restrain the payment of compensation to any person appointed to or holding any office, place, or appointment in violation of the provisions of the act; and, in case of the appointment of any officer in violation thereof, that would seem to be the proper remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">It follows that the action of neither the municipal nor the state board of civil service commissioners can be reviewed in this proceeding, and that the writ should be dismissed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
