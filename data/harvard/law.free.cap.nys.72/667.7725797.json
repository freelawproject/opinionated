The complaint alleges an oral contract made by plaintiff with defendant, John S. Barry, as executor of the last will and testament of William Stanton, deceased, for the sale of the so-called \u201cStanton Farm.\u201d He alleges and proves the taking possession of the farm immediately after the oral agreement, and a continued possession since. The oral purchase was for the sum of $5,375, all of which plaintiff paid to defendant, except the sum of $1,755,. and interest from April 1, 1899; and on April 13, 1900, and before this action was commenced, plaintiff tendered such sum and interest, with a deed for execution. Defendant refused to receive the sum tendered, or to execute the deed, on the sole ground that the deed \u25a0 did not properly describe the farm sold.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b688-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>Argued before PARKER, P.

Barry individually, and not as executor, and hence the executor could not be bound; that the land was the farm of William Stanton a,t the time of his decease, and John S. Barry, as executor, by the power conferred by the last will of William Stanton, was the sole person who could enter into a contract of sale. Perhaps this argument would prevail if plaintiff was forced to stand on the written contract alone, but he alleges an oral contract with John S. Barry as-executor, and the proof is abundant to sustain it? He alleges possession and payment of the purchase price, and these proven facts are sufficient-to entitle plaintiff to a deed of the Stanton farm. Besides, the defendant does not plead the statute of frauds as a defense, so the verbal contract cannot be assailed because it was not in writing. The oral contract may well stand, and the written contract also. The oral is not merged in the written, because the parties are different. John S. Barry and John S. Barry, executor, being one and the same person, the written contract may be looked into for description of premises which was in the minds of the parties. The conclusion of the learned trial court, we think, was right. The defense is obviously technical. It appears that defendant, as executor, offered a deed in which the premises are described by metes and bounds. It also appears that there was a dispute as to the exact boundary line between the Stanton farm and the farm of John S. Barry, adjoining. To settle this dispute in favor of Barry\u2019s contention, the defendant made a deed by metes and bounds, and this is the one offered to plaintiff, and that was refused by him. We think plaintiff was entitled to the Stanton farm as he purchased it, and the deed should describe it as it was described when the agreement was made. The dispute over the division line is a matter for future consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All concur; PARKER, P. J., in result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
