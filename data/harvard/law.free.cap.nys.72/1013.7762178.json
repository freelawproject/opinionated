Upon motion the Niagara Falls Street Railway Company has been made a party to the proceedings for the purpose of responding to this appeal. Upon the argument the respondent did not appear. It has since been given an opportunity to file a brief herein, but has failed to do so. Under all the circumstances of this case we think the default of the respondent should be deemed a waiver of the authority granted by the railroad commissioners, and for this reason should cause a reversal of their determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-14\">Determination of the board of railroad commissioners reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
