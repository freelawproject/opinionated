J.</author>\n<p id=\"AT\">The plaintiff was primarily liable to his attorneys for their services in commencing and prosecuting this action, and the lien w\u2019hich is given them by section 66 of the Code is given as a security only for such demand. The court will enforce such lien whenever it is necessary to do so in order to protect the attorney\u2019s legal claims, but the client still has the unrestricted control of the subject of the action and the terms upon which the settlement may be made, and such a settlement is not affected by such section unless it operate to the prejudice of the attorney\u2019s claim. Such seems to be the rule as enunciated in the following cases: Lee v. Oil Co., 126 N. Y. 579, 27 N. E. 1018; Poole v. Belcha, 131 N. Y. 200, 30 N. E. 53; Peri v. Railroad Co., 152 N. Y. 521, 46 N. E. 849. In the case at bar it appears that the plaintiff is solvent, and abundantly able to pay the costs to which his attorneys are entitled. Nothing appears in the case showing that security for their demand of $16 is needed. The plaintiff, having settled with the defendant for a sum less than his full demand, must now settle with his attorneys for their services; and there is no intimation in the record that he cannot or will not do so. It is not claimed that there was any collusion in such settlement with a view to prejudice the attorneys, and, inasmuch as plaintiff is not only liable, but clearly able, to pay them, the enforcement of their lien is not necessary. They are in no way prejudiced without it.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-15\">It is urged upon us that the defendant deceived and defrauded the plaintiff into making such settlement, but this application is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>made on behalf of plaintiff to vacate such settlement on the ground of defendant\u2019s fraud. If it were, a different inquiry would be presented; but, as it is clearly a motion to enforce the attorneys\u2019 lien given by section 66, and nothing more, it must be controlled by the rules above stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">The order is reversed, with $io costs and disbursements. AH concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
