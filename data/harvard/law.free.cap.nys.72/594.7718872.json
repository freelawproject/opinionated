(25 per cent.) of any loss which was sustained by said company, due to the failure of the said Bradford Importing &amp; Trading Company to collect certain accounts of the said Bradford Importing &amp; Trading Company. (6) That the plaintiff herein has demanded of the defendants herein an accounting to show whether the business of the said Bradford Importing &amp; Trading Company had been conducted at a loss, and whether, if there was such loss, such loss was sustained by reason of the failure of any of the debtors above mentioned to pay their just indebtedness to the said Bradford Importing &amp; Trading Company. (7) That the defendants herein have refused to the plaintiff herein a just, true, and accurate account of the standing of the said Bradford Importing &amp; Trading Company.

The defendants demurred to the complaint upon the -ground that it' does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, which demurrer was overruled, and from the interlocutory judgment entered thereon this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">We are of opinion that the judgment appealed from should be reversed, and an interlocutory judgment directed sustaining the demurrer. The complaint is fatally lacking in averment of facts which show the plaintiff entitled to any relief. In substance and effect, it only avers conclusions of fact and law. There are no averments of fact showing either partnership, agency, fiduciary relation, or trust reposed in the defendants with respect to the money alleged to have been left with them; nor is there any averment showing a contract or agreement of any kind, or a breach thereof. \u2022 Giving the plaintiff the benefit of every just and reasonable inference to be drawn from the whole statement of the complaint, no cause of action for an accounting is averred. Schantz v. Oakman, 163 N. Y. 148, 57 N. E. 288. The complaint in the case cited was much more complete in its attempted averment of a cause of action than is the complaint in the case at bar, and yet it was held defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">It follows that the interlocutory judgment should be reversed, with costs, and judgment entered sustaining the demurrer, with costs, with leave to the plaintiff to plead over within 20 days, on payment of costs in this court and in the court below. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
