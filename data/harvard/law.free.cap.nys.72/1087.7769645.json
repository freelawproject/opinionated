This appeal must be, and is, a simple one. The court, in Dewey v. Finn, 18 Wkly. Dig. 558, 559, and the cases there cited, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1107-15\">\u201cWhen property is in the possession of a third party, and claimed to be owned by him, the same cannot be taken by a receiver; nor can the third party be ordered to; deliver the same to the receiver. When the property is forcibly taken by \u00e1 receiver, the order appointing him cannot justify the taking. Parker v. Browning, 8 Paige, 390; Cowdrey v. Coit, 44 N. Y. 383, 4 Am. Rep. 690; Bank v. Richards, 3 Hun. 367. But the court did not protect the rights of the receiver by a summary proceeding against a person not a party to the suit who seized upon property which was not in the possession of the receiver or his agents. A third party whose property is seized and carried away from his possession is entitled to the usual remedy given by common law, and for asserting such right, where he has not been made a party to the prior proceeding oi* had notice thereof, he ought not to be punished as for a contempt,\u201d\u2014which has not been overruled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1107-16\">The order is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-17\">Order affirmed, with costs.
