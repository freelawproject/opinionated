Controversy submitted upon an agreed statement of facts. Judgment for plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b752-11\">This is a submission of a controversy upon an agreed statement of facts. It appears that in May, 1898, the plaintiff procured from the defendant a policy of insurance upon a building in the city of New York. The policy was originally for the sum of \u00a760,000, but by agreement on June 14, 1900, it was reduced to \u00a742,500. The defendant\u2019s policy was in the standard form, containing the provision that it should \u201cnot be liable under this policy for a greater proportion of any loss on the described property, or for loss by and expense of removal from premises injured by fire, than the amount hereby insured shall bear to the whole insurance, whether valid or not, or by solvent or insolvent insurers, covering such property; and the extent of the application of the insurance under this policy, or of the contribution to be made by this company in case of loss, may be provided for by agreement or condition written - hereon or attached or appended hereto.\u201d On the 1st of July, 1900, the property covered by the defendant\u2019s policy was damaged by fire. The plaintiff at the time of the fire had other insurance upon the property; that other insurance being in four companies, whose policies contained the same clause as that above quoted from the defendant\u2019s policy, and in addition thereto another clause in the following words: \u201cPercentage Coinsurance Clause. In consideration of the premium for which this policy is issued, it is expressly stipulated that in the event of loss this company /shall be liable for no greater proportion thereof than the sum hereby insured bears to eighty per cent, of the cash value of the property described herein at the time when such loss shall happen, nor more than the proportion which this policy bears to the total insurance.\u201d The defendant\u2019s policy did not contain the 80 per cent, clause. In each of the four policies other than the defendant\u2019s no specific amount of risk taken by the underwriter is named, but in three of them the insurance is for an amount \u201cnot exceeding $5,000,\u201d and in one of them \u201cfor an amount not exceeding $2,500.\u201d These four policies aggregate $17,500, which is just the amount by which the defendant\u2019s policy was diminished by agreement. The insurance effected by the four policies other than the defendant\u2019s was for one year from the 5th of November, 1900. After the fire the underwriters and the plaintiff caused an appraisement of the property to be made, and. found that its sound value at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>time of the fire was \u00a7124,660, and that the plaintiff's loss was \u00a745,321.18. A controversy having arisen as to the amount for which the defendant was liable under this policy, a stipulation was made between the parties by which the defendant was to pay, and it did pay, to the plaintiff, the sum of \u00a732,102.50, leaving a balance of \u00a76,074.76 in dispute.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"AqXZ\">Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.

Cardozo, for defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b753-7\">PATTERSON, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ApB\">The underlying question is, what is the whole insurance upon the property destroyed? The plaintiff insists that it is the actual insurance effected by the four policies, plus that effected by the defendant\u2019s policy; that the actual insurance effected by the four policies, in view of the 8o per cent, clause, amounts to $7,952.84 only; and that, therefore, under the defendant\u2019s policy, it should pay $38,177.28. The defendant\u2019s contention, on the contrary, is that the total insurance is $60,000, and that it is liable only for 42000/6oooo of $45,321.18, or $32,102.50, the amount which it paid. Under the terms of all the policies, the amount of insurance exceeding the amount of loss, the plaintiff is entitled to full indemnity. The defendant\u2019s contention proceeds upon the theory that the plaintiff, by taking out the four additional policies, has become a coinsurer with it, and must bear a proportionate part of the loss, or, in other words, that, under the four policies contributing with the defendant, the plaintiff is a coinsurer for the difference between the amount for which the four companies are liable and the assumed aggregate insurance of $17,500 covered by those policies. Hence it is argued that the amount of insurance, and not the amount of the liability, controls. But it seems to us that the amount of insurance effected by the four policies is identical with the amount of the loss, and that the extent of that insurance could not be ascertained until after a loss, for the insurance was to an amount not exceeding a stipulated sum, and was therefore indefinite. It might or might not be the maximum amount named in each of the four policies. How much insurance was effected by each policy depended upon the sound value of the property covered at the time of the loss, diminished by 20 per cent. The plaintiff obtained insurance additional to that granted by the defendant only to the amount for which the four underwriters other than the defendant would be liable upon their policies. It is the actual amount of insurance obtained by the plaintiff, and in force at the time of the loss, from which the contribution is to be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">Judgment should be directed for the plaintiff for $6,074.76, with interest from November 28, 1900, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
