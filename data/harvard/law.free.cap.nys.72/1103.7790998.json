We find the case at bar even stronger in fundamental facts than Lawton v. Riel, 34 How. Prac. 465; for here the means were furnished by the papers themselves to compute the exact amount of damages claimed by plaintiffs. Order must be affirmed, with costs and disbursements to respondents. Order affirmed, with costs to respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-10\">CONLAN, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1123-11\">O\u2019DWYER, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ADkz\">I dissent. The proof failed to show that at the time the attachment was issued the plaintiffs were entitled to recover the sum of $960 as damages \u00abfor their wrongful discharge. Order should be reversed, and motion granted, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
