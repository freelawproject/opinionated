She was seriously injured. Two of her fingers were rendered useless. One of her arms she cannot raise higher than her ear, and it is quite useless. She was confined to her room for several weeks, suffered.pains and aches, and was otherwise physically and mentally injured and dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1120\">*1120</page-number>tressed. For all these injuries the jury awarded her $1,500, which, we think, was quite reasonable.
