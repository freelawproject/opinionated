They duly returned an inventory, the bonds and securities named in which were placed by them in a box and deposited in a bank in Boston, and for a time the income was duly paid by them to the persons entitled thereto under the will. Until January 1867 the coupons upon the largest of the bonds were detached by the defendants in the presence of each other, and sold, and the proceeds deposited in the bank and subsequently drawn by joint checks and paid to said persons. In May 1867 Turner, in the absence of Armstrong, made the usual semi-annual payment to the heirs by checks signed by himself and Armstrong. Fifteen shares of bank stock were sold in November 1867, and transferred by the defendants jointly, and a part of the proceeds were borrowed by Turner. Joint checks were always used in drawing money from the bank, the last being dated February 4, 1868.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-7\">Turner contended that all the money, except what he thus borrowed, was duly expended in the process of settling the estate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>and by payment to parties interested ; and also contended that a large part of the securities included in the inventory were taken from the bank and fraudulently appropriated by Armstrong; and that Armstrong hsd absconded and left the Commonwealth. The plaintiff contended that Turner was bound to account for the whole inventory, including the property so appropriated by Armstrong. And the question was reserved for the consideration of the full court, by the consent of the parties, by whom it was also agreed that the case should be sent to an assessor to determine, if necessary, the amount for which execution should issue upon such principles as might be decided to apply to the facts.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b25-5\">V. <em>Morse $ C.

Ch. 17. <em>Hargthorpe </em>v. <em>Milforth, </em>Cro. Eliz. 318. <em>Peter </em>v. <em>Beverly, </em>10 Pet. 532, 562. The testator requested that no sureties should be required, and none were required by the judge of probate. The joint character of the interest of the executors arises entirely from the will, not from their qualifying by giving bond. The joining of the executors in a fiduciary relation by the testator did not make one of them responsible for the fraudulent acts of the other; and the manner of qualifying for executor, by joining two principals in the same bond, could not enlarge this responsibility. The doctrine held in some states, that executors, by the execution of a joint bond, become sureties for each other, is not law in this Commonwealth. <em>Towne </em>v. <em>Ammidown, </em>20 Pick. 535, 541. Bra<em>zer </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>5 Pick. 96,104.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b26-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Ames, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Akq\">Coexecutors, even though numerous, are regarded</p>\n<p id=\"AE\">in law as but one person. The acts of one, within the scope of his authority, in the administration of the estate, are the acts of all, with this qualification, that at common law each was responsible only for such assets as came to his own hands. Under ordinary circumstances, one of two or more executors was not to be held accountable for waste or other misconduct on the part of an associate. The misplaced confidence of the testator in the integrity or capacity of one of the number was not allowed to operate to the prejudice of another. But even according to the common law, whenever any part of the estate, by any act or agreement of one executor, passes or is intrusted to the custody of a coexecutor, they are thereby rendered jointly responsible. In such a case it would be inferred that there had been a joint possession or custody, and that one executor, having power and opportunity to make it secure, had yielded the control to the other. In <em>Langford, </em>v. <em>Gascoyne, </em>11 Ves. 333, Lord Eldon held two executors jointly responsible for assets, consisting of gold in a bag, which had been delivered to one of them, and by him, immediately and without counting, handed to the other, by whom it was subsequently squandered or embezzled. <em>Gill </em>v. <em>Attorney </em>General, Hardr. 314. <em>Sadler </em>v. <em>Hobbs, </em>2 Bro. Ch. 114. <em>Cresse </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>7 East, 246, 256. <em>Hovey </em>v. <em>Blakeman, </em>4 Ves. 596. <em>Brice </em>v. <em>Stokes, </em>11 Ves. 319. <em>Monell </em>v. <em>Monell, </em>5 Johns. Ch. 283, 296. <em>Sterrett\u2019s appeal, </em>2 Penn. 419. <em>Edmonds </em>v. Crenshaw, 14 Pet. 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">Whether, upon the facts set forth in the report, such a case of joint possession is presented as to render Turner liable at common law for the fraud and embezzlement committed by his associate, is a question which it is hardly necessary to decide, as the whole case turns upon the effect of the bond given by the two. At common law no bond was required of an executor, but his office was considered as a personal trust, resting in the confidence of the testator in the qualities which led to his selection for that special duty. By the terms of the will, these executors were not required to furnish sureties upon the assumption of their trust. They however gave a bond, according to the requirements of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>93, \u00a7 2, and we find it impossible to avoid considering that bond as binding equally on both, and making each of them liable for its entire fulfilment, at least as to all assets included in their inventory and which have come into their joint possession. It purports to be their joint and several bond. It provides that they shall return an inventory; that they shall administer according to law and the will of the testator; and that they shall render an account. They were not required by law to enter into a joint obligation. Each might have filed a separate bond. But having united in a joint bond, its effect is to make them both liable to the judge of probate as the trustee for creditors and others interested in the estate, to the extent of the assets which came to their joint possession. The authorities are clear that under such a bond, whatever may have been their common law rights, they are jointly responsible during the continuance of the joint executorship. <em>Brazer </em>v.
