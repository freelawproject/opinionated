Tallman, \u201c during his natural life, the use and occupancy and improvement \u201d of a farm in Maine, \u201c to hold the said farm to the said James during his natural life, and at his decease I will that the same descend to his oldest surviving son, if he leave one, and if not, to his two oldest daughters equally, and in case he has but one daughter, then to descend to her, and on failure of heirs of his body on the part of said James, then said real estate is to descend to the oldest surviving son of Benjamin F. Tallman, provided said son be a steady and temperate man at the age of twenty-one years. If not, then said real estate to descend to the two oldest daughters of my said son Benjamin F.

Fearne on Rem. 217. <em>Richardson </em>v. Wheatland, 7 Met. 169. The devise \u201c to her oldest son, in case she have one,\u201d means, in case she have one at the testator\u2019s decease. <em>M'Lachlan </em>v. <em>Taitt, </em>2 De Gex, Fisher &amp; Jones, 449. <em>Bowers </em>v. <em>Porter, 4 </em>Pick. 198, 205. <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Essex Merrimac Bridge Proprietors, </em>2 Pick. 243. <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>25 Wend. 119. <em>Miles </em>v. <em>Boyden, </em>3 Pick. 213. <em>Driver </em>v. <em>Frank, </em>3 M. &amp; S. 25 <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Bush, </em>8 Scott, 405. As the plaintiff satisfies the <em>descriptio personae </em>fully, the remainder, being vested, does not require to open to let in others of a class. <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Wheatland, </em>7 Met. 169. \u201c Oldest child \u201d in such a devise is a word of purchase. <em>Annable </em>v. <em>Patch, </em>3 Pick. 360. Clause seven shows that the testator knew the apt words to express <em>\u201c </em>oldest surviving son.\u201d If Caroline did not take an estate for life with a vested remainder to her oldest son in fee, she took an estate in fee tail, or an estate for life with remainder to her oldest son in fee tail. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Charlton, </em>1 Man. &amp; Gr. 429. <em>Nightingale </em>v. <em>Burrell, </em>15 Pick. 104. <em>Canedy </em>v. <em>Haskins, </em>13 Met. 389, 403. <em>Gifford </em>v. <em>Choate, </em>100 Mass. 343. Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>89, c. 12. Whichever of these constructions is adopted, the plaintiffs can give a good title to the land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b34-8\">The remainder cannot be vested in the son, subject to be di <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>vested by Ms dying before Ms mother; because, if the time oi vesting was the testator\u2019s death, there are no words showing any intention of divesting the remainder upon any subsequent contingency. <em>Blanchard </em>v. <em>Blanchard, </em>1 Allen, 223, and cases cited. If the remainder should be held contmgent until Caroline\u2019s death, then the estate would go, if she had no children then living, to the cMldren of Henry Tallman. But tMs would be construing \u201c cMldren born \u201d to mean \u201c children surviving,\u201d wMch could not be. So, if this construction was adopted, and Caroline died without living children, but having grandchildren by a deceased oldest son, the estate would go to Henry\u2019s children.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKj\">The remainder to Caroline\u2019s oldest son is contingent. The gift \u201c at her death to her oldest son, in case she have one,\u201d is a gift to the person who should be oldest son at the period of distribution, that is, at the death of Caroline. <em>Leake </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>2 Meriv. 363, 385, 386. <em>Festing </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>12 M. &amp; W. 279, 300. <em>Newman </em>v. <em>Newman, </em>10 Sim. 51. <em>Carmichael </em>v. <em>Carmichael, </em>4 Keyes, 346. <em>Miles </em>v.

If the testator meant to give the remainder exclusively to the present oldest son, who was living at the date of the will, why did he not devise it to Mm by name ? If he meant the present oldest son, then the clause would read as if it had been written, \u201c and at her death to her present oldest son, in case she have one,\u201d wMch would be absurd. The testator saw that the son living at the date of the will might die, and that some other son might be born who would answer the description of \u201c oldest son \u201d at Caroline\u2019s decease. <em>Madden </em>v. <em>Ikin, </em>2 Dr. <em>&amp; </em>Sm. 207. <em>Collingwood </em>v. <em>Stanhope, </em>Law Rep. 4 H. L. 43. <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Hancock, </em>3 Jones (No. Car.) 471.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-6\">If the remainder is vested in William, yet it is defeasible by Ms death in the lifetime of his mother; <em>Blanchard </em>v. <em>Blanchard, </em>1 Allen, 223 ; <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>25 Wend. 119; and he can give no good title thereto. The expression \u201cwithout children born \u201d cannot mean \u201c without having had a child,\u201d for Caro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>line had a child at the time the will was made. The seventh clause is to the same effect as the fourteenth, but more clearly expressed.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b36-5\">Gray, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_\">Upon a consideration of the provisions of this will,</p>\n<p id=\"Ab\">and of the numerous cases cited in the elaborate arguments of counsel, we are of opinion that the testator by the fourteenth article gave an estate for life to his daughter Caroline, and a vested remainder to her son William, being her oldest son at the time of the death of the testator, when his will took effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">If the case depended upon the provisions of the fourteenth article only, we should, having regard to the leaning of the law in favor of vested interests, have no doubt that this was the true construction. <em>Miles </em>v. <em>Boyden, </em>3 Pick. 213. <em>Pike </em>v. <em>Stephen son, </em>99 Mass. 188. 2 Jarman on Wills, 117, 124 ; (3d ed.) 192, 197, 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">In support of the argument that the words \u201c oldest son,\u201d in this article, mean \u201c oldest son surviving \u201d his mother, the learned counsel for the defendants refer to the seventh article of the will, which they contend \u201cis to the same effect, but more clearly expressed.\u201d But such a reference seems to us, by the contrast between the terms of the two articles, strongly to support the opposite conclusion; for the fourteenth article omits not only the word \u201c surviving \u201d as qualifying the words \u201c oldest son,\u201d but the direction that at the decease of his parent the estate shall \u201c descend \u201d to him; and the seventh article gives the estate over to another branch of the family, only on failure of \u201cheirs of the body \u201d of the child of the testator named in that article, which would include issue in any degree; whereas in the fourteenth article the devise over is \u201c in case the said Caroline decease without children of her born,\u201d so that, if the defendants\u2019 construction should be adopted, then, in case Caroline should leave no children living at her death, but should leave grandchildren, the estate would go to another branch of the family, to the exclusion of her grandchildren. Such a construction would be inconsistent with the general intention of the testator, as manifested by both articles, to give the estate described in each primarily to the testator\u2019s child therein named and its issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>It is admitted by the defendants that this last clause in the fourteenth article cannot be read literally, so as so mean \u201c shall die without having had a child.\u201d It is argued that it means \u201c without children of her born, living at her decease.\u201d But the true construction of this clause appears to us to be to refer it to the same period at which the oldest son of Caroline is to be ascertained, namely, at the time of the testator\u2019s death, so that the remainder would, in any event, vest absolutely at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">It follows, that Caroline and William together can convey an absolute and indefeasible title in fee simple.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">\n<em>Decree for the plaintiff\u00bb.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
