He made such examination as he saw fit. He rode .around the lot in company with the defendant\u2019s agent, came to the conclusion to buy it at the price demanded by the vendor, and paid the sum of five hundred dollars on account of the sale, for which payment the receipt was given. There is no evidence that any warranty oi <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>assurance was given that the area was only between forty and fifty thousand square feet, and there is nothing to show that the plaintiff\u2019s offer was for any definite number of square feet. On the contrary, he contracted to buy the specific lot which was pointed out to him, and to pay for it by the foot, without any knowledge as to the exact number of feet contained in it. On this point he contented himself with his own estimate and the opinion expressed by the defendant\u2019s agent. He had the same opportunity that the defendant\u2019s agent had to have the exact area ascertained by measurement, and that measurement could as easily have been made before as after closing the bargain. Under the circumstances, the mistake in his estimate as to the number of square feet contained in the lot is no excuse for his refusal to complete the purchase, and gives him no right to reclaim the money paid on account. We see no ground for the suggestion that there is a latent ambiguity in the receipt, or that the deed offered him varies from the contract, or purports to convey more land than he actually purchased. <em>Noble </em>v. <em>Googins, </em>99 Mass. 231. <em>Salem India Rubber Co. </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>23 Pick. 256. <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Parmelee, </em>15 Gray, 413. <em>Coughlin </em>v. <em>Knowles, </em>7 Met. 57. <em>Congdon </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>13 Gray, 3. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
