At Havana she was chartered to sail to Cienfuegos, a port on the south side of Cuba; and she sailed from Havana to Cienfuegos, took in cargo.there, and sailed thence for Boston, on which final passage the freight was totally lost by a peril covered by the policy, if the policy was then in force.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-12\">These facts were agreed, and the sole question was, whether there was a departure which avoided the policy before the loss.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b407-13\"><em>W.

To give it the meaning contended for by the plaintiff would be contrary to the grammatical construction and natural interpretation of the terms in which the parties have embodied their contract. The description of a voyage to a port on the north side of Cuba, \u201c with'the liberty of a second port thereon,\u201d can only mean that the second port is to be on what has already been specified, namely, the north side. In this connection, the word \u201c thereon \u201d has exactly the same meaning as if the expression had been \u201c on the same.\u2019' It is unusual and incorrect to speak of a port as on an island, though very proper to describe it as on the coast or side of an island. The plaintiff\u2019s construction of the sentence requires us to translate \u201c thereon \u201d into \u201c on Cuba.\u201d If the parties had intended that the second port might be any port in the island, without distinction, they could very easily have adopted language that would convey that meaning. We cannot do it for them, without altering their contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">It does not remove the difficulty, that the contract provides for an increase of premium \u201c if second port in Cuba is used.\u201d This provision can only apply to the \u201c second \u201d port in Cuba permitted by the policy, which, as we have found, must be on the north side of the island. A voyage from the north to the south side may have been subject to very different risks.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendants.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
