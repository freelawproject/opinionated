The declaration alleged \u201c that the defendant corporation is the owner of a certain railroad, extending from Middle-borough in Massachusetts to Newport in Rhode Island, and on July 11,1868, and for a long time previously, was accustomed to carry and convey in its cars and over its said road passengers for hire; that on said July 11 the plaintiff, having purchased of one of the defendants\u2019 authorized agents a ticket entitling him to a passage in their cars over said road from said Middleborough to said Newport, entered said cars with said ticket, and was rightfully, peaceably and lawfully riding and being conveyed from said Middleborough to said Newport; that, while so riding and being conveyed, at or near Tiverton in Rhode Island, and having with him said ticket which he had then and there exhibited to the conductor of the train of cars in which he was riding, the defendant corporation, by its said conductor and agent, assaulted the plaintiff, and wrongfully, and without any just or lawful cause, with great force and violence, pulled and dragged the plaintiff and forced and ejected him from said cars, and caused him to be there detained for the space of eight hours, whereby the plaintiff was then and there greatly exposed and injured in his credit, and suffered much pain of body and mind, and was subjected to great loss in his business,\u201d

Middleborough <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>to Newport, but denied all the other allegations of the declaration, and alleged \u201c that, if the plaintiff purchased a ticket as alleged, the said ticket was for a continuous passage from Sandwich in Massachusetts to New York, and was purchased by him subject to the established rules of the defendants, which rules the defendants were authorized to make, and of which the plaintiff was informed, to wit, that the holder of said tickec would only be carried from Midclleborough to Newport in trains connecting with steamboats for New York; that said ticket was sold at a less price than tickets allowing the holders to stop at intermediate points on the defendants\u2019 railroad, or at said Newport; that the plaintiff, in violation of said rules, attempted to ride on other trains over the defendants\u2019 railroad, not connecting with said steamboats, and to stop at intermediate points on said railroad, namely, at Fall River and Newport; and that, if the plain-. tiff was required, at the time and place alleged, or at any time and place, to leave the defendants\u2019 cars, then that the plaintiff refused to pay the established fare over the defendants\u2019 railroad, when the same was properly demanded, and that the defendants were justified in law in requiring the plaintiff so to leave said cars, the defendants expressly denying the use of any unlawful or unnecessary force therein.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-5\">Trial in the superior court,

Newport, which came to Fall River by way of Taunton, and not by way of Middleborough; and that between Fall River and Tiverton, being called upon for his fare by the conductor of the last named train, he presented the ticket, and was informed by the conductor that by the rules of the defendants it was good only on the steamboat trains, or trains connecting with the steamboats, of which two were run

If the jury find that the plaintiff purchased at Sandwich, on the Cape Cod Railroad, a through ticket for New York, in part over the defendants\u2019 railroad, such ticket would not entitle the plaintiff to ride in any local train or trains on the defendants\u2019 railroad between Middleborough and Newport which the plaintiff might select; but the defendants could designate the time and mode of conveyance on their railroad, provided that the plaintiff was carried, or allowed to go, by the earliest through passenger conveyance, and by direct line to New York; and such ticket would not entitle the plaintiff to break his journey by stopping at one or more points on the defendants\u2019 railroad.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-8\">\u201c2. The plaintiff, buying a through ticket to New York over the defendants\u2019 line of railroad and steamboats connecting therewith, must take the mode of conveyance over the defendants\u2019 line provided by their rules and regulations, provided he shall be car<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>ried or allowed to go by a direct and the earliest through passenger conveyance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-5\">\u201c 3. It was competent for the defendants to make rules and regulations to prevent passengers on through tickets from Middleborough to New York, over the defendants\u2019 line, from stopping at intermediate points on their railroad, or at Newport; and it is immaterial whether the plaintiff, before purchasing such through ticket, was informed or not of such rules and regulations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-6\">\u201c4. If the defendants ran a through passenger car or train, with proper accommodations from Middleborough to Newport, connecting there with the earliest steamboat leaving for New York, they might lawfully restrict all through passengers from Middleborough to New York to such car or train, and might lawfully prevent such through passengers from taking other trains.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-7\">\u201c5. If there was a difference in the fare between a through conveyance from Middleborough to New York, and a conveyance allowing stops at intermediate points of the journey, the plaintiff, who selected a through conveyance as the cheaper, has no cause of action against the defendants, if prevented by them from stopping and breaking his journey at any intermediate point.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-8\">\u201c 6. The Cape Cod Railroad Company, if authorized by custom or contract to sell tickets over the defendants\u2019 railroad, would not be authorized thereby to make special contracts for the conveyance of passengers over the defendants\u2019 railroad in contravention of the rules and regulations of the defendants, but only in the usual and regular way; and would not be authorized thereby to contract with passengers on through tickets, permitting them to stop or break their journey at intermediate points.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-9\">\u201c 7. It would not be within the scope of the authority of a ticket-seller appointed by the Cape Cod Railroad Company, authorized by said company to sell tickets over the defendants\u2019 railroad, under such custom or contract to make representations binding upon the defendants as to what would or would not be allowed the passenger holding such ticket to do upon the defendants\u2019 railroad. He could only sell such tickets subject to the lawful rules and regulations of the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>\u201c 8. There is no evidence from which the jury can lawfully infer that the ticket-seller upon the Cape Cod Railroad was an agent of the defendants, authorized to make contracts for the conveyance of passengers over the defendants\u2019 railroad, other than by the sale of tickets in the usual way and form, or to make representations as to the trains by which the defendants would carry said passengers; and such contracts and representations, if made, would be binding only on said Cape Cod Railroad Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-5\">\u201c 9. If the jury shall find that, under the terms of connection subsisting, either by express or implied contract, between the Cape Cod Railroad Company and the defendants, said Cape Cod Railroad Company had no right to sell through tickets, or make contracts for conveyance of passengers, allowing the passenger to break his journey or stop on the way, before reaching his destination, the plaintiff\u2019s remedy for a breach of such representation or contract, or any injury resulting therefrom, would be against the Cape Cod Railroad Company, and not against the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-6\">\u201c These instructions the judge declined to give in the form requested, but did instruct the jury substantially as follows : That the plaintiff, holding a ticket in the above form, purchased by him of the ticket-seller at Sandwich, upon which no condition appeared, was entitled to ride thereon upon the defendants\u2019 regular train that morning from Middleborough to Fall River, and from Fall River he was entitled to ride in the next regular train of the defendants from that place to Newport; that the rule alleged to have been made by the defendants was a rule the defendants had a right to make and enforce, and the plaintiff would be bound thereby if he had knowledge thereof; that if the plaintiff at any time before entering the defendants\u2019 cars at Middleborough had knowledge of said rule, he was not entitled to ride from Middle-borough to Fall River on said ticket in any but the steamboat trains; and that if at any time before entering the defendants\u2019 cars at Fall River the plaintiff had knowledge of said rule, he was not entitled to ride on said ticket from Fall River to Newport in any but the steamboat trains, and if he attempted so to do, the defendants might lawfully, using no unnecessary force, remove him from any other train <em>; </em>but that, if the jury should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>find, that the plaintiff had not such knowledge before entering the train from Fall River to Newport, and no reasonable means of knowledge, then he was entitled to ride upon said ticket to Newport; that this question of knowledge was the main question for the jury to decide ; that, upon this question of the plaintiff\u2019s knowledge of the defendants\u2019 rule, his conversation with Atkins, the ticket-seller,\" was competent testimony, and to be considered by the jury; but that, upon the evidence, Atkins was not the defendants\u2019 agent, and had no power to make contracts binding upon the defendants, and for this purpose alone, namely, as tending to show whether or not the plaintiff had such knowledge, the evidence of the conversation was admitted, and ruled out for all other purposes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-5\">\u201c The jury found for the plaintiff, with damages in the sum of $563; and to the foregoing rulings and refusals to rule the defendants allege exceptions.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b167-6\"><em>C. F. Choate, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATh\">1. The chief point in which the instructions given to the jury differ from those asked for by the defendants consists in this, that they were instructed that the plaintiff was not affected by a reasonable regulation of the defendants unless he had knowledge of it before entering the cars at Fall River. The qualification was erroneous. If the regulation was reasonable, the plaintiff, whenever informed, was bound to observe it. He suffered no detriment by failing to learn it before he entered the cars at Fall River. Had he learned it before he entered those cars, he might have waited for the steamboat train, or have paid additional fare, at his option. When informed, he had the same option, and had no longer a right to ride in the train without paying the established fare. <em>State </em>v. <em>Overton, 4 </em>Zabr. 435. <em>Cheney </em>v. <em>Boston Maine Railroad, </em>11 Met. 121.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b167-7\">2. The conversation with Atkins was improperly admitted. Although the whole testimony is not reported, it is clear, from the ruling of the court upon the whole evidence, that Atkins was not the defendants\u2019 agent. The plaintiff\u2019s testimony of his conversation with a third person, in no way connected with the defendants, had no tendency to prove his knowledge, or want 'if knowledge, as to the subject matter of the conversation.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number><em>A. Jones, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b168-5\">Wells, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AlU\">The plaintiff\u2019s ticket entitled him to a passage npon any regular train for passengers upon the road of the defendants. It contained no notice of any restriction or limitation of the right which it purported to give. It was issued by the ticket agent of the Cape Cod Railroad Company, whose authority for that purpose was sufficiently shown by the fact that such tickets had been so issued by said company \u201c for some months prior\u201d thereto, \u201cwith the assent uf the defendants.\u201d The defendants could not, by any rule or regulation not previously made known, restrict the plaintiff from taking the passage to which his ticket entitled him, in any regular train for the accommodation of passengers. Under the instructions, the jury must have found that there was no such information to the plaintiff personally; and the case shows no such publication of the rule as would affect him with notice thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The evidence of the inquiry made by the plaintiff of the person from whom he purchased his ticket, \u201cif he could go to Newport on the morning train on that ticket,\u201d and the answer that he could do so, was restricted explicitly by the j'udge at the trial, to me question whether the plaintiff had previous knowledge of the rule in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">We think that the defendants show no good ground of exception to the ruling or the instructions to the jury in the court below. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
