A judge of the Superior Court held the plaintiff First Pennsylvania Mortgage Trust (FPMT) liable to the defendants Dorchester Savings Bank (DSB) and National Bank of North America (NBNA) in the amount of $1,116,446 \u201cand interest thereon from when [FPMT] reneged on the deal, i.e., August 15, 1973.\u201d The plaintiff appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-11\">We summarize the facts as found by the judge. In 1970, the Weymouthport Corporation (Weymouthport) first approached DSB seeking a loan for a residential development to be built on land owned by the company in Weymouth. Initially refused by DSB, the company turned to NBNA with the same request. Ridgely Ware, then NBNA\u2019s senior vice president, was about to depart from NBNA to become the president of Associated Advisers, Inc., an entity established to manage the investments of FPMT. Ware asked Robert Dombal, an NBNA vice president, \u201cto reserve for [FPMT] a portion of any investment by NBNA\u201d in Weymouthport\u2019s project. Shortly thereafter, DSB agreed to participate in NBNA\u2019s construction loan to Weymouthport. Ware, on behalf of FPMT, and Dombal, on behalf of NBNA, continued negotiations. They agreed orally that NBNA \u201cwould advance [FPMT\u2019s] share of the loan until such time when [FPMT] was in a position to do so.\u201d Pursuant to the oral agreement, NBNA advanced $773,669 on behalf of FPMT, prior to the execution of a formal participation agreement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>In February, 1972, DSB, NBNA, and FPMT entered into such an agreement, dated \u201cas of July 14,1971.\u201d The agreement provided that the three participants would \u201cmake an interim construction loan\u201d of $8.5 million to Weymouthport. Of that $8.5 million, DSB would contribute $1.5 million (17.65%), NBNA would provide $4 million (47.06%), and FPMT\u2019s share would be $3 million (35.29%). As \u201cprincipal,\u201d DSB was to administer disbursements of the loan to Weymouthport as well as repayments of the loan to NBNA and FPMT.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Pursuant to paragraph 8 of the agreement, \u201call loss or losses and expenses other than bookkeeping and ministerial cost [would] be borne by the parties in accordance with their respective rateable undivided interests in the Bank Loan.\u201d The participation agreement further provided as follows: \u201cWithout the prior written consent of the Participants, Principal shall not make or consent to any modification of any said documents or make or consent to any release of the Borrower from any liability thereunder or waive any claim against the Borrower . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Over the next year, it became clear that earlier cost projections had been highly optimistic: Severe cost overruns resulted from unanticipated labor problems and difficulties in the preparation of concrete modules for use in the project. In February, 1973, FPMT and DSB joined in an additional mortgage loan to Weymouthport of $2 million as a stop-gap measure. Even this proved insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">In May, 1973, Dombal \u2014 now deeply concerned about serious cost overruns \u2014 requested, with the approval of DSB and FPMT, \u201ca special study of the current status of the . . . project to determine causes of direct cost overruns and to attempt to forecast the ultimate direct cost of the completed project.\u201d The result of the study was an estimated \u201ctotal direct cost for the project of $11,228,700,\u201d an \u201cincrease of 30% over the original estimate prepared in mid-1971.\u201d On May 22, 1973, a meeting of representatives of DSB, NBNA, FPMT, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>and Weymouthport took place at DSB. The judge found that, at that meeting, \u201c[a]ll agreed that it was appropriate and necessary to refinance the project and a consensus was reached that the then construction loan amount limit of $8.5 million would have to be increased to $12,550,000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">On June 1, 1973, Dombal sent letters to Ware and to Arthur Shaw, Jr., president of DSB, \u201cenclosing . . . a rough draft of the restructuring of the Weymouthport construction loan. . . .\u201d The draft proposed \u201ca $4,050,000 increase over the original approval of $8,500,000. Participants . . . will share in the increased portion on the same pro-rata share as the original participation . . . .\u201d In the letters, Dombal also wrote: \u201cAfter you\u2019ve had a chance to read this, please give me a call on . . . June 5th or 6th.\u201d When Ware did not telephone as requested, Dombal telephoned him. The judge specifically found \u201cthat after some discussion Ware, on behalf of AAI and [FPMT], then agreed that [FPMT] would participate as suggested during their discussions.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Shaw, on behalf of DSB, also agreed to the increase in the construction loan. During the summer, then, Dombal initiated the preparation of the appropriate legal documents, sought consultations with regard to accounting, financial planning, and marketing, and retained a well-known developer to finish the project.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">On August 15, 1973, DSB and Weymouthport signed a written amendment to the original loan agreement extending the amount of the loan from $8,500,000 to $12,550,000. Weymouthport concurrently executed a note in the amount of $12,550,000 as well as a series of mortgages. Thus, \u201c[t]he \u2018deal\u2019 increasing the amount of the construction loan to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>Weymouthport \u2018closed\u2019 on August 15,1973.\u201d Over the ensuing months NBNA and DSB advanced substantial funds to Weymouthport pursuant to the agreement to increase the construction loan. At one point, Dombal became concerned that he had not yet received a signed participation agreement from Ware. Ware assured Dombal that he \u201cwas in on the deal\u201d and requested that Dombal \u201ccover for him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">In late September or early October, 1973, Ware became \u201cevasive\u201d about FPMT\u2019s fulfilling its newly-incurred financial obligation. On October 10, 1973, Ware wrote Dombal as follows: \u201cAfter considerable thought and with much trepidation about the future of this project, I must inform you that because of past happenings ... I am unable to recommend to our Trustees the approval of any further increases in the above loan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">\u201cFor good business and financial reasons,\u201d the judge observed, \u201cthe project ultimately had to be restructured as a condominium development . . . .\u201d In 1974, DSB, with the approval of NBNA, accepted a deed from Weymouthport in lieu of foreclosure. Construction was completed in 1975 and the last condominium was sold in 1979. The total costs of the completed project were $24,005,800. The project realized $11,426,095 from the sales of condominium units, $250,943 in rental income, and $26,424 from the sale of equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">On June 20, 1974, FPMT filed suit in the Superior Court against the defendants seeking a declaratory judgment \u201cthat Dorchester by its conduct ha[d] (a) breached its obligations under the Participation Agreement, and (b) violated its fiduciary duties, as trustee, to protect the undivided interest of [FPMT] in the construction loan.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On September 16, 1974, DSB and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>NBNA filed an answer and counterclaim. The counterclaim alleged that FPMT had breached the amended participation agreement of August 15, 1973, and had made false representations to DSB and NBNA. The jury-waived trial commenced on July 6, 1982, and concluded on September 3, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">The judge rendered his decision on March 14, 1983.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That decision embraced four rulings of law: First, the judge held that DSB and NBNA had fulfilled all their obligations pursuant to the agreement with FPMT. Second, DSB had performed its duties toward NBNA, FPMT, and Weymouthport \u201cin good faith\u201d and with \u201cgood business judgment.\u201d Third, FPMT was responsible for its pro rata share of the project\u2019s losses, pursuant to the loan agreement, in the amount of $1,116,446. Last, even were the Statute of Frauds applicable to FPMT\u2019s oral agreement to the increase of the loan from $8,500,000 to $12,550,000, FPMT was \u201cbound thereby on the basis of equitable and promissory estoppel.\u201d The plaintiff filed a notice of appeal in the Appeals Court. We transferred the appeal to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">On appeal, FPMT raises several categories of error: It alleges that the judge\u2019s findings of fact were clearly erroneous; it maintains that the judge erred as a matter of law in deciding that FPMT could be held to have participated in the August 15, 1973, increase of the original loan in the absence of a written agreement; and it challenges the judge\u2019s calculation of damages.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We address each category of alleged error in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>1. <em>Allegations of factual error. </em>The thrust of FPMT\u2019s argument is that \u2014 whether as a matter of fact or as a matter of law \u2014 the judge erred in holding that FPMT did, through its agent, commit itself to participate with NBNA and DSB, despite the lack of a writing, in the additional $4,050,000 loan which closed on August 15, 1973. The plaintiff\u2019s initial basis of attack is that there was insufficient evidence to find that FPMT promised orally to participate in the $4,050,000 August 15, 1973, loan.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The plaintiff states that in relying on portions of Dombal\u2019s testimony, the judge \u201cstrain[ed] credulity to un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>reasonable limits.\u201d The plaintiff then goes on to suggest a fact pattern from the evidence which supports its version of these events. The plaintiff\u2019s argument misperceives the scope of appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">On appeal, we may not set aside findings of fact \u201cunless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d Mass. R. Civ. P. 52 (a), 365 Mass. 816 (1974). \u201cIn applying the clearly erroneous standard to the findings of a [judge] sitting without a jury, appellate courts must constantly have in mind that their function is not to decide factual issues <em>de novo.[</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>The authority of an appellate court, when reviewing the findings of a judge as well as those of a jury, is circumscribed by the deference it must give to decisions of the trier of the fact, who is usually in a superior position to appraise and weigh the evidence. The question for the appellate court under Rule 52(a) is not whether it would have made the findings the trial court did, but whether \u2018on the entire evidence [it] is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed\u2019\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Zenith Radio Corp. </em>v. <em>Hazeltine Research, Inc., </em>395 U.S. 100, 123 (1969). <em>New England Canteen Serv., Inc. </em>v. <em>Ashley, </em>372 Mass. 671, 675 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">\u201cWhat this means is that [the judge\u2019s] findings \u2018come here well armed with the buckler and shield\u2019 of F.R.Civ.P. 52(a); <em>Hortonv. U.S. Steel Corp., </em>286 F.2d 710, 713 (5th Cir. 1961); quoted with approval in 9 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2585, p. 729. See also Note, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a) and the Scope of Appellate Fact Review: Has Application of the Clearly Erroneous Rules Been Clearly Erroneous? 52 St. John\u2019s L. Rev. 68 (1977). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>burden is squarely on the appellant to show an appellate court that a finding is clearly erroneous, <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Missouri Pac. Ry. Co., </em>413 F.2d 9 (5th Cir. 1969) . . . .\u201d <em>Matter of Multiponics, Inc., </em>622 F.2d 709, 723 (5th Cir. 1980). <em>See Alaska Foods, Inc. </em>v. <em>American Mfr.\u2019s Mut. Ins. Co., </em>482 P.2d 842, 848 (Alaska 1971).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">After reviewing the record, we are not left with a firm conviction that the trial judge was mistaken. There was ample evidence to support the judge\u2019s finding that FPMT promised to participate in the additional loan of $4,050,000. Peter Weir, an attorney for NBNA, testified that at a meeting at DSB on May 22, 1973, representatives of FPMT, NBNA, and DSB reached the \u201cunderstanding . . . that an additional $4,050,000 would be needed.\u201d A letter dated June 1, 1973, from Dombal to Ware contained \u201ca rough draft of the restructuring of the Weymouthport construction loan\u201d in which FPMT was to contribute an additional $1,430,000 (i.e., 35.29% of $4,050,000). Dombal agreed that \u201con the 5th or the 6th [of June], somewhere around, there,\u201d he telephoned Ware and \u201ctold [Ware that he] was not going to go to the committee unless [Ware] was part of the deal, and . . . would take his proportionate share of the increase.\u201d Dombal averred that Ware told him \u201cthat he was going to be part of the deal.\u201d Dombal further stated that in late July, 1973, he and his assistant, Daniel P. Biggs, telephoned Ware to review all of the loan closing terms and the supporting documentation to be signed by the borrower; Ware approved each item. \u201cAt the conclusion of that conversation,\u201d Dombal asked Ware \u201cif he was in the deal, and he told [Dombal] yes.\u201d Biggs\u2019s deposition confirmed that Ware \u201cindicated his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>approval of those terms and conditions and instructed . . . Mr. Dombal to proceed with the execution of the appropriate documentation to effect those terms and conditions.\u201d Ware himself stated that at the end of July, 1973, he and Dombal \u201cwere talking on a daily basis or almost on a daily basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Dombal telephoned Ware after the closing on August 15, 1973, and said that Ware reiterated \u201c[t]hat he was in the deal . . . .\u201d Weir testified that Ware told him in mid-September that \u201che anticipated having a trustee to sign [the agreement] the following week\u201d and would then send it on. Shaw stated that on September 28, 1973, Ware once again said, \u201cI am definitely in.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">The exhibits also support the judge\u2019s determination that an oral agreement was reached among FPMT, DSB, and NBNA. Among those exhibits, a memorandum from Ware dated July 31, 1973, to a trustee of FPMT reported the \u201cjointly reached\u201d recommendation to \u201c[i]ncrease loan to $12-1/2 million and extend the maturity date to mid 1975.\u201d An internal Associated Advisers, Inc., form reporting the status of the Weymouthport loan as of September 8, 1973, noted the following under the heading \u201cAction Taken\u201d: \u201cLoan increased to $12.5 million. Additional collateral taken.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">The plaintiff places special emphasis on a memorandum from Biggs of September 11, 1973, which summarized the problems of the project, stating that FPMT \u201chas refused to fund their share of construction advances, pending their own \u2018analysis.\u2019\u201d Further, FPMT points up Ware\u2019s testimony that he never acquiesced to the increased loan, and the testimony of FPMT\u2019s expert on construction lending that \u201cit is never good banking practice to advance money, even in the best of circumstances, without a signed participation agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">The plaintiff asks us, in effect, to weigh the evidence supporting its position anew.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> But there is no doubt that here the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>trial judge was \u201cin a superior position to appraise and weigh the evidence.\u201d <em>Building Inspector of Lancaster </em>v. <em>Sanderson, </em>372 Mass. 157, 161 (1977). We will not \u201creview questions of fact found by the trial judge, where such findings are supported \u2018on any reasonable view of the evidence, including all rational inferences of which it was susceptible. \u2019 <em>Bowers </em>v. <em>Hathaway, </em>337 Mass. 88, 89 (1958).\u201d <em>T.L. Edwards, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fields, </em>371 Mass. 895, 896 (1976). In sum, on the entire record, there is no basis for a determination that the trial judge made a mistake. <em>New England Canteen Serv., Inc. </em>v. <em>Ashley, </em>372 Mass. 671, 675 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">2. <em>The validity of the oral </em>agreement.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The plaintiff next contends that, as a matter of law, \u201cFPMT cannot be found to have participated in the August 15th [1973] loan by reason of an alleged oral promise by Ridgeley Ware\u201d and that \u201c[i]t is therefore not bound contractually to share in the losses on that loan.\u201d The plaintiff insists that the obligation which, in other circumstances, might be imposed on FPMT by reason of an exchange of oral promises, see <em>Loranger Constr. Corp. </em>v. <em>E.F. Hauserman Co., </em>376 Mass. 757, 762-763 (1978), is expunged here both by the Statute of Frauds,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> as well as by the specific provisions of the original agreement among DSB, NBNA, and FPMT. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>The Statute of Frauds is not germane to the transactions involved. Both the written participation agreement of 1972 and the oral agreement of 1973 were contracts of \u201cjoint adventure and for the division of profits and losses resulting therefrom.\u201d 2 A. Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 411, at 420 (1950). \u201cSuch joint venture contracts involving transactions in land are generally held not to be within the statute of frauds, and therefore, may be oral.\u201d 2 S. Williston, Contracts \u00a7 319, at 634 (3d ed. 1959). See <em>Fencer </em>v. <em>Wills, 259 </em>Mass. 546, 549 (1927) (\u201cThe subject matter of the agreement concerned alone the matter of profits and losses arising, or which might arise, from the sale of lands purchased and held under the terms of the agreement. We think the agreement is not a contract for the sale of lands or any interest in land . . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Nor do the \u201cclear terms\u201d of the original participation agreement, requiring prior written consent to any modification, nullify the subsequent oral agreement of August, 1973. \u201cIt is a settled \u2018principle that the mode of performance required by a written contract may be varied by a subsequent oral agreement based upon a valid consideration.\u2019 <em>Siegel </em>v. <em>Knott, </em>316 Mass. 526, 528 (1944).\u201d <em>Wesley </em>v. <em>Marsman, </em>393 Mass. 1003, 1004 (1984). Here, the \u201cvalid consideration\u201d consisted of the promises of NBNA and DSB to invest their pro rata shares of the loan increase. Mutual agreement on modification of the requirement of a writing may, moreover, \u201cbe inferred from the conduct of the parties and from the attendant circumstances\u201d of the instant case. <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>359 Mass. 711, 715 (1971). There was no evidence or finding suggestive of the intention ofFPMT not to amend the contract unless all written documents were drafted and signed and a formal amendment to the participation agreement was executed. To the contrary, the judge found that Ware \u201cunequivocally\u201d indicated his approval \u201cof the many pertinent details\u201d of the deal in late July, 1973: \u201cWare did not indicate any disagreement either with the concept or with the terms of the proposed amendment to the Agreement.\u201d We concluded that there was no error of law in the judge\u2019s determination of FPMT\u2019s \u201coral commitment to participate financially pro rata in the parties\u2019 agreed-to increase in the construction loan to Weymouthport.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>3. <em>The computation of damages. </em>In their counterclaim for breach of contract, NBNA and DSB sought \u201cdamages either for the sum of $1,400,028.04, which is [FPMT\u2019s] alleged <em>pro rata </em>share of the increase in the construction loan purportedly agreed-to by it or for the sum of $1,116,446 which is claimed to be [FPMT\u2019s] <em>pro rata </em>share of the total losses sustained by the parties on the project.\u201d The judge held FPMT \u201cresponsible for its <em>pro rata </em>share of the project\u2019s losses in the sum of $1,116,446 pursuant to paragraph numbered 8 of the [participation] agreement.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">On appeal, FPMT argues that the measure of damages is incorrect. It maintains that \u201c[t]he key flaw in the [judge\u2019s] legal analysis is its implied finding that paragraph 8 of the Participation Agreement covering the $8.5 million loan extends to the entire $24 million\u201d ultimately expended for completion of the project. FPMT reasons that such an interpretation of paragraph 8 locks \u201cFPMT into 35.29% of unlimited losses, whether approved by FPMT or not, and whether 5, 10 or even 100 million dollars.\u201d The plaintiff asserts, moreover, that \u201ceven if FPMT must further share in the \u2018burdens\u2019 of the Project by contributing funds to the second loan, it is entitled also to share fully in the proceeds derived from that loan.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">We reject this characterization of FPMT\u2019s entitlement, a characterization which neglects the core fact, as found by the judge, that \u201c[FPMT] reneged on the deal.\u201d The plaintiff did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>not fund its pro rata share of the increase in the construction loan, and repudiated the agreement, through its agent Ware, by letter on October 10, 1973. Where a party violates \u201ca contract to invest money in an enterprise . . . substantial damages may be recovered.\u201d 5 A. Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 1078, at 450 (1964). The court may award such damages \u201cas may be presumed to have been in the contemplation of the parties at the time the contract was made.\u201d <em>Bucholz </em>v. <em>Green Bros., </em>272 Mass. 49, 54 (1930).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">The plaintiff contends that it never contemplated liability for a pro rata share of \u201cunlimited losses\u201d and that the judge\u2019s computation of damages was, therefore, erroneous. We disagree. At the point at which it acquiesced in the modification of the participation agreement, FPMT manifested its willingness to risk up to 35.29%, i.e., its pro rata share, of $12,550,000. In a joint venture such as that among FPMT, DSB, and NBNA, \u201cno financial return is promised the party supplying the capital. In exchange for a share in the earnings and'residue, he takes the risk of failure of the enterprise and of total loss.\u201d <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Ajax Constr. Co., </em>124 Cal. App. 2d 425, 433 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">The judge, then, simply held FPMT to its promise. He found the plaintiff liable for its pro rata share of the project\u2019s losses, losses which did not exceed $12,550,000. Thus, FPMT\u2019s argument that the damages here were beyond its contemplation is specious. That the judge\u2019s explication of his reasoning was elliptical does not undermine the soundness of his resolution of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Moreover, the judge, in calculating damages, <em>did </em>factor in share of the \u201cproceeds\u201d due the plaintiff. By first deducting the income of the project from the total expenditures on the project, before calculating FPMT\u2019s share of the losses, see note 16, <em>supra, </em>he, in effect, gave FPMT credit for 35.29 cents on each dollar by which the \u201cproceeds\u201d brought the total losses below $12,550,000. Arguably, he might have held FPMT liable for a full 35.29% of $12,550.000.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The result, however, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>that the trust was found liable in an amount <em>less </em>than that which FPMT had promised to risk. We conclude that there is no basis on which to disturb the assessment of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b632-7\"> The judge found \u201c[o]n all the evidence . . . that Dorchester performed its almost purely ministerial responsibilities under the Agreement and as \u2018lead\u2019 bank in a competent and businesslike manner.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b633-7\"> On appeal, FPMT does not challenge the finding below that Ware possessed the express authority to commit FPMT to its pro rata share of the increase in the construction loan to Weymouthport.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b633-8\"> The judge noted that \u201c[a]s of the beginning of August, 1973, of the three buildings planned as the first phase of the project, only one was substantially complete, another was 65% complete and construction of the largest building had not yet begun. . . . [Tjhere was only a very small amount of construction loan funds remaining to be advanced from the original amount borrowed . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b634-8\"> On September 9, 1977, FPMT commenced a separate action adding two claims: first, that the defendants, after FPMT filed its first complaint, violated both their agreement with FPMT and their fiduciary duties by releasing the contractor and the guarantors from obligations under the original loan agreement. Second, FPMT alleged that entities controlled by DSB were holding the Weymouthport project as constructive tmstees for the benefit of FPMT to the extent of FPMT\u2019s interest under the participation agreement. (The latter claim was dismissed by stipulation of the parties on August 8, 1978.) On September 26, 1980, a judge of the Superior Court allowed a joint motion to consolidate the actions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b635-7\"> On April 1, 1983, FPMT filed a motion requesting that the judge amend and supplement his findings of fact and conclusions of law as well as amend the judgment. On May 3,1983, the judge denied the motion for amendment and for supplemental findings of fact. He did, however, amend his conclusions of law. His \u201ccorrections [were] technical and [did] not go to the substance of judgment previously entered in this action.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b635-8\"> The plaintiff further asserts that the judge \u201cmade a number of critical and significant evidentiary rulings which were erroneous as a matter of law and which resulted in a pattern of findings which favored the defendants,\u201d and that the judge abused his discretion in denying FPMT\u2019s motion to amend its complaint to add a claim under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 11 (1984 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">As for the evidentiary rulings complained of, those painstakingly gleaned by FPMT from the transcript are, in our view, neither critical nor significant; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>most were discretionary. The plaintiff claims, for example, that the judge erroneously permitted Dombal to \u201ctestify as to what Ware meant\u201d by his request that Dombal \u201csave a piece of the deal\u201d for FPMT. But FPMT misconstrues the judge\u2019s ruling: Dombal was permitted to testify as to his <em>own </em>understanding of Ware\u2019s statements, a fact relevant to determination of Dombal\u2019s later reliance. There was, thus, no error. The exclusion of a letter from which an enclosure was missing did not amount to an abuse of discretion. The judge gave counsel an opportunity to obtain the enclosure and also permitted oral testimony as to the contents of the letter. Last, the judge excised from an exhibit those portions concerned, for example, with the allocation of fees and disbursements between all counsel for the defendants. There was no error in excising that portion of the exhibit. In any event, FMPT has not demonstrated that any \u201cerror complained of has injuriously affected [its] substantial rights.\u201d G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 119 (1984 ed.). See G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 132 (1984 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Nor did the judge abuse his discretion in denying FPMT\u2019s eleventh-hour motion to amend its complaint. Even though the action had been pending for more than eight years, FPMT filed its motion on July 1, 1982. \u201cWhen trial is as imminent as it was in this case, a judge may give weight to the public interest in the efficient operation of the trial list and to the interests of other parties who are ready for trial. In the circumstances of this case, the plaintiff was guilty of undue delay warranting the judge\u2019s denial of the motion\u201d to amend. <em>Castellucci </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., </em>372 Mass. 288, 292 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b636-7\"> The judge also ruled that FPMT was bound \u201con the basis of equitable and promissory estoppel.\u201d Because we conclude that FPMT entered into a binding oral agreement to participate in the additional loan of $4,050,000, we do not reach FPMT\u2019s claims that there was insufficient evidence to find that: (1) FPMT participated in the original $8,500,000 loan before the participation agreement was signed; (2) had FPMT made a promise to participate in the $4,050,000 increase in August, 1973, NBNA and DSB relied on that promise in deciding to enter into the new loan; and (3) even if the defendants had relied on a promise of FPMT to participate in the additional $4,050,000 loan, such reliance was reasonable.
