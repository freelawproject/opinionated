Dr. Kobrin claimed that, on the basis of the psychotherapist-patient privilege, G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B (1984 ed.), he was not permitted to disclose those portions of the subpoenaed medical records which concerned communica^ tians between him and his patients relating to diagnosis and treatment. We vacate the judgment of contempt and remand this matter to the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">There is no dispute as to the procedural background. On May 9,1984, a Suffolk County special grand jury, investigating alleged violations of the Medicaid False Claim Act, G. L. c. 118E, \u00a7\u00a7 21A-21G (1984 ed.), issued a summons to Dr. Kobrin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As revised two days later, the summons included a subpoena duces tecum that demanded the production of all Dr. Kobrin\u2019s appointment books and calendars as well as all records relating to the treatment or billing of Dr. Kobrin\u2019s Medicaid patients.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Dr. Kobrin immediately undertook to consult his Medicaid patients to determine whether they wished to assert their statutory privilege to prevent disclosure of communications between them and Dr. Kobrin. Twenty-seven patients submitted written invocations of the psychiatrist-patient privilege.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Dr. Kobrin then filed a motion to quash \u201cso much of the summons as request[ed] the privileged communications. \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A judge of the Superior Court denied the motion and ordered the production of the subpoenaed records. Dr. Kobrin immediately requested relief from a single justice of this court under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3 (1984 ed.). That request was similarly denied. Dr. Kobrin was called to testify before the grand jury on May 31, 1984. At that time, he produced only his appointment books<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and \u201csanitized\u201d copies of patients\u2019 charts, stating that his \u201cpatients [had] validly exercised this psychotherapist-patient privilege and [have] thereby prevented me from voluntarily surrendering these records.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">That same day, the Commonwealth moved to hold Dr. Kobrin in civil contempt. After a hearing, the judge granted the motion and remanded Dr. Kobrin to the custody of the sheriff. Dr. Kobrin appealed the contempt citation, and a single justice of the Appeals Court ordered \u201cthat a stay of the judgment of contempt be continued provided that the petitioner, Dr. Kobrin, deliver to the clerk of this court by June 12, 1984, originals of all the records under summons.\u201d The records were to be impounded. While the single justice held that all the records under summons were to be turned over to the grand jury, the parties were to submit a plan before June 14, 1984, to protect the confidentiality of patient communications.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Dr. Kobrin deposited the records as ordered. On June 13, 1984, he submitted his proposed plan to the single justice of the Appeals Court. Though preserving his objection to any disclosure of his patients\u2019 communications, Dr. Kobrin proposed that the Commonwealth be required to demonstrate \u201ca particularized need for each record and an indication of what information the Commonwealth believes the record contains, the need for that information and an assurance to the court that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>the information cannot be obtained anywhere else by less intrusive methods, including the interview of the patient.\u201d Even then, Dr. Kobrin suggested, the court might \u201crelease only that portion of the record meeting the conditions . . . with strict orders to keep all such information strictly confidential.\u201d The Attorney General objected to this proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">On June 26, 1984, the single justice of the Appeals Court received and allowed a motion to intervene brought on behalf of patients of Dr. Kobrin who wished to assert the psychotherapist-patient privilege. After further argument, the single justice of the Appeals Court rejected Dr. Kobrin\u2019s proposal. He ordered that one copy of the disputed patient records be released unedited to the Attorney General; patient names were to be \u201cwhited out\u201d but a cross-reference list of names to Medicaid numbers would be made and retained by the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">The records were released and have since been in the possession of the Attorney General.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Dr. Kobrin added to his appeal of the Superior Court contempt judgment an appeal to the full Appeals Court of the disclosure order issued by the single justice.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We granted the application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">On appeal, Dr. Kobrin argues that the psychotherapist-patient privilege of G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B, is available to psychiatric patients participating in the Medicaid program.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He maintains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>that neither the Federal government nor the Massachusetts Legislature has abrogated the privilege as it applies to Medicaid patients. He further asserts that the actual communications between a Medicaid patient and the psychiatrist are irrelevant to an investigation of Medicaid fraud and thus should be closed to inspection by the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The Commonwealth contends that invocation of the psychotherapist-patient privilege in the instant circumstances would hinder the Federal objective of verifying the provision of services for which Medicaid reimbursement is sought. The Commonwealth maintains that Federal Medicaid law and the psychotherapist-patient privilege are in conflict and that, under the supremacy clause of the Federal Constitution, the privilege must yield. While conceding that the \u201crecords may contain some patient communications intermingled throughout the notes of Dr. Kobrin,\u201d the Commonwealth urges that \u201c[tjhis commingling of patient communications with progress notes and other information specifically required to be kept by a provider should not allow the provider to circumvent the disclosure requirements of the law.\u201d We turn to the statutory provisions at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Both Federal and State laws and regulations require Dr. Kobrin, as an approved Medicaid provider, to maintain certain records for audit and inspection. Title XIX of the Social Security Act mandates that a State plan for medical assistance \u201cprovide for agreements with every person or institution providing services under the State plan under which such person or institution agrees (A) to keep such records as are necessary fully to disclose the extent of the services provided to individuals receiving assistance under the State plan, and (B) to furnish the State agency . . . with such information, regarding any payments claimed by such person or institution for providing services under the State plan, as the State agency . . . may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>from time to time request.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(27) (1982).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, Massachusetts requires that all Medicaid providers \u201cmaintain proof, subject to audit, of the actual deliverance of services and goods to recipients for which bills are submitted.\u201d G. L. c. 118E, \u00a7 20.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">At the same time, G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B, states: \u201cExcept as hereinafter provided, in any court proceeding preliminary thereto and in legislative and administrative proceedings, a patient shall have the privilege of refusing to disclose, and of preventing a witness from disclosing, any communication, wherever made, between said patient and a psychotherapist relative to the diagnosis or treatment of the patient\u2019s mental or emotional condition.\u201d The statute defines \u201ccommunications\u201d as including \u201cconversations, correspondence, actions and occurrences relating to diagnosis or treatment before, during or after institutionalization, regardless of the patient\u2019s awareness of such conversations, correspondence, actions and occurrences, and any records, memoranda or notes of the foregoing.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>The investigation of a psychiatrist for possible Medicaid fraud thus demands our consideration of two significant policies. First, \u201c[t]he federal policy requiring disclosure of patient records for fraud investigations is very necessary to the continued viability of the Medicaid program.\u201d <em>In re Grand Jury Investigation, </em>441 A.2d 525, 531 (R.I. 1982). Second, the Legislature in enacting G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B, acknowledged \u201c \u2018the justifiable expectations of confidentiality that most individuals seeking psychotherapeutic treatment harbor. \u2019 We are not free to water down the legislative policy embodied in the statute . . . .\u201d <em>Usen </em>v. <em>Usen, </em>359 Mass. 453, 457 (1971), quoting <em>In re Lifschutz, </em>2 Cal. 3d 415, 431 (1970). But we do not perceive a total conflict between these two policies or between the statutory provisions in which they are embodied. In our view, both the State\u2019s \u201ccompelling interest in ensuring that services and supplies for which it is being billed have been provided, and that the medicaid program is not being defrauded,\u201d <em>Hawaii Psychiatric Soc\u2019y, Dist. Branch of the Am. Psychiatric Soc\u2019y </em>v. <em>Ariyoshi, </em>481 F. Supp. 1028, 1041 (D. Hawaii 1979), as well as \u201cthe general policy of the statute protecting the confidentiality of communications between a patient and psychotherapist,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lamb, </em>365 Mass. 265, 268 (1974), may be accommodated.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">States have been afforded significant discretion in the implementation of Medicaid programs, particularly in the area of documentation. See, <em>e.g., In re Madeline Nursing Homes, </em>694 F.2d 433, 447-448 (6th Cir. 1982); <em>Troutman </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>588 F. Supp. 590, 600-601 (E.D. Pa. 1984). Federal law demands only that Medicaid providers \u201ckeep such records <em>as are necessary </em>fully to disclose the extent of the services provided\u201d to patients (emphasis supplied). 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a) (27)(A). And although the language of G. L. c. 118E, \u00a7 20, is not identical to that of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(27)(A), the intent to adhere to the Federal standard is evident in the regulations promulgated pursuant to G. L. c. 118E, \u00a7 20. See note 11, <em>supra. </em>Thus, the Commonwealth may require a psychiatrist to keep, and, consequently, to disclose only those records \u201cas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>are necessary fully to disclose the extent of the services provided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">The Commonwealth argues that the \u201cferreting out of fraudulent practices,\u201d <em>In re Grand Jury Investigation, supra </em>at 532, requires unlimited access to the patient files of a psychiatrist. But none of the authorities cited by the Commonwealth supports the wholesale assault on privacy in its claim that psychiatric records in their entirety are \u201cnecessary fully to disclose the extent of the services provided.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Commonwealth relies on <em>In re Grand Jury Investigation, supra, </em>for the proposition that the medical records in the possession of psychiatrists are obtainable by the grand jury in a Medicaid fraud investigation. But at issue in that case was the relation between the State\u2019s physician-patient privilege and the Federal Medicaid law. Only nonpsychiatric medical records were involved. Compare <em>Department of Social &amp; Health Servs. </em>v. <em>Latta, </em>92 Wash. 2d 812 (1979) (physician-patient privilege at issue, not psychotherapist-patient privilege). Similarly, we held in <em>Stornanti </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>389 Mass. 518 (1983), that a pharmacy voluntarily participating in the Medicaid program must produce Medicaid patient drug profile records, prescription records, and doctor\u2019s order forms when subpoenaed by a grand jury. We did not confront in that case, however, a countervailing mandate of confidentiality such as that expressed by the Legislature in G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B. The court in <em>Camperlengo </em>v. <em>Blum, </em>56 N.Y.2d 251, 253 (1982), held that the statutorily-created physician-patient privilege did \u201cnot absolutely protect a [psychiatrist\u2019s] records of treatment of Medicaid patients from a subpoena of the State Department of Social Services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>issued in an investigation of billing practices.\u201d That court, however, specifically noted that, because the psychiatrist had abandoned any claim that the department\u2019s subpoena was overly broad, it had \u201cno occasion to delineate the precise boundaries of the exception\u201d to the physician-patient privilege. <em>Id. </em>at 256 note.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Such an occasion, however, is present in the case before us. We conclude that psychiatric records of certain patient communications are not \u201cnecessary fully to disclose the extent of the services provided.\u201d The critical issue in a Medicaid fraud investigation is whether the psychiatrist has accurately represented the number of patients seen, the frequency of patient visits, and the length of time per visit or psychotherapeutic session.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We fail to see how the Commonwealth\u2019s review of those portions of a psychiatrist\u2019s records that recite \u201cthe patient\u2019s most intimate thoughts and emotions, as well as descriptions of conduct that may be embarrassing or illegal,\u201d <em>Hawaii Psychiatric Soc\u2019y, supra </em>at 1041, can be helpful to a determination whether the psychiatrist has in fact furnished a reimbursable service.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In short, \u201c[t]here is no evidence that review by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>the State of personal and confidential information contained in a psychiatrist\u2019s patient files is necessary to prevent fraud.The details of a patient\u2019s problems are not necessary to an evaluation of whether a psychiatrist is rendering services in the amount claimed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1041-1042.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Even were we persuaded that such communications might in some as yet unexplained way assist in the detection of Medicaid fraud, we would be lath to approve their wholesale production before the grand jury. The Commonwealth concedes \u201cthe interest that the patients have in protecting the confidentiality of their communications to Dr. Kobrin and understands their concern in the release of this information.\u201d See <em>Stornanti </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>389 Mass. 518, 527 n.14 (1983) (Medicaid patients retain privacy rights). Furthermore, there is no suggestion that the Legislature intended that the privacy concerns underlying G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B, be abrogated in the face of an investigation under the Medicaid False Claim Act. \u201cIn respect to relevance . . . privacy interests . . . should be considered. . . . [A]s the relevance of a document or part of it [is] seen to be attenuated or remote, the existence of a personal interest in nondisclosure might well persuade a court against ordering production.\u201d <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Peabody, </em>380 Mass. 805, 819 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Because their unrestricted production would implicate privacy interests without being necessary to a determination whether the Medicaid program has been defrauded, the \u201ccommunications\u201d of Dr. Kobrin\u2019s patients warrant protection. But the scope of protected \u201ccommunications\u201d in the context of a Medicaid fraud investigation may not be so broad as to embrace that information \u201cnecessary to satisfy the important public in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>terest in seeing that Medicaid funds are properly applied.\u201d <em>Camperlengo </em>v. <em>Blum, </em>56 N.Y.2d 251, 255-256 (1982). Concomitantly, any exception to the privilege of G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B, must be \u201cno broader than necessary for effective oversight of the Medicaid program.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 256. Accordingly, we conclude that the Commonwealth may properly request that Dr. Kobrin submit to the grand jury those portions of his records documenting the times and lengths of patient appointments, fees, patient diagnoses, treatment plans and recommendations, and somatic therapies.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Those portions of the records, however, which reflect patients\u2019 thoughts, feelings, and impressions, or contain the substance of the psychotherapeutic dialogue are protected and need not be produced. See <em>In re Pebsworth, </em>705 F.2d 261, 262, 263 (7th Cir. 1983) (distinguishing between \u201cfragmentary data\u201d such as listing of patient visits or \u201cin some cases, the patient\u2019s diagnosis\u201d and \u201cdetailed psychological profiles of patients or substantive accounts of therapy sessions\u201d). See also <em>In re Subpoena Served Upon Zuniga, </em>714 F.2d 632, 640 (6th Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Zuniga </em>v. <em>United States, </em>464 U.S. 983 (1983). Similarly, those portions of the records \u201cpossibly exposing personal relationships of no concern to legitimate investigation\u201d shall remain unavailable. <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Peabody, supra </em>at 820. A psychiatrist need neither keep such records nor disclose them.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">In sum, a judge confronting the competing demands of the right to privacy under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B, and the need to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>supervise the disbursement of Medicaid payments for psychiatric services shall review the psychiatrist\u2019s records. Excerpts of those records which reveal that a patient with a given diagnosis saw the psychiatrist on a certain date for a certain length of time shall be released. The psychiatrist\u2019s observations of objective indicia of emotional disturbance may be released.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Notations of patient prescriptions, blood tests and their results (e.g., lithium carbonate levels), or the administration of electroconvulsive treatment shall be released. Indications of treatment plans (e.g., a recommendation of continuing psychotherapy or of medication) shall be released.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The psychiatrist\u2019s records of patient conversations shall be withheld. The judge may furnish the Commonwealth with a physical description of such notes. The judge might, for example, inform the Commonwealth that the psychiatrist\u2019s record of a particular date includes a one-page, handwritten report of a psychotherapy session, but the substance of that session may not be disclosed. If the medical record is devoid of such notations, the judge may so indicate.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">We vacate the judgment of contempt as well as the disclosure order of the single justice of the Appeals Court. We remand this action to the Superior Court for a hearing on the redaction of Dr. Kobrin\u2019s records consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b301-6\"> The Medicaid fraud control unit of the office of the Attorney General \u201cconducts [its] investigation, in part, by invoking the powers of the grand jury.\u201d <em>In re Grand.

The Commonwealth maintains, therefore, that \u201copen-ended\u201d issues remain. We need not address this argument. The questions raised on this appeal warrant our consideration because they are likely to recur, yet evade review.

L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B, and Federal standards of disclosure that might govern in other contexts such as reviews of the medical necessity and quality of Medicaid services.

The validity of such an inference is questionable because psychiatric records often reflect only the barest outline of the treatment provided. See generally Slovenko, On the Need for Recordkeeping in the Practice of Psychiatry, 7 J. Psychiatry &amp; L. 399 (1979). Psychiatric records \u201care becoming as stereotyped a production as the pleadings of an attorney.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 421-422. Moreover, unrestricted State access to such records may induce psychiatrists to limit their recordkeeping even further to sparse and perfunctory notations. \u201cPsychiatrists may be disinclined to record in their files extremely personal, sensitive confidences of a patient if they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>know those files may be reviewed and copied by state officials at any time. The threat of searches may therefore decrease the likelihood that the very information most valuable to another treating psychiatrist, a history of the patient\u2019s emotional and mental problems, will be available.\u201d <em>Hawaii Psychiatric Soc\u2019y, Dist. Branch of the Am. Psychiatric Soc\u2019y </em>v. <em>Ariyoshi, </em>481 F. Supp. 1028, 1042 (D. Hawaii 1979). See Slovenko, <em>supra </em>at 401-403. In any event, we conclude that notations regarding somatic therapy are not \u201ccommunications\u201d which must be shielded in an investigation of Medicaid fraud. See note 16, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b310-6\"> Somatic therapies are physical treatments such as the provision of medication or electroconvulsive therapy. In its pellucid amicus brief, the Massachusetts Psychiatric Society points out that \u201c[w]here physical services are provided by psychiatrists, just as where they are provided by nonpsychiatric medical doctors, the likelihood that a record of those services will be necessary to document the actual deliverance of Medicaid reimbursement services is substantially greater than it is with respect to records of nonphysical therapy. Moreover, few, if any, private communications need be revealed in these circumstances.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b310-7\"> The Department of Public Welfare may wish to review its regulations regarding documentation of psychiatric services for the purpose of consistency.

The list is not meant to be exhaustive. Similarly, objective acounts of the patient\u2019s past medical and psychiatric histories shall be made available. Such histories may include earlier hospitalizations, treatments, and diagnoses but shall not include patient conversations.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
