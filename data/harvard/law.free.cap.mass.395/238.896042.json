We granted the plaintiffs\u2019 application for further appellate review, and we now disagree with the conclusion of the Appeals Court and affirm the judgment for the plaintiffs entered in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">The central question in this dispute is the extent of authority the Legislature intended to grant to the examiners by using the words \u201cfor light, heat or power purposes\u201d after \u201celectricity\u201d in G.

The plaintiffs argue that the words were meant as a limitation on the examiners\u2019 authority, and that their interpretation is supported by the his<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>tory surrounding the statute and the policies it was designed to further. Alternatively, the plaintiffs contend that they are engaged in the transmission of intelligence by electricity, within the meaning of the exemption created by G. L. c. 141, \u00a7 7.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Appeals Court also rejected this argument. <em>Id. </em>at 27-28. We decide that rule 2.2 exceeds the power granted to the examiners by G. L. c. 141, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">The facts underlying this case are stipulated. The plaintiffs are engaged in the business of installing and maintaining fire and burglar alarm systems in commercial and residential properties in the Commonwealth. Most of the contracts entered into by the plaintiffs include long-term agreements for maintenance, and virtually all of the contracts with commercial customers include monitoring the customers\u2019 premises by a central station which notifies police or fire officials should a break-in or fire occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Essentially, a typical fire alarm system consists of a control box, connected by wire or plug-in transformer to a source of electricity which provides the power to operate the system. This control box is also connected by other wires to the component parts of the system, such as horns, sprinklers, thermostats, smoke detectors, and alarm boxes. The typical burglar alarm system is similar, except that the component parts include such devices as bells, sirens, space detectors, and perimeter detectors. In all modem burglar alarm systems, and about fifty per cent of all fire alarm systems, the control box is connected to a power supply by means of a plug-in transformer, which \u201csteps down\u201d the voltage from normal household current to a lower voltage, similar to that used in telephone wires. The installation of this transformer is performed by a licensed elec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>trician. Similarly, all \u201chard-wiring,\u201d that is, the direct connection of the control box to the live electric wires supplying power, is done by licensed electricians in situations where a plug-in transformer is not used. However, installation of the components of the alarm system is performed by technicians who are not licensed electricians. The wires that these technicians install do not carry electricity until the control box has been connected to a source of power.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">A majority of the individuals and corporations engaged in the business of installing alarm systems do not have electricians\u2019 licenses. Under rule 2.2, they would be required to obtain licenses or to hire licensed electricians in order to continue in business. The plaintiffs\u2019 customers prefer that the plaintiffs\u2019 technicians, rather than licensed electricians, install the component parts and wires of the alarm systems. This is the case not only because installation and maintenance is less expensive that way, but also because the technicians are bonded and heavily insured, due to the confidential information they learn during the course of their work and the consequences of a system failure. The examiners do not require that licensed electricians be either bonded or insured. No claims have ever been filed against any of the plaintiffs for damage or personal injury as the result of the installation of an alarm system in Massachusetts, and the examiners have received no complaints about them.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">In 1969, the examiners amended rule 2.2 to read in its present form, although enforcement was not attempted until 1974. On March 20, 1975, the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction was granted, and on September 11, 1980, rule 2.2 was declared invalid by a judge in the Superior Court. He found that the plaintiffs \u201care not engaged in or working at the business of installing wires, conduits, apparatus, fixtures or other appliances for carrying or using electricity for light, heat, or power purposes.\u201d The judge also found that the plaintiffs were engaged in the transmission of intelligence by electricity, within the meaning of the exemption contained in G. L. c. 141, \u00a7 7. A divided Appeals Court reversed on both grounds. We now decide that rule 2.2 exceeds the powers the Legislature granted to the examiners, and is therefore invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>1. <em>The statute. </em>The starting point of our analysis is the language of the statute, \u201cthe principal source of insight into Legislative purpose.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lightfoot, </em>391 Mass. 718, 720 (1984). In this case, we must determine whether, by using the phrase \u201cfor light, heat or power purposes,\u201d the Legislature intended to emphasize the broad reach of the statute or to narrow its scope. We decide that the phrase was intended to be one of limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">The words \u201clight, heat or power\u201d are not unique to G. L. c. 141, \u00a7 1, and that statute cannot be interpreted properly without an analysis of the context in which the phrase arose. The Legislature originally chose this terminology to describe companies organized for the purpose of generating or selling electricity. In its first definition of an \u201celectric light company,\u201d the Legislature used the words \u201cany corporation organized . . . for the purpose of making or selling electricity only for light, heat or power.\u201d St. 1908, c. 529, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, the term had acquired a specialized legislative meaning, relating to the sale of electric power by utilities, by the time St. 1915, c. 296, \u00a7 1 (now G. L. c. 141, \u00a7 1), was enacted. This court has also used that phrase in the same, specialized sense. See <em>Tax Collector of N. Reading </em>v. <em>Reading, </em>366 Mass. 438, 441 (1974) (\u201cdevelopment of electricity for light, heat, and power by a municipality\u201d); <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>321 Mass. 31, 37-39 (1947); <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Peck, </em>283 Mass. 618, 629 (1933); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>150 Mass. 592, 598 (1890).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>Thus, we should consider the utility context from which the phrase arose when interpreting the words of the statute. As Chief Justice Rugg observed: \u201cStatutes are to be interpreted, not alone according to their simple, literal or strict verbal meaning, but in connection with their development, their progression through the legislative body, the history of the times, prior legislation, [and] contemporary customs and conditions .... General expressions may be restrained by relevant circumstances showing a legislative intent that they be narrowed and used in a particular sense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welosky, </em>276 Mass. 398, 401-402 (1931), cert. denied, 284 U.S. 684 (1932). <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Bohn, </em>377 Mass. 544, 548 (1979). <em>Chipman </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., 366 </em>Mass. 253 , 256 (1974). If a word or phrase has a technical or specialized meaning, this court will adopt that meaning in its construction of the statute. See <em>United States Jaycees </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>391 Mass. 594, 601 (1984); <em>School Comm. of Springfield </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., 362 </em>Mass. 417, 439 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">In the utility context, the words \u201clight, heat or power\u201d are used to describe the purposes of companies supplying electricity which is consumed by other products on the premises of the end user. When it used the words \u201celectricity for light, heat or power purposes\u201d in this statute, the Legislature intended that the <em>purposes </em>for which wires carrying electricity are used must be considered before it can be determined whether the examiners have the authority to regulate that use. Thus, it becomes evident that the Legislature intended to grant power to the examiners only over companies in the business of installing wires which carry or use electricity <em>as a product, </em>for light, heat or power purposes, but not over the infinitely broader spectrum of companies in the business of supplying other products that merely use electricity <em>as a source, </em>for light, heat or power. Alarm system installers do not install wires to carry electricity; they install wires to provide alarm systems. A majority of the Appeals Court concluded that \u201clight,\u201d \u201cheat,\u201d and \u201cpower\u201d are \u201cbut varied manifestations of the same thing,\u201d deriving this observation from the legislative history of another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>bill concerning electric utilities. <em>Simon </em>v. <em>State Examiners of Electricians, supra </em>at 23, quoting 1913 House Doc. No. 1925 at 14. However, this \u201csame thing\u201d is the product supplied by an electric company, not any product that happens to use electricity. In this context, the Legislature\u2019s use of the phrase \u201clight, heat or power\u201d was clearly one of limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">The statutory precursors of G. L. c. 141 also establish that the examiners\u2019 interpretation would render meaningless the words \u201cfor light, heat or power purposes\u201d in G. L. c. 141, \u00a7 1. We have already noted that the Legislature originally used the words \u201clight, heat or power\u201d to define an electric utility in St. 1908, c. 529, \u00a7 1. Several years later, the Legislature consolidated the laws concerning those companies, and, in its new definition of an \u201celectric company,\u201d described it as one \u201corganized ... for the purpose of making . . . and selling . . . electricity.\u201d St. 1914, c. 742, \u00a7 1. The limiting words in the previous definition \u2014 \u201conly for light, heat or power\u201d \u2014 were dropped in favor of the use of a single word, \u201celectricity,\u201d which the Legislature apparently considered more general, more inclusive and more appropriate.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In addition, the Legislature\u2019s use of the word \u201conly\u201d in the 1908 statute substantially undermines the proposition that the words \u201clight, heat or power\u201d were considered by the Legislature to be general terms. Instead, it strongly suggests that a more limited grant of power to the examiners was envisioned by the framers of St. 1915, c. 296 (G. L. c. 141), than that which results from the examiners\u2019 view. In any event, there is no basis for disregarding in this case the principle that \u201cwherever possible, no provision of a legislative enactment should be treated as superfluous.\u201d <em>Casa Loma, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>377 Mass. 231, 234 (1979). <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number><em>Discrimination </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>371 Mass. 186, 190-191 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">2. <em>Subsequent legislative and administrative history. </em>Actions taken by both the examiners and the Legislature since 1915 support this interpretation. The history shows that the examiners themselves were unsure of the extent of their mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">At the outset, it should be recognized that while some respect is due the examiners\u2019 claim of authority under the statute <em>(White Dove, Inc. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Marine Fisheries, </em>380 Mass. 471, 477 [1980]), this case does not involve a contemporaneous and consistent administrative interpretation of the statute. Compare <em>Maria </em>v. <em>State Examiners of Electricians, </em>365 Mass. 551, 552-555 (1974). See <em>School Comm. of </em>Springfield <em>v. Board of Educ., </em>362 Mass. 417,441 n.22 (1972); <em>Cleary </em>v. <em>Cardullo\u2019s, Inc., </em>347 Mass. 337, 343-344 (1964).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Instead, the examiners apparently have never been convinced that regulations such as those involved here were within their statutory mandate. For example, in 1948, the examiners asked the Attorney General whether the wires and apparatus used in television installation constituted the use of \u201celectricity for light, heat or power purposes.\u201d His opinion was that they did not. Rep. A.G., Pub. Doc. No. 12, at 22-23 (1949).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Furthermore, although it is undisputed that substantial use of alarm systems predates the 1915 statute, the examiners never attempted to regulate alarm system installers until 1969, at a time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>when new systems were becoming less, not more, dangerous. As the Supreme Court has observed: \u201cAuthority actually granted by [the Legislature] of course cannot evaporate through lack of administrative exercise. But just as established practice may shed light on the extent of power conveyed by general statutory language, so the want of assertion of power by those who presumably would be alert to exercise it, is equally significant in determining whether such power was actually conferred.\u201d <em>FTC </em>v. <em>Bunte Bros., </em>312 U.S. 349, 352 (1941).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">In 1975, the examiners recommended to the Legislature a bill that would have amended G. L. c. 141, \u00a7 1, to grant express authority over businesses installing wires for carrying \u201celectricity for light, heat or power purposes, <em>or any other purposes as governed in the rules and regulations of the board of fire prevention regulations\u2019'\u2019 </em>(emphasis added). 1975 House Doc. No. 145. This amendment was deemed necessary by the examiners in order to \u201cupdate\u201d and to conduct \u201ca general revision\u201d of the law. 1975 House Doc. No. 144. Its passage would have been interpreted as a legislative approval of rule 2.2, which tracked the statutory language of \u00a7 1, but added \u201cfire alarm and all signal work requiring the use of wire for transmission.\u201d This action by the examiners is a persuasive recognition that they were concerned that \u201clight, heat or power purposes\u201d was not a sufficiently broad grant of authority on which to base rule 2.2, and that the examiners therefore sought to extend their statutory mandate to include the same broad language and policy applicable to the Board of Fire Prevention Regulations.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Legislature was apparently unconvinced that such an expansion of powers was in the public interest, since both branches accepted the report of the House Committee on Government Regulations, stating that the bill \u201cought not to pass.\u201d 1975 House Journal 843, 855 (1976). 1975 Senate Jour<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>nal 807 (1976). Similar bills have been introduced before and after that time; none has been enacted. See 1984 Sen. Doc. No. 542 (proposing \u201clight, heat, power, <em>fire warning or security systems\u201d); </em>1983 Sen. Doc. No. 531 and 1984 Sen. Doc. No. 543 (proposing \u201clight, heat or <em>current consuming purposes\u201d); </em>1983 Sen. Doc. No. 532 and 1984 Sen. Doc. No. 544 (proposing to <em>delete </em>phrase \u201clight, heat or power purposes\u201d); 1973 House Doc. No. 4143 (proposing \u201clight, heat, power, <em>burglar alarm, fire alarm, sprinkler alarm, x-ray equipment, communications systems and signal systems\u201d). </em>While postenactment history is not ordinarily considered as showing legislative disapproval of the rejected amendments <em>(Franklin </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>381 Mass. 611, 616-617 [1980]), it is nevertheless relevant here, where the examiners have expressly stated that their proposed amendments constituted a \u201crevision\u201d of the statute, not merely a clarification of their authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Administrative interpretations are entitled to \u201ca certain degree of weight, but they are not conclusive.\u201d <em>Russo </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>377 Mass. 645, 649 (1979). Little weight is due the examiners\u2019 interpretation, since this legislative and administrative history casts serious doubt on the examiners\u2019 claim of authority here.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">3. <em>Legislative policy. </em>One reason that the Legislature enacted St. 1915, c. 296 (now G. L. c. 141), was to protect the citizens of the Commonwealth from the significant danger posed by the transmission of electric current.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> However, as noted above, this case does not involve the transmission of electricity in the utility context in which the Legislature intended the statute to apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">There is also a substantial question on which the judge made no findings, namely, whether the low-voltage electricity used in alarm systems (or in television, telephone, or computer lines), poses a \u201csignificant danger.\u201d In fact, the likelihood of an accident or injury seems remote. It is agreed that none of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>parties to this case is aware of <em>any </em>instance of damage or injury caused by alarm system installation in this Commonwealth, even though the plaintiff installers in this case have been engaged in their occupation collectively for a total of 197 years. It is undisputed that alarm systems, on the whole, are becoming progressively safer, since newer systems can be efficiently powered by voltage so low that, even according to the examiners\u2019 expert witness, the intensity of a shock would be \u201cslight.\u201d Even some bills that would have granted regulatory authority over this field to the examiners have distinguished between limited voltage alarm systems and high voltage electric power. See, e.g., 1984 Sen. Doc. No. 543; 1983 Sen. Doc. No. 531; 1973 House Doc. No. 4143. Given these circumstances, the examiners\u2019 interpretation is hardly mandated by the legislative policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>The interpretation we adopt is neither an unreasonable construction of the statute nor an emasculation of the examiners\u2019 powers. It is stipulated that licensed electricians perform all \u201chard-wiring\u201d in the installation of alarm systems, that is, they connect the alarm system wires with the live wires that supply the electricity which powers the system. Since \u201chard-wiring\u201d involves installing wires that carry and supply electricity as an end product, it is well within the examiners\u2019 power to regulate. On the other hand, the installation of the component parts of an alarm system only involves supplying a product that uses electricity as a source of power.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Frequently, the installers merely insert a two-pronged plug into a wall receptacle that a licensed electrician has installed. If the examiners have the authority to regulate alarm system installers only because the system has wires that are connected to a source of electricity (often by a simple wall outlet),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the exam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>iners have an equally persuasive claim of power over those who are in the business of supplying, delivering and installing such mundane items as washing machines, televisions, and toasters, since they, too, have wires that are connected to a source of electricity through a wall outlet.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> There is nothing to suggest that the Legislature intended to grant electricians such a legal monopoly.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">The duty of this court is to interpret the statute according to the intent of the Legislature and common sense. We are not simply to provide our imprimatur for regulations that the examiners might be able to defend on an excessively broad reading of the statute. This is especially true in the case now before us, where the statute is penal and must be as strictly construed as a criminal law. <em>Maria </em>v. <em>State Examiners of Electricians, </em>365 Mass. 551, 554 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The examiners\u2019 interpretation of G. L. c. 141, \u00a7 1, is not supported by the language of the statute, the context from which it arose, any consistent administrative interpretation, or the legislative policy on which the statute is based. In other situations, we have not hesitated to reject administrative interpretations that violated the language and policy of the statute. See, e.g., <em>Cardin </em>v. <em>Royal Ins. Co., </em>394 Mass. 450, 456-457 (1985). We reject such an interpretation here, and affirm the judgment entered against the examiners in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Rule 2.2, now codified at 237 Code Mass.

The first reference to these companies using the phrase \u201celectricity for light, heat or power\u201d appears in Revised Laws c. 34, \u00a7 1 (1902).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b260-6\"> The Legislature was aware that this court would be more likely to construe the new definition more broadly than the old, and would have been acting consistently with the principle that \u201ca statutory expression of one thing is an implied exclusion of other things omitted from the statute.\u201d <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>380 Mass. 480,484 (1980), quoting <em>Harborview Residents\u2019 Comm., Inc. </em>v. <em>Quincy Hous.

The plaintiffs\u2019 business involves the installation of electrical wiring connecting horns, sprinklers, alarm boxes, bells, and sirens to a control box, which in turn is connected to an electrical power supply. According to uncontradicted testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>in the Superior Court, sophisticated modem alarm systems perform such functions as overriding elevator control systems, closing electromagnetic doors, and reversing air circulation systems, The purpose of the wiring installed by the plaintiffs is to transmit the electrical power required to sound the horns, bells, and sirens, and to activate the sprinklers and other protective devices. Yet, the court denies that the plaintiffs are \u201cperson[s], firm[s] or corporation^] . . . engage[d] in . . . the business of installing wires ... for carrying . . . electricity for . . . power purposes\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 141, \u00a7 1 (1984 ed.). The court ignores the principle, to which it purports to adhere, <em>ante </em>238, 242, (1985), that \u201c[statutory language is the principal source of insight into Legislative purpose.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lightfoot, </em>391 Mass. 718, 720 (1984). I would hold that the plaintiffs come within the meaning of G. L. c. 141, \u00a7 1, and that, because they are not \u201ccompanies incorporated for the transmission of intelligence by electricity,\u201d they do not come within the exemption from c. 141, provided by c. 141, \u00a7 7. As a consequence, I would further hold, as did the Appeals Court, that Rule 2.2 of the Rules and Regulations of the Board of State Examiners of Electricians is a valid exercise of the examiners\u2019 mie making power granted by G. L. c. 141, \u00a7 2. Any concern of the court, no matter how legitimate it may be, that such a holding would grant electricians a legal monopoly, see <em>ante </em>at 249, does not justify the tortured construction that the court gives the plain language of the statute. If, through G. L. c. 141, \u00a7 1, the Legislature has granted electricians a monopoly, the Legislature may remedy that situation if it chooses to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">The court reasons that, since the Legislature originally used the words \u201clight, heat or power\u201d in legislation governing the sale of electric power by utilities, those words acquired \u201ca specialized legislative meaning, relating to the sale of electric power by utilities.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 242. The court speaks of \u201cthe utility context in which the Legislature intended the statute to apply,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 247, and of the Legislature\u2019s intent \u201cto grant power to the examiners only over companies in the business of installing wires which carry or use electricity <em>as a product, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>for light, heat or power purposes, but not over the infinitely broader spectrum of companies in the business of supplying other products that merely use electricity <em>as a source, </em>for light, heat or power\u201d (emphasis in original). Therefore, stating that \u201c[a]larm system installers do not install wires to carry electricity; they install wires to provide alarm systems,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 243, the court concludes that G. L. c. 141, \u00a7 1, does not apply to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">That reasoning seems to suggest that G. L. c. 141 applies only to those who install wires for the purpose of carrying electricity they have produced, i.e., utilities, and perhaps to their employees. Surely that was not the intent of the Legislature. If the court does not mean that, it must mean, at least, that G. L. c. 141 applies to those in the business of installing electrical wires so that a building will have electrical wiring, but not to those who install electrical wires only in connection with the installation of some other product, like an alarm system. The statutory language does not support such a distinction. Alarm installers install wires \u201cfor carrying electricity for . . . power purposes,\u201d and they get paid to install those wires. Therefore, despite the court\u2019s statement that \u201c[a]larm system installers do not install wires to carry electricity; they install wires to provide alarm systems,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 243, alarm installers are persons \u201cengaged in . . . the business of installing wires ... for carrying . . . electricity for . . . power purposes\u201d as provided by G. L. c. 141, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The court\u2019s decision is not justified by its expressed reluctance to interpret G. L. c. 141 in a way that would result in examiners\u2019 having authority to regulate \u201cthose who are in the business of supplying, delivering and installing such mundane items as washing machines, televisions, and toasters, since they, too, have wires that are connected to a source of electricity through a wall outlet.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 249. The statute prohibits participation without a license in \u201cthe business of installing wires, conduits, apparatus, fixtures or other appliances for carrying or using electricity for light, heat or power purposes.\u201d Plugging an appliance into an outlet is not installation. Running wires between locations in a building, as is typical in burglar and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>fire alarm systems, on the other hand, is installation. \u201c[RJeason and common sense are not to be abandoned\u201d when we interpret statutes, <em>van Dresser </em>v. <em>Firlings, </em>305 Mass. 51, 53 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">To bolster its conclusion, the court improperly relies on actions taken by the examiners since St. 1915, c. 296 (now G. L. c. 141), was enacted. Stating that, \u201cin 1948, the examiners asked the Attorney General whether the wires and apparatus used in television installation constituted the use of \u2018electricity for light, heat or power purposes,\u2019 \u201d <em>ante </em>at 245, and asserting that, in 1975, by introducing legislation designed to amend G. L. c. 141, \u00a7 1, the examiners demonstrated their concern that \u201c Tight, heat or power purposes\u2019 \u201d was not broad enough to authorize rule 2.2, <em>ante </em>at 246, the court concludes that \u201cthe examiners apparently have never been convinced that regulations such as those involved here were within their statutory mandate.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 245. By relying on those actions, the court unwisely ignores our previously expressed policy to \u201cnot draw the inference that the [agency] believed it was without the power requested from the fact that the legislation was introduced. Such an inference would be merely speculative and might serve to chill the agency\u2019s freedom to seek \u2018clarifying legislation on a genuinely debatable point of agency procedure . . . .\u2019 <em>Wong Yang Sung </em>v. <em>McGrath </em>[339 U.S. 33, 47-48, modified, 339 U.S. 908 (1950)]. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v. Woods Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S. Auth., </em>352 Mass. 617, 619-620 (1967).\u201d <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>371 Mass. 186, 194 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Similarly, the court\u2019s reliance on the examiners\u2019 failure to attempt to enforce regulations concerning the installation of alarms until 1969 does not help the court. It may be that advances in alarm technology or other considerations prompted the examiners to exercise that authority for the first time in 1969, but in any event, \u201c[authority actually granted by [the Legislature] . . . cannot evaporate through lack of administrative exercise.\u201d <em>FTC v. Bunte Bros., </em>312 U.S. 349, 352(1941). See <em>Brooks v. Architectural Barriers Bd., </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 584, 588-589 (1982). The examiners now purport to possess <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>the authority to regulate the installation of alarms, and that assertion of authority deserves respect. <em>White Dove, Inc. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Marine Fisheries, </em>380 Mass. 471, 477 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Just as the examiners\u2019 actions lend no support to the court, neither can the failure of recent Legislatures to adopt proposed amendments to G. L. c. 141 lend the court aid. The court infers from the Legislature\u2019s failure to enact several proposed bills that there has been legislative opposition to the examiners\u2019 having the authority they now claim. But that is not a valid inference. \u201c[N]o one knows why the legislature did not pass the proposed measures. . . . The practicalities of the legislative process furnish many reasons for the lack of success of a measure other than legislative dislike for the principle involved in the legislation.\u201d <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Ware, </em>392 Mass. 745, 773 (1984), quoting <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Branner, </em>245 Or. 307, 311 (1966). Furthermore, inquiry into the preference of Legislatures since 1915 is off the mark. The critical issue is what the Legislature that enacted the statute intended \u2014 not what subsequent Legislatures thought of proposed amendments to the statute. Failure of subsequent legislative bodies to adopt proposed amendments \u201c \u2018has no persuasive significance\u2019 with reference to the intent of the Legislature which passed the original bill. <em>Devlin </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>364 Mass. 435, 442-443 (1973). <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wise, </em>370 U.S. 405, 411 (1962). \u2018[T]he views of a subsequent [Legislature] form a hazardous basis for inferring the intent of an earlier one.\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Price, </em>361 U.S. 304, 313 (1960). <em>Wong Yang Sung </em>v. <em>McGrath, </em>339 U.S. 33, 47-48, modified, 339 U.S. 908 (1950). <em>Helvering </em>v. <em>Hallock, </em>309 U.S. 106, 119-121 (1940).\u201d <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., supra </em>at 193-194.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">It is true, as the court states, that G. L. c. 141, \u00a7 5, renders G. L. c. 141 a penal statute, and that, for that reason, we must resolve in favor of criminal defendants any reasonable doubt about the statute\u2019s meaning. But the meaning of the statute is clear. The plaintiffs engage in the business of installing wires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>to carry electricity for power purposes, and therefore they are required to be licensed and to otherwise comply with rule 2.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">I would vacate the judgment entered in the Superior Court, and I would remand the case to that court for the entry of a judgment declaring valid rule 2.2, as codified in 237 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.02 (3) (1981), and declaring G. L. c. 141, \u00a7 7 (1984 ed.), inapplicable to the plaintiffs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
