L. c. 66, \u00a7 10 (1984 ed.). In this case, the plaintiffs (public school teachers in the Braintree school system and officers and members of the Braintree Education Association, another labor union) and the defendants (the MFT and the Supervisor of Public Records for the Commonwealth [supervisor]) cross-appeal from a judgment entered in the Superior Court in Norfolk County. In that judgment, the Superior Court judge granted the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss in part and denied them in part, thereby allowing the disclosure of the school employees\u2019 names and job classifications. Also, the judge granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment in part and denied it in part, thereby permanently enjoining the disclosure of the school employees\u2019 home addresses. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion. We hold that G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10, requires the disclosure of all the information requested: the name, job classification, and home address of each school employee. Accordingly, we direct that the judgment be modified.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b879-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>General Laws c. 66, \u00a7 10, provides, in relevant part: \u201cEvery person having custody of any public record, as defined in clause Twenty-sixth of section seven of chapter four, shall, at reasonable times and without unreasonable delay, permit it, or any segregable portion of a record which is an independent public record, to be inspected and examined by any person, under his supervision, and shall furnish one copy thereof upon payment of a reasonable fee.\u201d The plaintiff school employees argue that their names and home addresses are exempt from disclosure under G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10. They claim that their names <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>and home addresses are not part of a \u201cpublic record,\" as that term is defined byG. L. c. 4, \u00a77, Twenty-sixth <em>(c).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">The plaintiffs do not argue that their names and home addresses do not come within the general definition of public records.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rather, they claim that their names and home addresses fall within one of the statutory exemptions to the definition of a public record. General Laws c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth <em>(c), </em>exempts from the definition of a public record: \u201cpersonnel and medical files or information; also any other materials or data relating to a specifically named individual, the disclosure of which may constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d The plaintiffs claim that their names and home addresses fall within this exemption and so should not be disclosed as a public record under G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10. We hold that public school employees\u2019 names and home addresses do not fall within the exemption of G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">This case is controlled by our holding in <em>Hastings &amp; Sons Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>City Treasurer of Lynn, </em>374 Mass. 812 (1978). See <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>388 Mass. 427, 435 n.13 (1983) (reaffirming the holding in <em>Hastings, supra). </em>In <em>Hastings, </em>we construed the language of G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth (c),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and held that \u201c[t]he names <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>and salaries of municipal employees, including disbursements to policemen for off-duty work details, are not the kind of private facts that the Legislature intended to exempt from mandatory disclosure [under G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth (c)].\u201d <em>Hastings, supra </em>at 818. Our holding required the release of payroll records of municipal employees. Those records contained \u201cthe <em>name, address, </em>base pay, overtime pay, miscellaneous payments, and gross pay of individual municipal employees of Lynn\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 821. Moreover, while <em>Hastings </em>involved an appeal by city police officers from a judgment in the Superior Court, the judgment which we affirmed required the release of the payroll records \u201cof <em>all categories of employees </em>of Lynn\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 815. This included public school employees: the plaintiff in <em>Hastings </em>had requested the disclosure of payroll records \u201cof any and all categories of employees of the City of Lynn, <em>including employees of the School </em>Department\u2019 (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 813.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">There is a clear statutory presumption in favor of disclosure: \u201c[Tjhere shall be a presumption that the record sought is public, and the burden shall be upon the custodian to prove with specificity the exemption which applies.\u201d G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10 (c) (1984 ed.). <em>See. Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Northampton, </em>375 Mass. 127, 131 (1978), and <em>Hastings &amp; Sons Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>City Treasurer of Lynn, supra </em>at 817. In <em>Hastings, supra, </em>\u201cthere was no showing that disclosure of [inter alla, the names and addresses of city employees] would constitute an invasion of personal privacy.\u201d Similarly, in the instant case there were no genuine issues as to any material fact which would indicate that disclosure of the school employees\u2019 names and addresses would invade the school employees\u2019 privacy. Names and home addresses are not \u201c \u2018intimate details\u2019 of a \u2018highly personal\u2019 nature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 818, quoting <em>Getman </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>450 F.2d 670, 675 (D.C. Cir. 1971). <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Collector of Lynn, </em>377 Mass. 151, 157 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>Public employees, by virtue of their public employment, have diminished expectations of privacy. See <em>Hastings, supra </em>at 818-819, and cases cited therein. Moreover, the names and addresses of the school employees are available from other sources. See <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Collector of Lynn, supra. </em>For example, G. L. c. 51, \u00a7\u00a7 4,6,7 (1984 ed.), require the creation of \u201cstreet lists\u201d of all persons residing in the Commonwealth. These street lists, which are publicly available, contain, inter alla, the names, residential addresses, and occupations of the persons listed. G. L. c. 51, \u00a7\u00a7 6, 7. In addition, the names and addresses of all persons who register a car in the Commonwealth are publicly available. G. L. c. 90, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 30 (1984 ed.). Furthermore, telephone directories contain addresses for all persons with publicly listed telephone numbers. Thus, we do not believe that disclosure of the school employees\u2019 names and addresses would invade the privacy of the school employees. Because we so hold, there is no occasion for us to inquire whether any invasion of privacy would be \u201cunwarranted.\u201d G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth (c) (1984 ed.). See note 5, <em>supra.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b883-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>We conclude that the judge below erred in granting summary judgment for the plaintiffs (and denying the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss) on the issue of the home addresses.* *****<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">The case is remanded to the Superior Court, where the judgment is to be modified in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b878-5\"> The procedural history of this case is fairly complex. MFT sent a written request to the superintendent for the name, home address, job classification and assignment of each school employee. The superintendent refused this request. MFT then petitioned the supervisor in accordance with G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10 <em>(b), </em>for a determination whether the records sought were public records. The supervisor found that the information sought was public and ordered the superintendent to release the information to MFT. Before the superintendent released the information, the plaintiffs in this case filed a complaint in the Superior Court in Norfolk County seeking, inter alia, a temporary restraining order preventing the release of the teachers \u2019 names, home addresses, and job classifications to the MFT. A judge issued the requested temporary restraining order. The defendant supervisor filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. A judge of the Superior Court then declined to grant a preliminary injunction against the release of the information, stating: \u201cThe Court is satisfied that the records sought are Public Records within the meaning of M.G.L. c. 66 and do not fall within any exception thereto.\u201d The plaintiffs sought interlocutory review of the order denying the application for tire preliminary injunction before a single justice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>of the Appeals Court. The single justice denied the plaintiffs\u2019 petition for relief; relying on <em>Hastings &amp; Sons Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>City Treasurer of Lynn, </em>374 Mass. 812 (1978), he held that the information sought was public information within the meaning of G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth (1984 ed.). Apparently the superintendent continued to refuse to release the information because eleven days after the single justice issued his order, MFT filed a motion in the Superior Court for an order to release the information in accordance with G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10 <em>{t\u00ed). </em>MFT also filed a <em>motion to </em>dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. The plaintiffs filed a motion to treat the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment and grant \u201cjudgment against the defendants pursuant to MRCP 56 (c).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">A judge of the Superior Court (a judge other than the one who denied the plaintiffs\u2019 application for a preliminary injunction) rendered judgment. He ruled on the defendants\u2019 pending motions to dismiss and the plaintiffs\u2019 motion, which he treated as a motion for summary judgment. He granted the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss with respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 claims concerning names and job classifications and denied the motions with respect to the home addresses. Accordingly, he granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment with respect to the school employees\u2019 home addresses, thereby permanently enjoining the release of the home addresses. After the defendant MFT\u2019s motion for reconsideration was denied without a hearing, defendants MFT and the supervisor and the plaintiff school teachers cross-op-pealed from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">We take special note of the fact that MFT filed a motion for an order to release the information pursuant to G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10 <em>(b), </em>and we consider the case from the perspective of an action to enforce the public records statute. SeeG. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10 <em>(b) </em>(1984 ed.) (permitting \u201cany person requesting a public record\u201d to seek an order from the \u201csupreme judicial or superior court\u201d requiring the custodian of a public record to comply with the disclosure request). In so doing we do not address the question \u201cwhat rights a submitter of information to a governmental entity may have to restrain disclosure of exempt information by that entity. See <em>Chrysler Corp. </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>441 U.S. 281 (1979).\u201d <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>388 Mass. 427, 442 n.24 (1983). This issue has not been fully briefed or argued. <em>Id. </em>at 442 &amp; n.24.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b880-7\"> General Laws c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth, defines the term \u201cpublic records.\" It provides a general definition of a \u201cpublic record\u201d and then lists eleven exemptions. See G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth <em>(a)-(k). </em>\u201cPublic records\u201d are defined generally to \u201cmean all books, papers, maps, photographs, recorded tapes, financial statements, statistical tabulations, or other documentary materials or data, regardless of physical form or characteristics, made or received by any officer or employee of any agency, executive office, department, board, commission, bureau, division or authority of the commonwealth, or of any political subdivision thereof, or of any authority established by the general court to serve a public purpose, unless such materials or data fall within the following exceptions in that they are:. . . .\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b880-8\"> In <em>Hastings, </em>we construed the language of G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth (c), as appearing in St. 1973, c. 1050, \u00a7 1, which exempted from the definition of a public record, inter alla, \u201cdata relating to a specifically named individual, the disclosure of which may constitute an invasion of personal privacy.\u201d The Legislature since has amended this language of G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth (c), to read: \u201cdata relating to a specifically named individual, the disclosure of which may constitute an <em>unwarranted </em>invasion of personal privacy\u201d (emphasis added). St. 1977, c. 691, \u00a7 1. It is the latter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>version of G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth (c), which applies in the present case. The addition of the word \u201cunwarranted\u201d narrows the scope of information which may be exempted under G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth (c). <em>Torres </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>391 Mass. 1, 7 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b882-5\"> The plaintiffs argue that MFT seeks the disclosure of the school employees\u2019 names and home addresses \u201cfor the purely private, commercial interest of labor organizing,\u201d and that MFT\u2019s interest in obtaining the information for a nonpublic purpose should be weighed against the privacy interests of the plaintiffs in their names and home addresses. We need not decide this issue because we hold that the school employees have no privacy interest in their names and home addresses. We note several points regarding the plaintiffs\u2019 argument, however. First, we seriously doubt whether a labor union\u2019s interest in obtaining the names, job classifications, and home addresses of a group of employees can be characterized as a \u201cpurely private, commercial interest.\u201d See generally G. L. c. 150A, \u00a7 1 (1984 ed.), and G. L. c. 150E (1984 ed.). Second, while we have stated that \u201c[ajnalysis under exemption (c) requires a balancing between the seriousness of any invasion of privacy and the public right to know,\u201d <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Collector of Lynn, supra </em>at 156, none of our cases sanctions discrimination among the persons requesting disclosure of public records. On the contrary we have questioned \u201cwhether the Legislature intended a variable definition of \u2018personal data\u2019 and \u2018public records,\u2019 depending on the merits of the information seeker\u2019s need.\u201d <em>Torres </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>391 Mass. 1, 10 (1984). General Laws c. 66, \u00a7 10 <em>(a) </em>(1984 ed.), states that <em>\u201cany person\u201d </em>may examine public records (emphasis supplied). See <em>Bougas </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Lexington, </em>371 Mass. 59, 64 (1976), <em>Direct-Mail Serv., Inc. </em>v. <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles, 296 </em>Mass. 353, 356 (1937), and <em>Cunningham </em>v. <em>Health </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number><em>Officer of Chelsea, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 861, 862 (1979). See also 950 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 32.05 (5) (1983) (prohibiting a custodian of public records from inquiring into the requestor\u2019s reasons for seeking disclosure of records).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">The plaintiffs also claim .that they are entitled to relief under G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 IB (1984 ed.). We do not address this claim because we have stated that G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth (c) \u201citself recognizes an invasion of privacy exemption on a standard more favorable to nondisclosure than G. L. c 214, \u00a7 IB . . . [and that] we need test the judgment only against the exemption of subclause (c).\u201d <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Northampton, supra </em>at 132. See <em>Hastings &amp; Sons Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>City Treasurer of Lynn, supra </em>at 819. <em>School Comm. of Northampton </em>and <em>Hastings </em>were decided under G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth (c), as appearing in St. 1973, c. 1050, \u00a7 1, i.e., the version in effect before the 1977 amendment adding the word \u201cunwarranted\u201d to qualify \u201cinvasion of personal property.\u201d <em>School Comm. of Northampton, supra </em>at 131 n.4. <em>Hastings, supra </em>at 817 n.8. However, we believe that G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth (c), as amended by St. 1977, c. 691, \u00a7 1, continues to set a \u201cstandard more favorable to nondisclosure than G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 IB [which provides a right only against \u2018unreasonable, substantial or serious interference with . . . privacy\u2019].\u201d <em>School Comm. of Northampton, supra </em>at 132. G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 IB.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b883-13\"> The defendant MFT argues that it should be awarded attorneys\u2019 fees under the authority of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F (1984 ed.), because the plaintiffs\u2019 claims \u201cwere wholly insubstantial, frivolous, and not advanced in good faith.\u201d G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F. We decline to order a hearing on attorneys\u2019 fees. In view of the Superior Court judge\u2019s ruling that the school employees\u2019 home addresses were exempt from disclosure, we cannot say that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were \u201cwholly insubstantial, frivolous, and not advanced in good faith.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
