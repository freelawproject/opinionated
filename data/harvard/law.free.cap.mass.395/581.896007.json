A jury found the defendant MBTA liable for negligence and breach of warranty resulting in the death of Michael Ferragamo. The judge granted the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict only with respect to those counts sounding in breach of warranty. Both parties appealed. We reverse the judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the breach of warranty claims, and affirm the judgment on the negligence claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">The jury could have found the facts to be as follows. In June, 1976, the defendant sent Paul Ferragamo an invitation to bid on eight trolley cars, no longer being used in the subway system.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Paul Ferragamo, as the successful bidder, signed a contract of sale which described the items purchased as \u201c8-scrap P.C.C. Cars complete \u2018As is\u2019 Where is.\u201d The contract further provided that \u201c[a]ll property listed herein is offered for sale \u2018as is\u2019 and \u2018where is\u2019 and without recourse against the Authority. The Authority makes no guaranty, warranty, or representation, express or implied, as to the quantity, kind, character, quality, weight, size or description of any of the property . .</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">. .\u201d The purchaser was to be \u201csolely responsible for all injuries to persons or damage to property occurring on account of, or in connection with\u201d dismantling the cars and removing them from MBTA premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">Car No. 3298, one of the eight cars purchased by Paul Ferragamo, had been \u201cinvolved in [a] fire at the Kenmore Square M.B.T.A. station in July of 1975.\u201d The jury could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>have found that as a result of the fire, forty-five firemen, several passengers, and a number of MBTA employees had been treated for possible exposure to polyvinyl chloride (PVC) fumes;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that a chemist had determined that there was some \u201c25.7 lbs. of PVC compound\u201d in \u201cthe area of the fire\u201d; and that Car No. 3298 was covered with drippings of melted plastic.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">It was one year after the fire that Paul Ferragamo engaged his twenty year old brother, the decedent, to assist in dismantling the eight trolley cars at the defendant\u2019s Watertown yard. The decedent completed work on the first two cars without incident. The plaintiff and the decedent began to dismantle Car No. 3298 during the week of August 8, 1976. They first cleared the debris from the car and scraped off as much of the plastic drippings as possible, whereupon the decedent proceeded to cut through the remaining plastic with an acetylene torch. Wearing a dust mask only intermittently, the decedent cut the car from Monday through Friday in very hot weather. His voice became progressively more hoarse during the week and he experienced considerable shortness of breath and a sore throat. On the morning of August 16, 1976, the decedent was gasping for breath in his sleep. He was then taken by ambulance to the hospital where he died shortly thereafter \u201cas a result of acute respiratory failure.\u201d On the day following his brother\u2019s death, Paul Ferragamo spoke with the MBTA foreman at the Watertown yard and told him about the death. Paul Ferragamo was then informed for the first time that \u201cthere was something wrong with that car, that there had been PVC near it or in it</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">The plaintiff filed this action on July 11,1978. The complaint embraced four counts. In Counts I and HI, the plaintiff sought damages for the decedent\u2019s wrongful death and conscious suffering occurring as a result of the defendant\u2019s negligence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>Counts II and IV sought damages on a theory of breach of warranty.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On May 6, 1983, a jury returned verdicts for the plaintiff on all four counts while finding the decedent contributorily negligent by thirty-five percent on the two negligence counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">On May 16, 1983, the MBTA moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdicts. The judge allowed the motion as to Counts II and IV \u2014 the warranty counts \u2014 but denied the MBTA\u2019s motion as to Counts I and HI \u2014 the negligence counts. He ruled \u201cthat on the facts in this case the defendant MBTA is not a \u2018Merchant\u2019 as that term is defined in M.G.L.A. Chap. 106, Sec. 2-104 (1). Since the defendant is not a \u2018merchant\u2019 the provisions of M.G.L.A. Chap. 106, Sec. 2-314 do not apply and there was no implied warranty that the car in question was fit for the ordinary purpose for which it was sold.\u201d The judge further held that although \u201c[t]he evidence on this question is slight,\u201d there was \u201cenough to warrant a jury to find that PVC was present on or in the car; that this presence was known or should have been known to the defendant and imposed on the defendant a duty to warn of the danger involved in cutting up the car with an acetylene torch.\u201d Both parties then filed notices of appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We transferred the matter to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">On appeal, the plaintiff argues that the MBTA is a merchant, for purposes of the implied warranty of merchantability set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>forth in G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-314 (1) (1984 ed.),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that the verdicts on the breach of warranty claims must thus be reinstated. The defendant contends that the trial court judge ruled correctly; that even if the MBTA were a merchant, the disclaimers in the contract of sale were effective; that the jury\u2019s special finding of comparative negligence ought either to bar the plaintiff\u2019s recovery for breach of warranty or to reduce that recovery by a factor proportionate to the decedent\u2019s negligence; and that, in any event, there was insufficient evidence for the jury to find that PVC was present on or in Car No. 3298 at the time Michael Ferragamo worked on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">1. <em>The MBTA\u2019s status as a \u201cmerchant.\u201d </em>The parties do not dispute that the MBTA may not be held liable for breach of an implied warranty of merchantability under G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-314 (1), unless the MBTA is a \u201cmerchant,\u201d within the meaning of the statute. The MBTA maintains, in essence, that because its sales of used trolley cars are \u201cincidental\u201d to its primary business as a matter of law, it cannot be viewed as a merchant of scrap trolley cars. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">The judge submitted the question whether \u201cthe M.B.T.A. was a merchant with respect to the sale of Car 3298\u201d to the jury.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Only in his memorandum of decision on the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict did he role that, as a matter of law, the MBTA was not a merchant. That ruling was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">The definition of \u201cmerchant\u201d is set forth at G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-104 (1) (1984 ed.): \u201c\u2018Merchant\u2019 means a person who deals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>in goods of the kind or otherwise by his occupation holds himself out as having knowledge or skill peculiar to the practices or goods involved in the transaction or to whom such knowledge or skill may be attributed by his employment of an agent or broker or other intermediary who by his occupation holds himself out as having such knowledge or skill.\u201d Further, a warranty of merchantability under G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-314, is implied only \u201cif the seller is a merchant with respect to goods of that kind.\u201d \u201cObviously this qualification restricts the implied warranty to a much smaller group than everyone who is engaged in business and requires a professional status as to particular kinds of goods.\u201d G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-104, comment 2, at 190 (Law. Coop. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Thus, the dual requirements of G. L. c. 106, \u00a7\u00a7 2-104 (1) and 2-314, lead us to ask whether there was evidence that the MBTA \u201cregularly deals in goods of the kind involved or otherwise has a professional status with regard to the goods involved such that [it] could be expected to have specialized knowledge or skill peculiar to those goods.\u201d <em>Crooper </em>v. <em>Rego Distribution Center, Inc., </em>542 F. Supp. 1142, 1154 (D. Del. 1982). Moreover, that inquiry \u201cis of necessity highly dependent on the factual setting of the transaction in question. Consequently, whether a person is a merchant is to be determined according to the circumstances of each case.\u201d 1 R.A. Anderson, Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 2-104:25 (3d ed. 1981). Particularly with respect to the seller of used equipment is such a determination contingent on the factual background. See <em>id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 2-104:29 \u2014 2-104:45. We conclude that the instant circumstances warranted the jury\u2019s determination that the MBTA is a merchant with respect to its sales of used trolley cars.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">The jurors could have found the following facts: First, the MBTA stipulated that it \u201csells almost all of its old M.B.T.A. trolley cars for scrap.\u201d Second, the MBTA had solicited a bid from the plaintiff, among others, on the eight trolley cars to be sold. Third, the eight trolley cars were purchased by the MBTA in 1951 and were operated and repaired by MBTA employees for approximately twenty-five years. Fourth, MBTA agents had originally designed the cars which were then built to their specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>This concatenation of facts and the reasonable inferences drawn from them permitted the jury to find that the MBTA is a merchant with respect to used trolley cars. \u201cThe term \u2018merchant\u2019 . . . roots in the Taw merchant\u2019 concept of a professional in business. The professional status under the definition may be based upon specialized knowledge as to the goods . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-104, comment 2, at 189 (Law. Coop. 1984). \u201cProfessionalism, special knowledge and commercial experience are to be used in determining whether a person in a particular situation is to be held to the standards of a merchant.\u201d <em>Decatur Coop. Ass\u2019n v. Urban, </em>219 Kan. 171,176-177 (1976). \u201c[T]he test is whether a person is so experienced and knowledgeable under the circumstances that he should be charged with the more substantial burden imposed upon a merchant\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Sea Harvest, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rig &amp; Crane Equip. Corp., </em>181 N.J. Super. 41, 48 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Here, the MBTA was highly \u201cexperienced and knowledgeable\u201d with respect to the goods involved. The MBTA had, through its employees, a long-term and thorough acquaintance with the cars sold to the plaintiff: MBTA employees had contributed to the manufacture of the cars,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and had operated, repaired, refurbished, and maintained them for twenty-five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>years.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The MBTA asserts that is cannot be a merchant because its principal business is solely the \u201coperation of a mass transportation system\u201d \u2014 not the sale of scrap. But while the MBTA may not be a merchant of scrap, there was sufficient evidence to conclude that it was a merchant of used trolley cars. Its supervision of a mass transit system implies professional expertise with respect to the medium of transit, namely trolley cars.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Indeed, by virtue of its very assertion that its business is the \u201coperation of a mass transportation system,\u201d the MBTA \u201cby [its] occupation holds [itself] out as having knowledge or skill peculiar to the . . . goods involved in the transaction.\u201d G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-104 (1). See 1 R.A. Anderson, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 2-104:17.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">The MBTA next maintains that \u201c[t]he fact that [it] occasionally sells its old trolley cars for scrap does not render the MBTA a merchant of scrap goods.\u201d But \u201cthe fact that a person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>is not in the business of buying and selling a particular kind of goods does not mean that he is not a merchant with respect to such goods.\u201d 1 R.A. Anderson, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 2-104:14. The only apparent sine qua non of merchant status under G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-314 (1), is that the sale at issue not be \u201can isolated sale of goods.\u201d G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-314, comment 3, at 466 (Law. Coop. 1984). It appears from the record that the MET A sold off its discarded cars; and, although the record does not reflect the number of occasions on which those cars were sold, the jurors could have inferred that the instant sale was not an isolated transaction. Thus, the sporadicity of sales does not vitiate the jurors\u2019 conclusion that the META is a merchant. Because the META possessed specialized knowledge of trolley cars, and because the transaction was not an isolated sale, we conclude that the jury could determine that the META was a merchant with respect to used trolley cars.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">2. The <em>effect of the disclaimers. </em>The judge stated that \u201c[i]f [G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-316] has any relevancy to the negligence issue I rule that the decedent employee not being a party to the contract of sale of the car involved is not bound by the terms of the contract.\u201d In view of our conclusion that the META is a merchant under G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-314 (1), the effect of the disclaimers present in the contract of sale is now indeed relevant. The defendant argues \u201cthat warranty disclaimers should apply against any person entitled to bring an action for damages against a seller under [G. L. c. 106,] \u00a7 2-318.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The MBTA thus asserts that because it sold the trolley cars \u201cas is,\u201d the plaintiff\u2019s breach of warranty claims are effectively barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>We reject this reasoning. We assume, without deciding, that the disclaimer here at issue fully satisfied the requirements of G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-316.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The narrow question is whether such a disclaimer necessarily precludes an action in breach of warranty against the seller by the buyer\u2019s employee who has suffered a personal injury. We conclude that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Section 2-316 of G. L. c. 106 \u201cdoes not undertake, nor does any other section of the [Uniform Commercial Code] undertake, to specify who shall and who shall not be bound by an exclusion of warranties which meets the requirements of section 2-316.\u201d <em>Velez </em>v. <em>Craine &amp; Clark Lumber Corp., </em>33 N.Y.2d 117, 124 (1973). The general rule is that \u201c[t]he employee of the buyer is not bound by a disclaimer of warranties in the sales contract.\u201d 3 R.A. Anderson, Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 2-316:56 (3d ed. 1983). The rationale supporting that rule is sound. \u201cThe reasoning is that disclaimers are a subject of agreement, and not binding on one not party to the agreement. The dual origin of warranty, in both tort and contract law, has been a powerful argument in eliminating the privity requirement, but it has not been alluded to in disposing of the effect on third parties of disclaimer provisions.\u201d 2A L.R. Framer &amp; M.I. Friedman, Products Liability \u00a7 19.07[4], at 5-199 (1984). But more than the absence of agreement between the buyer\u2019s employee who sustains a personal injury and the seller of the defective product is the fact that a disclaimer is irrelevant in an action which, although framed as one for breach of warranty, is based on strict tort liability. See L.R. Framer &amp; M.I. Friedman, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 19.07[4], 5-200. \u201cThe Legislature has made the Massachusetts law of warranty congruent in nearly all respects with the principles expressed in Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 402A (1965).\u201d <em>Back </em>v. <em>Wickes Corp., </em>375 Mass. 633, 640 (1978). \u201cWe see no necessity to labor the point that, intheab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>sence of special circumstances not present here, buyer and seller cannot contract to limit the seller\u2019s exposure under strict products liability to an innocent user or bystander.\u201d <em>Velez </em>v. <em>Craine &amp; Clark Lumber Corp., supra </em>at 125. Accordingly, the disclaimer in the sales contract between the MBTA and the plaintiff is inapplicable in the circumstances of this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">3. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>The MBTA next urges that the \u201cplaintiff failed to produce more than \u2018a mere scintilla\u2019 of evidence\u201d that Michael Ferragamo\u2019s death was caused by the presence of PVC on or in Car No. 3298, and that a directed verdict for the MBTA therefore was required on all counts. See <em>Hartmann </em>v. <em>Boston Herald-Traveler Corp., </em>323 Mass. 56, 59 (1948). We have reviewed the record in its entirety and discern no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">In determining whether the jury should have been allowed to decide the issue of negligence, \u201c[t]he question is whether the evidence, construed most favorably to the plaintiff, could not support a verdict for the plaintiff. <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Carlisle, </em>328 Mass. 25 (1951). More specifically, the test has been stated as whether \u2018anywhere in the evidence, from whatever source derived, any combination of circumstances could be found from which a reasonable inference could be drawn in favor of the plaintiff.\u2019 <em>Raunela </em>v. <em>Hertz Corp., </em>361 Mass. 341, 343 (1972). That the inferences be reasonable requires that they be based on \u2018probabilities rather than possibilities\u2019 and not the result of \u2018mere speculation and conjecture.\u2019 <em>Alholm </em>v. <em>Wareham, </em>371 Mass. 621, 627 (1976).\u201d <em>Poirier </em>v. <em>Plymouth, </em>374 Mass. 206, 212 (1978). <em>Accord Abraham </em>v. <em>Woburn, </em>383 Mass. 724, 727-728 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">We agree with the judge\u2019s own observation that the evidence, although \u201cslight,\u201d sufficed to permit the jury to find that the decedent died as a result of exposure to toxic fumes released when he burned through PVC present on or in Car No. 3298. First, the plaintiff introduced an internal memorandum of the MBTA dated July 29, 1975, stating that a company chemist had \u201cdetermined that in the area of the fire, which is about 200 feet in scope, there was 25.7 lbs. of PVC compound.\u201d Second, the plaintiff testified that, after the death of his brother, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>he was told by one MBTA supervisor \u201cthat there was something wrong with that car, that there had been PVC near it or in it\u201d and that a second foreman \u201casked me didn\u2019t we know anything about the plastics in the car.\u201d Last, one expert witness testified as follows: \u201cThe cause of death is most likely polyvinyl chloride intoxication. I think in a young person who\u2019s been healthy like this, and then exposed to something like this, who develops the very classic symptoms of polyvinyl chloride toxicity, that that is the likely cause of death.\u201d Another expert witness stated: \u201cI\u2019d say PVC poisoning is the only logical or likely one, the only sensible explanation in this case.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Given this evidence, the jury reasonably could have found that only the presence of PVC on or in Car No. 3298 at the time the decedent worked on it could account for the rapid deterioration and sudden death of this previously healthy twenty year old and that PVC had been deposited in or on Car No. 3298 as a result of the MBTA fire in 1975. \u201cAs long as the jury\u2019s verdict is supported by reasonable inferences, we will not substitute our interpretation of the facts for theirs.\u201d <em>Abraham </em>v. <em>Woburn, supra </em>at 730.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">4. <em>The relationship between the decedent\u2019s comparative negligence and the breach of warranty claims. </em>Finally, the MBTA maintains that the jury \u2019 s special finding that Michael Ferragamo was 35% negligent was tantamount to a finding of unreasonable use or misue thereby barring the plaintiff from recovery. Alternatively, according to the defendant, that recovery ought to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>be reduced in proportion to the decedent\u2019s degree of negligence. The MBTA\u2019s position directly contravenes the principles set forth in <em>Correia </em>v. <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>388 Mass. 342 (1983). There we held that \u201cthe plaintiff in a warranty action under G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-314, may not recover if it is found that, after discovering the product\u2019s defect and being made aware of its danger, he nevertheless proceeded unreasonably to make use of the product and was injured by it. No recovery by the plaintiff shall be diminished on account of any other conduct which might be deemed contributorily negligent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 357. Nowhere in the record is there the least indication that the decedent discovered the defect in Car No. 3298, was aware of its danger, yet proceeded unreasonably to dismantle the car. For the defect lay not in the mere fact that Car No. 3298 had been damaged in a fire \u2014 a fact observable, by all accounts, on inspection \u2014 but in the unseen presence of a potentially lethal chemical. Thus, the decedent\u2019s negligence did not meet the threshold such that his \u201cconduct alone [would be] the proximate cause of his injuries, as a matter of law, and recovery . . . appropriately denied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">We reverse the judgment which the judge entered notwithstanding the verdict on Counts II and IV, and remand the case to the Superior Court for the entry of judgment on those counts for the plaintiff. The judgment on Counts I and III is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b598-11\"> The parties stipulated to the fact that \u201c[t]he M.B.T.A. sells almost all of its old M.B.T.A. trolley cars for scrap.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b599-7\"> According to one expert witness, polyvinyl chloride is \u201ca material that is used widely in synthetic materials and specifically in plastics,\u201d and, which, on thermal degradation, releases hydrogen chloride gas. That gas \u201cin high enough doses, in a high enough concentration, . . . will cause serious lung damage in practically everybody that inhales it.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b600-7\"> The complaint alleged a breach both of an implied warranty of merchantability and of an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. The judge charged the jury on both types of warranty, but the special verdicts on Counts II and IV did not distinguish between the two. In his memorandum of decision on the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the judge stated that there was no \u201cevidence on the part of the plaintiff that the buyer relied \u2018on the seller\u2019s skill or judgment to select or furnish suitable\u2019 cars.\u201d G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-315. The plaintiff does not challenge that ruling on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b600-8\">In response to the plaintiff\u2019s motion for reconsideration, on August 3, 1983, the judge affirmed his \u201caction in granting the defendant\u2019s\u201d motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict as to Counts II and IV of the complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b601-8\">General Laws c. 106, \u00a7 2-314 (1), provides in relevant part: \u201cUnless excluded or modified by section 2-316, a warranty that the goods shall be merchantable is implied in a contract for their sale if the seller is a merchant with respect to goods of that kind.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b601-9\"> The judge approached the question of the MBTA\u2019s merchant status as a mixed question of law and fact, and we review the question on that basis. We leave open the possibility that, in other circumstances, the determination of merchant status might constitute solely an issue of law. See, e.g., <em>County of Milwaukee </em>v. <em>Northrop Data Syss., </em>602 F.2d 767, 771 (7th Cir. 1979); <em>Cudahy Foods Co. </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>55 N.C.

We had a team at that time. We have a group, a team, and I was one of that group.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-11\">Q. \u201cAnd did you prepare some sort of design drawings for the Presidential Conference Cars?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-12\">A. \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-13\">Q. \u201cWould you, for the jury\u2019s benefit, would you give them a bit of history of the M.B.T.A.\u2019s acquisition of the PCC cars in the late forties and early fifties?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-14\">A. \u201cWell, the cars that we were operating were quite old, and we saw fit to make us \u2014 update out system, and that\u2019s what we did. We prepared specifications, and we proceeded to have people build the cars.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b604-6\"> Another employee of the MBTA testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-7\">Q: \u201cCan you tell me what your responsibilities have been over the last 15 or 20 years on the T?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-8\">A: \u201cI\u2019ve been working on the old streetcars, what we call the PCC\u2019s for the past 20 years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-9\">Q: \u201cAnd can you give the jury an explanation of the kinds of things that were done to these \u2014 to this car, as well as the others in that series, over the period of time since they were bought by the T?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-10\">A: \u201cWell, one of the major overhauls began in 1961 after they were ten years old. They were taken to our Everett shops for overhauling, reconditioning. They painted the exterior and interior on them. Laid new tile, mbber tile flooring, wall to wall, and \u00e1t a later date, they started installing the fiberglass seats in them. They overhauled the electrical and air components on those cars, installed new motors, new wheels, and then they were returned to our reservoir car house where I was inspector foreman.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b604-11\"> The MBTA cites several cases for the proposition that incidental sales of used equipment do not place the seller in the position of a merchant underG. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-314(1). See, <em>e.g.,Bruce v.Martin-Marietta Corp., </em>544 F.2d 442 (10th Cir. 1976) (airline not a merchant in isolated sale of a used aircraft which it neither designed, manufactured, nor altered); <em>Joyce </em>v. <em>Combante/Longwood, </em>405 So. 2d 1358 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1981) (bank making occasional sales of repossessed automobiles not a merchant); <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Nicole, Inc., </em>172 N.J. Super. 442 (1980) (seller of amusement ride not a merchant where he lacked specialized knowledge or skill peculiar to goods involved). In each of these cases, the seller lacked the professional expertise, with respect to the goods sold, which the MBTA possesses in the instant circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b605-6\"> General Laws c. 106, \u00a7 2-318 (1984 ed.), provides in relevant part: \u201cLack of privity between plaintiff and defendant shall be no defense in any action brought against the manufacturer, seller, lessor or supplier of goods to recover damages for breach of warranty, express or implied, or for negligence, although the plaintiff did not purchase the goods from the defendant if the plaintiff was a person whom the manufacturer, seller, lessor or supplier might reasonably have expected to use, consume or be affected by the goods. A manufacturer, seller, lessor or supplier may not exclude or limit the operation of this section.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b606-6\"> Subsection (3) <em>(a) </em>of G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-316 (1984 ed.), is pertinent to the instant action: \u201c[U]nless the circumstances indicate otherwise, all implied warranties are excluded by expressions like \u2018as is,\u2019 \u2018with all faults\u2019 or other language which in common understanding calls the buyer\u2019s attention to the exclusion of warranties and makes plain that there is no implied warranty. ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b608-7\"> On appeal the MBTA has not briefed or argued error in the admission of the experts\u2019 testimony. That issue therefore is deemed waived. Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 919 (1975). See <em>Wolfberg </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>385 Mass. 390, 391 n.1 (1982). The MBTA does argue that the plaintiff\u2019s experts did not have firsthand knowledge of what was in or near the car and that they did not conduct any tests or analyses of the car. The basis of the experts\u2019 opinions, however, goes to the weight of the evidence, not its sufficiency. The fact that the MBTA had an expert who said there was no PVC in Car No. 3298 in August, 1976, does not require the trial judge or this court to rule that the plaintiff\u2019s case, therefore, was insufficient as a mater of law. \u201cSuch testimony, with the weight and credibility of which we are not concerned, went no farther than to present an issue in the tribunal of fact.\u201d <em>Woronka </em>v. <em>Sewall, </em>320 Mass. 362, 367 (1946).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
