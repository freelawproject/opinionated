G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5, Seventeenth C (1984 ed.).* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiffs claim that the ten-year waiting period is an unconstitutional infringement of their right to travel. A judge of the Superior Court agreed and ordered that all class members be granted the abatement regardless of the length of time they have owned their homes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Commissioner of Revenue (Commissioner) appealed, and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The facts are as follows. The named plaintiffs, John and Catherine Lee, are both over the age of seventy. From 1943 to 1977, they owned and occupied a two-story, eight-room house in Springfield. In 1977, the Lees sold that house to a son and his wife, and purchased their present one-story, five-room house, also located in Springfield. The Lees have assets of less than $40,000, exclusive of their present home, which is assessed at 100% valuation of $42,600. On September 28, 1982, the Lees applied to the board of assessors of Springfield for a property tax abatement under G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5, Seven<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>teenth C (1984 ed.), which was denied. The Lees met all the requirements of that statute, except they have not owned and occupied their present home for the requisite ten-year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">The Lees then instituted this suit in Superior Court, on their own behalf as well as on behalf of all those similarly situated, claiming that the durational requirement of cl. Seventeenth C is an unconstitutional infringement of their right to travel.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On March 8, 1984, the judge found that the statute has an impact on the \u201cability of the plaintiffs to obtain the necessities of life.\u201d Finding this impact \u201csignificant,\u201d and the right to travel \u201cfundamental,\u201d the judge held that the durational requirement was subject to review by the \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d test, and therefore could be upheld only on a showing of a compelling State interest in that requirement. Finding no such State interest in this case, the judge held that the ten-year period \u201cpenalizes the fundamental right of interstate travel protected by the United States and Massachusetts constitutions,\u201d and therefore that it was unconstitutional. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Although the Supreme Court has not held that the right to travel protected by the United States Constitution is applicable when only intrastate rights are involved, we assume, for the purposes of discussion, that the statute in question affects that right. \u201cThe right to travel and to move from one state to another has long been accepted, yet both the nature and the source of that right have remained obscure.\u201d <em>Zobel </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>457 U.S. 55, 60 n.6 (1982). Nevertheless, the Supreme Court has generally reviewed right to travel cases under a standard similar to that applied to equal protection claims. <em>Id. </em>(right to travel involves \u201clittle more than a particular application of equal protection analysis\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 67 (Brennan, J., concurring) (\u201cright to travel achieves its most forceful expression in the context of equal protection analysis\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In equal protection cases, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>classification involving a suspect group or a fundamental right must be supported by a compelling State interest. Cases not involving a suspect group or fundamental right need be supported only by a rational or conceivable basis. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>374 Mass. 5, 21 (1977), and cases cited. While the right to travel is considered a fundamental right (see, e.g., <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Helms, </em>452 U.S. 412, 418 [1981]), not every statute that affects the right to travel must be supported by a compelling State interest. Only those classifications that serve to <em>penalize </em>the exercise of that right are tested on that strict scrutiny basis. See <em>Memorial Hosp. </em>v. <em>Maricopa County, </em>415 U.S. 250, 256 (1974); <em>Shapiro </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>394 U.S. 618, 634 &amp; 638 n.21 (1969). See also <em>Milton </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>365 Mass. 368, 371 (1974). As the Supreme Court itself has realized, however, \u201c[t]he amount of impact [on the right to travel] required to give rise to the compelling-state-interest test was not made clear.\u201d <em>Memorial Hosp. </em>v. <em>Maricopa County, supra </em>at 256-257. See <em>Milton </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The determination whether a particular statute imposes a \u201cpenalty\u201d on the right to travel includes something more than merely deciding whether the statute denies some other fundamental right or the \u201cnecessities of life.\u201d <em>Zobel </em>v. <em>Williams, supra </em>at 64 &amp; n. 11. To determine what level of scrutiny to apply, courts have generally focused on the \u201cnature of the benefit denied.\u201d <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Reiser, </em>610 F.2d 629, 635 (9th Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 447 U.S. 930 (1980). Only those statutes resulting in some significant effect on the right to travel will be deemed \u201cpenalties.\u201d Examples of such \u201cpenalties\u201d include a one-year residency requirement to receive welfare benefits <em>(Shapiro </em>v. <em>Thompson, supra); </em>a one-year residency requirement to exercise the right to vote <em>(Dunn </em>v. <em>Blumstein, </em>405 U.S. 330 [1972]); a one-year residency requirement to receive free nonemergency medical care <em>(MemorialHosp. </em>v. <em>Maricopa County, supra); </em>a two-year residency requirement to use the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>State\u2019s courts for divorce <em>(Fiorentino </em>v. <em>Probate Court, </em>365 Mass. 13 [1974]). Less significant impositions on the right to travel have been upheld when supported by a rational or conceivable basis. See, <em>e.g., Milton </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, supra </em>(preferential civil service treatment for one-year residents); <em>Hawaii Boating Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Water Transp. Facilities Div., </em>651 F.2d 661 (9th Cir. 1981) (lower mooring rates for one-year residents); <em>Kuhn </em>v. <em>Vergiels, </em>558 F. Supp. 24 (D. Nev. 1982) (financial assistance for professional school predicated on five-year residence); <em>Sturgis </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>368 F. Supp. 38 (W.D. Wash.), aff\u2019d mem., 414 U.S. 1057 (1973) (lower tuition rates at State colleges for one-year residents); <em>Starns </em>v. <em>Malkerson, </em>326 F. Supp. 234 (D. Minn. 1970), aff\u2019d mem., 401 U.S. 985 (1971) (same).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, \u201ca restriction based on residency does not warrant strict scrutiny merely because it impinges to some extent on the right to travel.\u201d <em>Matter of Frazier, </em>594 F. Supp. 1173, 1181 (E.D. La. 1984), citing <em>Memorial Hosp. </em>v. <em>Maricopa County, supra </em>at 256. See <em>Soto-Lopez </em>v. <em>New York City Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>755 F.2d 266, 278 (2d Cir. 1985) (\u201cMerely having an effect on travel is not sufficient to raise an issue of constitutional dimension\u201d); <em>Philadelphia Lodge No. 5, Fraternal Order of Police </em>v. <em>Philadelphia, </em>599 F. Supp. 254, 258 (E.D. Pa. 1984) (only \u201cunreasonable burdens\u201d are penalties). This is simply an accommodation to common sense, for \u201c[a]ny expense imposed on citizens crossing state lines but not imposed on those staying put could theoretically be deemed a penalty on travel; the toll exacted from persons crossing from Delaware to New Jersey by the Delaware Memorial Bridge is a \u2018penalty\u2019 on interstate travel in the most literal sense of all.\u201d <em>Memorial Hosp. </em>v. <em>Maricopa County, supra </em>at 284 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). <em>See Huffman </em>v. <em>Montana Supreme Court, </em>372 F. Supp. 1175, 1182 (D. Mont.), aff\u2019d mem., 419 U.S. 955 (1974). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>In our view, the right to the real estate tax abatement at issue here simply does not rise to a level of interference with the right to travel that would justify the application of strict scrutiny. The plaintiffs have no right to a particular rate of taxation, and \u201cStates have large leeway in making classifications and drawing lines which in their judgment produce reasonable systems of taxation.\u201d <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Vermont, </em>472 U.S. 14, 22 (1985), quoting <em>Lehnhausen </em>v. <em>Lake Shore Auto Parts Co., </em>410 U.S. 356, 359 (1973). The State action in question here does not affect the right to travel in any significant way. It does not interfere with the \u201cvitality of the principle of free interstate migration.\u201d <em>Zobel </em>v. <em>Williams, supra </em>at 67 (Brennan, J., concurring). It does not have a significant impact on the \u201cnecessities of life\u201d <em>(Shapiro </em>v. <em>Thompson, supra </em>at 627), or on any other right or privilege. Nor are the plaintiffs in this case members of a group unable to protect their interests through the political process, the historical justification for the application of strict scrutiny. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Carolene Prods. Co., </em>304U.S. 144, 152-153 n.4 <em>(1938); Sklarv. Byrne, </em>727 F.2d 633, 639 n.8 (7th Cir. 1984). Therefore, we must determine whether the statutory classification is supported by a rational basis. We conclude that G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5, Seventeenth C, meets that test.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The Commissioner states that the local option abatement provisions of cl. Seventeenth C were enacted by St. 1981, c. 743, \u00a7 1, in response to inflationary increases in real estate values occurring in the 1970\u2019s, which led to increases in real estate tax assessments. The Legislature rationally could have concluded that persons over the age of seventy, many of whom are retired and who depend on fixed incomes, might have difficulty meeting these higher tax assessments. This problem has, if anything, been compounded by substantial increases in real estate values unrelated to inflation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Of course, elderly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>persons who <em>choose </em>to move to new, perhaps smaller and lower value, homes after they have retired and after their children have grown will receive the appreciated value of their home at the time of sale, which in most cases would reimburse them for any previous rise in real estate taxes. That is exactly the choice that the named plaintiffs in this case have made. However, the Legislature could have determined that some elderly persons, perhaps many, would greatly prefer to remain in their present homes. That class of persons is burdened with increasing real estate taxes not offset by a concomitant increase in their income, or by a recapture of the appreciated value by sale of the property. By easing their tax burden, the Legislature has attempted to make the option of remaining in their homes a more feasible one. We cannot say that cl. Seventeenth C is an irrational way to address this problem.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Indeed, it is apparent that cl. Seventeenth C was designed to make little or no impact on the right to travel, since it seems inconceivable that those elderly persons who do choose to move will not recoup substantially more from the sale of their homes than those who remain and receive the modest abatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">It is true that, in a sense, the statute may result in the unequal distribution of benefits. However, the classification made by cl. Seventeenth C, between those who move and those who stay and receive the abatement, reflects preexisting differences; it does not establish new classes that are different only in the way that the statute treats them. Compare <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Vermont, </em>472 U.S. 14, 27 (1985). Those who sell and those who do not are not similarly situated. One class has received a capital gain within the past ten years, reflecting the increased value of their prior homes. The second class has not received such a capital gain and thus has not received any of the appreciated value of their homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>Nor does the statute create \u201cfixed, permanent distinctions between an ever-increasing number of perpetual classes.\u201d <em>Zobel </em>v. <em>Williams, supra </em>at 59. See <em>Hooper </em>v. <em>Bernalillo County Assessor, </em>472 U.S. 612, 623 (1985). Instead, once any person, new resident or old resident, has suffered the harm determined by the Legislature to exist, that person will be eligible for the benefit designed by the Legislature to offset that harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">We hold that the statute \u201chas a fair and rational relationship to the object sought to be accomplished.\u201d <em>Seiler Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>384 Mass. 635, 639 (1981). The plaintiffs\u2019 right <em>to </em>travel, guaranteed by the United States Constitution,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> has not been infringed. Therefore, we reverse the judgment entered in the Superior Court, vacate the award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, and order that judgment be entered for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b543-17\"> The judge certified a class comprising all present and future applicants for real estate tax abatements under G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5, Seventeenth C, who have been residents for at least ten years of a Massachusetts municipality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>which has accepted cl. Seventeenth C, and who were or will be denied an abatement solely because they have changed their domicil within that municipality during the previous ten years. While neither party has appealed this certification, both parties have expressed misgivings about the limited scope of the class. Since we assume, without deciding, that the rights of any larger class present the same constitutional questions, we need not decide whether the certified class is too restrictive. See <em>Milton </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>365 Mass. 368, 371 n.2 (1974). But see <em>Martinez </em>v. <em>Bynum, </em>461 U.S. 321, 329 n.8 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b544-8\"> General Laws c. 59, \u00a7 5, states in part: \u201cThe following property shall be exempt from taxation . . .

Cities and towns have the option to accept this clause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b544-9\"> The judge allowed the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b545-7\"> The Commissioner moved to dismiss the complaint in the Superior Court on the ground that the plaintiffs failed to appeal the denial of the abatement to the Appellate Tax Board, as provided in cl.
