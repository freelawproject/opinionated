Parkinson. We conclude that the conservation easement granted by Parkinson, which placed substantial restrictions on the future development of her land, was invalid and unenforceable. Consequently, the board correctly refused to consider those restrictions when it assessed the value of her property.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-13\">Ellen L. Parkinson was the owner of three parcels of land, totalling 82.17 acres, in Medfield. The largest of these parcels is over seventy-six acres, and contains a single family dwelling, an attached two-car garage, and a bam. On June 16,1980, pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>suant to statutory provisions which authorize easements designed to preserve land or water in natural or open condition, see G. L. c. 184, \u00a7\u00a7 31, 32 (1984 ed.), Parkinson granted a conservation easement on all three of these parcels to The Trustees of Reservations. See St. 1891, c. 352. The easement prohibited, among other things, \u201cthe construction or placement of any building ... or other temporary or permanent structure on, above or under the Premises,\u201d as well as \u201c[a]ny use of the Premises, and activity thereon which, in the reasonable opinion of the grantee is or may become inconsistent with . . . the preservation of the Premises predominantly in their natural condition . . . .\u201d The easement further provided that the use of \u201c[o]ne single-family residence with usual appurtenant outbuildings and structures\u201d would \u201cnot be prohibited ... or considered inconsistent\u201d with these restrictions. The board of selectmen of Medfield, as well as the Secretary of Environmental Affairs, see G. L. c. 184, \u00a7 32, approved the easement, and it was recorded in the Norfolk County registry of deeds on October 30, 1980.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">It was the policy of the board \u201cto assess land properly subject to a conservation easement or restriction at no more than 25% of full and fair cash value.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nonetheless, when the board assessed Parkinson\u2019s real estate in fiscal 1982 and 1983 at $317,300 and $346,700, respectively, it refused to discount the value of her property. Instead, the board claimed that the conservation easement was invalid because it purported to apply not only to land, but also to Parkinson\u2019s residence and outbuildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Parkinson paid her taxes in full, and then filed timely applications for abatement on assessments for both years. The board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>denied these applications, and Parkinson appealed to the Appellate Tax Board. At the hearing before the Appellate Tax Board, Parkinson presented the testimony of two 'expert witnesses. The first witness, a real estate appraiser,' testified that the property at issue, when assessed in light of the easement\u2019s restrictions on development, was worth approximately $212,500. In making that determination, he calculated that occupation of the single family residence and outbuildings, expressly allowed by the easement, required the use of about seven acres of land. He then valued the house and this hypothetical seven acre parcel at $175,000. He valued the remainder of the land at only $500 an acre, because it was encumbered by the conservation easement. The second witness, an attorney for The Trustees of Reservations, testified over the board\u2019s objection to the validity of the easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The Appellate Tax Board concluded that G. L. c. 184, \u00a7 31, did not authorize a conservation easement to be placed on dwellings and appurtenant buildings, and thus affirmed the denial of the applications for abatement. Parkinson then appealed to this court. She claims that nothing in the language of G. L. c. 184, \u00a7 31, prohibits the kind of easement at issue here, and thus that the board erred in refusing to consider the easement when it assessed the premises. We conclude that the easement is invalid, not because it is prohibited by statute, but because its terms are so vague that it precludes any meaningful identification of the servient estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">\u201cWhile no particular words are necessary for the grant of an easement, the instrument must identify with reasonable certainty the easement created and the dominant and servient tenements.\u201d <em>Dunlap Investors, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>133 Ariz. 130, 132 (1982), quoting Oliver v. <em>Ernul, </em>277 N.C. 591, 597 (1971). <em>Hynes </em>v. <em>Lakeland, </em>451 So. 2d 505, 511 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1984). <em>Germany </em>v. <em>Murdock, </em>99 N.M. 679, 681 (1983). <em>Vrabel </em>v. <em>Donahoe Creek Watershed Auth., </em>545 S.W.2d 53, 54 (Tex. Civ. App. 1976). See <em>McHale </em>v. <em>Treworgy, </em>325 Mass. 381, 385 (1950). The instrument must be sufficiently precise that \u201ca surveyor can go upon the land and locate the easement.\u201d <em>Vrabel </em>v. <em>Donahue Creek Watershed Auth., supra. </em>If the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>instrument does not describe the servient land with the precision required to render it \u201ccapable of identification . . . the conveyance is absolutely nugatory.\u201d <em>McHale </em>v. <em>Treworgy, supra. Allen </em>v. <em>Duvall, </em>311 N.C. 245, 249 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">The board\u2019s inability to assess the property in light of the conservation easement is symptomatic of the easement\u2019s fatal ambiguity. The use of a single family residence, along with the \u201cusual\u201d outbuildings and structures, was excepted from the restrictions set forth in the instrument. According to the decision of the Appellate Tax Board, the appraiser who testified on behalf of Parkinson stated that such use would require \u201cabout\u201d seven acres of land surrounding the house. Therefore, Parkinson contends that the assessors should have made separate assessments of the seven-acre parcel and of all the remaining land.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">There is nothing in the record which supports the apparently arbitrary determination that seven acres of land were required for the use of Parkinson\u2019s house, and thus ought to be excepted from the restrictions set forth in the easement. One-half acre would probably be sufficient for some, while others would doubtless prefer substantially more. In short, the size of the servient estate depends wholly on one\u2019s estimate of the amount of property required for the use of the house. Moreover, as the board recognized, the easement would allow the use of one single family residence <em>anywhere </em>on the property. Accordingly, the instrument creates a roving exception to the easement\u2019s development restrictions, which, if the current residence were destroyed, could be placed anywhere on Parkinson\u2019s land. Therefore, the easement fails because it inadequately describes not only the size, but also the location, of the land subject to its restrictions. See 4 H. Tiffany, Real Property \u00a7 997, at 229 (3d ed. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">Parkinson contends that the legislative scheme anticipates that the grantors of conservation easements may remain in residence on the subject property. See Forty-second Report of the Judicial Council, Pub. Doc. No. 144, at 89 (Dec. 1966). We conclude that in order to do this, grantors are required to identify a parcel of land, separate from the house, which is subject to the development restrictions. This conclusion is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>bolstered by the language of G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 11, which provides that real estate subject to a conservation easement \u201cshall be assessed as a separate parcel.\u201d The location of this \u201cseparate parcel,\u201d we conclude, must be identified with sufficient clarity to enable the assessment to be made. See G. L. c. 184, \u00a7 33 (1984 ed.) (public restriction tract index \u201cshall indicate sufficiently for identification ... the land subject to the restriction\u201d). The decision of the Appellate Tax Board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b660-7\"> By an instrument dated April 9,1981, Parkinson conveyed to the trustees \u201call of her right, title and interest\u201d in the premises, reserving to herself a life estate, and stating that the conveyance was subject to the conservation easement granted in 1980. In light of our conclusion with respect to the ambiguity of the easement, we need not consider the board\u2019s further contention that this conveyance, under the doctrine of merger, extinguished the easement. See generally Restatement of Property \u00a7\u00a7 497-499 (1944).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b660-8\">General Laws c. 59, \u00a7 11 (1984 ed.) provides that any land subject to a conservation easement under G. L. c. 184, \u00a7 31, \u201cshall be assessed as a separate parcel\u201d of real estate.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
