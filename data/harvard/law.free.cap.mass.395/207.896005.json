The board upheld a refusal by the Commissioner of Revenue (Commissioner) to abate the taxpayer\u2019s corporate excise for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1977.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We reverse the decision of the board and remand for further proceedings in light of our opinion in <em>Commissioner of Revenues. Shafner, </em>392 Mass. 256 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>We summarize the parties\u2019 stipulation of agreed facts. The taxpayer is incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth and is engaged in selling, distributing, trading, and transporting petroleum products, principally in New England. Its sole shareholder is Northeast Petroleum Industries, Inc., a Delaware corporation. In 1973, the taxpayer entered into a joint venture with Ingram Corporation (Ingram) to build a petroleum refinery in Louisiana. In May, 1973, the taxpayer and Ingram incorporated Energy under Delaware law. Energy issued all its stock to Ingram and the taxpayer, each receiving fifty per cent of the shares. In April, 1974, Energy organized a wholly-owned subsidiary, ECOL, Ltd. (ECOL), a Louisiana corporation which was to purchase the refinery site and then construct the refinery.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thereafter, ECOL purchased the stock of the corporation owning the site for the proposed refinery.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> ECOL liquidated the corporation holding the site and commenced construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The taxpayer\u2019s investment in Energy never exceeded $10 million. The project eventually cost approximately $285 million. Substantially all the costs of constructing the refinery were financed by bank loans and advance payments for refinery output by a utilities company. As a condition to the $250 million credit agreement that financed substantially all the refinery construction costs, the taxpayer and Ingram jointly agreed to execute contracts to purchase 15% (by volume) of the refinery\u2019s output, on a cost-plus basis.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In fulfilment of this condition, the taxpayer and Ingram each separately contracted to purchase 7 <em>xh% </em>of the refinery output.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">In 1976, prior to completion of construction of the refinery, a change occurred in Federal law which adversely affected the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>economic feasibility of the project. Therefore, Energy accepted an offer from a subsidiary of Marathon Oil Company, a corporation unrelated to the taxpayer and Ingram, to purchase its only asset, the stock of ECOL. On September 20,1976, Energy sold all the ECOL stock for $140 million in cash. Energy was then liquidated, passing on a capital gain of $44,658,048 each to the taxpayer and Ingram. The refinery performed no commercial operations and sold no product during the period that it was owned by Energy.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Energy\u2019s gain from the sale of its stock in ECOL was taxed by the State of Louisiana. That tax was $3,721,444. The taxpayer paid one-half of this tax, or $1,860,722, on behalf of Energy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Energy was completely liquidated on June 14, 1977, when it distributed to the taxpayer and Ingram the sale proceeds remaining after payment of expenses. For Federal income tax purposes, the taxpayer had a capital gain of $44,658,048 on its 50% share of Energy\u2019s net proceeds. After payment of Federal taxes, the taxpayer had a posttax gain of $31,251,546. Within eight months after the liquidation of Energy, the taxpayer\u2019s parent corporation, Northeast Petroleum Industries, Inc., distributed approximately $25.3 million, or about 81% of the net liquidation proceeds, in complete redemption of the stock of certain of its shareholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">When the taxpayer filed its Form 355A Massachusetts corporate excise return for the year ending June 30, 1977, it also filed a statement in accordance with G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 42, requesting approval of the use of an alternative method of apportioning its income to Massachusetts. The tax return reported no Massachusetts income and reflected a $518,478 loss, of which 58.6% was apportioned to Massachusetts. After an audit, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>Commissioner issued to the taxpayer a notice of assessment of an additional $2,521,470 corporate excise for the year ending June 30, 1977, together with interest of $789,776,55.* ***<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The assessment, issued on March 30, 1981, was in accordance with the apportionment formula provided in G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38. The assessment allocated 58.6% of the taxpayer\u2019s income to Massachusetts, but excluded from that computation the property, payroll, and sales of Energy and ECOL. On May 5,1981, the taxpayer filed an application for a $2,486,113 abatement of the corporate excise assessed, together with all interest thereon. On June 10, 1981, the taxpayer was notified of the Commissioner\u2019s refusal to abate the tax. On June 17, 1981, the taxpayer paid the entire amount of the assessed tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">On August 7, 1981, the taxpayer appealed the Commissioner\u2019s decision to the board, which issued a decision in favor of the Commissioner on May 16, 1983. Pursuant to the taxpayer\u2019s request, the board issued findings of fact and report on June 25, 1984. The board found that under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38, the taxpayer had received \u201cincome derived from business carried on within the commonwealth\u201d when it redeemed the Energy stock and received the $44,658,048 capital gain.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The board concluded that the gain was taxable because it was de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>rived from an investment in a Delaware corporation and constituted the carrying on of business in Massachusetts, not in Louisiana. The board found that the taxpayer, which had never conducted business operations in Louisiana, made a decision to invest in an out-of-State venture from which it hoped to reap capital appreciation without a large commitment of time and energy toward the project\u2019s management. The board concluded that the Commissioner was not seeking to tax the income of an ongoing business engaged in interstate commerce. It found rather that the tax was imposed on the taxpayer for the privilege of transacting business as a Massachusetts corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">The board concluded, furthermore, that the taxpayer\u2019s payment of one-half of Energy\u2019s tax liability to Louisiana was not dispositive of the issue whether the gain was derived from the taxpayer\u2019s business in Louisiana or Massachusetts. The board stated that under Louisiana law, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 47:135 (West Supp. 1985), Energy was liable for a tax on the transaction, not the taxpayer. The board also concluded that, since the project constituted the carrying on of business in Massachusetts, the taxpayer\u2019s gain was not grossly disproportionate to its Massachusetts business. The board found, therefore, that the Commissioner correctly allocated a portion of the taxpayer\u2019s capital gain in the calculation of its corporate excise. The board concluded that the taxpayer had not carried its burden of establishing that the calculation of the excise under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38, was not reasonably adapted to approximate the taxpayer\u2019s income derived from its Massachusetts business.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The taxpayer argues on several grounds that the board erred in upholding the Commissioner\u2019s refusal to abate the corporate excise on the distribution received by the taxpayer upon the liquidation of Energy. The taxpayer contends, first, that the distribution was a dividend received in a liquidation under I.R.C. \u00a7 337 and is exempt from corporate taxation under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38 (a) (1). It finds support for this argument in our decisions in <em>Dow Chem. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>378 Mass. 254, 267-272 (1979) (deemed distribution from foreign subsidiary is deductible from taxable income as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>dividend under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38 [a] [1], where it had already been taxed to the subsidiary), and <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Shafner, </em>392 Mass. 256 (1984) (distribution which shareholders received from a liquidation under I.R.C. \u00a7 337 of a corporate trust is a dividend exempt from tax under G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 8 [c]). We decided <em>Shafner, </em>however, after the board had issued its decision in this case and just five days prior to the issuance of its findings of fact and report. We hold that it is appropriate to remand this case to the board for further consideration in light of <em>Shafner. </em>We conclude, therefore, that it is unnecessary to consider the other arguments raised by the taxpayer on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">The Commissioner contends that the taxpayer may not claim that the distribution is a dividend exempt from tax under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38 <em>(a) </em>(1), because the taxpayer has waived this argument by failing to raise it before the board. It is well established that failure to raise a statutory or constitutional question before the board generally bars a party from raising it on appeal. See G. L. c. 58 A, \u00a7 13 <em>Minchin v. Commissioner of Revenue, </em>393 Mass. 1004, 1004-1005 (1984); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Department of Revenue, </em>387 Mass. 59, 62-63 (1982); <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>McGraw-Hill, Inc., </em>383 Mass. 397, 404-405 (<em>1981); New Bedford Gas &amp; Edison Light Co. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Dartmouth, </em>368 Mass. 745, 751-752 (1975). Cf. <em>Gurry </em>v. <em>Board ofPublic Accountancy, </em>394 Mass. 118, 125-126(1985); <em>M. H. Gordon &amp; Son </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>386 Mass. 64, 68-69 (1982). We conclude, however, that the taxpayer in this case is not precluded from raising its argument under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38 <em>(a) </em>(1), on appeal. The taxpayer relied upon that statutory provision in its petition, and argued before the board that the statutory policy against multiple taxation suggests that it is improper to tax the distribution in this case. The taxpayer\u2019s requests for findings of fact and rulings of law, and its posttrial briefs, also raise the multiple taxation issue. Furthermore, at all stages of the proceeding, the taxpayer relied on <em>Dow Chem. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra, </em>in which the court concluded that the Commissioner erred in failing to allow a deduction under G. L. c. 63, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>\u00a7 38 <em>(a) </em>(1), for dividends of a foreign corporation deemed distributed in the taxable year. <em>Id. </em>at 272. The taxpayer could not have cited our decision in <em>Shafner </em>as support because that case was decided after the board\u2019s decision and only shortly before the board issued its findings of fact and report. Although the taxpayer could have been more precise in its argument before the board that the distribution was exempt from tax as a dividend under \u00a7 38 <em>(a) </em>(1), we conclude that the taxpayer was not so remiss that it should be held to have waived this argument and therefore be precluded from raising it on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">In light of the similarities between <em>Shafner </em>and the facts of the instant case, we conclude that it is appropriate to let the board pass on the question of the applicability of G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38 <em>(a) </em>(1), before we render a judgment on the question.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This is consistent with our traditional deference to the expertise of the board in tax matters involving interpretation of the laws of the Commonwealth. See <em>French </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>383 Mass. 481, 482 (1981). In <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Shafner, </em>392 Mass. 256 (1984), a Massachusetts corporate trust was liquidated in accordance with I.R.C. \u00a7 337. <em>Id. </em>at 257. The liquidating distribution in <em>Shafner </em>had been taxed by the Commonwealth at the corporate trust level. <em>Id. </em>at 258. The trustees of the corporate trust made cash distributions of the proceeds from the liquidation to the trust\u2019s shareholders, including the taxpayers in that case. We held that the cash distributions to the taxpayers were \u201cdividends\u201d under G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 <em>1(e), </em>and, therefore, exempt from taxation under G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 <em>2(a) (2) </em>(D). <em>Id. </em>at 259-260.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>Although <em>Shafner </em>involved the taxation of a trust under analogous provisions of G. L. c. 62, the board could apply the principles of that case to the distribution by Energy and rule that it was a \u201cdividend\u201d exempt from tax under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38 (a) (1), which provides that only those \u201cdividends\u201d distributed to a \u201ccorporation own[ing] less that fifteen per cent of the voting stock of the corporation paying such dividend\u201d may be taxed to the corporate shareholder as net income under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30. Such a result would be consistent with the policy against duplicative taxation expressed in <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Shafner, supra, </em>and Dow <em>Chem. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra. </em>See also <em>Rohrbough, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>385 Mass. 830, 831 (1982). On the other hand, the board may decide that the principles of <em>Shafner </em>do not control. In either case, we would review the decision of the board in the light of its expertise and the traditional deference due its decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Because of the view we take of this case, we conclude that it is not necessary to address the additional statutory and constitutional arguments advanced by the taxpayer. The decision of the Appellate Tax Board affirming the Commissioner\u2019s refusal to abate the tax is reversed. The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b223-14\">.

Although the taxpayer, a stockholder of the liquidating corporation, was under no obligation to pay any of Energy\u2019s tax liability to Louisiana, it nevertheless paid one-half of that liability. The taxpayer then filed a Louisiana franchise tax return in its own name, on which it was allowed an exclusion for its share of the capital gain on the liquidation of Energy. As a result, no additional tax was due to Louisiana.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b226-6\"> During the year ending June 30, 1977, ECOL owned property with a tax basis of $202,921,945, none of which was located in Massachusetts; ECOL\u2019s employees received $1,578,147 in compensation ($600,647 paid by ECOL, and $977,500 in termination payments paid by Energy), none of it on a Massachusetts payroll; and ECOL had no Massachusetts sales.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b226-11\"> General Laws c. 63, \u00a7 32, as amended by St. 1975, c. 684, \u00a7 48, provides, in relevant part: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided herein, every domestic corporation, exercising its charter, or qualified to do business or actually doing business in the commonwealth . . . shall pay, on account of each taxable year, the excise provided in . . . this section ....
