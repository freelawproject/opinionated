The briefs received were unanimous in their commendation to the court of the proposed amendment.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In view of the experience of other jurisdictions with the IOLTA program, the absence of significant constitutional or ethical objections, the voluntary nature of the proposed plan, and the worthy aims of the program, we grant the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-6\">We briefly review the history of the IOLTA movement. \u201cAttorneys have been entrusted with clients\u2019 funds and property since the early part of the development of our common law system of jurisprudence. Trust soon led to abuses and abuses of trust led to regulations.\u201d England &amp; Carlisle, History of Interest on Trust Accounts Program, 56 Fla. B. J. 101, 101 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>(1982). The rules regulating trust accounts appear at S.J.C. Rule 3:07, Canon 9, DR 9-102, as appearing in 382 Mass. 795 (1981). Historically, client funds small in amount \u201chave been commingled and placed in noninterest-bearing accounts held in trust for individual clients.\u201d Special Project, Interest on Lawyers\u2019 Trust Accounts: A Proposal for Wisconsin, 66 Marquette L. Rev. 835, 835 (1983). When individual sums of clients\u2019 money were capable of generating significant amounts of money, they were \u201coften deposited by lawyers in interest bearing savings accounts with the interest earned thereon, less the costs of maintaining the account, paid over directly to the client or credited to the client\u2019s account.\u201d <em>Petition of Minn. State Bar Ass\u2019n, </em>332 N.W.2d 151, 156 (Minn. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b20-5\">In the 1960\u2019s, the bars of several Australian States and Canadian provinces, seeking sources of funding for expanding bar activities, established IOLTA programs to support legal aid, law libraries, law school scholarships, and other projects for the improvement of the administration of justice. England &amp; Carlisle, <em>supra </em>at 102. With the advent of the negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) account, these programs \u201cdemonstrated the logic of capturing interest which [could not] economically or practically be identified or paid to specific clients and allowing the interest to be used for various law-related, public purposes.\u201d <em>Petition of Minn. State Bar Ass\u2019n, supra </em>at 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-6\">The IOLTA concept began in the United States in Florida in 1971, \u201cas a result of an investigation into means to provide funds for the improvement of the administration of justice.\u201d <em>Petition of N.H. Bar Ass\u2019n, </em>122 N.H. 971, 972 (1982). In 1978, the Florida Supreme Court approved a voluntary interest-bearing-trust-account program by court rule, on petition from the Board of Governors of the Florida Bar, with the concurrence of the Board of Directors of the Florida Bar Foundation. <em>Matter of Interest on Trust Accounts, </em>402 So. 2d 389 (Fla. 1981). Within two years of its implementation, the Florida program raised one million dollars of which more than half was distributed for legal assistance to the poor, legal scholarships, and projects designed to improve the administration of justice. See Krasno, IOLTA Programs Gaining Momentum, 67 Judicature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>49 (1983). Enthusiasm for the concept spread rapidly, see Rivlin, I.O.L.T.A. Gains Momentum Nationwide, 69 A.B.A.J. 1036 (1983), with the result that by the time of the petition of the MBA and BBA, twenty-two States,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> including the neighboring States of New York, Vermont, and New Hampshire, had adopted IOLTA programs, with local modifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-5\">The petition filed by the MBA and BBA, including the proposed amendment to S.J.C. Rule 3:07, calls for a voluntary program for Massachusetts lawyers with respect to pooled trust deposits which are currently held in noninterest-bearing accounts. We point out several salient features of the proposal: (1) The determination whether a client\u2019s funds are nominal in amount or to be held for a short period of time rests in the sound judgment of each participating attorney; (2) the qualified recipient charitable entities are to be designated by this court; (3) the qualified recipient entities shall allocate net income from the IOLTA program for use in improving the administration of justice or delivering civil legal services to the poor; and (4) lawyers must direct the depository institution to pay interest or dividends, net of any service charges or fees, to the designated charitable entities, and to send certain regular reports to the entities and to the depositing lawyer or law firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-6\">Having considered the possible impediments to implementation of an IOLTA program, we conclude, as have the highest courts of other States, that the program is constitutionally and ethically permissible. See, e.g., <em>Matter of Interest on Lawyers\u2019 Trust Accounts, </em>283 Ark. 252 (1984); <em>Matter of Interest on Trust Accounts, </em>402 So. 2d 389 (Fla. 1981); <em>Petition of Minn. State Bar Ass\u2019n, </em>332 N.W.2d 151 (Minn. 1982); <em>Petition of N.H. Bar Ass\u2019n, </em>122 N.H. 971 (1982); <em>Matter of Interest on Lawyers\u2019 Trust Accounts, </em>672 P.2d 406 (Utah 1983); <em>Matter of the Adoption of Amendments to CPR DR 9-102 IOLTA, </em>102 Wash. 2d 1101 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b21-7\">The major question to be addressed with respect to the IOLTA concept is whether the program would yield an uncon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>stitutional taking of property without due process or just compensation, in derogation of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution or of art. 10 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We follow the weight of authority in concluding that interest on nominal or short-term trust deposits is not property for constitutional purposes. \u201cAt present, the earnings of funds held in trust accounts can benefit neither the attorney nor the client, but simply redound to the benefit of the depository institution.\u201d <em>Matter of Interest on Lawyers\u2019 Trust, </em>675 S.W.2d at 357. In other words, \u201c[tjhere simply is no \u2018property\u2019 now in existence that would be taken.\u201d <em>Petition of Minn. State Bar Ass\u2019n, </em>332 N.W.2d at 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-5\">Opponents of IOLTA in other jurisdictions have contended that the decision in <em>Webb\u2019s Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. </em>v. <em>Beckwith, </em>449 U.S. 155 (1980), supports the broad proposition that interest of the character involved here is property. We disagree. In <em>Webb\u2019s, </em>the court held unconstitutional a Florida statute authorizing a county to take as its own the interest accrued on an interpleader fund deposited in the registry of the county court when a fee, prescribed by another statute, was also charged for the clerk\u2019s services in receiving the fund into the registry. That holding is inapposite in the context of an IOLTA program. \u201cThe most relevant distinction, plainly, is the fact that no client is compelled to part with \u2018property\u2019 by reason of a state directive, since the program creates income where there had been none before, and the income thus created would never benefit the client under any set of circumstances .... It follows that no client has a \u2018property interest,\u2019 in the constitutional sense, which is being taken from him by this program.\u201d <em>Matter of Interest on Trust Accounts, </em>402 So. 2d at 395-396. See also <em>Petition of N.H. Bar Ass\u2019n, </em>122 N.H. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>976; <em>Petition of Minn. State Bar Ass\u2019n, </em>332 N.W.2d at 158. We agree with the Florida court\u2019s analysis and conclude that there is no constitutional impediment to the IOLTA proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">Nor would the proposal contravene, in our view, relevant ethical considerations. The proposal involves only those funds which currently are not earning interest for the attorney or the client. \u201cBasic principles of the law of agency and trusts seem to compel the conclusion that at some point it would be irresponsible for an attorney not to deposit a client\u2019s funds in an interest-bearing trust account, and pay such interest to the client. An attorney who fails to do so may be found to have violated the fiduciary duty owed to his client.\u201d <em>Petition of N.H. Bar Ass\u2019n, </em>122 N.H. at 976. See 2 A. Scott, Trusts \u00a7\u00a7 180.3, 181, 182 (3d ed. 1967 &amp; Supp. 1984). However, individually the amounts which would be pooled under IOLTA are either so small or are held for such a short period of time, that it is not feasible to place them at interest, given the transaction costs and unavailability of practical subaccounting procedures. See <em>Chase </em>v. <em>Pevear, </em>383 Mass. 350, 362 (1981) (trustee, in investing funds, shall consider probable income). Thus, clients lose nothing by the IOLTA proposal, nor does any financial benefit inure to the participating lawyer in violation of Canon 9 of Rule 3:07 of the Rules of the Supreme Judicial Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">On July 23,1982, the Ethics and Professional Responsibility Committee of the American Bar Association issued Formal Opinion 348, concluding that a lawyer may ethically participate in an IOLTA program, similar to the proposal by the MBA and BBA, authorized by the State. We consider the Committee\u2019s reasoning to be sound: \u201cThe client has no right under the circumstances to require the payment of any interest on the funds to himself or herself because the amount of interest which the funds could earn is likely to be less than the appropriate charges for administering the earnings. The practical effect of implementing these programs is to shift a part of the economic benefit from depository institutions to tax-exempt organizations. There is no economic injury to any client. The program creates income where there was none before. For these reasons, the interest is not client funds in the ethical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>sense any more than the interest is client property in the constitutional sense .... Therefore, assuming that either a court or a legislature has authorized a program . . . and thus, either implicitly or explicitly, has made a determination that the interest earned is not the clients\u2019 property, participation in the program by lawyers is ethical.\u201d ABA Comm, on Ethics and Professional Responsibility, Formal Op. 348, at 8 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">Finally, other jurisdictions have had the opportunity to explore the tax consequences of an IOLTA program. The \u201cassignment of income\u201d doctrine which has evolved since the decision in <em>Lucas </em>v. <em>Earl, </em>281 U.S. 111 (1930), prohibits persons who generate income by their services or with their property from shifting income to persons in whose hands the income either would not be taxed or would be taxed at significantly lower rates. \u201cOver the years the common elements of prohibited income assignment have been a tax avoidance motive and a scheme or device for shifting income to related or controlled taxpayers.\u201d <em>Matter of Interest on Trust Accounts, </em>402 So. 2d at 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">The Internal Revenue Service has ruled that interest earned on a lawyer\u2019s trust account and paid to a charitable entity under a program like Florida\u2019s is not includible in the clients\u2019 gross income. Rev. Rui. 81-209, 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.61-7 (1981). That ruling held that the assignment-of-income doctrine would pose no obstacle \u201cso long as clients could in no way and to no degree control the creation or destiny of earnings generated on their attorney-held funds.\u201d <em>Matter of Interest on Trust Accounts, </em>402 So. 2d at 391. The ruling, however, states that its conclusion is limited to the unique facts described therein. Thus, although nothing in the proposal before us would appear to implicate the assignment-of-income doctrine, we include in our order the suggestion that the IOLTA Implementation Committee consider whether a favorable tax ruling should be obtained prior to authorization of any deposits pursuant to the new DR 9-102 (C).</p>\n<p id=\"b24-7\">We commend the petitioners both for their unflagging efforts to realize the IOLTA concept and for their successful collaboration in achieving an acceptable compromise plan in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>months following the original submission of the petition.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We further urge the bar to encourage participation in this program which puts \u201cidle funds to law-related public uses. \u201d ABA Formal Opinion 348, <em>supra </em>at 9.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Such participation is in accord with the exhortation that a \u201clawyer should assist in improving the legal system.\u201d ABA Model Code of Professional Responsibility Canon 8 (1980).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b18-12\"> On December 12, 1984, the MBA and BBA moved to amend their petition to add the Massachusetts Legal Assistance Corporation as an additional petitioner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b18-13\"> The petition proposed an amendment that would add the following new paragraph (C) to DR 9-102:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b18-14\">\u201c(C) A lawyer may elect to create, maintain, and at any time to close an interest-bearing trust account (hereinafter \u2018trust account\u2019) for clients\u2019 funds which in the judgment of the lawyer are nominal in amount, or are to be held for a short period of time, in compliance with the following provisions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b18-15\">\u201c(1) The trust account may be established with any bank or savings and loan association authorized by federal or state law to do business in Massachusetts and insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, or similar state insurance programs for state-chartered institutions.
