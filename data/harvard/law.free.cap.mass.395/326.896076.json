Sac-cone. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (1984 ed.). The commission found that Saccone had violated \u00a7 23 <em>(d) </em>of G. L. c. 268A (1984 ed.), the conflict of interest law, on five separate occasions and assessed a civil penalty of $300 for each violation. The judge in the Superior Court determined that the commission lacked subject matter jurisdiction to enforce G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 23. We granted the defendant\u2019s application for direct appellate review of the case. The commission argues that the judge erred in ruling that the commission does not possess statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>power to enforce the provisions of G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 23.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">We summarize the agreed facts and procedural background. Saccone was at all relevant times employed by the Department of Public Safety as a senior civil engineer assigned to the life safety code inspection unit. His official duties included conducting periodic surveys of nursing homes to ensure compliance with the Federal life safety code and State physical environment standards (State and Federal standards). He then was required to file reports regarding the conditions existing in the surveyed nursing homes and detail any deficiencies in complying with the State and Federal standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">In the spring of 1975, Saccone was assigned to survey the North River Nursing Home (nursing home). On five separate occasions between My, 1975,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and December, 1978, he surveyed the nursing home and filed reports stating that it had complied with several of the State and Federal standards. The commission later found that material violations of those standards existed. On two occasions during this period, Saccone accompanied Edmund W. DelPrete, president of North River Nursing Home, Inc., the corporation which owned and operated the nursing home, on trips to Italy and Brazil sponsored by the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company (company), of which DelPrete was a member. Travel space on these trips was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>limited to company members and their guests. The commission found that DelPrete paid in whole or in part for Saccone\u2019s participation in the trip to Brazil. It also found unpersuasive certain evidence introduced at the proceedings of a prior friendship between Saccone and DelPrete.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">On October 1, 1980, the commission issued an order to show cause naming Saccone as a respondent. On June 1,1982, after an adjudicatory hearing, the commission issued a decision and an order finding that Saccone had violated G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 23 (if),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which prohibited an officer or employee of a State, county, or municipal agency from using or attempting to \u201cuse his official position to secure unwarranted privileges or exemptions for himself or others,\u201d on five separate occasions and assessed five $300 penalties on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">The Legislature created the State Ethics Commission in 1978 by inserting c. 268B into the General Laws. St. 1978, c. 210, \u00a7 20. The question before us is whether the Legislature, through the enabling legislation, G. L. c. 268B (1984 ed.), authorized the commission to enforce G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 23, the section which the commission found Saccone had violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">\u201cOur task is to interpret the statute according to the intent of the Legislature, as evidenced by the language used, and considering the purposes and remedies intended to be advanced.\u201d <em>Cardin </em>v. <em>Royal Ins. Co. of Am., </em>394 Mass. 450, 454 (1985), quoting <em>Glasser </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>393 Mass. 574, 577 (1984). In G. L. c. 268B, \u00a7 3, the Legislature set forth the \u201c[p]owers and duties\u201d of the new commission. That section\u2019s only reference to the commission\u2019s civil enforcement duties is contained in \u00a7 3 (f), which empowers the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>commission to \u201cact as the primary civil enforcement agency for violations of chapter 268A, as specified in sections 9 and 15 of that chapter, and of this chapter [268B].\u201d General Laws c. 268A, \u00a7 9, is concerned with violations by State employees of \u00a7\u00a7 2-8 of G. L. c. 268A and G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 15, with violations by county employees of \u00a7\u00a7 11-14 of G. L. c. 268A.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Both \u00a7 9 and \u00a7 15 also provide additional remedies designed to recoup any economic gain which may have been derived by an individual who violated any of the sections of G. L. c. 268A incorporated by reference. No reference is made in G. L. c. 268B, \u00a7 3 (z), to the commission\u2019s enforcement powers over G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 23, the section at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>Additionally, \u00a7\u00a7 2-8 and \u00a7\u00a7 11-14 of G. L. c. 268A contain criminal penalties for violations of those sections. Enforcement of the criminal penalties is left to the Attorney General and the district attorneys. Civil enforcement of those sections is granted to the commission by virtue of the reference in \u00a7 3 <em>(i) </em>of G. L. c. 268B to violations of sections specified in \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 15 of G. L. c. 268A. Our conclusion that the commission lacks authority to enforce \u00a7 23 is buttressed by the fact that \u00a7 23 contains no criminal sanctions. Reading the statute as a whole, we believe the Legislature gave the commission the power and duty to enforce civilly only those sections which contain criminal sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">The commission argues that \u00a7 4 of G. L. c. 268B, rather than \u00a7 3 (/), controls here because it sets out the investigative, adjudicative, and enforcement authority of the commission.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>Contained in the text of \u00a7 4 are general references to violations of G. L. c. 268A, without further limitation to \u00a7 9 and \u00a7 15 of that chapter. Subsection (a) of G. L. c. 268B, \u00a7 4, provides, \u201cUpon receipt of a sworn complaint ... or ... of evidence which is deemed sufficient by the commission, the commission shall initiate a preliminary inquiry into any alleged violation of chapter 268A or this chapter.\u201d Enforcement by the commission of G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 23, the commission argues, is therefore within the authority granted to it by G. L. c. 268B, \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The commission\u2019s argument, however, ignores the fact that \u00a7 3 of G. L. c. 268B sets out the \u201c[p]owers and duties\u201d of the commission. Section 4, entitled \u201c[i]nvestigations by the commission,\u201d merely provides the procedural mechanism and authority to accomplish the duties of the commission as already set out in \u00a7 3.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>Craven </em>v. <em>State Ethics Comm\u2019n, </em>390 Mass. 191, 196 (1983).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The general references to violations of G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>c. 268A contained in the procedural provisions of G. L. c. 268B, \u00a7 4, are, therefore, limited by the specific jurisdictional authority as provided by G. L. c. 268B, \u00a7 3 (z). Particular words and phrases narrow general terms which might embrace related acts or conduct. <em>Roller </em>v. <em>Duggan, </em>346 Mass. 270, 273 (1963). See <em>Haas </em>v. <em>Breton, </em>377 Mass. 591, 595 (1979). The general rule is that \u201c[i]f a general statute and a specific statute cannot be reconciled, the general statute must yield to the specific statute.\u201d <em>Pereira </em>v. <em>New England LNG Co., </em>364 Mass. 109, 118 (1973). See <em>Mailhot </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>375 Mass. 342, 345-347 (1978). This principle is especially applicable where, as here, the specific limiting statute grants the powers of the commission, while the general language is contained in a procedural provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The language of G. L. c. 268B, \u00a7 3 (z), which governs the power and duties of the commission, clearly limits its jurisdiction over civil enforcement to violations of G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 15, and c. 268B itself. If the Legislature had intended to grant a plenary enforcement power, it would not have included the limiting language. \u201cIt is not to be assumed that words in a statute have no force or effect.\u201d <em>Milton </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Dist. Comm\u2019n, </em>342 Mass. 222, 225 (1961), quoting <em>Gillam </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Saugus, </em>327 Mass. 621, 623 (1951). See <em>Simon </em>v. <em>State Examiners of Electricians, ante </em>238, 242244 (1985); <em>Casa Loma, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>377 Mass. 231, 234 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The commission\u2019s argument that G. L. c. 268B, \u00a7 3 (z), pertains only to the commission\u2019s authority to undertake a civil recovery action pursuant to the remedial portions of G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 15, is also without merit. The plain language of G. L. c. 268B, \u00a7 3 (z), refers to violations, not remedies, and therefore applies to all civil enforcement efforts. The commission\u2019s interpretation also fails to account for the reference inG. L. c. 268B, \u00a7 3 (z), authorizing enforcement by the commission for violations of G. L. c. 268B.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">Although \u201cthe principal source of insight into the legislative purpose\u201d is the language of the statute, <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Howmedica, Inc., </em>373 Mass. 32, 37 (1977), the history of G. L. c. 268A, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>\u00a7 23, also supports our conclusion. The \u201cCode of Ethics,\u201d as what is now \u00a7 23 was called before the enactment of G. L. c. 268A, was conceived as a set of general guidelines for standards of conduct, and not standards to be specifically enforced by penal sanction, as were other sections of G. L. c. 268A. Final Report of the Special Comm\u2019n on Code of Ethics, 1962 House Doc. No. 3650, at 17,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See St. 1962, c. 779, \u00a7 1. Section 23, therefore, was not intended as a set of specific provisions punishable by fine, but rather, \u201c[i]t performs a particularly useful role in outlining the principles of the other [more concrete] provisions.\u201d Buss, The Massachusetts Conflict-of-interest Statute: An Analysis, 45 B.U.L. Rev. 299, 307 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The Legislature provided that \u00a7 23 would be enforced through administrative action by the appropriate constitutional officer or agency head. <em>District Attorney for the Hampden Dist. </em>v. <em>Grucci, </em>384 Mass. 525, 528-529 (1981). In 1982, the Legislature amended \u00a7 23 to make former public employees subject to certain of its provisions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> St. 1982, c. 612, \u00a7 14. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>Additionally in the amendment, the portion authorizing constitutional officers and heads of agencies to take administrative action was modified by the word \u201calso.\u201d The commission claims that the word \u201calso\u201d in the amended version indicates that it is an unspecified other enforcement agency for \u00a7 23. Further, the commission argues that because neither agency heads nor constitutional officers have disciplinary authority over former employees, the use of the word \u201calso\u201d indicates that the Legislature intended that the commission would continue its enforcement of \u00a7 23. Otherwise, the commission contends, the new version of \u00a7 23 is meaningless and \u201c[a]n intention to enact a barren and ineffective [piece of legislation] is not lightly to be imputed to the Legislature.\u201d <em>Habeeb </em>v. <em>Retirement Bd. of Quincy, </em>389 Mass. 634, 639 (1983), quoting <em>Insurance Rating Bd. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>356 Mass. 184, 189 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">\u201cWhen the meaning of any particular section or clause of a statute is questioned, it is proper, no doubt, to look into the other parts of the statute: otherwise the different sections of the same statute might be so construed as to be repugnant, and the intention of the legislature might be defeated. And if, upon examination, the general meaning and object of the statute should be found inconsistent with the literal import of any particular clause or section, such clause or section must, if possible, be construed according to the spirit of the act.\u201d <em>Holbrook </em>v. <em>Holbrook, </em>1 Pick. 248, 250 (1823). \u201c[W]here two or more statutes relate to the same subject matter, they should be construed together so as to constitute an harmonious whole consistent with the legislative purpose.\u201d <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal on Motor Vehicle Liab. Policies &amp; Bonds, </em>382 Mass. 580, 585 (1981). We look, therefore, to the entire statutory scheme to determine the sense of the amendment in relation to the statute as a whole. <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Board of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number><em>Appeals of Harwich, </em>388 Mass. 42, 51 (1983). 2A C. Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 46.05 (4th ed. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Testing the amended \u00a7 23 thus, we conclude that including the word \u201calso\u201d does not indicate that the Legislature granted the commission the power to enforce \u00a7 23.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Because the commission was created by the Legislature, it has \u201conly the powers, duties and obligations expressly conferred upon it by . . . statute .. . or such as are reasonably necessary ... [to carry out] the purpose for which it was established.\u201d <em>Hathaway Bakeries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>316 Mass. 136, 141 (1944), and cases cited. As noted, G. L. c. 268B, \u00a7 3 (z), sets forth the extent of the commission\u2019s powers and duties. See <em>supra </em>at 328-329. Nothing in the 1982 amendment changes the language of \u00a7 3 (z). We cannot ignore the plain legislative language limiting the civil enforcement powers of the commission to G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 15, and granting constitutional officers and agency heads the power and duty to enforce G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 23, administratively. The Legislature has spoken clearly; the commission is not authorized to enforce G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 23, by the terms of G. L. c. 268B.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b343-7\"> The judge based his decision on a report issued by the special master assigned to the case by the Superior Court. The report recommended that because the commission had no subject matter jurisdiction over enforcement ofG. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 23 (d), the judge should enter judgment for Saccone.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b343-8\"> The commission also asks us to rule on the contentions that the three-year tort statute of limitations applies to actions based on violations of G. L. c. 268A, and that the commission\u2019s proceedings against Saccone were commenced prior to the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations because Saccone\u2019s actions constituted fraudulent concealment and tolled the limitations period. Because we conclude that the commission lacks jurisdiction to enforce G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 23, we do not address this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b343-9\"> In May, 1975, Saccone recommended that the Department of Public Health grant Edmund W.

Where a current employee is found to have violated these provisions, appropriate administrative action as is warranted may <em>also </em>be taken by the appropriate constitutional officer, by the head of state, county or municipal agency (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">64</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">\u201cNo current or former officer or employee of a state, county or municipal agency shall:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-10\">\u201c(1) accept employment or engage in any business or professional activity which will require him to disclose confidential information which he has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>gained by reason of his official position or authority;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-7\">\u201c(2) improperly disclose materials or data within the exemptions to the definition of public records as defined by section seven of chapter four, and were acquired by him in the course of his official duties nor uto such information to further his personal interests.\u201d .</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b351-7\"> Had the 1982 amendment granted the commission the power to enforce \u00a7 23, that power and duty would not be retroactive and thus would not affect the instant case. <em>Nantucket Conservation Found., Inc. </em>v. <em>Russell Management, Inc., </em>380 Mass. 212, 214 (1980). We do not understand the commission to argue otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b351-8\"> We agree with the commission that deference should be given to long consistent administrative interpretations of an agency\u2019s governing statute. \u201cIn no event, however, will an administrative interpretation be followed if it is contrary to \u2018plain and unambiguous terms [in] a statute.\u2019\u201d <em>School Comm. of Springfield </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., 362 </em>Mass. 417, 441 n.22 (1972), quoting <em>Bolster </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation, </em>319 Mass. 81, 86 (1946). \u201cCourts are not bound by erroneous administrative constructions of a statute.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Martigrietti, </em>374 Mass. 784, 790 (1978). \u201cThe duty of statutory interpretation is for the courts.\u201d <em>Cleary </em>v. <em>Cardullo\u2019s, Inc., </em>347 Mass. 337, 344 (1964).
