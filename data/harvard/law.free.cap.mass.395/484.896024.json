He is a \u201cmember in service\u201d of the State employees\u2019 retirement system as that term is used in G. L. c. 32 (1984 ed.). He is also a veteran. Court officers are classified in Group 1 of the retirement system. G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 3 (2) (g). <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Sheriff of Suffolk County, </em>366 Mass. 779, 780 (1975). The maximum retirement age for employees in Group 1 is seventy. G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 1. The employment of court officers is also governed by G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 72, which provides in part that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>no court officer \u201cshall hold office . . . beyond age seventy years.\u201d G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 72 (1984 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">In 1977, the Legislature enacted a statute entitled \u201cAn Act permitting certain employees to continue working after they have reached the mandatory retirement age.\u201d St. 1977, c. 735. The statute amended G. L. c. 32, by inserting a new \u00a7 90F. That section provides in pertinent part: \u201cAny member in service, classified in Group 1 shall continue in service, at his option, notwithstanding the fact that he has attained age seventy; provided, however, that he is mentally and physically capable of performing the duties of his office or position. Such member shall annually, at his own expense, be examined by an impartial physician designated by the retirement authority to determine such capability.\u201d G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 90F (1984 ed.). In 1978, the Legislature enacted a similar statute amending G. L. c. 32, by inserting a new \u00a7 90G. St. 1978, c. 557. That section is, in all relevant aspects, identical to \u00a7 90F, except that \u00a7 90G applies only to veterans.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">On or about June 24, 1984, Chemick attained seventy years of age. Pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7\u00a7 90F and 90G, he applied to the State Board of Retirement (board) to be allowed to continue in service past the maximum retirement age of seventy. On or about May 7, 1984, Chemick received notice that the board had approved his continuance in office for one year beyond the maximum retirement age.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, on or about May 29, 1984, the office of the Chief Administrative Justice of the Trial Court informed Chemick that, notwithstanding the decision of the board, he would be retired on June 30, 1984, pursuant to the requirements of G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>Chemick then brought this action in the Superior Court seeking injunctive and declaratory relief. Specifically, the complaint sought an injunction prohibiting the defendant from requiring him to retire on June 30, 1984, and a declaration of the legal rights of the parties. On July 10,1984, after a hearing, a judge in the Superior Court granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction. On a joint motion by the parties and a stipulation to the material facts, the judge reported the case without decision for determination by the Appeals Court pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 64, 365 Mass. 831 (1974). We granted the defendant\u2019s application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">The only issue presented is whether the Legislature, by enacting G. L. c. 32, \u00a7\u00a7 90Fand90G, intended to create an exception to the mandatory retirement age for court officers established by G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 72. We conclude that the Legislature did not intend to create such an exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">General Laws c. 32 establishes a contributory retirement system for employees of the Commonwealth. The statute classifies employees in various groups depending upon the nature of their employment, G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 3 (2) (g), and establishes a maximum retirement age for each group. G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 1. Before 1972, there was no specific statutory provision governing the retirement of court officers. As members of Group 1, they were required to retire at age seventy. However, in 1972, the Legislature amended G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 72, to establish sixty-five as the mandatory retirement age for court officers. G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 72, as appearing in St. 1972, c. 740, \u00a7 10.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> By virtue of that enactment, the mandatory age for court officers\u2019 retirement was no longer set by G. L. c. 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>In 1978, the Legislature amended G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 72, raising the mandatory age for retirement of court officers to seventy. St. 1978, c. 478, \u00a7 252. The Legislature could have accomplished the same result by simply deleting the mandatory retirement age provision in G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 72. General Laws c. 32 then would have set the age for court officers\u2019 mandatory retirement, as it did prior to 1972. By its 1978 amendment the Legislature continued to employ G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 72, and not G. L. c. 32, as the statute governing the mandatory retirement age for court officers, and nothing in the history or language of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7\u00a7 90F and 90G, suggests any change in legislative approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Section 90F was added to G. L. c. 32 in 1977, prior to the amendment of G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 72, which increased the court officers\u2019 mandatory retirement age to seventy. When \u00a7 90F was added to G. L. c. 32, the mandatory retirement age for Group 1 was seventy, but for court officers it was sixty-five. The language of \u00a7 90F, as inserted by St. 1977, c. 735, \u201cAny member in service, classified in Group 1, shall continue in service, at his option, notwithstanding the fact that he has attained age seventy\u201d provided that a physician determines he is capable to do so, could not have referred to court officers, who, by virtue of G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 72, were no longer in service at seventy years of age. It is clear that the Legislature did not view \u00a7 90F as an amendment to G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 72. It is equally clear that the 1978 Legislature did not intend to amend G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 72, by adding \u00a7 90G to G. L. c. 32. In all material respects, the language of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 90G, tracks G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 90F.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">We reject Chernick\u2019s contention that G. L. c. 32, \u00a7\u00a7 90F and 90G, create an exception toG.L. c. 221, \u00a7 72. To reach that result, we would have to conclude that the Legislature partially repealed, by implication, the mandatory retirement provision of G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 72. \u201cSuch repeals have never been favored by our law. Unless the prior statute is so repugnant to and inconsistent with the later enactment that both cannot stand, then the former is not deemed to have been repealed.\u201d <em>North Shore Vocational Regional School Dist.v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number><em>Salem, </em>393 Mass. 354, 358 (1984), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bloomberg, </em>302 Mass. 349, 352 (1939). See also <em>Haffner </em>v. <em>Director of Pub. Safety of Lawrence, </em>329 Mass. 709, 713-714 (1953). \u201cThat principle has particular force in the context of a special statute, such as [G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 72], followed by a general statute such as [G. L. c. 32, \u00a7\u00a7 90F and 90G]. \u2018[S]trong terms are required to show a legislative intent to supersede by a general act a special act <em>North Shore Vocational Regional School Dist. </em>v. <em>Salem, supra </em>at 358-359, quoting <em>Haffner </em>v. <em>Director of Pub. Safety of Lawrence, supra </em>at 714. \u201cWhere the later general statute does not present an irreconcilable conflict the prior special statute will be construed as remaining in effect as a qualification of or exception to the general law.\u201d 1A C. Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 23.15 (4th ed. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">We conclude, therefore, that G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 72, establishing a mandatory retirement age for court officers, is an exception to the provisions of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7\u00a7 90F and 90G, and that Chemick is not entitled to continue his employment pursuant to those sections. We remand the case to the Superior Court for entry of a final order consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b501-7\"> General Laws c. 32, \u00a7 90G (1984 ed.), provides in part: \u201cAny member in service, classified in Group 1, who is a veteran, shall continue in service, at his option, notwithstanding the fact that he has attained age seventy; provided, however, that he is mentally and physically capable of performing the duties of his office or position. Such member shall annually, at his own expense, be examined by an impartial physician designated by the retirement authority to determine such capability.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b501-8\"> The record does not indicate whether the board granted Chemick permission to continue working pursuant to \u00a7 90F or pursuant to \u00a7 90G.
