L. c. 263, \u00a7 5A (1984 ed.), a statute which requires the police to afford to an individual, charged with driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, \u201ca reasonable opportunity\u201d to be examined immediately by a physician of his own selection. We conclude that, in the circumstances here, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>police have fulfilled their statutory responsibility, and thus that the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the results of his breathalyzer test should have been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The testimony at the hearing on the motion to suppress is summarized as follows.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Keith Lindner, the defendant, was arrested by the East Longmeadow police department on December 2, 1982, for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor in violation of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) (a) (1) (1984 ed.). The defendant was brought to the police station, where the booking and breathalyzer officer, Patricia Farrell, administered a breathalyzer test. After the test, Officer Farrell informed the defendant of his right, under G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 5A, to an independent analysis of his blood performed by a physician of his own selection. The officer told the defendant that any such analysis would be \u201cat his own expense, and [that] he had to come up with someone to do the testing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The defendant requested that he be allowed to avail himself of the right to an independent analysis of his blood. Accordingly, Officer Peter Dalessio transported the defendant to Wesson Hospital emergency room, where a nurse drew the blood sample. The nurse gave the sample to Officer Dalessio, who then returned to the police station with the defendant. The defendant was placed in a cell. Officer Dalessio then presented the blood sample to the watch commander, who informed Officer Dalessio that the blood sample was the defendant\u2019s, and that it should be returned to the hospital for analysis at the defendant\u2019s expense. Officer Dalessio returned the blood sample to the hospital, and gave it to the same nurse who had drawn it from the defendant\u2019s arm. The nurse stated that she would attempt to have the blood sample analyzed at the hospital, but that the presence of certain stabilizers which are added to prevent spoilage might necessitate sending it elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">The record is unclear about the fate of the defendant\u2019s blood sample after Officer Dalessio left it at the hospital. The defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>ant testified that, after being placed in a cell, he did not discuss the status of his blood sample with anyone at the police station. Neither the defendant nor the police made any attempt, at the suppression hearing, to explain why the blood sample was not properly analyzed, or why the results of any such analysis were unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">On December 6, 1983, the judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the results of the breathalyzer test. The Commonwealth appealed, and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion. The defendant contends that the failure of the police to ensure that the blood sample was properly analyzed deprived him of a \u201creasonable opportunity\u201d for an immediate, independent medical examination, in violation of G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 5A. The defendant further argues that this statutory violation deprived him of his only meaningful opportunity to challenge the result of the breathalyzer test, and thus that the result of that test should be excluded from evidence at his trial. We disagree, and reverse the allowance of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">General Laws c. 263, \u00a7 5A,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> requires that the police provide the defendant with \u201ca reasonable opportunity to exercise his right to an examination by a physician of his choice at his request and expense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alano, </em>388 Mass. 871, 878 (1983). We have held that, to fulfil their duty under this statute, the police \u201cneed not assist\u201d a defendant in obtaining an independent examination, <em>id. </em>at 879, but instead \u201cneed only inform him of his rights and allow him access to a telephone.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Andrade, </em>389 Mass. 874, 877 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>(1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Paiva, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 561, 564 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">In this case it is clear that the police did nothing to \u201cprevent or hinder\u201d the defendant from obtaining an independent examination under G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 5A. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alano, supra. </em>The defendant does not contend that he was inadequately informed of his rights by the booking officer, and nothing in the record suggests that he was ever discouraged or prevented from making arrangements over the telephone for an examination by a physician of his own selection. In fact, the police in this case did far more than they were required to do. After the defendant was informed of his rights, a police officer drove him to the nearest hospital to have the blood sample drawn. Nothing in the record suggests that, after the defendant had been driven to the hospital, the police did anything to encourage the loss of the blood sample, or acted in any way inconsistent with the defendant\u2019s statutory rights. On these facts there could be no violation of G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 5A.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">The defendant claims that, because the police undertook to transport him to the hospital, they encouraged him to believe that they would also safeguard the blood sample and ensure that it was properly analyzed. The defendant further contends that, because of this mistaken belief, he took no further steps to have another blood sample obtained, and thus that he was, in effect, deluded into forfeiting his statutory rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">The defendant\u2019s argument is meritless. First of all, the defendant conceded at the hearing on the motion to suppress that he could not recollect whether the police had ever suggested to him that they would ensure that the blood sample would be analyzed. Instead, the booking officer had told the defendant that \u201che had to come up with someone to do the testing.\u201d Moreover, to accept the defendant\u2019s contention that, by driving him to the hospital, the police assumed a further duty to ensure that the test is completed, would simply discourage police attempts to assist such defendants in exercising their right under G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 5A. Nor could the defendant complain that, by being placed in a cell, he was deprived of a reasonable opportunity of ensuring that his blood sample was not lost or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>destroyed. Nothing in the record suggests that he ever requested that he be allowed to telephone the hospital to assure himself that the blood sample was handled properly. Had he made such a request, nothing in the record suggests it would have been denied. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alano, supra </em>at 879.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The unexplained loss or destruction of the defendant\u2019s blood sample is regrettable. Given the disoriented state of many of those arrested for driving while under the influence, and in order to avoid the kind of confusion reflected in the record before us, it might be advisable for police departments throughout the Commonwealth to establish with local hospitals some procedure for handling blood samples obtained under G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 5A. Nonetheless, that statute places primary responsibility for an independent blood test in the hands of the defendant, not the police. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alano, supra </em>at 878-880. Because the police fulfilled their limited responsibility under G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 5A, we reverse the order allowing the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the results of the breathalyzer test, and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b161-8\"> The judge made no findings of fact in connection with his allowance of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. Consequently, we rely here on a transcript of the testimony taken at the suppression hearing. That testimony is not internally inconsistent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b162-7\"> General Laws c. 263, \u00a7 5A, provides, in full: \u201cA person held in custody at a police station or other place of detention, charged with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, shall have the right, at his request and at his expense, to be examined immediately by a physician selected by him. The police official in charge of such station or place of detention, or his designee, shall inform him of such right immediately upon being booked, and shall afford him a reasonable opportunity to exercise it. Such person shall, immediately upon being booked, be given a copy of this section unless such a copy is posted in the police station or other place of detention in a conspicuous place to which such person has access.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b164-7\"> The defendant has not raised any argument based on due process principles. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Neal, </em>392 Mass. 1,7-14 (1984); <em>California </em>v. <em>Trombetta, </em>467 U.S. 479 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
