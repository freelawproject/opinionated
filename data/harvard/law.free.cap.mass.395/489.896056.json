The place where she fell was not a public way in the traditional sense but was a so-called park road. If the injury had occurred solely as a result of ice on a public way, she could not have recovered against the city because of the limitations on municipal liability for injuries caused by snow and ice on public ways set forth in G. L. c. 84, \u00a7 17 (1984 ed.). Because the injury was sustained on a park road, however, the limitations of \u00a7 17 did not apply explicitly to the plaintiff\u2019s claim. The plaintiff thus argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>the city is not entitled to municipal immunity in the circumstances. G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 2 (1984 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">The case was tried to a jury, which returned a verdict for the plaintiff. After failing to obtain a directed verdict, the city unsuccessfully moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The plaintiff does not contest the city\u2019s claim that its motions properly raised the question whether the city should be liable for a defect in a park road consisting, as the evidence in this case showed, solely of ice (and compacted snow) on a sidewalk. The Appeals Court rejected the city\u2019s claim that it was entitled to a directed verdict or judgment notwithstanding the verdict. <em>Intriligator </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 703 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">We granted the city\u2019s application for further appellate review. We conclude that the city is not liable for negligently permitting an accumulation on a park road of snow or ice that is the sole cause of an injury to a traveler on that way.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">In concluding that the city could be liable for the consequences of a snow or ice defect on a park road, the Appeals Court followed a logical pattern of reasoning based on a literal reading of the relevant statutes. The Massachusetts Tort Claims Act (G. L. c. 258) has abolished governmental immunity with certain exceptions. <em>Intriligator </em>v. <em>Boston, supra </em>at 704. The statute generally places municipalities on the same footing as private tort defendants. <em>Id. </em>The Tort Claims Act preserves the restrictions and limitations on municipal liability for defects in public ways (see St. 1978, c. 512, \u00a7 18) but no statute regulates a city\u2019s liability for injuries sustained on park roads due to the city\u2019s negligence because a park road is not a public way covered by G. L. c. 84, \u00a7\u00a7 15-25. <em>Id. </em>at 704 n.1. See <em>Dakin </em>v. <em>Somerville, </em>262 Mass. 514, 515-516 (1928). The Legislature could prospectively correct any oversight in not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>treating park roads as it treated public ways under the Tort Claims Act. <em>Id. </em>at 705 n.2.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">We do not adopt the literal approach to the resolution of the municipal immunity issue because we believe that the result obtained by that approach is not faithful to the general intent of the Tort Claims Act. In dealing with aspects of the no-fault motor vehicle insurance law, another statute of broad scope, we rejected the concept that limiting statutory words, literally read, were fully expressive of the applicable law. <em>See Mailhot </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>375 Mass. 342 (1978). The <em>Mailhot </em>case involved a claim for personal injury protection benefits (G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34A) by a person whose injury by a Massachusetts registered motor vehicle was covered under the United States workers\u2019 compensation law. Personal injury protection benefits were not available for a person covered for the same injury under the Massachusetts workers\u2019 compensation act (G. L. c. 152). See c. 90, \u00a7 34A. The no-fault law said nothing about the rights of persons covered under other workers\u2019 compensation laws. Literal application of the workers\u2019 compensation exemption from coverage would have let the plaintiff recover personal injury protection benefits. This court denied coverage, not by an interpretation of the exception language as such but by fashioning \u201can adjunct to \u00a7 34A called for by the sense of that section in its relation to the legislation as a whole.\u201d <em>Mailhot </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co. supra </em>at 348. The court noted other cases in which it had not applied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>the no-fault law literally and thus had fulfilled the over-all legislative purpose. <em>Id. </em>at 345-346. Justice Kaplan, writing for the court, explained the reason why literal application of particular words might produce an unintended result: \u201cIn so large a legislative enterprise, there are likely to be casual overstatements and understatements, half-answers, and gaps in the statutory provisions. As practice develops and the difficulties are revealed, the courts are called on to interweave the statute with decisions answering the difficulties and composing, as far as feasible and reasonable, an harmonious structure faithful to the basic designs and purposes of the <em>Legislature.\u201d Id. </em>at 345.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">We know that when the Legislature enacted G. L. c. 258, it intended to preserve those provisions of the General Laws that defined the circumstances under which an action could properly be maintained against a municipality for a defect in a public way. Statute 1978, c. 512, \u00a7 18 (\u201cThe provisions of this act . . . shall not be construed to supersede or repeal . . . [G. L. c. 84, \u00a7\u00a7 15-25]\u201d). One of the sections preserved (\u00a7 17) excludes municipal liability \u201cfor an injury or damage sustained upon a public way by reason of snow or ice thereon,\u201d if the way is otherwise free of any defect causing the injury or damage. See G. L. c. 84, \u00a7 17; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Orange, </em>320 Mass. 336, 337 (1946); <em>Newton </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>174 Mass. 181, 187 (1899). We know that before adoption of the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act a municipality was free from liability for any injury caused by a defect in a way that was a park road or the like,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> unless the defect was shown to have been associated with a proprietary function of the municipality.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">We are at a loss to perceive how the Legislature could have intended that municipalities should continue to have specially limited liability for injuries caused by defects in public ways <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>(G. L. c. 84, \u00a7 15 \u2014 $5,000) and should continue to be wholly free from liability for injuries negligently caused solely by snow and ice on public ways (G. L. c. 84, \u00a7 17), but that suddenly municipalities should be potentially liable in a far greater amount (G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 2 \u2014 $100,000) for injuries negligently caused solely by snow and ice on park roads. To achieve what we view as the general purpose of the Tort Claims Act and to construe it \u201cliberally for the accomplishment of the purposes\u201d of the Act (St. 1978, c. 512, \u00a7 18), we conclude that we should fashion \u201can adjunct to [St. 1978, c. 512, \u00a7 18, and G. L. c. 84, \u00a7 17] called for by the sense of [those] section [s] in relation to the legislation as a whole.\u201d See <em>Mailhot v. Travelers Ins. Co., supra </em>at 348. The result is that a municipality is not liable for injuries caused solely by snow and ice on a park road.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Another way of reasoning to the same conclusion is to note that the Tort Claims Act eliminated governmental immunity in numerous circumstances, but it did not thereby create liability. <em>Dinsky </em>v. <em>Framingham, </em>386 Mass. 801, 804 (1982). In deciding whether a public employer will be liable \u201cin the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances\u201d (G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 2), we must consider whether liability would be imposed on \u201ca private individual under like circumstances.\u201d <em>Gallant </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>383 Mass. 707, 714 (1981). Assuming no statute imposes liability on a private individual in such circumstances, the common law applies. See <em>Spring </em>v. <em>Geriatric Auth. of Holyoke, </em>394 Mass. 274, 284-285 (1985). The statutory reference to \u201ca private individual under like circumstances\u201d is not helpful in resolving the common law question now before us because a private individual would not \u201cunder the circumstances\u201d have a statutory exemption for certain similar negligent acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">The Legislature has expressed a policy that no municipality shall be liable for injuries caused solely by snow and ice on a public way. G. L. c. 84, \u00a7 17. In formulating a common law rule concerning municipal liability for defects in ways in parks, it is appropriate to recognize (1) there is no logical reason to impose liability because of a defect in a park road but to impose no liability for a similar defect in a public way and (2) the Legislature\u2019s statement of policy provides guidance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>as to what the common law rule should be. The common law rule should bar recovery for injuries caused in circumstances that are substantially identical. Because \u00a7 17 bars recovery for injuries caused by a snow and ice defect in a public way, the common law does the same for such injuries sustained on a park road. Such a common law rule, an adjunct to the statutory pattern, fulfils the over-all legislative purpose.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b506-8\"> We need not discuss other issues raised by the city. We, therefore, assume for the purposes of this case that all other issues would be decided in the plaintiff\u2019s favor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b507-6\"> The Appeals Court followed somewhat similar reasoning in <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Dist. Comm\u2019n, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 337, 338-339 (1984), when it concluded that the defendant commission was liable for a defect in a sidewalk maintained by it because the Tort Claims Act expressly eliminated the commission\u2019s statutory exemption from liability for such defects.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">By the time the case reached the Appeals Court, the Legislature had amended St. 1978, c. 512, \u00a7 18, to include a reference to the statutory provision exempting the commission from liability in such circumstances. St. 1983, c. 392. That change was effective only prospectively. <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Dist. Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 340. In the case before us, unlike the <em>Rogers </em>case, we are not dealing with the express repeal of an exempting statute. The Legislature was silent in G. L. c. 258 on the question of the liability of a municipality for the consequences of a defect on a sidewalk in a park road.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b508-7\"> See <em>Dakin </em>v. <em>Somerville, </em>262 Mass. 514, 515-516 (1928) (a boulevard); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>201 Mass. 267, 268-269 (1909) (Audubon Road in the Back Bay Fens); <em>Steele </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>128 Mass. 583, 584 (1880) (Boston Common); <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Waltham, </em>128 Mass. 567, 569-570 (1880) (Waltham common).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b508-8\"> See <em>Oliver </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>102 Mass. 489, 502 (1869) (excavation in public common in connection with a city-owned building leased as a source of revenue).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b510-7\"> The Legislature would be well advised to address this general question, even if it concludes that the result we reach is the appropriate one. Without legislative clarification, questions will remain as to the extent to which claims based on defects in park roads will be subject to the statutory conditions and limitations applicable to claims for defects in public ways.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
