R. Crim. P. 30, 378 Mass. 900 (1979), and from the denial of his motion for reconsideration thereof.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On June 22, 1971, Leaster was convicted of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>murder in the first degree, of armed robbery, and of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon. The convictions arose out of the robbery of a variety store and the shooting of the store\u2019s owner, Levi Whiteside, on September 27, 1970. This court affirmed the convictions on appeal. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leaster, 362 </em>Mass. 407 (1972). In 1977, after the trial judge had retired, another judge denied Leaster\u2019s motion for a new trial. In 1980, the same judge denied Leaster\u2019s further motion for postconviction relief. A single justice of this court denied Leaster leave to appeal the judge\u2019s action, and we dismissed Leaster\u2019s appeal of the single justice\u2019s decision. <em>Leaster </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>385 Mass. 547 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">In 1982, Leaster filed the motion for postconviction relief now under consideration. The same judge who had ruled on the earlier motions denied the motion because of Leaster\u2019s failure to submit a supporting affidavit as required by Mass. R. Grim. P. 30 (b) (3). Thereafter, in response to a motion for reconsideration accompanied by an affidavit, the judge conducted a hearing and ruled on the motion for postconviction relief on its merits. He denied the motion and, by the allowance of a motion pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E (1984 ed.), by a single justice of this court, Leaster appeals to the full court. We affirm.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Leaster argues that he is entitled to a new trial because of certain newly discovered evidence. The principal issue at trial was the identity of Levi Whiteside\u2019s killer. Levi\u2019s widow, Kathleen, and Nellie Rivera, a customer of the store at the time of the shooting, identified Leaster as the killer. Their testimony was crucial on that issue. Also, there was evidence at the trial that Kathleen had identified Leaster at a hospital parking lot approximately one and one half hours after the shooting. The trial judge admitted the evidence of the parking lot identification only after conducting a voir dire, at the conclusion of which he made findings, warranted by the evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>that we summarize. The shooting occurred at about 4:05 p.m. A few minutes later, two police officers arrived at the scene of the shooting, obtained descriptions of the robbers, and relayed them to police headquarters. Headquarters broadcast the descriptions and, between 5:15 p.m. and 5:20 p.m., Boston division 4 police Officer Frost arrested Leaster. Leaster, at least as to clothing, fitted precisely the description of the alleged assailant. Following headquarters\u2019 instructions, Officer Frost drove Leaster in a division 4 police wagon to the Boston City Hospital parking lot where, pursuant to instructions previously received, Frost transferred Leaster to a division 3 police cmiser. The shooting had occurred within the jurisdiction of division 3. As Officer Frost transferred Leaster from one police vehicle to the other, Kathleen Whiteside, accompanied by Sergeant Downey of division 3, came out of the hospital into the parking lot. Upon seeing Leaster, Kathleen stated, \u201cThat looks like the man that shot my husband. I\u2019m going over to take a better look.\u201d She did that, and said, \u201cThat\u2019s the man. I see the mark on his eye.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">The trial judge also found that, on the morning of the day of the shooting, Kathleen had observed the man who shot her husband, and the man\u2019s partner, hanging around the variety store for about thirty minutes. Later, minutes before the shooting, when the two men returned to the store, their presence so aroused Kathleen\u2019s suspicion that she suggested to her husband that they call the police. Just before the shooting, the assailant held Kathleen at gunpoint for a least a few minutes. Rivera stared at the assailant face to face for at least three minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">The judge found that headquarters had instructed Officer Frost to take the suspect to Boston City Hospital to arrange a confrontation with the victim, Levi Whiteside, and that neither police headquarters nor Officer Frost knew that Whiteside had in fact been pronounced dead at 4:45 p.m. The judge found that the police had not planned a confrontation between Kathleen and the defendant, that the confrontation took place within approximately one hour of the crime, and that permitting the identification to proceed as it did was reasonable police procedure. He concluded that the confrontation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>was permissible under <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bumpus, </em>354 Mass. 494, 501 (1968), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 1034 (1969), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>356 Mass. 617, 623-624, cert. denied, 400 U.S. 843 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Finally, the judge found after voir dire that Kathleen had carefully scrutinized the men who had been in the store in the morning and again in the afternoon, and he found that she had \u201cfixed into her mind a mental description of their physical characteristics and their clothing and attire.\u201d He concluded that Kathleen\u2019s in-court identification had its \u201cpreliminary origin in the observations which she made at the time [of the shooting] and is based upon substantial evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Leaster argues that he now possesses evidence, unavailable to him at trial and at the hearings on earlier posttrial motions, that requires a new trial at which Kathleen\u2019s out-of-court and in-court identifications would be suppressed. He also contends that, even if he is not entitled to suppression of those identifications, he at least is entitled to present to a new jury previously unavailable evidence which, he contends, would demonstrate infirmities in Kathleen\u2019s parking lot identification and, therefore, would minimize the persuasiveness of her in-court identification as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">The evidence, asserted by Leaster to be newly discovered, is as follows: (1) Officer Frost testified before the grand jury that following the shooting he was on patrol in a police wagon when he heard on the radio that a man answering a particular description was \u201cwanted for murder,\u201d that he saw a man fitting that description, and that he took that man to Boston City Hospital to meet Sergeant Downey. In response to a question whether there was any conversation between the victim and Leaster in Frost\u2019s presence, Frost answered in the negative and, when asked, \u201c[W]as he dead?,\u201d Frost answered, \u201cI believe they just pronounced him dead. It came over the air the man was wanted for murder as well as armed robbery. That is the man we placed in the wagon.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (2) A police report that Leaster <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>claims was not produced until the hearing on the motion in question here states: \u201cLieut. Det. McCallum of Homicide notified by Lieut. Page at 5:00 P.M., date,\u201d and \u201cabout 5:15 P.M., Patrolman Frost and Erickson . . . arrested [Leaster] without a warrant for the murder of Levi Whiteside:\u201d (3) In 1983, at the hearing on the motion now being reviewed, Kathleen Whiteside testified that when the police took her husband from the store they covered his face with a sheet or a blanket, and that when they got to the hospital one of the officers told her that her husband was dead before he left the store. Furthermore, the following questions were asked and Kathleen gave the following answers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-5\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cWhen you were leaving the emergency room did something happen?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-7\">A.: \u201cYes, they came up with the paddy wagon. So they had him in it, in there, and so they carried me out and put me in the car, walked me around and put me in the car. And so they said, \u2018We have someone out here we want to see do you know.\u2019 But just as they was coming around, I looked and saw him. I say, \u2018That\u2019s the guy that shot my husband.\u2019 I said, \u2018What\u2019s he doing here like that?\u2019 So he said, \u2018We just wanted you to identify him for us.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-9\"><em>Q. \\ </em>\u201cDid they tell you, Mrs. Whiteside, why they brought him there?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-10\">A.: \u201cYes, they told me why they brought him there.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-11\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cWhy?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-12\">A.: \u201cAfterwards.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-13\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cAfterwards. What did they say to you?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-14\">A.: \u201cI recognized him as soon as I saw him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-15\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cPardon me?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-16\">A.: \u201cI recognized him no sooner I saw him, and I spoke up before the policemen even said anything to me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number><em>Q.: </em>\u201cAfter you spoke up and saw him, did they say something to you about this person you are pointing at in the courtroom, why they brought him there?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-6\">A.: \u201cI told you they said they brought him there for me to identify him. He wasn\u2019t hurting or nothing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">In contrast to that evidence, Officer Frost testified at the trial during voir dire that the information he received on the radio concerned a \u201cshooting\u201d and an armed robbery, and that when he arrived at the hospital he did not know whether the victim was dead or alive. Furthermore, at the voir dire Kathleen Whiteside testified that Sergeant Downey \u201cdidn\u2019t say anything at all\u201d to her as they left the hospital. \u201cI just looked up and saw [Leaster] as I was coming out of the door,\u201d she testified. She did not testify, as she did at the hearing on Leaster\u2019s motion, that the police told her after she identified Leaster that they had brought him to the hospital to see whether she could identify him.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">1. <em>Standard of review. </em>A trial judge\u2019s familiarity with a case may lead him or her to conclude, particularly in light of postverdict developments, that justice may not have been done at a defendant\u2019s trial. Absent an abuse of discretion, we will not disturb a trial judge\u2019s ruling allowing or denying a new trial motion based on newly discovered evidence, even though the cold record may not clearly demonstrate the correctness of that decision. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeChristoforo, </em>360 Mass. 531, 542-543 (1971). However, when the motion judge did not preside over the trial, and the defendant cannot benefit from the judge\u2019s first hand exposure to the witnesses, the judge must carefully scrutinize the trial record with a liberal attitude in order to determine fairly whether newly discovered evidence demonstrates that justice may not have been done. This court, too, must perform that careful scrutiny. Although we necessarily give deference to the motion judge\u2019s assessment of the credibility of witnesses at the hearing on the motion, we are in as good a position as is the judge to evaluate the trial record, so we defer less to the judge\u2019s discretion than we do when the motion judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>also presided over the trial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ellison, </em>376 Mass. 1, 16-17 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">2. <em>Suppression of Kathleen Whiteside\u2019s identifications. </em>Leaster argues that the newly discovered evidence shows that, when the police brought him to the parking lot, they knew that the victim had died, and that, therefore, the confrontation between Kathleen and Leaster was not an accidental by-product of an arranged showup between the victim and Leaster, as the trial judge found, but instead was a planned and unnecessarily suggestive one-to-one showup. Leaster asserts that Kathleen\u2019s out-of-court identification taints any in-court identification, so that he is entitled to a new trial without evidence of either identification being admitted. In order to dispose of that contention, we need not decide whether the evidence, claimed to be newly discovered, qualifies as such, nor do we need to consider how persuasive that evidence might be with respect to whether the police arranged the confrontation that occurred. Also, we do not need to consider whether that evidence tends to show that, before any identification had been made, the police had told Kathleen that they wanted her to see whether the man they had in custody was the one who had shot her husband. For the purpose of dealing with the suppression argument, we may and do assume, most favorably to Leaster, that the evidence was newly discovered, that Leaster exercised due diligence in uncovering it, that it persuasively showed that the police arranged the parking lot confrontation, and that it also showed that before Kathleen identified Leaster the police told her that they wanted to know if she recognized the person they had brought to the parking lot. We hold that, even were Leaster to establish those facts, evidence of the out-of-court identification would be admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">In a long line of cases, beginning with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bumpus, </em>354 Mass. 494, 497-502 (1968), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>356 Mass. 617, 623-624 (1970), both of which the trial judge acknowledged, we have held that due process rights are not violated when the police, promptly after a criminal episode, show a defendant singly to a person for the sole purpose of identifying the wrongdoer. See <em>Commonwealth </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>v. <em>Bowden, </em>379 Mass. 472, 478-479 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Storey, </em>378 Mass. 312, 316-318 (1979), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 955 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Venios, </em>378 Mass. 24, 29 (1979); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barnett, </em>371 Mass. 87, 91-93 (1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1049 (1977); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Denault, </em>362 Mass. 564, 566-567 (1972). Such police procedures are entirely reasonable, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connolly, supra </em>at 624, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bumpus, supra </em>at 501, and it makes no difference that the witness\u2019s life is not in such jeopardy as to make imperative the immediate preservation of the witness\u2019s account of the event. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barnett supra </em>at 92. The procedures are \u201cjustified by the need for efficient investigation in the immediate aftermath of crime. ... To have the witness view the suspect while his recollection or mental image of the offender is still fresh, before other images crowd in or his attempts to verbalize his impressions can themselves distort the original picture, provides the witness with good opportunity for an accurate identification. ... A further consideration is that prompt confrontation yielding a negative result, besides freeing the innocent, informs the police that a possible predisposition on their part is or may be in error and releases them quickly to follow another track.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Of course, if there are special elements of unfairness, indicating a desire on the part of the police to \u201cstack the deck\u201d against the defendant, an identification resulting from such a confrontation would be inadmissible. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moon, </em>380 Mass. 751, 756-759 (1980). <em>See Commonwealth v. Storey, supra </em>at 317-318; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barnett, supra </em>at 93; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coy, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 367, 372-374 (1980). The proposed evidence here does not demonstrate special elements of unfairness in the parking lot confrontation. Although a police officer\u2019s statement to Kathleen, before she identified Leaster, that the police wanted to see whether she could recognize the person they had in custody, would contain some inherent suggestiveness, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barnett, supra </em>at 93, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hicks, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 574, 583 (1984), our decisions do not deem that amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>suggestiveness either unnecessary or unfair. Therefore, the police officer\u2019s statement to Kathleen would render neither the out-of-court nor the in-court identification inadmissible. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Storey, supra </em>at 319-320. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Venios, supra </em>at 29. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perretti, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 36, 41-42 (1985); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coy, supra </em>at 376. Accordingly, we find no merit in Leaster\u2019s contention that he is entitled to a new trial at which those identifications would be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">3. <em>Jury consideration of the circumstances surrounding the parking lot identification. </em>Leaster argues that, even if the newly discovered evidence does not entitle him to a new trial at which Kathleen Whiteside\u2019s identification testimony will be suppressed, he is entitled to a new trial nonetheless because at the 1971 trial he was unable to demonstrate to the jury the suggestiveness of the circumstances in which Kathleen\u2019s parking lot identification took place. It is true that \u201c[wjhere identification evidence has not been suppressed, its infirmities are a matter for consideration by the jury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>378 Mass. 296, 308 (1979), and cases cited. However, the new evidence on which Leaster relies does not demonstrate suggestiveness with any more force than the evidence available at trial. Officer Frost\u2019s grand jury testimony, the police report, and Kathleen\u2019s testimony at the motion hearing would warrant a finding that the police arranged the confrontation between Kathleen and Leaster, but that fact does not demonstrate any suggestiveness in the showup. A showup\u2019s suggestiveness results from factors that the witness observes, not from what was in the minds of the police officers. Nothing prevented Leaster from demonstrating the relevant facts at his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">As we have stated above, Kathleen Whiteside testified at the motion hearing that, when she was leaving the hospital, the police arrived with a vehicle containing Leaster, that \u201cthey put [her] in the car\u201d and \u201cthey said, \u2018We have someone out here we want to see do you know. \u2019 But just as they was coming around, [she] looked and saw him. [She said] \u2018That\u2019s the guy that shot my husband.\u2019 [She said], \u2018What\u2019s he doing here like that?\u2019 So [the policeman] said, \u2018We just wanted you to identify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>him for us.\u2019\u201d In testimony that immediately followed, Kathleen said that she made the identification before the policeman said anything to her. In further testimony, given in response to the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination at the motion hearing, Kathleen repeatedly stated that she identified Leaster before the police said anything to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Even if we were to assume that the suggestiveness inherent in a one-to-one confrontation could be exacerbated by the police informing the witness in advance that they have someone in custody for the witness to view for a possible identification, it is questionable whether Kathleen\u2019s testimony at the motion hearing would, if presented to a new jury, warrant a finding that any statement made by the police was made before, rather than after, the identification. In any event, we agree with the motion judge that the evidence was not of such a nature as to be likely to affect the result. See <em>DeLuca </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Ry., </em>312 Mass. 495, 497 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">4. <em>Other grounds. </em>Leaster argues that the newly discovered evidence, discussed above, requires anew trial especially when considered in conjunction with certain other evidence: the results of his recent polygraph test indicating the truth of his claim of innocence; his own posttrial hypnotically aided testimony; and the motion hearing testimony of two individuals. Leaster does not rely on this other evidence as independent support for his claim of right to a new trial, but asserts that it adds \u201csubstantial weight\u201d to his arguments discussed above. In view of our disposition of Leaster\u2019s primary arguments, we need not address those that merely add weight to them. We note, however, that the motion judge found the polygraph examiner to be unqualified. Furthermore, we recently announced our view that hypnosis \u201clacks general acceptability by experts in the field as a reliable method of enhancing the memory of a witness.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kater, </em>388 Mass. 519, 520-521 (1983), <em>S.C. </em>394 Mass. 531 (1985). Finally, the testimony of the two individuals consisted almost entirely of hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>We conclude that the judge correctly denied Leaster\u2019s motion for postconviction relief. The interests of justice do not require that we grant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">\n<em>Order denying postconviction relief affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b112-15\"> In relevant part, mie 30 provides: \u201c(b) NEW TRIAL.

At trial, Leaster did not show a particularized need for the grand jury minutes, and they were not made available to him.
