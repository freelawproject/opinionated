The regulation prohibits \u201c[t]he testing, storage, transportation and disposal,\u201d within the city of Cambridge, of five highly toxic chemical warfare agents. Arthur D. Little, Inc. (ADL), has challenged the regulation, and the order enforcing it, on a variety of procedural and substantive grounds, contending that: (1) the regulation is invalid because it was issued without a hearing, and without specific findings of any threat to public health; (2) the judge below wrongly deprived ADL of its right to challenge the regulation and order through a trial by jury; (3) the regulation is preempted by the constitutional grant of war and defense powers to the Federal government; (4) the regulation is unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious; and (5) the regulation violates the contract clause of the United States Constitution, art. I, \u00a7 10, cl. 1. We conclude, after examining each of these contentions in turn, that the regulation and order were validly promulgated, and constitute a permissible attempt by the city of Cambridge to protect the health and welfare of its inhabitants.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The facts as established by the materials submitted for the purposes of the summary judgment motions are as follows. In June, 1982, and September, 1983, ADL entered into contracts with the United States Department of Defense (DOD), which called for the testing of small quantities of chemical warfare agents. This testing was commenced in the fall of 1983 at ADL\u2019s Cambridge facility, known as Levins Laboratory. The laboratory was constructed and operated in full accord with all applicable Federal and State standards, including standards issued by the DOD. It is located adjacent to Route 2, and within several hundred feet of a busy commercial area and a residential neighborhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">On March 13, 1984, the commissioner, pursuant to his authority under G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7\u00a7 31 and 143 (1984 ed.),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> adopted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>the regulation at issue here, which prohibits the \u201ctesting, storage, transportation and disposal,\u201d within city limits, of five chemical warfare agents being studied at the Levins Laboratory.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The regulation was to remain in effect until a Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) study, and an \u201cindependent hazard assessment,\u201d of those chemicals were completed and reviewed. Also on March 13, the commissioner issued an order under G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7\u00a7 143 and 146 (1984 ed.), requiring ADL to \u201ccease the storage and testing\u201d of the chemicals listed in the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">ADL promply filed a complaint in Superior Court in Middlesex County seeking a review of the commissioner\u2019s order under G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 147 (1984 ed.), and a declaration under G. L. c. 231 A, \u00a7 1 (1984 ed.), that the regulation issued by the commissioner was invalid. Shortly thereafter, a judge enjoined the commissioner from enforcing the regulation. This injunction has been extended pending the resolution of the merits of ADL\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">In June, 1984, a consulting firm hired by the city issued its \u201cindependent hazard assessment.\u201d This report contained a detailed scientific analysis \u201cof the potential public hazards involved in experiments with chemical warfare agents\u201d at ADL. The report refrained, however, \u201cfrom characterizing ... the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>hazard as \u2018acceptable\u2019 or \u2018unacceptable\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The SAC issued its report in September. Certain of its findings are set forth in detail in the margin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In short, the SAC concluded that ADL\u2019s use of the chemicals listed in the regulation, \u201cwithin the densely populated City of Cambridge,\u201d was \u201cinappropriate,\u201d and that the risks involved in such research were \u201cunacceptable.\u201d On September 18, 1984, following the submission of these two reports, the commissioner issued a second regulation and order reaffirming the ban on the use of the chemical agents under study at ADL.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment in the Superior Court suit filed by ADL to test the validity of the regulation. On Febuary 27, 1985, by order of a Superior Court judge, judgment was entered on behalf of the commissioner, declaring the regulation valid and enforceable. ADL promptly filed a notice of appeal, as well as a motion for a stay pending appeal. The requested stay, first denied by the Superior Court, was granted on March 15, 1985, by a single justice of the Appeals Court. The commissioner then filed a petition for relief from the stay with a single justice of this court, under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3 (1984 ed.). The single justice reserved and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>reported this petition to the full bench. The appeal on the merits, pending in the Appeals Court, was also transferred here. Thus both cases are now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">I. Procedural challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">ADL contends that its statutory and constitutional due process rights were violated, because the regulation was issued without a prior hearing, and without findings of fact based on substantial evidence. We disagree. The State Administrative Procedure Act (APA), G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7\u00a7 1 et seq. (1984 ed.), is inapplicable to actions taken by the commissioner pursuant to G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7\u00a7 31 and 143. Nor does any other statute, or the Constitution, require a hearing or findings to support this exercise of the commissioner\u2019s rule making authority. Consequently, the regulation was issued in a procedurally adequate fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">First of all, we reject ADL\u2019s argument that the commissioner is subject to the procedural requirements of the APA. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7\u00a7 2-7. General Laws c. 30A, \u00a7 1 (2), renders the APA applicable to administrative action by \u201cany department, board, commission, division or authority of the state government or subdivision of any of the foregoing, or official of the state government.\u201d Because the responsibilities of the commissioner are \u201cconfined to the municipality,\u201d <em>United Food Corp. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>375 Mass. 238, 242 (1978), the requirements of the APA are inapplicable.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blackgammon\u2019s, Inc., </em>382 Mass. 610, 626 (1981); <em>Buteau </em>v. <em>Norfolk County Retirement Bd., </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 391, 392 (1979).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>Nor do we believe that G. L. c. 111, \u00a7\u00a7 31 and 143, require either a hearing, <em>Board of Health of Franklin </em>v. <em>Hass, </em>342 Mass. 421, 423 (1961); <em>Revere </em>v. <em>Blaustein, </em>315 Mass. 93, 95 (1943), or specific factual findings. <em>See Moysenko </em>v. <em>Board of Health of N. Andover, </em>347 Mass. 305, 307 (1964). Nothing in the language of either section supports a different interpretation. Section 31 provides that \u201c[b]cards of health may make reasonable health regulations.\u201d The section further requires notice by publication, but does not require a hearing or findings. Section 143 prohibits the establishment in a city or town of trades which may be harmful to the public, \u201cexcept in such a location as may be assigned by the board of health . . . after a public hearing has been held thereon.\u201d Nonetheless, the same section provides that the board of health may prohibit the exercise of harmful activity \u201cin places not so assigned, in any event.\u201d The absence of any provision for adjudicatory procedures in this latter situation is dispositive. \u201c[WJhere the Legislature has employed specific language in one [portion of a statute], but not in another, the language should not be implied where it is not present.\u201d <em>School Comm. of Brockton </em>v. <em>Teachers\u2019 Retirement Bd., </em>393 Mass. 256, 263 (1984), quoting <em>Beeler </em>v. <em>Downey, </em>387 Mass. 609, 616 (1982).* ****<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Finally, ADL claims that due process principles require that it be given a hearing, and that the regulation be supported by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>findings of fact based on substantial evidence. The argument is based on the ground that the regulation is targeted solely at ADL, and thus that the regulation is essentially adjudicatory in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Although the requirements of the APA are inapplicable to the actions taken by the commissioner, the distinction set forth in that statute between \u201cregulation\u201d and \u201cadjudicatory proceeding\u201d is helpful in situations such as that before us now. See <em>Mullin </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Brewster, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 139, 141-142 (1983). An \u201cadjudicatory proceeding\u201d involves a determination of the \u201clegal rights, duties or privileges of specifically named persons.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1 (1). On the other hand, a \u201cregulation\u201d includes \u201cevery rule, regulation, standard or other requirement of general application and future effect.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1 (5). See, <em>e.g., Borden, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Health, </em>388 Mass. 707, 716, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Formaldehyde Inst., Inc. </em>v. <em>Frechette, </em>464 U.S. 936 (1983); <em>Cambridge Elec. Light Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>363 Mass. 474, 486-487 (1973); <em>Cast Iron Soil Pipe Inst. </em>v. <em>State Examiners of Plumbers &amp; Gas Fitters, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 575, 586-587 (1979); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Florida E. Coast Ry., </em>410 U.S. 224, 244-246 (1973). The regulation at issue here, as the judge below concluded, \u201capplies to the operations of other laboratories and defense contractors in the city and is not an adjudication of the rights of a particular party.\u201d We find no reason to disagree. The regulation here is one of \u201cgeneral application and future effect.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1 (5). It \u201ccould not be fittingly described as intended simply to determine, the particular legal interests of specifically identified persons.\u201d <em>Cambridge Elec. Light Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., supra </em>at 486. Cf. <em>Borden, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Health, supra </em>at 717; <em>Milligan </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Pharmacy, </em>348 Mass. 491, 499 (1965). We note that this characterization of the commissioner\u2019s action is consistent with other cases decided under \u00a7 143, or its predecessor, which hold that such a rule \u201cis not in the nature of an adjudication of a particular case, but of a general regulation of the trade or employment mentioned therein.\u201d <em>Moysenko </em>v. <em>Board of Health </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number><em>of N. Andover, supra </em>at 307, quoting <em>Taunton </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>116 Mass. 254, 261 (1874). <em>Cochis </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Canton, </em>332 Mass. 721, 725 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">We recognize that ADL\u2019s use of the banned chemicals precipitated the action by the commissioner. Moreover, it is not disputed that ADL alone was conducting activity proscribed by the regulation. But the fact that ADL\u2019s research alone motivated the ban, and served to \u201cillustrate the general problems, . . . could not have the effect of transforming the regulatory endeavor into an adjudicatory one.\u201d <em>Cambridge Elec. Light Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., supra </em>at 487. In a similar situation this court has upheld a \u00a7 143 regulation prohibiting the painting of trucks within the city limits. <em>Revere </em>v. <em>Blaustein, </em>320 Mass. 81, 83 (1946). We noted that \u201cno constitutional right of the defendant was impaired even if he were the only one affected by the regulatory action of the board.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Similarly, in <em>Milton </em>v. <em>Donnelly, </em>306 Mass. 451, 460 (1940), we recognized that even \u201cif the only billboard that could be affected by the enforcement of the by-law is that of the respondent, that circumstance alone would not render the by-law invalid.\u201d See <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>387 Mass. 531, 536-537 (1982). <em>Massachusetts Gen. Hosp. </em>v. <em>Belmont, </em>233 Mass. 190, 203-204 (1919).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Because we conclude that the commissioner\u2019s action was rule making, and not adjudication, ADL\u2019s contention that it is entitled to findings of fact, and a hearing, before adoption of the regulation is meritless. It is well established that \u201can agency is not. . . obliged to provide a statement of the reasons which support its adoption of a regulation.\u201d <em>Borden, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Health, supra </em>at 723 n.9. <em>Cambridge Elec. Light Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., supra </em>at 490-491. Moreover, \u201c[a]ny constitutional claim to a trial type hearing fails if the proceeding was . . . regulatory or legislative or political. ... A regulation, like legislation, often increases costs or diminshes business expectations or even proprietary rights, but neither demands a prior confrontation resembling a lawsuit. \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 488. See also <em>American Grain Prods. Processing Inst. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>392 Mass. 309, 323 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>n.20 (1984). <em>Bi-Metallic Inv. Co. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization of Colo., </em>239 U.S. 441, 445-446 (1915).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">ADL further contends that it was entitled to a hearing and findings before issuance of the order prohibiting further use of the specified chemicals. We disagree. General Laws c. Ill, \u00a7 147, provides ADL with an adequate means of challenging an order issued pursuant to a regulation validly enacted under \u00a7\u00a7 31 and 143. See, e.g., <em>Revere </em>v. <em>Blaustein, </em>315 Mass, at 95; <em>Swansea </em>v. <em>Pivo, 265 </em>Mass. 520, 523 (1929). In addition, we have interpreted \u00a7 148 to provide for a \u201cdiscretionary stay\u201d of the order pending judicial review. <em>Board of Health of Franklin </em>v. <em>Hass, supra </em>at 426. Finally, \u00a7 150 provides for damages to the plaintiff in the event that the order is overturned. These \u201csafeguards ... at least satisfy, and may exceed, what is constitutionally required.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">ADL\u2019s final procedural challenge to the judgment below is premised on the ground that the trial judge wrongly, deprived it of the right to a jury trial under G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 147 (1984 ed.). This contention is meritless. Section 147 provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[wjhoever is aggrieved by an order made under section one hundred and forty-three . . . may . . . file a petition for a jury in the superior court . . . and . . . may have a trial in the same manner as other civil cases are tried by jury.\u201d As the judge below noted, ADL failed to make a demand for a jury trial, either in its complaint or in any other timely fashion. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 38(b), 365 Mass. 800 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>(1974). According to rule 38 (d), \u201c[t]he failure of a party to serve a demand . . . constitutes a waiver by him of trial by jury.\u201d See <em>Greenberg </em>v. <em>Greenberg, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 827 (1980). We note that other courts have strictly enforced cognate demand requirements, even when the relevant statute, like \u00a7 147, expressly provides for trial by jury. See <em>Scharnhorst </em>v. <em>Independent School Dist. </em># 710, 686 F.2d 637, 641 (8th Cir. 1982), and cases cited, cert. denied, 462 U.S. 1109(1983). Consequently, ADL has waived its right to a trial by jury.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">n. Substantive challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">A. <em>Preemption. </em>ADL contends that the regulation is inconsistent with the Federal Constitution and Federal statutes, and thus that it is invalid under the supremacy clause of the United States Constitution. Art. VI, cl. 2. We consider this argument in light of two principles which have traditionally informed our preemption analysis. First of all, \u201c[preemption ... is not favored, and State laws should be upheld unless a conflict with Federal law is clear.\u201d <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>385 Mass. 598, 602 (1982) <em>(Travelers I), </em>vacated, 463 U.S. 1221 (1983), reaffirmed, 391 Mass. 730 (1984), aff\u2019d sub nom. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>471 U.S. 724 (1985). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McHugh, </em>326 Mass. 249, 265-266 (1950); <em>Exxon Corp. </em>v. <em>Governor of Md., </em>437 U.S. 117, 132 (1978). State law is not preempted merely by reference to some vaguely defined Federal policy, or on the ground that Congress has enacted a statute which is tangentially relevant to the subject at issue. Instead, the plaintiff here is obligated to show preemption \u201cwith hard evidence of conflict ... on the basis of the record evidence in this case.\u201d <em>Grocery Mfrs. of Am., Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>379 Mass. 70, 81-82 (1979), quoting <em>Kargman </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>552 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>F.2d 2, 6 (1st Cir. 1977). Generally speaking, \u201ca finding of no preemption is regarded as preferable because Congress can overrule it by appropriate legislation, while a finding of preemption cannot be changed by the states.\u201d <em>Agency Rent-A-Car, Inc. </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>686 F.2d 1029, 1038 (1st Cir. 1982). See <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>State Energy Resources Conservation &amp; Dev. Comm\u2019n, </em>461 U.S. 190, 216 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Secondly, this court, and the United States Supreme Court, have been particularly reluctant to overturn State laws which are \u201cdeeply rooted in local feeling and responsibility.\u201d <em>Travelers I, supra </em>at 611, quoting <em>San Diego Bldg. Trades Council </em>v. <em>Garmon, </em>359 U.S. 236, 243-244 (1959). <em>Massachusetts Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>375 Mass. 160, 174 (1978). This principle applies with special force to laws designed to protect the public health and welfare, a subject of \u201cparticular, immediate, and perpetual concern\u201d to any municipality. 6 E. McQuillin, Municipal Corporations \u00a7 24.01 (3d ed. rev. 1980). In fact, according to an early decision of this court, <em>Vandine, petitioner, </em>6 Pick. 187, 191 (1828), \u201c[t]he great object of the city is to preserve the health of the inhabitants.\u201d Accordingly, municipal health and safety regulations, such as that at issue here, carry a heavy presumption of validity, and are only rarely preempted by Federal law. <em>Travelers I, supra </em>at 612. See <em>Malone </em>v. <em>White Motor Corp., </em>435 U.S. 497, 513 n.13 (1978). \u201cThe States traditionally have had great latitude under their police powers to legislate as \u2018to the protection of the lives, limbs, health, comfort, and quiet of all persons. \u2019 \u201d <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>471 U.S. 724, 756 (1985), quoting <em>Slaughter-House Cases, </em>16 Wall. (83 U.S.) 36, 62 (1873). <em>Huron Portland Cement Co. </em>v. <em>Detroit, </em>362 U.S. 440, 442-443 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">ADL argues that any regulation which interferes with the conduct of a DOD research program is preempted by the Constitution\u2019s grant of war and defense powers to the Federal government. For example, the Constitution provides Congress with the power to \u201cprovide for the common Defence,\u201d art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 1, \u201c[t]o raise and support Annies,\u201d art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 12, and \u201c[t]o make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>land and naval Forces,\u201d art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 14. The Constitution further directs that the President \u201cshall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy.\u201d Art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 1. We agree with ADL that these provisions constitute an explicit constitutional commitment of the national defense to the Federal government. Nevertheless, we further recognize that not every regulation which has some incidental effect on a defense program is invalid under the supremacy clause. Cf. <em>DeCanas </em>v. <em>Bica, </em>424 U.S. 351, 355 (1976) (State laws involving aliens are not \u201cper se pre-empted\u201d by exclusive Federal power over immigration); see <em>also Plyler v. Doe, </em>457 U.S. 202, 228 n.23 (1982). Nothing in the record before us suggests that the commissioner\u2019s action would have anything more than a \u201cspeculative and indirect impact,\u201d <em>DeCanas </em>v. <em>Bica, supra, </em>on the national defense. Accordingly, we conclude that the regulation is not preempted by the Constitution\u2019s allocation of war and defense powers to the Federal government.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">First of all, we reject ADL\u2019s contention that the regulation at issue impermissibly interferes with an integral part of an important national defense program. Nothing in the record suggests that the densely populated city of Cambridge is somehow uniquely suited to research on chemical warfare agents. Banning research on these chemicals within that city hardly requires the abandonment of the DOD\u2019s chemical warfare program. The DOD remains free to conduct its research elsewhere. Accordingly, the city of Cambridge has not attempted to dictate the scope of permissible strategic research, or otherwise to interfere with congressional power to \u201cprovide for the common Defence.\u201d Instead, it has merely taken the position that research on certain chemical warfare agents must be conducted, if at all, outside the city limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Nor are we persuaded by what the commissioner has termed \u201cADL\u2019s domestic domino theory.\u201d Even if the Cambridge regulation alone does not substantially interfere with national defense, ADL asserts that other municipalities may enact similar prohibitions, and thus seriously hinder the DOD\u2019s ability to study chemical warfare agents. We believe that the scenario posited by ADL is far too \u201chypothetical,\u201d <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Norman Wil</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number><em>liams Co., </em>458 U.S. 654, 659 (1982), to warrant preemption. According to the record only one other city has even considered the problem, and there is no indication that it will respond as the city of Cambridge has. Moreover, as the judge below recognized, even if a significant number of municipalities did enact such regulations, the DOD would always be free to conduct such research on its military bases. See <em>McQueary </em>v. <em>Laird, </em>449 F.2d 608, 612 (10th Cir. 1971) (\u201cFederal Government has traditionally exercised unfettered control with respect to internal management and operation of federal military establishments\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">ADL next contends that the regulation at issue is preempted by Federal legislation authorizing and regulating chemical warfare research.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> State law, including municipal regulations, can be preempted by an act of Congress if the State law \u201c\u2018conflicts with federal law or would frustrate the federal scheme, or [if] the courts discern from the totality of the circumstances that Congress sought to occupy the field to the exclusion of the States. \u2019 \u201d <em>Metropolitan Life Ins.

In applying this analysis, \u201cwe start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the States were not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 206, quoting <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Santa Fe Elevator Corp., </em>331 U.S. 218, 230 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">ADL bases its preemption argument on several Federal statutes which we briefly summarize. In 10U.S.C. \u00a7 2358 (1982), Congress authorized \u201cthe Secretary of Defense . . . [to] engage in basic and applied research projects that are necessary to the responsibilities of the Department of Defense in the field of basic and applied research and development and that relate to weapons systems and other military needs.\u201d See also 10 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2302 et seq. (Supp. 1985) (controlling the authority of Secretary of Defense to contract for defense purposes). In 50 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1511-1520 (1982), Congress set forth certain restrictions on the DOD\u2019s chemical and biological warfare programs. For example, \u00a7 1511 requires that the Secretary of Defense submit an annual report to Congress detailing the research conducted during the preceding year on \u201clethal and nonlethal chemical and biological agents.\u201d Section 1512 prohibits the expenditure of funds for the transportation, open air testing, or disposal of chemical warfare agents unless certain specified procedures are followed, while \u00a7 1516 prohibits the expenditure of funds \u201cfor the procurement of delivery systems specifically designed to disseminate\u201d such materials, unless the President certifies that such procurement is essential to the national defense. Sections 1517 and 1518 prohibit, except in emergency situations, the disposal of chemical or biological warfare agents unless they have first been detoxified, and \u00a7 1520 regulates the use of human subjects for the testing of these weapons. Finally, we note that the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1311 (f) (1982), prohibits the discharge of any \u201cchemical, or biological warfare agent. . . into the navigable waters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>The purportedly preemptive effect of these statutes does not require extended discussion. First of all, we fail to see how the challenged regulation \u201cconflicts with federal law or would frustrate the federal scheme.\u201d <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, supra </em>at 2393. Certainly, there is no \u201cconflict\u201d in the sense that \u201ccompliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility.\u201d <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>State Energy Resources Conservation &amp; Dev. Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 204, quoting <em>Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. v.Paul, </em>373 U.S. 132, 142-143 (1963). Nowhere in the Federal scheme is there any requirement that ADL conduct research on the banned chemicals within the Cambridge city limits. Nor do we observe any \u201cconflict\u201d here in the sense that enforcement of the regulation \u201cwould frustrate the federal scheme.\u201d <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, supra </em>at 2393. In fact, there is no Federal scheme whatsoever which either promotes or encourages the research at issue here. Cf. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2013 (d) (1982) (purpose of Atomic Energy Act to \u201cencourage widespread participation in the development and utilization of atomic energy\u201d). In the absence of some \u201cclear and manifest purpose\u201d on the part of Congress to foster private research on chemical warfare agents, <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>State Energy Resources Conservation &amp; Dev. Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 206, we are unable to infer any conflict with the Federal statutory framework.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Finally, we do not see any indication in these statutes that Congress \u201csought to occupy the field\u201d of chemical warfare regulation \u201cto the exclusion of the States.\u201d <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, supra </em>at 2393. Only a few of the Federal statutory provisions cited by ADL even apply to parties other than the Secretary of Defense. See 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1311 (f); 50 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1517, 1518, 1520.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Of these, only one places restrictions on ADL\u2019s testing of chemical warfare agents. That statute, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1520, prohibits the use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>human subjects except under specified conditions. This isolated provision hardly constitutes congressional occupation of the field sufficient to warrant preemption. Cf. <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>General Elec. Co., </em>683 F.2d 206, 214 (7th Cir. 1982) (preemption warranted in light of \u201ccomprehensive scheme of federal regulation of atomic energy\u201d), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Hartigan </em>v. <em>General Elec. Co., </em>461 U.S. 913 (1983); <em>Washington State Bldg. &amp; Constr. Trades Council </em>v. <em>Spellman, </em>518 F. Supp. 928, 931 (E.D. Wash. 1981) (same), aff\u2019d, 684 F.2d 627,(9th Cir. 1982), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Don\u2019t Waste Washington Legal Defense Found. </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>461 U.S. 913 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">We recognize that Congress has plenary authority in exercising its war and defense powers. See <em>Ullmann </em>v. <em>United States, </em>350 U.S. 422, 436 (1956); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Onslow County Bd. of Educ., </em>728 F.2d 628, 640-641 (4th Cir. 1984); <em>St. John\u2019s River Shipbuilding Co. </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>164 F.2d 1012, 1015 (5th Cir. 1947). Nonetheless, it is also well established that a State court, before invalidating State laws, should be \u201cthoroughly convinced\u201d of the arguments in favor of preemption, \u201clest it discover later that it has retreated where the Federal government will not advance and has therefore been derelict in its duty.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McHugh, </em>326 Mass. 249, 265-266 (1950). In the absence of any congressional action which clearly conflicts with the regulation at issue, and in the absence of congressional intent to occupy the field, we conclude that the regulation is not preempted by Federal legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Finally, ADL suggests that a contract between the DOD and a private defense contractor, authorized by Federal statutes, preempts inconsistent local regulations. We agree that ADL\u2019s obligations under its contracts with the DOD, and under the regulation, are flatly inconsistent.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Compliance with both is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>a \u201cphysical impossibility.\u201d <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>State Energy Resources Conservation &amp; Dev. Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 204. Nonetheless, this court has been unable to locate authority in this or any other jurisdiction which supports the proposition that a contract to which the Federal government is a party somehow constitutes Federal law for the purposes of the supremacy clause. In fact, relevant authority strongly suggests that Federal power does not extend that far. The United States Supreme Court recently held that the constitutional immunity of Federal instrumentalities from State taxation cannot depend on a \u201cgovernment functionary . . . changing a few words in a contract.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>New Mexico, </em>455 U.S. 720, 737 (1982), quoting <em>Kern-Limerick, Inc. </em>v. <em>Scurlock, </em>347 U.S. 110, 126 (1954) (Douglas, J., dissenting). See <em>Baltimore &amp; A. R.R. </em>v. <em>Lichtenberg, </em>176 Md. 383, 393, appeal dismissed, 308 U.S. 525 (1939); Tribe, Intergovernmental Immunities in Litigation, Taxation &amp; Regulation: Separation of Powers Issues in Controversies about Federalism, 89 Harv. L. Rev. 682, 710 (1976). Allowing the DOD to contract itself, as well as private defense firms, out of local health and safety requirements would seriously compromise the city\u2019s ability to protect its inhabitants. Moreover, it would constitute a grant of power to the executive branch which, in the absence of congressional authorization, is wholly inconsistent with our federalist system. See Washingtonv. <em>United States, </em>460 U.S. 536,546 (1983); <em>United States </em>v. <em>New Mexico, supra </em>at 737-738; Tribe, <em>supra </em>at 711. Accordingly, we agree with the judge below that the regulation is not preempted by the contracts between ADL and the Federal government.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>B. <em>Arbitrariness. </em>General Laws c. 111, \u00a7 143, authorizes the commissioner to prohibit activities that <em>\u201cmay </em>result\u201d in a nuisance or be harmful to the inhabitants\u201d (emphasis added). See <em>Waltham </em>v. <em>Mignosa, </em>327 Mass. 250, 252 (1951) (activity \u201cneed not in fact be a nuisance . . . before the power of prohibition arises\u201d). Construing this broad delegation of authority, we have held that regulations promulgated under \u00a7 143 may be struck down only if they are shown to be \u201cunreasonable, arbitrary, whimsical, or capricious.\u201d <em>Moysenko </em>v. <em>Board of Health of N.

In mounting a challenge on these grounds, ADL \u201chas the burden of proving on the record \u2018the absence of any conceivable ground upon which [the rule] may be upheld. \u2019 \u201d <em>American Grain Prods.

Plenary review of administrative regulations \u201cwould have an unhealthy tendency to substitute the court for the agency as policymaker.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 724, quoting <em>Cambridge Elec.

Both the SAC and an independent consultant recognized that a release of hazardous chemical warfare agents from Levins Laboratory was either \u201cunlikely\u201d or \u201cvery unlikely,\u201d <em>\u201cbut not impossible\u201d </em>(emphasis added). See notes 3 and 4, <em>supra. </em>The study conducted by the SAC concluded that the risks associated with the ADL research were \u201cunacceptable.\u201d See noted, <em>supra. </em>The other study refrained from making any such conclusion, asserting that \u201c[perspective on what is acceptable involves comparison with other risks people are exposed to as well as consideration of other factors such as whether the risks are voluntary or involuntary and what benefits accompany the risk.\u201d See note 3, <em>supra. </em>From these reports, the conclusion is inescapable that the necessity for the regulation is, at the very least, \u201cfairly debatable.\u201d <em>Borden, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Health, supra </em>at 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">ADL notes that it made a \u201ccommitment\u201d to use only a limited quantity of the chemicals at a single time, and thus argues that the SAC report is \u201cwildly inaccurate\u201d for failure to adjust its risk assessment accordingly. Even if ADL\u2019s \u201ccommitment\u201d diminishes the risk posed by th\u00e9 research conducted at the Levins Laboratory, it does not affect other research institutions in Cambridge which may have had occasion to use the banned chemicals. As the judge below found, \u201c[t]he regulation is aimed at the chemicals themselves and not merely at the ADL facility.\u201d Once the commissioner determined that the use of these chemicals, under some conceivable circumstances, would pose an unreasonable risk, he was under no duty to consider the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>specific conditions at the Levins Laboratory before issuing his order of prohibition. <em>Moysenko </em>v. <em>Board of Health of N. Andover, </em>347 Mass. 305, 307 (1964). <em>Sea Borden, Inc. </em>v. Commissioner <em>of Pub. Health, supra </em>at 727 n.19. See also <em>Weinberger </em>v.

Under \u00a7 143, the commissioner is empowered \u201cto prohibit the exercise of the trade or employment <em>as a whole whenever by any of the methods employed </em>it has become or may become a nuisance or otherwise offensive\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Moysenko </em>v. <em>Board of Health of N.

See note 13, <em>supra. </em>Nonetheless, we conclude, because the regulation is a reasonable and appropriate exercise of the city\u2019s police power, that ADL\u2019s contract clause challenge is meritless. See <em>Exxon Corp. </em>v. <em>Eagerton, </em>462 U.S. 176, 190-191 &amp; n.12 (1983); <em>Energy Reserves Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kansas Power &amp; Light, </em>459 U.S. 400, 412 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">\u201cLiteralism in the construction of the contract clause . . . would make it destructive of the public interest by depriving the State of its prerogative of self-protection. \u201d <em>Allied Structural Steel Co. </em>v. <em>Spannaus, supra </em>at 240, quoting <em>W.B. Worthen Co. </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>292 U.S. 426, 433 (1934). Consequently, a regulation \u201cdoes not violate the Contract Clause simply because it has the effect of restricting, <em>or even barring altogether, </em>the performance of duties created by contracts entered into prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>to its enactment\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Exxon Corp. </em>v. <em>Eagerton, supra </em>at 190. Instead, in reviewing regulations which substantially impair contractual obligations, we examine \u201cwhether the adjustment of \u2018the rights and responsibilities of contracting parties [is based] upon reasonable conditions and [is] of a character appropriate to the public purpose justifying [the (regulation\u2019s)] adoption. \u2019 \u201d <em>Energy Reserves Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kansas Power &amp; Light, supra </em>at 412, quoting <em>United States Trust Co. </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>431 U.S. 1, 22 (1977).

See <em>Borden, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Health, supra </em>at 737-738. See also <em>Travelers I, supra </em>at 616. The standard is not a stringent one. \u201c[U]nless the State itself is a contracting party,\u201d <em>Energy Reserves Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kansas Power &amp; Light, supra </em>412, we will defer to legislative or administrative judgment as to the wisdom of any particular measure. Any other rule would invite parties to enter into contracts to \u201cestop the legislature from enacting laws intended for the public good.\u201d <em>Manigault </em>v. <em>Springs, </em>199 U.S. 473, 480 (1905). <em>Exxon Corp. </em>v. <em>Eagerton, supra </em>at 190-191 &amp; nn.ll &amp; 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">For the reasons set forth in our discussion of ADL\u2019s challenge to the regulation on the ground it is arbitrary or capricious, we conclude that the action taken by the commissioner constitutes a reasonable, and thus permissible, impairment of ADL\u2019s contractual obligations to the DOD. This is not a regulation aimed at \u201cproviding a benefit to special interests.\u201d <em>Energy Reserves Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kansas Power &amp; Light, supra </em>at 412. Instead, the regulation imposes \u201ca generally applicable rule of conduct,\u201d <em>Exxon Corp. </em>v. <em>Eagerton, supra </em>at 192, designed to protect all Cambridge citizens from what the commissioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>has concluded is an unacceptable risk.

The benefits of research with these chemicals, in the opinion of the Committee, do not justify lethal risks to the general public. For this reason, the SAC believes that storage and testing of these chemical warfare agents within the densely populated City of Cambridge in the quantities and concentrations used by ADL is inappropriate.

Section 2617 (a) (1) of that statute provides that <em>\u201c[n\\othing in this chapter </em>shall affect the authority of any State or political subdivision of a State to establish or continue in effect regulation of any chemical substance, mixture, or article containing a chemical substance or mixture\u201d (emphasis added). This section disposes of any preemption argument based on other provisions of TSCA, but does not, we conclude, obviate the possibility of preemption either by the Constitution\u2019s grant of defense powers to the Federal government, or by other Federal legislation regulating the manufacture, use, transportation or disposal of hazardous chemicals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b566-6\"> Most of the other relevant statutes, such as 50 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1511-1513, 1516, 1519, place restrictions on the expenditure of funds by the Secretary of Defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b567-7\"> The commissioner contends that the regulation does not conflict with ADL\u2019s contracts with the DOD, on the ground that the contracts themselves require that ADL \u201cconform to all Federal, State and local laws and ordinances which apply to operations with toxic materials at the location of [the] facility.\u201d This contention is meritless. \u201c[L]aws enacted after the execution of an agreement are not commonly considered to become part of the agreement unless its provisions clearly establish that the parties intended to incorporate subsequent enactments into their agreement.\u201d <em>Feakes </em>v. <em>Bozy</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number><em>czko, </em>373 Mass. 633, 636 (1977). <em>Mayor of Salem </em>v. <em>Warner-Amex Cable Communications Inc., </em>392 Mass. 663, 666-667 (1984).

In upholding the action of the commissioner in this case, the majority reaffirms the applicability of the rational basis test to administrative action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As a result, if under any conceivable set of circumstances, no matter how remote, the necessity for the regulation is fairly debatable, the \u201cinescapable\u201d conclusion is that the regulation must be upheld. The majority reasons that any other result would violate the principle of separation of powers, and would fail to give due deference to the expertise of administrative bodies. <em>Ante </em>at 553-554.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">It is my view that the rational basis test as traditionally applied in this Commonwealth rests upon the twin infirmities of misapplied precedent and illogic. It therefore should no longer be used as the litmus for judicial scrutiny of administrative regulations. That the regulation in this case passes scrutiny under the rational basis test illustrates beyond dispute the ineffectiveness of that test as a limitation on the abuse of power by administrative bodies. Therefore, even assuming that the majority has correctly characterized the commissioner\u2019s action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>as a regulation rather than a disguised adjudication,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> I would not apply the rational basis test in determining the legality of that action. In my view, the rational basis test, as applied to administrative action, results not in the proper separation of powers, but in the abdication of meaningful judicial review. See <em>American Grain Prods. Processing Inst. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>392 Mass. 309, 331 (1984) (Lynch, J., dissenting). Thus, I respectfully dissent from Part IIB of the majority opinion. Because of the view that I take of this case, I would not reach the questions whether the procedure required by G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 31, was followed and whether the action of the commissioner was in fact adjudication within the meaning of G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7\u00a7 1 (1) &amp; 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">1. <em>Flaws of the rational basis test. </em>The rational basis test arose out of a recognition of the principle that \u201cacts, passed by the legislature, according to the forms prescribed in the Constitution, are founded in authority given by the people to that department.\u201d <em>Portland Bank </em>v. <em>Apthorp, </em>12 Mass. 252, 253 (1815). Popularly elected representatives are accountable to the electorate, which provides a check on the arbitrary exercise of legislative power. For that reason, otherwise constitutional legislative action is not normally subject to intense judicial scrutiny. Indeed, it is our duty \u201cto give effect to the will of the people as expressed in the statute by their representative body. It is in this way . . . that the doctrine of separation of powers is given meaning.\u201d <em>Shell Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Revere, </em>383 Mass. 682, 687 (1981), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leis, </em>355 Mass. 189, 202 (1969) (Kirk, J., concurring). <em>See Blue Hills Cemetery, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Embalming &amp; Funeral Directing, </em>379 Mass. 368, 372 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>However, the infirmities of the test flow from its application to judicial review of administrative action. I cannot agree with the principle that a \u201cregulation stands on the same footing as would a statute, ordinance, or by-law.\u201d <em>Druzik </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Haverhill, </em>324 Mass. 129, 138 (1949). That logical leap, first taken by this court in <em>Druzik, </em>has been accepted and repeated as an article of faith, though its historical and philosophical justifications have never been probed. Indeed, the only support for the extension of this principle that was cited by the <em>Druzik </em>court was <em>Pacific States Box &amp; Basket Co. </em>v. <em>White, 296 </em>U.S. 176, 186 (1935),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a case that is clearly no longer good law. See, e.g., 1 K.C. Davis, Administrative Law \u00a7 6.13, at 508; \u00a7 6.16, at 524 (2d ed. 1978).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While it may be easy to apply the same standard of review to legislative as to administrative action, to do so ignores material differences between the two.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Simply stated, \u201can agency is not a legislature.\u201d <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Transp., </em>680 F.2d 206, 221 (D.C. Cir. 1982), vacated on other grounds, <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of U.S., Inc. </em>v. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>463 U.S. 29 (1983). It is therefore \u201cincorrect\u201d to say that regulations have the \u201csame legal force as do statutes.\u201d 1 F. Cooper, State Administrative Law 264 (1965). See 1 K.C. Davis, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 6.13, at 509. Instead, we should recognize that administrative bodies \u201chave become a veritable fourth branch of the Government, which has deranged our three-branch legal theories much as the concept of a fourth dimension unsettles our three-dimensional thinking. . . . [They] have been called quasi-legislative, quasi-executive or quasi-judicial, as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>occasion required, in order to validate their functions within the separation-of-powers scheme of the Constitution. The mere retreat to the qualifying \u2018quasi\u2019 is implicit with confession that all recognized classifications have broken down.\u201d <em>FTC </em>v. <em>Ruberoid Co., </em>343 U.S. 470, 487-488 (1952) (Jackson, J.,</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">. dissenting). It is, however, not an impossible task to recognize the similarity of regulations to legislative enactments, while nevertheless taking due account of their differences. Blithely papering over these differences, as the rational basis test does, simply admits defeat in attempting to deal with a difficult problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">It will not do to say only that the Legislature, comprised of directly elected representatives, has delegated its power to administrative bodies and theoretically provides some check on administrative abuse. First, administrative bodies are still one step removed from the electorate, the source of legislative power and the most potent check on its possible abuse. See <em>American Grain Prods. Processing Inst. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, supra </em>at 333 (Lynch, J., dissenting) (\u201cadministrative officials are only tangentially responsive to the will of the people\u201d). Moreover, \u201cpolicymaking by a small group of political appointees may be objectionally nonrepresentative,\u201d especially when no hearing and no formal opportunity to comment on proposed regulations takes place. L. Jaffe, Judicial Control of Administrative Action 566 (1965). Second, the plethora of State and local administrative bodies and the competing demands of other pressing legislation prevent effective legislative oversight. The Legislature does not have the opportunity \u201cto examine more than an infinitesimal proportion of . . . regulations.\u201d DeLong, Informal Rulemaking and the Integration of Law and Policy, 65 Va. L. Rev. 257, 281 (1979). See Bruff, Legislative Formality, Administrative Rationality, 63 Tex. L. Rev. 207, 231-232 (1984). For these reasons, other courts have recognized that \u201cagencies do not have quite the prerogative of obscurantism reserved to legislatures.\u201d <em>UnitedStates </em>v. <em>Nova Scotia Food Prods. Corp., </em>568 F.2d 240, 252 (2d Cir. 1977). Indeed, the Supreme Court has recently stated that it does \u201cnot view as equivalent the presumption of constitutionality afforded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>legislation drafted by Congress and the presumption of regularity afforded an agency in fulfilling its statutory mandate.\u201d <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the U.S., Inc. </em>v. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., supra </em>at 43 n.9. See <em>FCC </em>v. <em>RCA Communications, Inc., </em>346 U.S. 86, 90 (1953) (\u201cCongress did not purport to transfer its legislative power to the unbounded discretion of the regulatory body\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">With the explosion of regulatory activity in the past twenty years, administrative bodies have become more independent, exercising more power at the same time that courts, at least in this Commonwealth, continued to adhere to only the most casual form of review. This situation has led to a perception that \u201cagencies are out of control.\u201d Breyer, Reforming Regulation, 59 Tul. L. Rev. 4, 6 (1984). It has added fuel to \u201cthe growing popular disenchantment with the pervasive bureaucratization of economic and social life.\u201d Gellhom &amp; Robinson, Rulemaking \u201cDue Process\u201d: An Inconclusive Dialogue, 48 U. Chi. L. Rev. 201, 260 (1981). These circumstances have called into doubt the \u201ccomfortable assumption that political remedies . . . may constitute an effective check\u201d on administrative power, at the same time that it has become evident that administrative bodies are political, not neutral and disinterested, parties. DeLong, <em>supra </em>at 278, 281.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Despite these formidable practical and theoretical problems generated by assigning equivalence to statutes and regulations, this court has maintained its adherence to <em>Druzik. </em>Generally, the court has stated this theory of equivalence (upon which the rational basis test wholly rests) as an accepted fact, as though through simple repetition it could become so. See, <em>e.g., American Grain Prods. Processing Inst. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, supra </em>at 329; <em>White Dove, Inc. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Marine Fisheries, </em>380 Mass. 471, 477 (1980); <em>Greenleaf Fin. Co. </em>v. <em>Small Loans Regulatory Bd., </em>377 Mass. 282, 293-294 (1979); <em>Colella </em>v. <em>State Racing Comm\u2019n, </em>360 Mass. 152, 155-156 (1971). Alternatively, the court has relied on justifications that may support some degree of judicial deference, but in no way command the application of the rational basis test. For example, the court has justified the rational basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>test on the ground that the court \u201cmay not substitute its judgment for that of the Legislature.\u201d <em>Purity Supreme, Inc. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>380 Mass. 762, 776 (1980). <em>See Borden, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Health, </em>388 Mass. 707, 723, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Formaldehyde Inst., Inc. </em>v. <em>Frechette, </em>464 U.S. 936 (1983). Similarly, the court has based its use of the rational basis test on the avoidance of \u201can unhealthy tendency to substitute the court for the agency as policymaker.\u201d <em>Cambridge Elec. Light Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>363 Mass. 474, 491 (1973). See <em>ante </em>at 553; <em>American Family Life Assurance Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>388 Mass. 468, 477-478, cert. denied sub nom. <em>American Family Life Assurance Co. </em>v. <em>Hiam, </em>464 U.S. 850 (1983); <em>Grocery Mfrs. of Am., Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>379 Mass. 70, 79-80 (1979); <em>Consolidated Cigar Corp. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>372 Mass. 844, 853 (1977). As the previous discussion has illustrated, however, the idea that the Legislature has exercised any \u201cjudgment\u201d is purely a legal fiction. Moreover, simply requiring that the administrative action be supported by \u201csuch evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\u201d (the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d test), does not require this court to engage in judicial legislation or to substitute its views for those of the administrative body. This is obvious from a review of our cases applying the substantial evidence test, where this court has held that it will not substitute its view of the facts for that of the administrative body, <em>Arthurs </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Medicine, </em>383 Mass. 299, 304 (1981), nor decide what weight should be placed on particular facts, <em>General Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Lynn, </em>393 Mass. 591, 602 n.5 (1984), nor set aside a choice \u201cbetween two fairly conflicting views, even though the court would justifiably have made a different choice.\u201d <em>Southern Worcester County Regional Vocational School Dist. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>386 Mass. 414, 420 (1982). We have noted that our review, even under the substantial evidence test, is a \u201climited\u201d one, calling for \u201cdeference\u201d to the administrative body\u2019s particular expertise. <em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Rating &amp; Inspection Bureau </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>391 Mass. 238, 245-246 (1984). Indeed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>under the substantial evidence test we have explicitly held that \u201cwe may not substitute our judgment for that of the [administrative body].\u201d <em>1001 Plays, Inc. </em>v. <em>Mayor of Boston, </em>387 Mass. 879, 885 (1983). In light of these facts, it is evident that the only justification for the rational basis test is judicial precedent based on faulty premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">2. A <em>proposed standard. </em>In developing a more appropriate standard of review of regulatory action, it is instructive to consider how the Federal courts have approached the same problem. Those courts, like the majority in this case, apply an \u201carbitrary or capricious\" standard. However, Federal application of the arbitrary or capricious test bears little similarity to the test applied by the majority. From the lenient standard of <em>Pacific States Box, </em>which the majority still follows, Federal courts have evolved a much more substantial inquiry, subjecting regulatory action to \u201ca thorough, probing, in-depth review.\u201d <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. </em>v. <em>Volpe, supra </em>at 415.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of U.S., Inc. </em>v. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., supra </em>at 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">This so called \u201chard look\u201d standard of review \u201ccompares the agency\u2019s stated rationale for a decision with supporting or opposing data and policy views gathered by the agency as the \u2018administrative record\u2019 for judicial review. The court identifies the agency\u2019s value choices and checks their consistency with the factual basis asserted for them, the agency\u2019s other present or past policies, and the governing statute.\u201d Bruff, <em>supra </em>at 238. Similarly, Federal courts will \u201cnot supply a reasoned basis for the agency\u2019s action that the agency itself has not given\u201d and actually relied on. <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of U.S., Inc. </em>v. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., supra </em>at 43 &amp; 50. This is in effect a rejection of the rational basis test as applied in this Commonwealth. That test, unlike the Federal test, validates any regulation so long as the imagination of some administrator, lawyer, or judge is fertile enough to envision a conceivable, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>though nonexistent, scenario, under which the regulation might possibly be labelled \u201crational.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">The elements of the Federal test \u201cdo not significantly differ for purposes of judicial review of rulemaking\u201d from the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d test with which this court already has developed familiarity. 1 K.C. Davis, Administrative Law \u00a7 6.6, at 468 (2d ed. 1978). See DeLong, <em>supra </em>at 287-288. See also <em>Associated Indus, of N.Y. State, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>487 F.2d 342, 349-350 (2d Cir. 1973). Therefore, I would apply the substantial evidence test to review regulatory action.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is neither radical nor unreasonable to require merely that administrative bodies base their regulations on \u201csuch evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\u201d (G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1 [6]), \u201cincluding any evidence that detracts\u201d from it. <em>Craven </em>v. <em>State Ethics Comm\u2019 n, </em>390 Mass. 191, 201 (1983), quoting <em>1001 Plays, Inc. </em>v. <em>Mayor of Boston, supra </em>at 885. Indeed, this court may have already begun to move in the direction of requiring something more from administrative bodies than \u201cany conceivable basis.\u201d See <em>American Grain Prods. Processing Inst. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, supra </em>at 325 (finding a \u201csubstantial basis\u201d for regulation); <em>Borden, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Health, supra </em>at 725 (not relying on a rational basis because, after review of the record, the court found actual evidence warranting the regulation).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">3. <em>The action in this case. </em>It is unmistakably clear that the commissioner\u2019s action is not supported by substantial evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>dence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> His action is purportedly based on scientific studies conducted for the commissioner. But these studies were undertaken only <em>after </em>the commissioner had originally issued the chemical ban. It is not surprising that it was reissued almost verbatim after the studies were completed, because when \u201cthe decision is announced prior to [its justification]. . . the process is no longer one of investigation. There is an overwhelming institutional bias in favor of justifying the result in any way possible.\u201d <em>Independent U.S. Tanker Owners Comm. </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>690 F.2d 908, 920 (D.C.Cir. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Putting aside this consideration, the studies themselves also fail to provide substantial evidence for his action. First, these studies focused exclusively on ADL\u2019s research to establish the threat to public health involved. There was no consideration of, or reliance on, any other realistic scenarios concerning the possible use of the banned chemicals in Cambridge by the small number of other foreseeable users. Second, the conclusions of those studies are flawed on their face. They do not consider ADL\u2019s commitment to use significantly smaller amounts of the chemicals than the studies hypothesized. Thus, the studies are virtually useless in assessing even the \u201cworst case\u201d accident scenarios. When confronted with this fact, the commissioner has simply asserted that he did not have to consider ADL\u2019s commitment, since there was no guaranty that other users would make the same commitment. But the studies did not examine the hazards that might be posed by other users; they addressed themselves solely to ADL. It is neither reasonable nor rational for the commissioner to rely on the studies to support his action, but to deflect any criticism of the results <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>or methods chosen by shifting the focus to situations he has never considered.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Nor was there sufficient information from which the commissioner could have made an informed judgment about the acceptability of the risk of harm from ADL\u2019s research. In general, \u201c[t]he concept of overall risk incorporates the significance of possible adverse consequences discounted by the improbability of their occurrence.\u201d <em>City of N.Y. </em>v. <em>United States Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>715 F.2d 732, 738 (2d Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1055 (1984). Quite apart from the commissioner\u2019s faulty knowledge about possible adverse consequences, he had no reasonable idea of the possibility that they would occur. Neither study considered the probability of a harmful accident except in the most general terms. While I would not require mathematical precision in making this assessment, something more is required than unsupported statements that it is \u201cvery unlikely\u201d or \u201cunlikely but not impossible.\u201d The quoted assessments offer the commissioner no support, since virtually anything could be considered by a reasonable person to be \u201cnot impossible. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">The majority is correct in stating that we must give deference to the commissioner\u2019s expertise. <em>Ante </em>at 553-554. But <em>\u201c[i]n judicial review, the court must evaluate the relevance and weight of expertness\u201d </em>(emphasis in original). L. Jaffe, <em>supra </em>at 579. Unless \u201cthe requirements for administrative action [are] strict and demanding, <em>expertise, </em>the strength of modem government, can become a monster which mies with no practical limits on its discretion\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of U.S., Inc. </em>v. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., supra </em>at 48, quoting <em>New York </em>v. <em>United States, </em>342 U.S. 882, 884 (1951) (Douglas, J., dissenting). It does no violence to the principles of deference to conclude that the commissioner lacked substantial evidence to bring his expertise into play in this situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>The standard of review I have advanced would not unduly restrict role making, nor would it place this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>court in the position of determining the appropriateness of any particular rule. Instead, the court\u2019s task would be simply to ensure that administrative bodies act in a manner that is both consistent with statutory policy and reasonably related to life in the real world, rather than some conjectured life in the fictional twilight zone of what is \u201cconceivable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">It is worth bearing in mind that \u201cthe knowledge of an administrative agency is rarely complete, an administrative agency is not ordinarily a representative body, its deliberations are not usually conducted in public, and its members are not subject to direct political controls in the same way as are legislators.\u201d Bonfield, The Iowa Administrative Procedure Act: Background, Construction, Applicability, Public Access to Agency Law, the Rulemaking Process, 60 Iowa L. Rev. 731, 845 (1975). Oras one noted writer has said of independent agencies: \u201cThey have been founded on a basically undemocratic concept of the political process and have helped perpetuate naive notions about regulation, ... the virtues of group decision and the use of expertness.\u201d M. Bernstein, Regulating Business By Independent Commission 294 (1955). Because of these considerations, we should abandon the principle that the court \u201cshould cast about to discover\u201d any ground on which to uphold administrative action. <em>Cotter </em>v. <em>Chelsea, </em>329 Mass. 314, 318 (1952). For \u201c[w]hen a court declines to scrutinize (or even assumes the existence of) supporting facts, ignores the presence of alternatives, and requires nothing more than minimally rational explanation, almost any outcome can pass muster.\u201d Garland, Deregulation and Judicial Review, 98 Harv. L. Rev. 507, 556 (1985). The result here is, therefore, \u201cone more step toward agency nonaccountability and carte blanche.\u201d <em>American Grain Prods. Processing Inst. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, supra </em>at 332 (Lynch, J., dissenting). At some point this process must stop.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b573-10\"> The majority speaks of a \u201cconceivable ground\u201d necessary to validate the regulation, a test which is indistinguishable from the traditional rational basis test applied to legislative enactments. See, e.g., <em>American Family Life Assurance Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>388 Mass. 468, 477-478, cert. denied sub nom. <em>American Family Life Assurance Co. </em>v. <em>Hiam, </em>464 U.S. 850 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b574-6\"> Although the regulation is couched in general terms, ADL is the only present or likely user of the banned chemicals, and the scientific studies allegedly supporting the regulation focus exclusively on the risks associated with ADL\u2019s research, and not on other problems that might arise if the chemicals were used in the future by some other business or individual. I also note that the regulation essentially renders wasted approximately $1 million spent by ADL to construct, with the knowledge and approval of the city of Cambridge, a special laboratory to conduct this research.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b575-6\"> The <em>Druzik </em>court also cited <em>Fieldcrest Dairies, Inc. </em>v. <em>Chicago, </em>122 F.2d 132, 135 (7th Cir. 1941), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 316 U.S. 168 (1942), which itself relied on <em>Pacific States Box, </em>but only for the proposition that a municipal ordinance, not merely a regulation, stands on the same footing as a statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b575-7\"> The Supreme Court has since interpreted the language in <em>Pacific States Box </em>relied on by the <em>Druzik </em>court to mean only that administrative actions are entitled to a presumption of regularity. See <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. </em>v. <em>Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 415 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b579-7\"> Although <em>Overton Park </em>involved administrative action that was neither strictly regulatory nor adjudicatory, the principles of that case have been interpreted broadly so as to \u201crevamp the law of informal rulemaking.\u201d DeLong, <em>supra </em>at 266.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b580-7\"> Of course, the test would operate somewhat differently in regulatory cases than in review of adjudicatory action. For example, the \u201cevidence\u201d necessary to support the rule would be provided in court, rather than established before the administrative body and would include whatever information the regulation\u2019s challenger and the administrative body choose to present in support of, or in opposition to, the rule. As in adjudicatory review, the initial burden of producing sufficient evidence to call into question the basis for a regulation would rest on the challenger. The administrative body would then have the usual choice of testing the challenger\u2019s evidence by a motion to dismiss (and appealing an adverse result), or by presenting its own case, and holding the challenger to its ultimate burden of persuasion that the regulation is unsupported by substantial evidence. Cf. <em>General Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Lynn, </em>393 Mass. 591, 599-600 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b581-6\">I note that G.L. c. 111, \u00a7 31, requires the commissioner\u2019s regulations to be \u201creasonable\u201d In <em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Rating &amp; Inspection Bureau </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>391 Mass. 238, 245 (1984), we held that there is \u201cno principled basis\u201d for distinguishing between \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d defined as evidence \u201ca reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion,\u201d and \u201creasonable support in the evidence.\u201d Thus, even without adopting the new general standard I have put forth, the commissioner\u2019s regulation should be reviewed under the substantial evidence test. To determine its validity under the rational basis test ignores the Legislature\u2019s choice of a stricter standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b582-8\"> It was also open to the commissioner to include in the regulation a restriction similar to the commitment made by ADL.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
