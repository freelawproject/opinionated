A. Taft, trustee for self,\u201d and the policy, dated November 19, 1886, contained a direction that its proceeds should be payable \u201cto and for the sole and separate use and benefit of E. A.

Taft, trustee.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-6\">After the death of the plaintiff\u2019s testator, on December 11, 1896, a letter bearing the same date was found in his desk, written by him and enclosed in a sealed envelope addressed, \u201c Mr. E. A. Taft, Boston, Mass. Personal.\u201d This letter, which, subject to the exception of the plaintiff, was admitted in evidence, contained a request to \u201c pay over in case of my death any money collected by you as trustee on any policies of insurance on my life to Mrs. Thomas J. Smith, Hotel Pelham.\u201d During the lifetime of the testator, Taft had no knowledge of the existence of such letter, or that the policy had been issued to him as trustee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-7\">The claimant testified that she became acquainted with the plaintiff\u2019s testator fourteen years before his death; at which time she was married and living with her husband, Thomas J. Smith, from whom she obtained a divorce in 1895 and resumed her maiden name; that she was not related to J. R. Kendrick or acquainted with his wife or any of his or her relatives, except that she had once met a niece of his wife, and that she had never been to his house; that Kendrick was married when she became acquainted with him, and that his wife died on May 13, 1893. She further testified, subject to the exception of the plaintiff, that in 1886 J. R. Kendrick asked her to inquire of her counsel \u201c how the matter could be arranged so that he could have his life insured for her,\u201d and afterward said that she need do nothing about it as he had arranged the matter himself; that Mr. Taft had the matter in charge and would attend to it; that he did not use the word \u201c trustee,\u201d but said that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>was to go to Mr. Taft, who was the person to whom she was to look; that she had other conversations with J. R. Kendrick, and at the last one, about three weeks before his death, he told her that he had had his life insured for her, and that she was to go to Mr. Taft in case anything happened to him, but that she did not know of the existence of the policy or of the letter to Taft until June, 1897. There was no evidence that the claimant went to Taft or said anything to him about insurance until June 10,1897.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-5\">At the close of the evidence the plaintiff requested the judge to rule, 1. that on the evidence the claimant cannot recover; 2. that neither the letter of -J. R. Kendrick to Taft nor his oral' statements entitle the claimant to the fund; 3. that such letter or statements do not constitute a declaration of trust; 4. that the letter to Taft, not having been delivered, is of no effect; 5. that the claimant, not belonging to any of the classes of persons named in Article 1 of the by-laws of the insurance company, cannot recover; 6. that the letter to Taft is of no effect as being contrary to the provisions of Article 17 of the by-laws of the company; 7. that the letter to Taft and the statements of the plaintiff\u2019s testator are invalid, as contrary to the statute of wills.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-6\">The judge declined to rule as requested, and found for the claimant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b330-7\"><em>E.

The policy was not made payable to the plaintiff\u2019s testator whose life was insured, but \u201cto and for the sole and separate use and benefit of E. A. Taft, trustee.\u201d The intention on the part of the plaintiff\u2019s testator to create a trust of some sort was thus clearly manifested. But neither the terms of the trust nor the name of the beneficiary was disclosed in the policy. For the purpose of showing who was the beneficiary, and what the terms of the trust were, evidence of the declarations oral and written of the donor were admissible. <em>Barrell </em>v. <em>Joy, </em>16 Mass. 221. <em>Gerrish </em>v. <em>New Bedford Institution for </em>Savings, 128 Mass. 159. <em>Catland </em>v. <em>Hoyt, </em>78 Maine, 355. It is true that a voluntary trust once <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>clearly established cannot be modified or controlled by subsequent declarations on the part of the donor, <em>(Chase </em>v. <em>Perley, </em>148 Mass. 289,) and the plaintiff contends that the direction in the application, that the policy be made payable to \u201c E. A. Taft, trustee for self,\u201d shows that the insured was himself the beneficiary. But it was competent for the court to find that the letter to the general agent of the insurance company, which referred to the policy as something still <em>in </em>futuro, was sent and received before the policy was issued, and contained a later direction than the application and the one which was followed in writing the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The question then remains whether there was evidence tending to show who the beneficiary was, and what were the terms of the trust, which warranted the finding in favor of the claimant. We think that there was.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">' The sealed letter addressed to Taft, which was found amongst the testator\u2019s papers after his death, clearly pointed out the claimant Ray as the beneficiary or <em>cestui que trust, </em>and directed the proceeds of the policy to be paid to her on his, the testator\u2019s death. Of itself it would not have been enough. But it was competent for the court to find that what was said by the testator to the claimant in the conversations between them, the last one shortly before his death, which, as she testified, were to the same effect, though the word \u201c trust \u201d or \u201c trustee \u201d was not mentioned, constituted a notice by him to the claimant of the existence of the trust in her favor. See <em>Gerrish </em>v. <em>New Bedford Institution for Savings, </em>128 Mass. 159. The fact that the policy never was delivered to her or to Taft, and that the letter to Taft also remained in the testator\u2019s possession and its'contents were unknown to the claimant and to Taft till after the testator\u2019s death, is not controlling or decisive against the claimant. <em>Gerrish </em>v. <em>New Bedford Institution for Savings, ubi supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">It is sufficient if it appears that the trust was clearly and unequivocally declared and executed by the donor in favor of the claimant, and was made known by him to her, and was assented to by her. <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Henshaw, </em>170 Mass. 409. <em>Gerrish </em>v. <em>New Bedford Institution for Savings, ubi supra. Urann </em>v. <em>Coates, </em>109 Mass. 581. <em>Brabrook </em>v. <em>Boston Five Cents Savings Bank, </em>104 Mass. 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>We think that there was evidence which warranted a finding in favor of the claimant on all of these points. See <em>Scrivens </em>v. <em>North Easton Savings </em>Bank, 166 Mass. 255; <em>Eastman </em>v. <em>Woronoco Savings Bank, </em>136 Mass. 208; <em>Alger </em>v. <em>North End Savings Bank, </em>146 Mass. 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">If we assume that the donor might have revoked the trust at any time during his life, he did not do so, and a power of revocation is not inconsistent with the existence of a valid trust. <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Hackett, </em>12 Gray, 227, 232.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">The insurance company might have availed itself of any defences afforded by its by-laws in an action by the plaintiff against it on the policy, but it admitted its liability, and paid the money into court. We do not see how the plaintiff can set up against the claimant matters arising out of the by-laws of the insurance company. She does not rely upon the contract contained in the policy, but upon a trust perfected in her favor by the insured in regard to the proceeds of the policy. <em>Brabrook </em>v. <em>Boston Five Cents Savings Bank, </em>128 Mass. 159, 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">We discover nothing which rendered the trust invalid on grounds of public policy, or inoperative as an attempted testamentary disposition of property. It is not necessary to consider in detail the rulings that were asked for, as we think that they are disposed of by what has been said.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
