Smith Robinson died in the year 1869, intestate, owning certain real estate in Springfield, known as the Nayasset House. He left a widow, Amelia Robinson, and as his only heirs his children, Marvin P. Robinson, Ethan C. Robinson, Henry S. Robinson, and Olive A. Dillaber. Henry S. Robinson died intestate, and without issue, on April 10, 1870, but leaving a widow, Josephine. After the death of Henry S. Robinson, the Nayasset House was occupied by tenants, and the rent was collected by Ethan C. Robinson, and sundry payments were made by him for taxes, water rents, insurance, repairs, and interest on a mortgage for $6,600 upon the property, given by J. Smith Robinson in his lifetime, which mortgage remained undischarged until January 3,1891, and for a few other incidental expenses. The taxes were assessed to the heirs of J. S. Robinson. There was no evidence of the receipt by Ethan C. Robinson of any rent prior to the death of Henry S. Robinson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-7\">On October 16, 1871, Olive A. Dillaber conveyed all her interest in the Nayasset House property to Albert P. Chapin, an uncle of Ethan C. Robinson. Books of account were kept by Ethan C. Robinson, wherein were entered an account of money received by him as rent of the property, and the payments made by him for taxes, water rents, insurance, repairs, interest on mortgage, and incidental expenses. No conversations ever took place between Ethan C. Robinson and said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>Marvin P. Robinson, or between said Ethan C. Robinson and said Albert P. Chapin, or between said Ethan C. Robinson and said Laura A. Robinson, in regard to an accounting concerning the Hayasset House property, and no demand was ever made by any of them upon said Ethan C. Robinson for an accounting, and no balance of accounts was ever struck on the books. It appeared by the books that between April 10, 1870, the time of the death of Henry S. Robinson, and October 16, 1871, the time of the conveyance by Olive A. Dillaber to Albert P. Chapin, the amount of rents received by said Ethan C. Robinson was $3,878.08, and the amount paid out by him for taxes, etc. was $1,275.96, leaving a balance of $2,602.12. If Amelia Robinson, the widow of J.

Sts. c. 197, \u00a7 1, runs upon a claim of one tenant in common against another for- a just share of the profits of land, when there has been no demand and no termination of the tenancy or of the defendant\u2019s management of the land, or any other event to change the relations between the two.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">The liability arises from St. 4 &amp; 5 Anne, c. 16, \u00a7 27, which gave an action of account to one tenant in common against the other as bailiff for receiving more than comes to his just share or proportion. However it may have been in its origin, this liability to an action of account long has been regarded as different fi\u2019om bailment on the one side, (Y. B. 20 Hen. VI. 16, and F. N. B. 116, Q. n. (d),) and from debt or an absolute liability for money on the other. Holt, C. J., <em>Anon. </em>11 Mod. 92. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number><em>Farrington </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>1 Mod. 268; 2 Mod. 311; <em>S. C. nom. Harrington </em>v. <em>Leech, </em>Freem. 229, 234, 242. It seems more like the accountability of a trustee, \u2014 a liability for an identified fund, which would be discharged by showing that the fund had been lost without the accountant\u2019s fault, as is clearly stated in a case between tenants in common by Parke, B. <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>5 Exch. 28, 33. See Fitz. Abr. Accompt, pl. 40; <em>Woodlife\u2019s case, </em>Moore, 462; <em>S. C. </em>Owen, 57; Co. Lit. 89 a. The relation between the parties is fiduciary. An action does not lie without privity, which in this instance is created by the statute. <em>Sargent </em>v. <em>Parsons, </em>12 Mass. 149, 152. <em>Bracebridge's case, </em>1 Leon. 264, 266. <em>Tottenham </em>v. <em>Bedingfield, </em>Owen, 35, 83; <em>S. C. </em>3 Leon. 24. <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>5 Exch. 28, 33. Of course, as in other cases of fiduciary relations, the liability may be made absolute by the accountant\u2019s appropriating the fund or repudiating the trust; as if the tenant in common wrongfully cuts and sells trees. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>7 Pick. 133. So, after demand and refusal, debt or assumpsit would lie, and the statute of limitations Avould begin to run. Frowike in Keilwey, 77 a, 77 b, pl. 25. Langdell, 2 Harv. Law Rev. 253, 254, where the subject is discussed with Mr. Langdell\u2019s usual ability. But it is plain from the nature of the duty created by the statute of Anne that the time of limitation ought not to begin to run when there has been no demand or refusal, and nothing to notify the plaintiff that the defendant has repudiated the relation, or that it has come to an end. <em>Jolly </em>v. <em>Bryan, </em>86 N. C. 457. See <em>Dickinson </em>v. <em>Leominster Savings Bank, </em>152 Mass. 49, 52, 54; <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Whoriskey, </em>170 Mass. 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">The action of account has been abolished in Massachusetts, and therefore an action of contract necessarily is resorted to. We are not aware that the attention of the court ever has been directed to the question whether a demand and refusal generally are necessary in this class of cases. But the nature of the duty created by the statute is not affected by the disappearance of the action, and what follows from the nature of the duty we already haAe stated. Cases where by mutual understanding the relation has terminated, and nothing remains to be done except to pay over a balance, have no application. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Harraden, </em>9 Mass. 540, n. <em>Currier </em>v. Hallowell, 158 Mass. 254, 256. So <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number><em>Clark </em>v. <em>Moody, </em>17 Mass. 145, stands on its own circumstances, and in <em>Vail </em>v. Durant, 7 Allen, 408, 410, was invoked as authority for the right of a factor to mingle the proceeds of goods consigned to him with his own funds, and the correlated proposition that he becomes at once a debtor for such proceeds. In this view, it has nothing to do with the liability of the defendant as bailiff. See <em>Lincoln </em>v. <em>Parr, </em>2 Keble, 781. In <em>Dickinson </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>11 Cush. 258, the tenancy in common continued when the action was brought, but the transactions out of which the claims arose were at an end. It was stated by the court that \u201c this judgment, when rendered, will be a final settlement between the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Apart from what has been said thus far, we are of opinion that, as was held in <em>Dickinson </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>just cited, the account was \u201c a mutual and open account current \u201d within the saving of Pub. Sts. c. 197, \u00a7 8. The defendant\u2019s intestate, Ethan C. Robinson, received rents and profits on the one side, and on the other paid, not merely for repairs, insurance, etc., but for taxes, in respect of which he had a personal claim against his cotenants. <em>Dewing </em>v. <em>Dewing, </em>165 Mass. 230.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">We are of opinion that nothing has barred the claims of the present tenants in common. It is true that some tenants have sold their shares, and that if an account had been sought in equity, the parties to the bill would have varied according to the tenants during the period in question. But such collateral changes do not affect the continuity of the remaining tenants\u2019 substantive rights, and we see no reason why they should affect their remedies. One tenant in common has a right to sell his share when he likes, and may do so without the knowledge of other tenants. The sale does not dissolve the relation between the remaining tenants, as in the case of a partnership. The fact that different bills in equity may be required in order to take all the accounts that are necessary to settle the whole business does not prevent the account between two continuing tenants from being one account from beginning to end.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">The two years from the filing of the administrator\u2019s bond within which a suit must be begun in order not to be barred by the special statute of limitations, Pub. Sts. c. 136, \u00a7 9, expired on May 11, 1898. Statements of the appellants\u2019 claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>were left with the register, and indorsed by him as presented for allowance on May 7, 1898. We are of opinion that this was equivalent to beginning suit, and avoided the bar. See Pub. Sts. c. 137, \u00a7\u00a7 2-4, 10; <em>Guild </em>v. <em>Hale, </em>15 Mass. 455, 458; <em>Aiken </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>104 Mass. 277; <em>Tarbell </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>106 Mass. 347, 349; <em>Morrell </em>v. <em>Old Colony Railroad, </em>158 Mass. 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-3\">The statements as to the payments to the widow are somewhat vague. But while we cannot draw inferences of fact upon an agreed statement, we must use reasonable discretion in interpreting what is admitted. The only reasonable understanding of the entries is that the widow was paid as provided by Pub. Sts. c. 124, \u00a7 13. If we were not to give that interpretation we should discharge the statement, and, if the same facts came before us as evidence, should draw an inference of fact to the same effect as we now construe the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">\n<em>Decree accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
