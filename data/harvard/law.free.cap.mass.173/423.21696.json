Hearing before Hammond, J., who, at the request of the defendant Metzenroth, reported the case for the consideration of the full court, in substance as follows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-12\">The plaintiff and the defendant Metzenroth were severally seised of a parcel of land on K Street in South Boston, and both derived their title by mesne conveyances from the Trustees of the Hawes Fund, a corporation which, in 1867, was the owner of a tract of land situated on both sides of K Street, extending from Fifth to Seventh Streets. The corporation inserted in the deed to the plaintiff\u2019s predecessor in title the following restriction : \u201c subject to the following restriction, to wit, that no buildings shall be erected or placed upon said premises except dwelling-houses with their outbuildings, each dwelling-house to be at least two and one half stories in height, and situated six feet from the line of said K Street \u201d; and in the deed to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>defendant\u2019s predecessor in title the following restriction : \u201c Said land is conveyed subject to the restriction that no buildings shall be erected or placed thereon except a dwelling-house and a stable for private use, and that the main part of such dwelling-house shall not be less than two and one half stories in height, and the main part of any building erected on said land shall be set back six feet from the line or side of said K Street.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-5\">All the land so owned by the corporation had prior to the commencement of this suit been sold and conveyed subject to restrictions similar to those contained in the deed to the plaintiff\u2019s grantors. The restrictive clauses in the deeds to the plaintiff\u2019s and the defendant\u2019s grantors were referred to and made a part of all mesne conveyances through which the plaintiff and the defendant derived title. No part of the land originally owned by the corporation had ever been used for other than residential purposes, nor any buildings other than dwelling-houses with their usual outbuildings erected thereon. The defendant, when the plaintiff\u2019s bill was filed, was so altering the dwelling-house upon her premises as to be used for a Chinese laundry in disregard of the plaintiff\u2019s notice, given seasonably, that the proposed alterations were in violation of the restrictions of the deed, and of the rights of the owners of other lots, and had executed and delivered a written lease of a part of her premises for use as a laundry. The proposed alterations and use would cause irreparable injury to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-6\">The judge found that the language of the various deeds contemplated a scheme of general improvement, and that there was an intention upon the part of the Trustees of the Hawes Fund at the time of the original conveyances to restrict the use of its land to residential purposes; that such intention was for the benefit of the entire tract which it intended to sell and did sell; that the restriction as to the character and height of the buildings, and their distance from the street, was uniform in deeds of all the land on K Street; that the proposed alteration and use of the defendant\u2019s premises would damage the plaintiff\u2019s land, injure the entire tract for residential purposes, and violate the restrictions in her deed; and that there had been no gradual infringement, and that the plaintiff was not guilty of loches. The judge entered a decree for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b447-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number><em>C.
