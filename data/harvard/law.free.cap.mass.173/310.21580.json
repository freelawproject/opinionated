At the trial in the Superior Court, before Maynard, J., the case was submitted to the jury upon the issues whether it was impossible, from mental or physical incapacity, for the intestate to give notice within ten days prescribed by statute, and upon the questions of due' care of the intestate, and the defect in the sidewalk on which the accident occurred. Upon the first two questions the jury found for the plaintiff, and reported a disagreement upon the latter question. Thereupon the judge ordered a verdict for the defendant ; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions. The facts appear in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-6\">The case was argued at the bar in November, 1898, and afterwards was submitted on briefs to all the justices except <em>Field, </em>C.

If such were the facts, under the provisions of Pub. Sts. c. 52, \u00a7 21, her administratrix might give the notice, and the presiding justice was therefore wrong in ordering a verdict for the defendant, as matter of law. The question of fact, if disputed, was for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
