If under my management, ownership, or control the said business shall be brought to a profitable and remunerative condition, out of the first profits thereof accruing to me and equal in amount to the said sum, I promise and undertake to pay to H.

Joshua S. Ingalls. May 25, 1887.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-3\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Sheldon, </em>J., it appeared that the taxes referred to in the agreement for 1887 were afterwards paid by the plaintiff, and amounted to $38.06, making a total of the two items which the defendant undertook conditionally to pay, $3,151.64; that the defendant took possession of the manufacturing plant and carried on the business until January 1,1894, when he sold it out; that from 1887 to 1891 inclusive the defendant put into the business the sum of $39,764.08 ; that this was carried on the books as a capital account, and interest credited thereon to the defendant; and that he was also credited on July 1, 1892, with $2,863.95, profits of the business for the first half of the year. But it did not appear what became of the profits subsequently made according to the profit and loss account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-5\">The judge found that the expenses or disbursements exceeded the receipts for the period from May 25, 1887, through 1890, by $12,110.69, and that the receipts exceeded the expenses for the years 1891 to 1893 by $9,054.64.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-6\">The judge found as facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-7\">\u201c1. That the business was brought to a profitable and remunerative condition in the year 1891; and 2. That in the year 1892 the defendant realized profits exceeding the sum claimed in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration, but not sufficient to make up his previous losses.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-9\">The plaintiff requested the judge to rule as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-10\">\u201c First profits,\u2019 within the meaning of the contract sued on, is not to be construed as meaning <em>net </em>profits, or profits remaining after the payment of all losses, if any, previously made, but is to be taken to mean the first excess of receipts over expenditures in the business.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-11\">The judge declined so to rule, and the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-12\">At the defendant\u2019s request the judge gave the following ruling:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-13\">\u201cIn determining whether or not there were profits to the amount of $3,151.64 while the business was under the ownership, management, or control of the defendant, the whole period of such ownership, management, or control is to be considered, and no particular portion thereof independently of the whole period.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>To this ruling the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-3\">The judge ruled that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover ; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b209-4\">G. <em>W. Anderson, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b209-5\"><em>B. E. Kemp, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b209-6\">Hammond, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Avqq\">This case presents a very narrow question as to the construction of that part of the contract which relates to the payment by the defendant to the plaintiff of profits accruing to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">The plaintiff contends that the meaning of the contract is that, no matter how great the losses of the defendant were in the first part of his management of the business, as soon as there came a period of time within the term of the management when, taking the business for that period by itself, there were profits, such profits accrued to the defendant within the meaning of the contract, and were payable to the plaintiff thereunder to the amount therein named, even although they were insufficient to offset the defendant\u2019s previous losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">The defendant contends that the question of profits has reference to the whole term of his management, so far at least as to require that the previous losses must be first extinguished.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">The court ruled substantially in accordance with the defendant\u2019s contention, and we think the ruling was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">The defendant was willing to pay $8,000 in cash for the property, and if he made anything out of the business he was willing the plaintiff should have the first profits to a certain amount. But so long as the account of the business under his management showed a loss, there were no profits accruing to the defendant. The construction contended for by the plaintiff would require the defendant to pay to him money as profits when during the term of his management the defendant had never seen the time when that management on the whole showed any pi'ofits accruing to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-11\">This does not seem to us a natural and reasonable construction of the language of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-12\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
