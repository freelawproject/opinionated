The action was originally begun in the Municipal Court of the city of Boston, and, after judgment there for the defendant, was carried by the plaintiff to the Superior Court on appeal. After its entry in that court the plaintiff discontinued the action. The defendant thereupon filed a complaint for failure to prosecute the appeal, upon which the Superior Court affirmed the judgment of the Municipal Court for the defendant, and the plaintiff appealed to this court, which in a former decision, reported in 171 Mass. 444, reversed the judgment of the Superior Court and ordered judgment for the defendant for costs only. The Superior Court thereupon taxed the defendant\u2019s costs, including costs accruing after the discontinuance of the action, and the plaintiff again appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b434-10\"><em>C.
