At the trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Hopkins, </em>J., after the jury had returned a verdict for the defendant, the plaintiff, filed the following motion to set aside the same: \u201cBecause that one or more of the members of said jury before whom the said cause was heard was or were spoken to in reference to the same, by one or more of the witnesses who testified 'in behalf of the defendant, both prior to and during the trial, and also by others.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-11\">There was evidence tending to show that after the evidence was all in and the court had adjourned to the following day, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>when the judge was to charge the jury, one William A. Reed, the foreman of said jury, was seen to get into the carriage of one of the defendant\u2019s witnesses in the case, named Banks, and drive down the street with him; and a juror testified that Banks drove up to the court-house gate, from the place where he had previously tied his horse, while engaged as a witness at the trial, and as the jury filed out of the same turned his horse around, and that Reed then got into his carriage and drove by the jury as they went down the street from the court-house.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-5\">The judge refused to grant the plaintiff\u2019s motion; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b147-6\"><em>J.

But we cannot say that what happened required the verdict to be set aside as matter of law. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Witt, </em>138 Mass. 79. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
