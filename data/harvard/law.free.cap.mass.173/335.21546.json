Trial in the Superior Court, without a jury, before Sherman, J., who reported the case for the determination of this court, in substance as follows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-10\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel, in opening, stated that on August 21, 1897, the plaintiff purchased at Charleston, Tennessee, of the Southern Railroad, a ticket to Boston, and at the same time delivered to the railroad company a trunk containing her wearing apparel and personal baggage, for which she received a check to Boston; that from Charleston to Boston the plaintiff travelled over six distinct railroads, her ticket having separate coupons for her passage over each road; that the last of these railroads was that extending from New York to Boston, and was owned and operated by the defendant; that each of the railroads sold tickets to passengers for passage beyond the line of its own road, stipulating, however, that in selling the tickets good for passage beyond its own road it acted simply as agent for such other road; that the plaintiff\u2019s trunk and contents were in good condition and properly packed when delivered to the Southern Railroad; that the plaintiff did not see the trunk from the time she checked it at Charleston until it was delivered to her by the defendant at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>Boston; and that upon opening it she discovered that its contents had been wet with water in some unknown manner, and greatly damaged, but was unable to show when, where, or how this damage occurred, or in whose possession the trunk was when the damage was done.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-5\">It was agreed that the judge might regard the facts stated by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel as proved, for the purposes of the case, and might draw inferences of fact therefrom.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-6\">The plaintiff then asked the judge to make the following ruling: \u201c Where, as in a case like this, personal baggage of a passenger who pays his fare is carried from the starting point to the destination over the lines of several connecting railroads, which are common carriers, the passenger checking the baggage ' through,\u2019 and retaining no control over it on the journey, and where the baggage thus taken care of and transported by the connecting railroads, and checked ' through,\u2019 was properly packed and in good condition at the beginning of the journey, and when said baggage on delivery by the last common carrier to the owner turns out to have been injured and damaged in transit, then and in that event the presumption is that the damage occurred while the baggage was in the care, custody, and control of the last of said connecting lines of railroad. And the presumption being as just stated, it is for the defendant in this case, whose line of railroad was the last line over which the plaintiff\u2019s baggage was transported, to exonerate itself from this presumption. And if it fails so to do, the plaintiff is entitled to a verdict.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-7\">The judge refused so to rule, on the ground that the plaintiff, as matter of law, was not entitled to the ruling, and found for the defendant. If the ruling should have been given, judgment was to be entered for the plaintiff for the sum of $258.75, and interest from the date of the writ; otherwise, judgment for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-8\">The case was argued at the bar in January, 1899, and afterwards was submitted on briefs to all the justices except Field, C. J.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b358-9\"><em>F. N. Nay, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b358-10\"><em>C.

The passage was over six connecting railroads ; it does not appear where the damage was done, and the plaintiff seeks to recover upon a presumption that the accident happened upon the last road.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">The so called presumption was started and justified as a true presumption of fact, that goods shown to have been delivered in good condition remain so until they are shown to be in bad condition, which happens only on their delivery. But it was much fortified by the argument that it was a rule of convenience, if not of necessity, like the rule requiring a party who relies upon a license to show it. 1 Greenl. Ev. \u00a7 79. Pub. Sts. c. 214, \u00a7 12. As we, in common with many other American courts, hold the first carrier not answerable for the whole transit, and not subject to an adverse presumption, <em>(Farmington Mercantile Co. </em>v. <em>Chicago, </em>Burlington, <em>Quincy Railroad, </em>166 Mass. 154,) it is almost necessary to call on the last carrier to explain the loss if the owner of the goods is to have any remedy at all. To do so is not unjust, since whatever means of information there may be are much more at the carrier\u2019s command than at that of a private person. These considerations have led most of the American courts that have had to deal with the question to hold that the presumption exists. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>New York Central Railroad, </em>43 Barb. 225, 228, 229; <em>S. C. </em>affirmed, 41 N. Y. 620. <em>Laughlin v. Chicago Northwestern Railway, </em>28 Wis. 204. <em>Memphis </em>&amp; <em>Charleston Railroad </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>9 Baxter, 188, 191. <em>Dixon </em>v. <em>Richmond &amp; Danville Railroad, </em>74 N. C. 538. <em>Leo </em>v. <em>St. Paul, Minneapolis, &amp; Manitoba Railway, </em>30 Minn. 438. <em>Montgomery &amp; Eufaula Railway </em>v. Culver, 75 Ala. 587, 593. <em>Beard </em>v. <em>Illinois Central Railway, </em>79 Iowa, 518. <em>Savannah, Florida, Western Railway </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>26 Fla. 148. <em>Faison </em>v. <em>Alabama &amp; Vicksburg Railway, </em>69 Miss. 569. <em>Forrester </em>v. <em>Greorgia Railroad </em>&amp; <em>Banking Co. </em>92 Ga. 699. In the opinion of the court, the weight of argument and authority is on that side. Mr. Justice Lathrop and I have not been able to free our minds from doubt because we are not fully satisfied that the court has not committed itself to a different doctrine. Still, it has not dealt with it in terms. In <em>Darling </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Worcester Railroad, </em>11 Allen, 295, the only question discussed was a question of contract. In <em>Swetland </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Albany Railroad, </em>102 Mass. 276, the question wus as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>to frozen apples. It appeared that the weather had been very cold before delivery to the defendant. The presumptio\u00fc was not mentioned. These are the two nearest cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiff.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
