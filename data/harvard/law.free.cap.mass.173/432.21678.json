Under this statute, there can be a recovery of damages only upon a petition \u201c brought within one year after the day of the date of the decree of the court confirming the decision \u201d of the commission appointed under \u00a7 1 of St. 1890, c. 428. It is argued that the words, \u201c in the same manner and under like rules of law as damages may be determined when occasioned by the taking of land for the locating and laying out of railroads and public ways, respectively,\u201d adopt into this statute the provisions of the Pub. Sts. c. 49, \u00a7\u00a7 88, 89, in regard to bringing a petition within six months after the land is actually entered upon in certain cases. But we think it very clear that these words do not modify the previous requirements that a petition, in order to be entertained, must be brought within one year after the date of the decree.
