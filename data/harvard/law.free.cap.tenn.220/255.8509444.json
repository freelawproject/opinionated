DuG-renier, Inc., for liquidated damages for the conversion of certain coin vending machines. The bill was filed on June 10, 1966, and alleged that on October 5, 1963, the defendant, a Massachusetts corporation not qualified nor domesticated to do business in this State, seized and confiscated the machines in Memphis. Complainant alleged this was a transaction of business in this State and a tort within the meaning of Chapter 67 of the Public Acts of 1965, known as Tennessee\u2019s new \u201cLong-Arm\u201d statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Services of process was obtained on the defendant under the Act codified as T.C.A. Sections 20-235 through 20-240, inclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The defendant filed a plea in abatement on the ground the legislation was unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">The Chancellor overruled the plea and granted defendant a discretionary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">We must dismiss the appeal as being premature. A decree overruling a plea in abatement is not an interlocutory decree from which an appeal will lie under T.C.A. Section 27-305. Thus, this Court has not acquired jurisdiction in the instant case. <em>Citizens\u2019 Bank and Trust Co. v. </em>Boyles, 153 Tenn. 40, 281 S.W. 932 (1925); <em>Employers\u2019 Indemnity Co. v. </em>Willard, 125 Tenn. 288, 151 S.W. 1029 (1911); <em>Younger v. Younger, </em>90 Tenn. 25, 16 S.W. 78 (1890).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">The appeal is dismissed at th\u00e9 cost of appellant.</p>\n<judges id=\"b274-10\">Burnett, Chief Justice, Dyer and Creson, Justices, and Harbison, Special Justice, concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
