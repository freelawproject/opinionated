We granted leave to determine whether \"house drops,\u201d a portion of the cable television system operating in the city, are owned by and assessable as the personal property of the cable company or, instead, are fixtures, taxable to each subscriber to whose home the cable runs.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-14\">We hold that the cable company owns the house <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>drops for ad valorem tax purposes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we hold that the city properly assessed to the cable company a personal property tax on the house drops for the three years in question. We affirm the Court of Appeals decision upholding the judgment of the Michigan Tax Tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">Petitioner-appellant, Continental Cablevision of Michigan, owns and operates a cable television system in the City of Roseville, the respondentappellee in this matter. Essentially, the system operates through cables which transmit television signals into the residences of subscribers. Three primary components comprise petitioner\u2019s system: (1) the main cables, which run underground or aerially along utility poles, (2) the house drops, which extend from the main cables into the subscribers\u2019 homes and end in wall plates resembling telephone jacks,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (3) the converters, which affix to the outlets, linking the television sets to the cable system. At issue in the instant case is the status of the house drops for tax purposes._</p>\n<p id=\"b877-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>Petitioner contends that a house drop, upon installation on a subscriber\u2019s real property, becomes a fixture properly assessable to the owner of the realty. Alternatively, petitioner suggests that each house drop is owned by and taxable as the personalty of each subscriber. Respondent, on the other hand, argues that petitioner retains ownership of house drops after installation. Thus, in the instant case, the house drops were properly taxed as the personal property of petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-4\">Petitioner was assessed taxes on the house drops for 1982, 1983, and 1984.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After failing to obtain relief from respondent\u2019s tax board of review,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>cable company filed a petition with the Michigan Tax Tribunal on May 20, 1982.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Eventually, similar petitions for 1983 and 1984 were consolidated.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">On February 25, 1985, a hearing was held before Tax Tribunal hearing officer Claris Kaye Cwirko. On June 7, 1985, the hearing officer rendered a proposed opinion, affirming the personal property assessments on the house drops. Petitioner filed exceptions to this proposed decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">However, in an order entered October 29, 1985, the Tax Tribunal adopted and incorporated by reference the findings of fact and conclusions of law in the hearing officer\u2019s proposed opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the Tax Tribunal. 158 Mich App 60; 404 NW2d 704 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-9\">The analysis adopted by the hearing officer, the Tax Tribunal, and the Court of Appeals is essentially identical. Each agreed that three factors must be examined in determining whether an item is a fixture: the degree of annexation to the realty, the nature of adaptation, and the intention of the parties. Each agreed that the first two elements were satisfied<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and that the dispositive issue in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>matter was the intention of the parties. The Court of Appeals succinctly set forth its analysis as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b879-1-pl-split\">1988] Continental v Roseville Opinion op the Court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-4\">The Tax Tribunal found that the first two criteria were met by the house drops. That finding is not in dispute on appeal. Rather, the controlling issue is the third factor. The tribunal found that petitioner did not intend that the house drops become fixtures. We believe the record supports this conclusion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-5\">When house drops are installed, the customer is charged $14.95. However, it costs petitioner approximately $40 in labor and materials to make the installation. By comparison, the charge to reconnect service to a residence with an existing house drop is $10. When service is disconnected, the house drops are not removed unless the customer so requests. Rather, service is turned off at the main cable line and the customer must turn in his converter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-6\">Also in the financial area is petitioner\u2019s treatment of the house drops costs for accounting purposes. The labor and material costs are capitalized and depreciated over a period of time. Petitioner treats the house drops as capitalized costs for federal and state tax returns. An accounting expert opined that petitioner\u2019s accounting methodology is inconsistent with the claim that petitioner does not own the house drops.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-7\">Next, the service agreement that petitioner enters into with its customers provides for continuing control of the entire system to be exercised by petitioner. Paragraph 2 of the agreement grants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>petitioner the right to install, maintain, repair and replace \"any and all components of the system.\u201d Paragraph 5 grants [the] exclusive right to repair and modify the system to petitioner. That paragraph also provides that the customer may not disturb, tamper with or reroute \"any component of the system.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-6\">However, it should be noted that, while the agreement explicitly provides in a number of places for petitioner\u2019s right to remove the converter upon termination of service, there is no explicit provision governing removal of the house drops. As noted above, house drops are not routinely removed. However, this does not compel the conclusion that the house drops are fixtures. Rather, the economics may be such that it is advisable to leave the house drops in. The house drops do not appear to have any known salvage value. Thus, it would be uneconomical to remove them. Second, since a future resident may desire service, or the same customer may wish to reconnect in the future, and the installation cost is greater than the installation charge, it could be more economical to leave the house drops in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-7\">In view of petitioner\u2019s accounting treatment of the house drops and that customers have no right of control over the house drops, we conclude that there is competent, material and substantial evidence to support the tribunal\u2019s conclusion that the house drops are personalty belonging to petitioner rather than fixtures or personalty belonging to the customers. [158 Mich App 64-65.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b880-8\">On March 9, 1987, petitioner filed an application for leave to appeal in this Court. We granted leave on June 30, 1987. 428 Mich 911 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b880-10\">The General Property Tax Act of Michigan<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> mandates that all real and personal property lo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>cated within the state, not expressly exempted, is subject to taxation. MCL 211.1; MSA 7.1. Real property is defined as \"all lands within the state, and all buildings and <em>fixtures </em>thereon . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Personal property, for purposes of taxation, means \"[a]ll goods, chattels, and effects within the state.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> According to the act, if the house drops in the case at bar are fixtures, then they are taxable to the owner or occupant of the realty.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> On the other hand, if the house drops are personalty, then they are assessable against the owner of the house drops.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b881-4\">Our scope of review in this matter is narrow. In the absence of fraud, appellate review of decisions of the Tax Tribunal is limited to determining whether the tribunal made an error of law or adopted a wrong principle; the factual findings of the tribunal are final, provided they are supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence on the whole record. Const 1963, art 6, \u00a728; <em>Fisher-New Center Co v State Tax Comm (On Rehearing), </em>381 Mich 713; 167 NW2d 263 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">Courts of this state have consistently applied a three-factor test to determine whether an item of property constitutes a fixture. The factors are: \" *[1] <em>annexation </em>to the realty, either actual or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>constructive; [2] <em>adaptation </em>or application to the use or purpose to which that part of the realty to which it is connected is appropriated; and [3] <em>intention </em>to make the article a permanent accession to the freehold.\u2019 \u201d <em>Peninsular Stove Co v Young, </em>247 Mich 580, 582; 226 NW 225 (1929); <em>Morris v Alexander, </em>208 Mich 387; 175 NW 264 (1919) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">The focus of our analysis is the intention to make the house drop a \"permanent accession\u201d to the freehold. Generally, this determination is made by examining the objective, visible facts. <em>Michigan Nat\u2019l Bank v City of Lansing, </em>96 Mich App 551, 554; 293 NW2d 626 (1980), affirmed by an equally divided Court 414 Mich 851; 322 NW2d 173 (1982). See also <em>San Diego Trust &amp; Savings Bank v San Diego Co, </em>16 Cal 2d 142; 105 P2d 94 (1940). It is undisputed herein, after viewing the objective visible facts, that petitioner intended that the house drops be permanently attached to the homes they serve. See above, n 7. However, this Court has long embraced the principle that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-7\">[t]he permanency of the attachment, and its character in law, do not depend so much upon the degree of physical force with which the thing is attached, or the manner and means of its attachment, as upon the motives and intention of the party in attaching it. If the intention is that the articles attached shall not by annexation become a part of the freehold, as a general rule they will not. <em>[Manwaring v Jenison, </em>61 Mich 117, 134-135; 27 NW 899 (1886). See also <em>Woodliff v Citizens Building &amp; Realty Co, </em>240 Mich 413, 416; 214 NW 343 (1927).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b882-9\">Although the physical facts demonstrate that Continental intended that the house drops remain in the subscribers\u2019 homes permanently, we must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>examine the other objective evidence offered in this case in order to determine whether petitioner intended that the house drops become \"accessions\u201d to the realty. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th ed), p 13, defines \"accession\u201d as \"[c]oming into possession of a right or office; increase; augmentation; addition.\u201d In our view, this definition implies a transfer of ownership and control over the property attached.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b883-4\">In the instant case, there was no express agreement that the house drops would, upon installation, become the property of the subscribers. Thus, our essential inquiry is to determine, from the objective evidence, whether the annexing party, i.e., Continental, intended to relinquish ownership and control over the house drops. <em>Kent Storage Co v Grand Rapids Lumber Co, </em>239 Mich 161, 165; 214 NW 111 (1927).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-5\">The intention considered is not a secret or undisclosed intent, but the apparent intent, <em>that inferred from all the facts and circumstances, </em>such as the relation and situation of the annexor, the policy of the law, the manner of annexation, and the purpose or use for which the annexation was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>made. [36A CJS, Fixtures, \u00a72b, p 596. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">The Court of Appeals held that the record supported the Tax Tribunal\u2019s determination that petitioner did not intend to relinquish ownership of the house drops. The Court reached this result by examining the service agreement entered into by petitioner and its subscribers, as well as the accounting and business practices of petitioner. Since \"all the surrounding circumstances\u201d are relevant for purposes of proving intent, we find that each of these inquiries was proper.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">In <em>Continental Cablevision of Michigan, Inc v City of Lansing, </em>unpublished opinion of the Michigan Tax Tribunal, decided September 30, 1982 (Docket Nos. 53491, 64619), as in the instant case, the Tax Tribunal examined the subscription agreement to determine the intention of petitioner, but held that house drops were fixtures for tax purposes. In the instant case, after a reexamination of the agreement, the tribunal reversed itself. We find the tribunal\u2019s latter analysis to be more persuasive than the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">We concur in the tribunal\u2019s finding that the agreement lacks any language from which it could be inferred that petitioner intended to relinquish ownership or control of the house drops. There is no language transferring title to or perfecting a gift in the subscriber. On the contrary, paragraph five provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-7\">All <em>repairs and modi\u00f1cations of the system shall be made only by ccmc </em>or its authorized agents. <em>Customer agrees not to disturb, tamper with, reroute or in any way interfere with any component </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number><em>of the system </em>unless authorized by ccmc. Customer further agrees that he will not attach any electric, electronic, or other type device thereto except a standard television or fm radio receiving set. Any unauthorized connection or modification of said installation will be considered a breach of the Agreement and thus cause for disconnection, and ccmc shall be entitled to recover damages for such tampering including, but not limited to, the value of ccmc service obtained without payment, the cost of repair or service, plus reasonable collection costs. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b885-4\">Thus, under the provisions of this paragraph, if a subscriber tampers with the house drop, petitioner may recover from that subscriber the cost of repairing or replacing it. In our view, petitioner\u2019s reservation of this right is inconsistent with its claim that it intended the house drops to become the property of its customers upon installation.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">Similarly, in paragraph two, petitioner secures the \"right to install, maintain, service[,] repair and replace any and all components of the system for the purpose of this agreement on the premises to be serviced.\u201d Again, reserving this unilateral right without providing for any additional charge to the customer is further evidence that petitioner intended to maintain ownership and control over the house drops after installation.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In paragraph <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>seven, petitioner also reserves the right to disconnect service \"at any time without notice and, at the option of ccmc the converter or <em>any other equipment </em>shall not be deemed . . . abandoned] . . . (Emphasis added.) This provision provides additional support for the tribunal\u2019s finding that petitioner intended to maintain control and ownership over the house drops. Finally, in paragraph nine, petitioner prohibits the subscriber from assigning any of its rights or duties under the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">Thus, taken as a whole, the service agreement, which was drafted by petitioner, provides ample evidence of Continental\u2019s intention to retain ownership and control over the house drops. On the face of the agreement, it appears obvious to this Court that petitioner intended merely to furnish cable service to customers for a fee. The function of the property in dispute, the house drops, was simply to assist in transmitting this service.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">Petitioner argues that paragraphs four and six of the service agreement militate against a finding that Continental intended to retain ownership and control over the house drops after installation. Paragraph six provides that \"the customer agrees to pay all federal, state, and local taxes, if any, which may in the future be imposed . . . with respect to service and installation charges for all equipment except converters.\u201d However, at issue in the instant case is ownership of the house drops for property tax purposes. Paragraph six speaks only to paying a hypothetical tax on \"service and installation charges\u201d which may or may not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>imposed in the future. Thus, we conclude that paragraph six is inapplicable in the instant action.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-4\">Paragraph four expressly reserves in petitioner ownership of the installed converter. Thus, if cable service is terminated, petitioner may enter the premises and recover the converter. Petitioner argues that because ownership of the house drops is not expressly reserved and because the house drops are not ordinarily removed when service is terminated, then petitioner intended the house drops, upon installation, to become the real property of the subscriber.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">We find this argument unpersuasive. Recently, in <em>Chillicothe Cablevision v Limbach, </em>unpublished opinion of the Ohio Court of Appeals, decided June 5, 1987 (Docket No. 1341),<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the court held that the cable company retains ownership of installed house drops for property tax purposes. In reaching its result, the court discussed two prior tax commission cases, <em>In re Telerama, </em>unpublished opinion of the Ohio Tax Commission, decided January 8, 1975 (Docket No. 13269), holding that \"set connectors\u201d (synonym for \"house drops\u201d) are fixtures because the cable company made no claim of ownership to or control over them, and <em>Communication Properties, Inc v Lindley, </em>CCH Ohio Tax Rpts 200-245 (Ohio Board of Tax Appeals, Docket No. 77-C-60) (August 15, 1978), holding that house drops are the personalty of the cable company since the company specifically reserved ownership of them in its service agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\"><em>Chillicothe, supra </em>is analogous to the instant case because neither cable company expressly reserved ownership of the house drops. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>instead of concluding that Chillicothe Cablevision intended the house drops to become permanent accessions to the realty, the court reasoned, and we agree, that no authority requires such an explicit reservation of ownership in order for the house drops to remain the personal property of the cable company. Our task, again, is to examine <em>all </em>of the surrounding circumstances in order to determine petitioner\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">In the instant case, the Tax Tribunal and the Court of Appeals examined petitioner\u2019s business and accounting practices in order to determine its intention regarding the house drops. Similarly, in <em>Comcast Cablevision, Inc v Sterling Heights, </em>unpublished opinion of the Michigan Tax Tribunal, decided August 20, 1987 (Docket No. 89712), the tribunal examined the company\u2019s trade and bookkeeping customs<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and concluded that house drops are the taxable personal property of the cable company.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Other states faced with this issue have also examined such practices in order to determine the intention of the cable company. See, e.g., <em>Chillicothe, supra; Horizon Communications Corp v Schneider, </em>unpublished opinion of the Missouri Tax Commission, decided January 22, 1987 (Docket No. 84-10083).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">Evidence introduced at the hearing, in the case at bar, demonstrated that a subscriber pays $14.95 to have a house drop installed. However, the actual cost to petitioner for labor and materials is $40. Petitioner does not remove the house drops when service is terminated unless the customers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>so request. Instead, service is disconnected at the main cable. When a person moves into a residence having an existing house drop, the charge to reconnect is only $10. Petitioner claims that its failure to remove the house drops is evidence of its intent to abandon and relinquish ownership of them. We disagree and concur in the tribunal\u2019s finding that the house drops are left in place not because of ownership by the subscriber, but because it would be too expensive to remove the house drops each time service is terminated. We conclude, therefore, that petitioner has made a conscious business decision to leave the house drops intact as an incentive to future residents to subscribe. See <em>Chillicothe, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b889-4\">Further evidence of petitioner\u2019s intent to retain ownership of the installed house drops is the company\u2019s practice of carrying house drops on its books as depreciable capital assets and taking deductions for them on its federal and state income tax returns.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> At the hearing, an accounting expert testified that these practices are wholly inconsistent with the claim that petitioner does not own the house drops.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">Petitioner argues that listing house drops on the company books as depreciable assets and deducting their value for income tax purposes is not controlling as to the issue of ownership. See <em>Tele-Vue Systems, Inc v Contra Costa Co, </em>25 Cal App 3d 340; 101 Cal Rptr 789 (1972); <em>Bylund v Dep\u2019t of Revenue, </em>9 Or Tax Rptr 76 (1981).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b890-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>While we agree that petitioner\u2019s tax and accounting practices are not <em>controlling </em>in this case, we find, nonetheless, that such practices are <em>relevant </em>for the purpose of proving petitioner\u2019s intention. We reiterate that \"all the surrounding circumstances\u201d must be examined in determining Continental\u2019s intention regarding the house drops.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">Under the provisions of 26 USC 167, depreciation is an allowance for deterioration of income-producing assets. The theory of depreciation assumes that property wears out with use and age and will have to be replaced. Ordinarily, only the owner of the asset suffers wear and tear and, therefore, only the owner is eligible for depreciation deductions. <em>Urbanek v United States, </em>731 F2d 870, 874, n 7 (CA Fed, 1984), cert den 469 US 1034 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">Petitioner cites three cases for the proposition that a person need not own property in order to claim depreciation deductions. However, in each of these cases, the person claiming the deduction had rights in the property equivalent to legal ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">In <em>Helvering v F &amp; R Lazarus &amp; Co, </em>308 US 252; 60 S Ct 209; 84 L Ed 226 (1939), the taxpayer, although not the legal titleholder, possessed a lease interest in the property for ninety-nine years. Similarly, in <em>Gladding Dry Goods Co v Comm\u2019r, 2 </em>BTA 336 (1925), the taxpayer had a lease interest giving him beneficial use of the property taxed. Finally, in <em>Loveman &amp; Son Export Corp v Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>34 TC 776 (1960), aff'd 296 F2d 732 (CA 6, 1961), cert den 369 US 860 (1962), a taxpayer, who had constructed a paved road, title to which was technically vested in the local municipality, was allowed to depreciate it. The commission allowed the depreciation because the road was built by the taxpayer, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>necessary to the operation of the taxpayer\u2019s business, and was of no real use to anyone other than the taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">Thus, while we do not find controlling the fact that petitioner claims depreciation deductions for the house drops and lists them as assets on the company books, we do find that such practices provide additional support for the tribunal\u2019s finding that petitioner intended to retain ownership of and control over the house drops after installation.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">Respondent urges this Court to treat house drops as other utility drops for purposes of taxation. MCL 211.8(g); MSA 7.8(g) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-8\">For the purposes of taxation, personal property shall include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-9\">(g) The personal property of gas and coke companies, natural gas companies, electric light companies, waterworks companies, hydraulic companies, and pipe line companies transporting oil or gas as public or common carriers, to be assessed in the township, village, or city where the personal property is located. <em>The mains, pipes, supports, and wires of these companies, including the supports and wire or other line used for communication purposes in the operation of those facilities, and the rights of way and the easements or other interests in land by virtue of which the mains, pipes, supports, and wires are erected and maintained, shall be assessed as personal property in the township, village, or city where laid, placed, or located. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">Thus, from the language of this ninety-five-year-old statute, ordinary utility lines and supports are to be assessed as personal property of the utility company. Although cable companies are not specifically listed along with other public utilities under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>subsection 8(g), case law suggests that cable television may be a public utility for taxation purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">In <em>White v Detroit Edison Co, </em>a companion case to <em>White v Ann Arbor, </em>406 Mich 554; 281 NW2d 283 (1979), this Court held that cable television is a public utility within the meaning of the Subdivision Control Act.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> MCL 560.102(1); MSA 26.430(102)(1) defines a public utility:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-5\">\"Public utility\u201d means all persons, firms, corporations, copartnerships or municipal or other public authority providing gas, electricity, water, steam, telephone, sewer, or other services of a similar nature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">Since cable television was not listed in subsection 102(1), we concluded that it could only be deemed a public utility if it is an \"other service[ ] of a similar nature\u201d to one of those listed in the statute. Construing subsection 102(1) in a manner so as to carry out the intention of the Legislature, this Court reasoned that cable television is \"similar\u201d to telephone service since both transmit communication signals along power lines. Thus, for purposes of the Subdivision Control Act, cable television is a public utility.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">On the other hand, in <em>White v Ann Arbor, supra, </em>we held that a cable system is not a public utility within the meaning of Const 1963, art 7, \u00a7 25, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-8\">No city or village shall acquire <em>any public utility furnishing light, heat or power, </em>or grant any public utility franchise which is not subject to revocation at the will of the city or village, unless the proposition shall first have been approved by three-fifths of the electors voting thereon. [Emphasis added.]_</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b893-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>From the plain meaning of the words of art 7, \u00a7 25 and from a review of the Official Record of the Michigan Constitutional Convention, we concluded that \"public utility\u201d is limited to those utilities furnishing light, heat, or power. Thus, for purposes of art 7, \u00a725, cable television is not a public utility.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\">In the instant case, we do not view the language of subsection 8(g) to be as constrictive as art 7, \u00a7 25 in <em>White v Ann Arbor; </em>nor do we view the statute herein to be as open-ended as subsection 102(1) in <em>White v Detroit Edison. </em>To date, the Legislature has not included cable television as one of the utilities in subsection 8(g), and we can properly assume that the Legislature did not even contemplate cable television when it drafted subsection 8(g) in 1893.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">However, although we agree that cable television is not a \"public utility\u201d as defined by the Michigan Constitution, we can find no justifiable rationale for treating house drops differently than other utility drops for purposes of taxation.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We find persuasive the analogy between cable televi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>sion and other public utilities drawn by Justice Moody in his concurrence in <em>White v Ann Arbor, supra, </em>p 575:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-4\">Although this limited constitutional definition of public utility excludes cable television, it is imperative to recognize on a practical level that cable television possesses all the attributes of a public utility. While the term \"public utility\u201d has eluded precise definition, this Court has defined the term as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-5\">\"Utility means the state or quality of being useful. Was this plant [waterworks company] one useful to the public? If so, it was a public utility.\u201d <em>Schurtz v Grand Rapids, </em>208 Mich 510, 524; 175 NW 421 (1919).[<footnotemark>24</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">Furthermore, in <em>Michigan Consolidated Gas Co v Michigan Tax Comm, </em>4 Mich App 33; 143 NW2d 606 (1966), on remand to the Michigan State Tax Commission, <em>In re Appeal No 1524 of Michigan Consolidated Gas Co, </em>unpublished proposed order issued June 6, 1967, where the gas company unsuccessfully contested taxes assessed on pipe lines running from the customers\u2019 property lines to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>meters attached to the homes (analogous to house drops), the commission stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-4\">It is anomalous to contend that the Gas Company, for rate purposes, \"owns\u201d that proportion of the service lines for which it has paid but that it has no ownership whatever for purposes of ad valorem taxation. As long as the Michigan Consolidated Gas Company is allowed to deduct the expense of maintaining the service lines and to earn a reasonable rate of return upon its contribution to the service pipelines, it is only right and proper that it suffer taxation thereon.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Accordingly, in the instant case, upon examination of petitioner\u2019s subscription agreement, its business and accounting practices, and the treatment afforded to other utilities in the area of taxation, we hold that the findings of the Tax Tribunal are supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence. We, therefore, affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals and hold that the City of Roseville properly assessed to Continental Cablevision a personal property tax for the years 1982, 1983, and 1984.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<judges id=\"b896-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>Brickley, Cavanagh, Boyle, Archer, and Griffin, JJ., concurred with Riley, C.J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b876-8\"> Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (4th ed), p 58, defines \"ad valorem\u201d to mean \"[a]ccording to value.\u201d \"The term <em>ad valorem </em>tax means a tax or duty upon the value of the article or thing subject to taxation.\u201d <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Arthur v Johnston, </em>185 SC 324, 330; 194 S\u00c9 151 (1937).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b876-9\"> If the main cable runs underground, then the house drop begins at a catv \"pedestal\u201d and continues to run underground (at least eighteen inches below the surface) to a \"ground block\u201d which is attached to the residence.

The majority summarizes its analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-6\">[I]n the instant case, upon examination of petitioner\u2019s subscription agreement, its business and accounting practices, and the treatment afforded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>to other utilities in the area of taxation, we hold that the findings of the Tax Tribunal are supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence.[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">In my opinion, the only evidence that might support the findings of the Tax Tribunal is the failure of the subscription agreement to provide unequivocally that title, ownership, and control of the house drops are vested in the owners of the realty. Substantial other evidence tends to support Continental\u2019s claim that it did relinquish title, ownership, and control.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">The treatment of gas and electric utility house drops for ad valorem tax purposes, provided by statute,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> does not bear on whether Continental intended that cable television house drops installed for its subscribers would become permanent accessions to the realty. Nor is it pertinent to an inquiry focusing on Continental\u2019s intention whether there is a \"justifiable rationale\u201d for treating house drops differently than other utility drops for purposes of taxation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Those are considerations for the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b897-10\">Continental\u2019s accounting practices are not inconsistent with its assertion that it intended that the house drops become permanent accessions to the realty. Although Continental may have preferred to expense the difference between the $40 cost of installation of a house drop and the $14.95 paid by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>the subscriber for installation of a house drop in the year in which the expenditure was made, the Internal Revenue Service apparently takes the position that the difference cannot be expensed but may be depreciated. The federal income tax treatment does not depend on whether Continental retains ownership<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> or, alternatively, whether ownership is vested in the owners of the realty. Even if title to the house drops were to be vested incontrovertibly in the owners of the realty, Continental would be entitled to claim depreciation deductions for the unamortized portion of the difference and could not accelerate the timing of depreciation allowances.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">Since, the federal income tax treatment and Continental\u2019s accounting practices in that regard are controlled by federal law, Continental\u2019s attempts to comply with that law as administered by the Internal Revenue Service are not any evidence at all on the question presented whether Continental intended that the house drops become permanent accessions to the realty.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">The provisions of the subscription agreement reserving to Continental the right, <em>during the term of the </em>agreement, to repair and replace all components, including house drops, connected to its cable system, and precluding the customer, <em>during the term of the </em>agreement, from interfering with the system, are not inconsistent with Continental\u2019s assertion that the house drops had become permanent accessions to the realty. These provisions of the subscription agreement seek to provide a means of maintaining the integrity of the cable system and of complying with Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>Communications Commission regulations<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> designed to prevent signal leakage that might interfere with other communications including flight control systems. Continental\u2019s efforts to comply with federal regulations do not tend to negative Continental\u2019s assertion that it intended that the house drops become permanent accessions to the realty.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-4\">Continental would have the same obligation to comply with fcc regulations if the house drops had been installed by the owner of the realty. Continental\u2019s obligation arises under federal law when the house drop \u2014 without regard to who installs, owns, or otherwise controls it \u2014 is connected into its cable system.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">The subscriber-owner of the realty can terminate the asserted ownership and control of Continental at will, after any notice that is provided for in the subscription agreement. Once the subscription agreement is terminated, the subscriber-owner of the realty may do whatever he may wish with the house drop. Continental would then have no further right to maintain, repair, or alter the house drop. Continental has never sought to exercise rights over house drops following termination of service to a subscriber and has never removed a house drop except to repair or replace it. Continental expressly reserves ownership in and the right to remove the converter, thereby indicating, under established rules of contract construction, that it did not intend to retain ownership of the house drops.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">There is no reason to suppose that Continental would desire to retain ownership of the house <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>drops.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> There is no advantage to Continental in retaining ownership<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> or in retaining control beyond such control as may be required by fcc regulations during such periods of time that a house drop is connected to Continental\u2019s cable system.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">Continental has every reason to relinquish ownership and all other control.
