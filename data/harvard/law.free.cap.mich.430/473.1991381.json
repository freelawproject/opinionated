Our answer is in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">Gene Christopher Schneider, a seven-year-old boy, was admitted to Lansing General Hospital for a tonsillectomy and bilateral tympanotomy. On June 16, 1978, following the tympanotomy and before the tonsillectomy, the child suffered a cardiac arrest. After half an hour of resuscitative effort, the child resumed a spontaneous heartbeat, and was taken to the intensive care unit where he was placed on a respirator and cardiac monitor. Several physicians on the hospital staff examined the child and directed treatment in the intensive care unit. On the following day, a second cardiac arrest occurred. The child\u2019s condition continued to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>deteriorate until his death six days later, on June 22, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">Plaintiffs, the personal representative and parents of the decedent, filed this wrongful death action in the Ingham Circuit Court. Among defendants named were Jana Palmer, a certified nurse anesthetist who administered anesthesia for the surgery, and Jack Gilmore, D.O., the supervising anesthesiologist. Both were employed by Capital Anesthesiologists, P.C., which had a contract to perform anesthesia in the hospital. Additional defendants included the Lansing General Hospital; Gerald Gilroy, D.O., who performed the surgery; David Sciamanna, D.O., a resident pediatrician; and several other physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Capital Anesthesiologists and physicians other than those named above were dismissed for reasons unrelated to this appeal. Prior to trial plaintiffs entered into a settlement and release agreement with Nurse Palmer in exchange for a payment of $85,000. Shortly after the trial began, plaintiffs also entered into a settlement and release agreement with Dr. Gilmore. The latter was a structured settlement providing for a cash payment of $72,000 and for installment payments over a period of twenty years or more, depending upon the life of the decedent\u2019s father, with a guaranteed total of at least $417,000. In both instances, a release was executed in consideration of the settlement payments and a provision was included in the release specifically reserving plaintiffs\u2019 claims against the remaining defendants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ABqb\">Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint included allegations of inde<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>pendent negligence<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on the part of the hospital. The complaint also charged the hospital with vicarious liability for negligence on the part of Palmer and Gilmore who, although not employees of the hospital, were alleged to be ostensible agents of the hospital under <em>Grewe v Mt Clemens General Hosp, </em>404 Mich 240; 273 NW2d 429 (1978). During the course of the trial the hospital moved to strike all allegations of negligence on the part of Palmer and Gilmore upon the theory that the settlements operated to release the hospital from vicarious liability for the torts of Palmer and Gilmore. Although the trial judge recognized the common-law rule that release of an agent discharges the principal, he nevertheless denied the motions to strike and admitted evidence of negligence on the part of Palmer and Gilmore on the ground that it was necessary to the jury\u2019s understanding of independent negligence claims against the remaining defendants, Lansing General, Dr. Sciamanna, and Dr. Gilroy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>After a two-week trial, the jury returned a verdict against the hospital of $1 million, and found no cause of action against Drs. Gilroy and Sciamanna. The trial court reduced the amount of the verdict to $742,261, allowing for a setoff of amounts received from the settlements with Palmer and Gilmore.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">Initially, the judgment below was affirmed by the Court of Appeals; however, on rehearing it was reversed. While holding that the release of Palmer and Gilmore discharged the hospital from liability on a theory of respondeat superior, the Court recognized that such a release provided no protection from liability for independent acts of negligence. However, after noting that the trial court had granted the hospital a directed verdict on all but one of plaintiffs\u2019 claims of independent negligence against the hospital, the panel\u2019s majority concluded on rehearing that as to the single remaining claim<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> there was \"no competent evidence or expert testimony\u201d to support it. Finding the evidence insufficient to submit a question of the hospital\u2019s independent negligence to the jury, the Court of Appeals set aside the verdict and remanded the case for a new trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">We granted leave to appeal, limited to two issues: (1) whether the settlements reached with Palmer and Gilmore released the hospital from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>vicarious liability for their actions under MCL 600.2925d; MSA 27A.2925(4); and (2) whether the releases, if not so protected, should be reformed as covenants not to sue. 426 Mich 864 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Since it was determined below that the hospital was not guilty of any independent act of negligence \u2014 an issue that is not before us on appeal\u2014 recovery against the hospital is precluded except on a theory of vicarious liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Although plaintiffs alleged that Palmer and Gilmore were agents of the hospital, they were actually employees of Capital Anesthesiologists, P.C. However, since Capital had an exclusive contract to perform anesthesia within the hospital, and the choice of an anesthetist or anesthesiologist was made without consultation with the decedent\u2019s parents, it is contended that Palmer and Gilmore were ostensible agents, or agents by estoppel, under <em>Grewe, supra. </em>We proceed with our analysis on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">At common law a valid release of an agent for tortious conduct operates to bar recovery against the principal on a theory of vicarious liability, even though the release specifically reserves claims against the principal. 53 Am Jur 2d, Master and Servant, \u00a7 408, pp 416-418; 126 ALR 1199; 76 CJS, Release, \u00a7 50, p 689. See <em>Bacon v United States, </em>321 F2d 880 (CA 8, 1963); <em>Max v Spaeth, </em>349 SW2d 1 (Mo, 1961). Michigan courts have adhered to this common-law rule. <em>Geib v Slater, </em>320 Mich 316; 31 NW2d 65 (1948), overruled on other grounds <em>Moore v Palmer, </em>350 Mich 363; 86 NW2d 585 (1957); <em>Lincoln v Gupta, </em>142 Mich App <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>615; 370 NW2d 312 (1985); <em>Willis v Total Health Care, </em>125 Mich App 612; 337 NW2d 20 (1983); <em>Drinkard v William J Pulte, Inc, </em>48 Mich App 67; 210 NW2d 137 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Plaintiffs argue that this common-law rule is inapplicable in the instant case by reason of the Michigan contribution act, MCL 600.2925; MSA 27A.2925. In particular they point to \u00a7 2925d which, as amended in 1974, reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-6\">When a release or a covenant not to sue or not to enforce judgment is given in good faith to 1 of 2 or more persons <em>liable in tort </em>for the same injury or the same wrongful death:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-7\">(a) It does not discharge any of the <em>other tortfeasors </em>from liability for the injury or wrongful death unless its terms so provide. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">Plaintiffs argue that the word \"tortfeasors\u201d in the statute includes persons whose liability is based solely upon the theory of respondeat superior, as in the case of principal and agent. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">The Michigan contribution act does not include a definition of the terms \"1 of 2 or more persons liable in tort,\u201d or \"other tort-feasors,\u201d as used in the above-quoted \u00a7 2925d. The Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act, 12 ULA 63, \u00a7 4 (1955 rev), upon which the Michigan act is based, likewise fails to define the term \"tortfeasor.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Hence, the present question has arisen, and a split has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>developed among the jurisdictions<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> as to whether a vicariously liable principal is a \"tortfeasor\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2925d.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">At common law and prior to enactment in 1941 of the Michigan contribution statute,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 1941 PA 303, contribution was not recoverable among or between tortfeasors. <em>O\u2019Dowd v General Motors Corp, </em>419 Mich 597, 603; 358 NW2d 553 (1984). Also, at common law the release of one joint tortfeasor automatically released other joint tortfeasors, although the release of a concurrent tortfeasor did not release other concurrent tortfeasors. See <em>Witucke v Presque Isle Bank, </em>68 Mich App 599; 243 NW2d 907 (1976); <em>McBride v Scott, </em>132 Mich 176; 93 NW 243 (1903). In <em>MacDonald v Henry Hornblower &amp; Weeks, </em>268 Mich 626, 628-629; 256 NW 572 (1934), this Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-6\">The law of joint tortfeasors has been the subject of many refinements of reasoning and much conflict of opinion. . . . The underlying principle is that the tort is single and the cause of action indivisible and exists against all feasors or none. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-7\">[W]hen the cause of action is destroyed as to one tortfeasor, it falls as to the others, even though it is attempted to preserve the liability of the others. So, where one tortfeasor is released from liability on payment of part of the damage, the others are discharged although the contract expressly re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>serves right of action against them. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">However, common-law rules which once governed contribution rights among joint and concurrent tortfeasors should not be confused with the deeply rooted common-law doctrine that release of an agent discharges the principal from vicarious liability. The rationale for the latter rule is entirely different and is grounded on the very nature of the principal\u2019s derivative liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Vicarious liability is indirect responsibility imposed by operation of law. In modern jurisprudence, vicarious liability is justified as \"a rule of policy, a deliberate allocation of a risk.\u201d Prosser &amp; Keeton, Torts (5th ed), \u00a7 69, p 500. As explained in <em>Dessauer v Memorial General Hosp, </em>96 NM 92, 108; 628 P2d 337 (1981),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-7\">\"Vicarious liability is based on a relationship between the parties, irrespective of participation, either by act or omission, of the one vicariously liable, under which it has been determined as a matter of policy that one person should be liable for the act of the other. Its true basis is largely one of public or social policy under which it has been determined that, irrespective of fault, a party should be held to respond for the acts of another.\u201d [Citing <em>Nadeau v Melin, </em>260 Minn 369, 375-376; 110 NW2d 29 (1961).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">More bluntly stated, \" '[i]n hard fact, the reason for the employers\u2019 liability is the damages are taken from a deep pocket.\u2019 \u201d Prosser &amp; Keeton, <em>supra, </em>p 500, quoting Baty, Vicarious Liability (1916), p 154. The principal, having committed no tortious act, is not a \"tortfeasor\u201d as that term is commonly defined. According to Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th ed), a tortfeasor is \"a wrong-doer; one who commits or is guilty of a tort.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>Although enactment in 1941 of Michigan\u2019s contribution statute narrowed the scope of concomitant doctrines applicable to contribution and release, this Court made clear in <em>Geib, supra, </em>that the statute did not abrogate the common-law rule that release of an agent discharges the principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">The defendant in <em>Geib </em>was guilty of no wrongdoing. However, he was vicariously liable as the owner of an automobile which was negligently operated by another.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Prior to trial, plaintiff settled with and released the negligent driver. However, by its terms the release did not discharge the owner-defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The defendant in <em>Geib </em>moved for summary judgment on the ground that release of the negligent driver operated to release the owner. Opposing the motion, plaintiff pointed to \u00a7 2 of the 1941 Michigan contribution statute which in essence provided that a claimant\u2019s release of one joint tortfeasor would not impair the claimant\u2019s right of action against other joint tortfeasors who were not released.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Holding the statute inapplicable because the defendant was not a joint tortfeasor, the <em>Geib </em>Court, in a unanimous opinion,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> reasoned that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>\"[defendant is guilty of no tortious act; he did not participate in the commission of the tort; and his liability arises only by operation of law.\u201d The Court compared the vicarious liability of the automobile owner \"with that of a surety for the honesty of an employee, whose obligation differs from that of his surety.\u201d 320 Mich 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">A brief review of the development of Michigan\u2019s contribution statute will demonstrate that the Legislature focused on other concerns and evinced no intention to abrogate the common-law rule that release of an agent discharges the principal from vicarious liability. After it was enacted, the 1941 statute was criticized for several reasons. First, the statute allowed contribution only if a \"joint judgment\u201d was obtained, thereby allowing the plaintiff to favor one joint tortfeasor over others. Second, it made contribution available to the insurer of one who was jointly or severally liable, thereby differentiating unfairly between insured and uninsured persons. Third, contribution under the statute did not apply to <em>concurrent </em>tortfeasors but only to <em>\"joint </em>tortfeasors.\u201d See discussion in <em>Moyses v Spartan Asphalt Paving Co, </em>383 Mich 314, 327-328; 174 NW2d 797 (1970); <em>Morgan v McDermott, </em>382 Mich 333, 371-372; 169 NW2d 897 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">In 1961 the Legislature enacted a virtual redraft of the 1941 act as part of the Revised Judicature Act. 1961 PA 236. The few changes made dealt principally with the \"joint judgment\u201d criticism, <em>Morgan, supra, </em>pp 374-375, and the accommodation of court rule revisions applicable to third-party practice. <em>Moyses, supra, </em>p 329. However, as Justice Black, writing for the <em>Moyses </em>Court, saw it,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-6\">Section 2925 [of 1961 PA 236] is a near-verbatim redraft of PA 1941, No 303 (CL 1948, \u00a7 691.561 <em>et </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number><em>seq.). </em>It turned out in the interval that the act of 1941 was considerably short of its supposedly purposeful aim; that of providing the substantive right of contribution between or among jointly liable or severally liable but not wilful tortfeasors. Section 2925 is correspondingly deficient, it having provided the desired right only to the extent of contribution between or among litigant \"joint tortfeasors,\u201d and that only upon the nod of the plaintiff or of the possibly whimsical circuit judge. [383 Mich 327.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">In <em>Moyses </em>this Court considered whether the defendant in a negligence action was entitled to contribution from another tortfeasor whose liability to the plaintiff was several, but not joint. Frustrated by the fact that the 1961 statute limited contribution rights to \"joint tortfeasors,\u201d the <em>Moyses </em>Court announced:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">[W]e have decided to overrule what is left of Michigan\u2019s common-law bar of contribution between or among \"wrongdoers,\u201d wilful or intentional wrongdoers excepted. [383 Mich 334.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">In addition to its use of the word \"wrongdoers,\u201d the Court provided other guidance concerning the scope of its overruling action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-8\">When one speaks specifically of <em>joint tortfeasors, </em>he does not refer (a) to wrongdoers the liabilities of whom arise out of variant legal positions, the concurrently applied but legally different derelictions of whom make them <em>severally </em>responsible to the plaintiff in damages, or (b) to the acts or omissions of several who act independently rather than in concert, or (c) to those who may \u2014 under present rules of court \u2014 be joined as defendants, <em>by the plaintiff </em>(see GCR 1963, 206), and held responsible to him for damages sustained on account of their causally cooperating but non-joint acts or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>omissions, say by the negligence of one, the violation of a statute like the dramshop act by another, and the breach by still another of an express or legally implied warranty. <em>[Id., </em>pp 331-332. Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Thereafter, within a few years of the <em>Moyses </em>decision, the Legislature enacted the present version of the contribution statute. 1974 PA 318. As this Court explained in <em>O\u2019Dowd, supra, </em>604,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-6\">The former limitation on contribution among tortfeasors to the class of tortfeasors where a judgment was obtained against two or more persons jointly was thought to preclude contribution where (i) the acts of the tortfeasors were separate, independent, or concurrent rather than joint or in concert, or (ii) where the tortfeasors were liable in tort on diiferent legal theories. The revised act by explicitly providing for contribution among tortfeasors \"severally\u201d liable in tort extended contribution to these situations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">There can be no doubt that the Legislature intended by its 1974 revision to expand the right of contribution. However, there is no basis in the legislative history for the contention that it also intended to abrogate the common-law doctrine that release of an agent discharges the principal. Rather, the Legislature\u2019s more evident purpose was to satisfy the criticisms of <em>Moyses </em>by adopting its holding, which extended contribution <em>as a matter of common law </em>to <em>wrongdoers, </em>whether \"jointly\u201d or \"severally\u201d liable. By its use throughout the 1974 statute of \"tortfeasor,\u201d rather than \"joint tortfeasor,\u201d the Legislature made evident its purpose to incorporate, not abrogate, the then-existing common law as fashioned in <em>Moyses.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">Despite the fact that there were three opportunities to do so, the Legislature has never expressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>an intent to make the change in law contended for by plaintiffs in this case. Obviously, the Legislature could easily have accomplished such a purpose by defining the word \"tortfeasor\u201d as used in the act to include one who, though guilty of no wrong, is vicariously liable for the tort of another. Instead, the Legislature chose in its 1961 and 1974 versions to eliminate altogether a definition of \"joint tortfeasor\u201d which had been included in the 1941 act.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">Of primary importance to this discussion is the fundamental principle that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-5\">statutes in derogation of the common law must be strictly construed, . . . and will not be extended by implication to abrogate established rules of common law .... The statute . . . must be construed sensibly and in harmony with the legislative purpose. <em>[Rusinek v Schultz, Snyder &amp; Steele Lumber Co, </em>411 Mich 502, 508; 309 NW2d 163 (1981), reh den 412 Mich 1101 (1981). See also <em>Hack Investment Co v Concrete Wall Co, </em>356 Mich 416; 97 NW2d 106 (1959).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">In interpreting a statute containing language virtually identical to \u00a7 2925d(a), the Illinois Court of Appeals in <em>Bristow v Grifiitts Const Co, </em>140 Ill App 3d 191; 488 NE2d 332 (1986), reached a conclusion similar to ours. Noting that \"[t]he common law is not to be deemed abrogated by statute unless it clearly appears that was the legislative intent,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 193, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-7\">The resolution of this case depends upon the meaning of the word \"tortfeasors\u201d as used in section 2(c). The plaintiffs maintain the word is synonymous with the phrase \"one or more persons liable in tort arising out of the same injury.\u201d A tortfeasor has also been defined as a \"wrong-doer; one who commits or is guilty of a tort.\u201d (Black\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>Law Dictionary 1335 [5th ed, 1979].) Under the doctrine of vicarious liability, an employer is held liable to a third party even when the employer is free from all fault. The doctrine is justified as a deliberate allocation of risk. The employer, having engaged in a business and seeking to profit from it, is better able to foresee harm caused by the negligence of his employees and to insure against it than the innocent third party. (Prosser &amp; Keeton, Torts sec. 69, at 499-501 [5th ed, 1984].) Thus, the employer is held liable as a matter of policy, but he is not a wrongdoer' The liability of the master and servant for the acts of the servant is deemed that of one tortfeasor and is a consolidated or unified one. <em>(Towns v Yellow Cab Co </em>[1978], 73 Ill 2d 113, 124; 382 NE2d 1217, 1221.) The master, therefore, would not be \"any of the other tortfeasors.\u201d <em>[Id., </em>pp 193-194.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">We are convinced that our interpretation of \u00a72925d harmonizes with other provisions of the contribution act.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> For example, \u00a7 2925b provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-5\">Except as otherwise provided by law, in determining the pro rata shares of tortfeasors in the entire liability as between themselves only and without affecting the rights of the injured party to a joint and several judgment:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-6\">(a) Their relative degrees of fault shall be considered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-7\">(b) If equity requires, <em>the collective liability of some as a group shall constitute a single </em>share._</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>(c) Principles of equity applicable to contribution generally shall apply. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The Commissioners\u2019 Comment to \u00a7 2 of the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act, 12 ULA 87, upon which this part of the Michigan statute is based, indicates that the vicarious liability of a principal/employer is subsumed by that of a tortfeasor agent/employee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-6\">This section in positive terms resolves several difficult questions of policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-7\">Second, it invokes the rule of equity which requires class liability, including the common liability arising from vicarious relationships, to be treated as a single share. <em>For instance the liability of a master and servant for the wrong of the servant should in fairness be treated as a single share. </em>Other examples are those situations involving co-owners of property, members of an unincorporated association, those engaged in a joint enterprise and the like ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">Taking a similar view with respect to its own contribution statute, another court in <em>Horejsi v Anderson, </em>353 NW2d 316, 318 (ND, 1984) has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-9\">The \"percentage of negligence\u201d attributable to the conduct of the servant constitutes the entire \"single share\u201d of liability attributable jointly to the master and servant. <em>Thus, when the plaintiff releases the servant he gives up his right to recover, </em>from either the master or servant, damages caused by the servant\u2019s negligence. <em>Because this percentage of negligence represents the \"single </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number><em>share\u201d of liability covered by the common liability of the master and servant, </em>the master is necessarily released from vicarious liability for the released servant\u2019s misconduct. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">See also Comment, 43 Boston U L R 417, 423 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Put in another context, if <em>A, B, </em>and <em>C </em>are sued because each is guilty of negligence which resulted in injury to a plaintiff, their pro-rata shares of the common liability are to be determined under the contribution statute without regard to whether A\u2019s principal, not a wrongdoer, is also joined as a fourth defendant. As between <em>A, </em>an agent, and his principal, there is only one tortfeasor, and they represent only one share of the common liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Section 2925d of the contribution act which is invoked by the plaintiff in this case makes clear that a release or a covenant not to sue given to A would not discharge the \"other tortfeasors\u201d <em>(B </em>and <em>C) </em>from liability. However, the statute says no more, leaving in place the deep-rooted common-law principle that the release of A would discharge his principal. Any other result would be illogical and unjust because release of the agent removes the only basis for imputing liability to the principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">Accordingly, we conclude that the release by plaintiffs of Nurse Palmer and Dr. Gilmore had the legal effect of discharging the hospital from vicarious liability for their acts or omissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">Finally, we consider the argument that the releases executed in favor of Nurse Palmer and Dr. Gilmore should be reformed as covenants not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>sue.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We recognize, as plaintiffs have pointed out, that at common law a covenant not to sue given to an agent did not discharge his principal. <em>Boucher v Thomsen, </em>328 Mich 312, 321-322; 43 NW2d 866 (1950). However, in this case we decline to reform the releases for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Courts are required to proceed with utmost caution in exercising jurisdiction to reform written instruments. <em>Ivinson v Hutton, </em>98 US 79; 25 L Ed 66 (1878), see also 66 Am Jur 2d, Reformation of Instruments, \u00a7 3, p 528. In this case the plaintiffs\u2019 request for reformation is made for the first time on appeal. See <em>Napier v Jacobs, </em>429 Mich 222, 233; 414 NW2d 862 (1987); <em>Durant v State Bd of Ed, </em>424 Mich 364, 396; 381 NW2d 662 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">We note that Nurse Palmer and Dr. Gilmore, who were directly involved in the settlement process and the releases, are no longer parties in the present action. See <em>Citizens\u2019 Mutual Automobile Ins Co v Downing, </em>339 Mich 434, 439-440; 64 NW2d 660 (1954). 66 Am Jur 2d, Reformation of Instruments, \u00a7 100, pp 631-632.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">As this Court has stated, \"the burden of proof is upon one seeking reformation of a written instrument.\u201d <em>River Rouge Bank v Fisher, </em>372 Mich 558, 562; 127 NW2d 426 (1964). Absent a mutual mis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>take or a unilateral mistake coupled with fraud, shown by clear and convincing evidence, this Court has declined to reform written instruments. <em>Windham v Morris, </em>370 Mich 188, 192; 121 NW2d 479 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Finally, a unilateral misunderstanding of the legal effect of an instrument is not a sufficient ground for reformation. <em>Wiersma v Nordella, </em>260 Mich 574; 245 NW 520 (1932); <em>Malone v SCM Corp, </em>63 Mich App 11; 233 NW2d 872 (1975). In the absence of a showing that the releases were not what was intended by the parties, the documents will not be rewritten. See <em>Denton v Utley, </em>350 Mich 332; 86 NW2d 537 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">Accordingly, we would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals except in one respect. Instead of remanding for a new trial, we would remand to the circuit court for entry of judgment in favor of the hospital.</p>\n<judges id=\"b639-8\">Riley, C.J., and Brickley, J., concurred with Griffin, J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b639-9\">Boyle, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABJ\">I agree with the conclusion that the Court of Appeals was in error in remanding this case for a new trial. Assuming that the document was a release, I would also agree with Justice Griffin\u2019s conclusion that MCL 600.2925d; MSA 27A.2925(4) does not abrogate the common-law rule that the release of the agent of a vicariously liable principle operates to discharge the principal. I have written separately because despite close examination of the trial court record, I am unable to reach a firm conclusion that the trial court held that the document in question was a release. I am, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>therefore, not persuaded that this case presents an appropriate record for resolution of the substantive issue. In my judgment, this matter should be remanded to the trial court for a determination as to whether the document was intended to release the principal or merely was intended as a covenant not to sue certain agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">The trial court denied the defendant hospital\u2019s motion to strike and stated that the statute did not apply. The trial court, at the same time, acknowledged the common-law rule that release of an agent bars suit against the principal. However, although it should have logically followed that the respondeat superior claim would be barred, the jury was instructed, without objection, that Lansing General could be found vicariously liable for the acts of Gilmore and Palmer. The matter was submitted to the jury on a general verdict, and the hospital did not move for a directed verdict or judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the vicarious liability theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">These facts raise a question as to how the parties themselves viewed the trial court\u2019s characterization of the document. It is possible that the parties understood that the court had held that the document operated to release the hospital and that the defense felt that it was unnecessary to object to the vicarious liability instruction in view of the fact that the motion to strike had been made and that the defendant moved for directed verdict on the independent claims of negligence. It is possible that the failure to submit the special verdict questions was sound trial strategy, an oversight in a protracted and technical trial, or is explained by the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that if counsel had not requested the verdict form, the trial judge should not intervene. It also could be speculated, however, that these facts are explained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>by misgivings on the part of the trial court as to whether the document was a release.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">If, indeed, the document was a release rather than a covenant not to sue, there might be a reason for admitting the evidence of the negligence of Palmer and Gilmore to facilitate the jury\u2019s understanding of the plaintiffs\u2019 theory of independent negligence. However, if this was the only reason for admission, it seems illogical that the court instructed on vicarious liability and presented the jury with alternative grounds for a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Portions of the trial court\u2019s colloquy with counsel at the time of the ruling on the motion to strike underscore the difficulty of resolving this threshold issue. Thus, the trial court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-6\">The case law seems to indicate that\u2019s the situation [the hospital is released], but it seems to me great pains were taken in this particular instance to attempt to avoid the obvious effect of the law, so it\u2019s difficult to fault the Plaintiffs when they took care to avoid the pitfalls, by their actions, in preparing this release and the petition in court here, so I think that my first suggestion is the one that I prefer to adopt, proceed to trial and then let the Court determine whether or not, from the facts, there is [sic], in fact, any independent acts of negligence on the part of the other Defendants that will put them in the category of a joint tort feasor, as opposed to a master-servant, and if there are, that we submit that to the jury on a separate and special verdict that they find specifically regarding these Defendants as they apply to the acts, or lack of acts, on the part of Jana Palmer. Okay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>The parties\u2019 arguments have assumed that this document was a release or that the trial court held it to be a release. Whether the document is considered a contract or a judgment, its construction is, of course, a matter of law, <em>Bradway v Miller, </em>200 Mich 648; 167 NW 15 (1918).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">The upshot of all of this is that both the opinion for affirmance and the opinion for reversal in this case have focused on the <em>effect </em>of a release when it is by no means clear whether there is a release in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Turning to the document itself, it is clear that the word \"release\u201d was used, but it is not clear in what sense it was used. For instance, the document indicates that the plaintiffs gave Gilmore and Palmer a \"release indemnity agreement\u201d holding these individual defendants harmless from any potential cause of action. A future action for indemnity could only be premised upon a theory of vicarious liability, since joint or several liability would give rise instead to a right to contribution. Also, as the trial court noted at the time of motion, the document seems to take away in the second sentence whatever it granted by way of \"release\u201d in the first sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">The discussions of the parties also undermine a firm conclusion that the document was intended to release the hospital. Thus, at the settlement hearing, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel questioned his client in regard to the document as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-9\"><em>Q. [Mr. </em>Kritselis] And, further, you are relying upon the fact that we are not dismissing anybody else other than Dr. Gilmore only, Capital Anesthesiologists only, Dr. Mahoney only, and that all claims against Lansing General Hospital and Dr. Gilroy and Dr. Sciamanna <em>under the various theories </em>as set forth in the pleadings, that those claims will continue. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number><em>A. [Mr. Schneider] </em>Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">This statement lends credibility to Mr. Kritselis\u2019 own, unsworn statement at a postverdict motion that he intended the consent judgment to preserve his vicarious liability theories against the hospital. These statements are also consistent with the fact that the hospital did not contribute to the settlement amounts underlying the \"releases.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-6\">[W]hether an instrument is a release or a covenant not to sue, the designation of the instrument as \"release\u201d or \"covenant not to sue\u201d is immaterial. To determine the nature of the document it is necessary to look to its terms, the words used, the amount paid, the substance of the agreement, and the intention of the parties. [73 ALR2d 403, 420. See also 4 Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 885, comment c.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">In my view, the correct resolution of this case requires a definite determination as to whether the document was, in fact, a release. To do this properly, the matter should be remanded to the trial court, since it is quite likely that an ambiguity will be found and that parol evidence will be required.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">I would reverse the determination of the Court of Appeals to grant a new trial,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> vacate the judgment of the trial court, and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<author id=\"b643-9\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIX\">At common law, where two or more tortfeasors contributed to a plaintiffs injury, a settlement reflected in a document containing language of release of the settling tortfeasor necessar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>ily discharged all other tortfeasors.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> And ordinarily, a tortfeasor could not obtain contribution from another tortfeasor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">The common-law rule has been changed in most jurisdictions by statute or by subsequent common-law decision. It is now generally provided that a settlement with one tortfeasor, although reflected in a document containing language of release, does not discharge other tortfeasors. And a tortfeasor who pays more than his share of the liability may now generally enforce contribution by other tortfeasors.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The question presented is whether the common-law rule, that a settlement with a tortfeasor reflected in a document containing language of release necessarily discharges other tortfeasors, continues to govern where the person released is an employee or agent of another person who is vicariously liable under the common-law doctrine of respondeat superior for the torts of the employee or agent, with the result that a release of the employee or agent discharges the employer or principal although the release reserves claims against other persons who are subject to liability for the alleged injury or wrongful death.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">In <em>Geib v </em>Slater, 320 Mich 316; 31 NW2d 65 (1948), this Court considered a section of 1941 PA 303,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> modeled on a provision of the 1939 Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> providing that an injured person may settle with a \u201cjoint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>tortfeasor\u201d and yet maintain an action against another joint tortfeasor. The Court held that this remedial provision was not applicable in a case where the settlement was with a tortfeasor for whose torts the defendant tortfeasor was vicariously liable because their liabilities were several and not joint, and thus they were not \"joint tortfeasors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">The lead opinion would hold that the defendant hospital \u2014 found to be vicariously liable for the. torts of a physician and nurse with whom plaintiff Theophelis entered into a settlement, reflected in a document containing language of release \u2014 is not a tortfeasor within the meaning of 1974 PA 318,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> substituting language of the 1955 Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act for the 1941 act.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">We would hold that a settlement with any person subject to tort liability, including a person vicariously liable for the torts of another, reflected in a document containing either language of release or language covenanting not to sue, does not \u2014unless otherwise agreed in the document \u2014 discharge any other person subject to tort liability without regard to whether the plaintiff\u2019s theory of liability against the other person is that he is vicariously liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">The operative effect of the common-law rule concerning the effect to be given a settlement with a tortfeasor had been ameliorated by judicial decision before the enactment of the 1941 legislation incorporating provisions of the 1939 Uniform Act and the 1974 legislation incorporating provisions of the 1955 Uniform Act._</p>\n<p id=\"b646-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">In 1935, this Court in <em>Cook v City Transport Corp, </em>272 Mich 91, 92; 261 NW 257 (1935), observed that by the great weight of authority the common-law rule could be avoided by substituting a covenant not to sue for a release. The Court acknowledged that \"[t]he distinction between a release and an agreement not to sue is finespun and seems overtechnical. However, the whole law of joint tortfeasors is of like character.\u201d \"[T]he overwhelming weight of authority draws the distinction and denies the effect of an agreement not to sue one as a release of other joint tortfeasors.\u201d This Court concluded in <em>Cook </em>that it would \"follow the weight of authority,\u201d not because it approved \"the distinction, except as a mental exercise,\u201d <em>id., </em>p 93, but for policy reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-5\">[Bjecause such effect of an agreement not to sue offers a way for a party to buy his peace and allows an opportunity to compromise a doubtful claim without requiring an injured party to forego the right of full compensation against known wrongdoers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">No longer need a settlement with one tortfeasor necessarily discharge all other tortfeasors. The operative effect of the common-law rule could be avoided by substituting one piece of paper (a covenant not to sue) for another (a release).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">One would think that what was left of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>common-law rule would by now be history. The Restatement now provides that a release does not, as a matter of common law, discharge others liable for the same harm unless it is agreed that it will so discharge them.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This Court, having by common-law decision in <em>Cook </em>changed the operative effect of the common-law rule, could, by common-law decision, as has the United States Supreme Court,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> complete the unfinished work by adopting the revision of the common-law rule as set forth in the Restatement of Torts, 2d.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">This Court\u2019s construction of the 1941 act in <em>Geib </em>is seen by the lead opinion as standing in the way. There the Court held that a settlement with a negligent driver of an automobile reflected in a release necessarily discharged the owner of the automobile because they were not \"joint tortfeasors\u201d within the meaning of the 1941 legislation providing that a person having a claim against \"2 or more joint tort-feasors\u201d may settle with and discharge one or more of them without impairing the right of such person to maintain an action against the remaining joint tortfeasors.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Although this Court had frequently used the term \"joint tortfeasor\u201d to describe persons severally liable in tort to the injured plaintiff,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>Court in <em>Geib </em>construed the 1941 legislation as in effect applicable only to tortfeasors acting in concert and not to those severally liable to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">In <em>Moyses v Spartan Asphalt Paving Co, </em>383 Mich 314, 334; 174 NW2d 797 (1970), this Court considered Geib\u2019s construction of the term \"joint tortfeasor\u201d in the context of an action for contribution. In pertinent part, the question was whether an action for contribution could be maintained by a severally liable tortfeasor against another severally liable tortfeasor under the section of the 1941 act<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> modeled on the 1939 Uniform Act<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> providing for contribution among \"joint tortfeasors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">The Court in <em>Moyses </em>held, as a matter of common law, that the <em>Geib </em>construction would no longer bar an action for contribution. In <em>Moyses, </em>the owner of an automobile sought contribution from the manufacturer of an allegedly defective tire. The Court reviewed the history of the 1941 and subsequent legislative efforts to rewrite common-law doctrine (by providing a substantive right of contribution among joint tortfeasors and by permitting settlement and discharge of one or more of them without impairing rights against the others) and Geib\u2019s construction of those legislative efforts, and decided \"to overrule what is left of Michigan\u2019s common-law bar of contribution be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>tween or among 'wrongdoers,\u2019 wilful or intentional wrongdoers excepted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">The Court thus by common-law decision superseded, as to actions for contribution, Geib\u2019s limiting construction of the term \"joint tortfeasor.\u201d Henceforth, an action for contribution could be maintained by one severally liable tortfeasor against another.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">It is contended, nevertheless, in the lead opinion that, except as provided in the 1974 legislation, common-law doctrine and the <em>Geib </em>analysis still control where the question is whether the release of one severally liable tortfeasor releases other severally liable tortfeasors.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">The first Restatement of Torts, promulgated in 1932, stated that a release discharged all others liable for the same harm, unless \u2014 as in the instant case \u2014 \"the parties to the release agree that the release shall not discharge the others.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It was further stated that a \"covenant not to sue one tortfeasor for a harm does not discharge any other liable for the harm.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">By 1981, it was observed in the commentary to the Restatement Torts, 2d, that the \"arbitrary distinction\u201d between a release and a covenant not to sue had \"frequently resulted in the unintended and unpaid-for discharge of one of the tortfeasors. This earlier rule is not consistent with the modern American point of view.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">The rule stated in the Restatement Torts, 2d, is that \"[a] valid release of one tortfeasor from liability for a harm, given by the injured person, does not discharge others liable for the same harm, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>unless it is agreed that it will discharge them.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In the instant case, the release provided that it did not release \"any other persons or entities who may be liable in tort for the alleged wrongful death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AmL\">The United States Supreme Court has held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>a release that clearly intends \u2014 as did the release in the instant case \u2014 to save the releasor\u2019s rights against another person subject to tort liability does not automatically surrender these rights. The Court said that the \"ancient common-law rule\u201d was \"grounded upon a formalistic doctrine that a release extinguished the cause of action.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The Court declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-4\">To adopt the ancient common-law rule would frustrate such partial settlements, and thereby promote litigation, while adoption of the First Restatement rule would create a trap for unwary plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys. The straightforward rule is that a party releases only those other parties whom he intends to release. Our conclusion that this is the appropriate rule for giving effect to releases under the antitrust laws is further buttressed by the Restatement\u2019s abandonment in a tentative draft of the rule requiring express reservation of rights in order to save them, and its adoption of the rule to which we adhere.[<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">I see no reason to perpetuate \"the ancient common-law rule,\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> where the piece of paper reflecting the settlement is in the form of a release rather than in the form of a covenant not to sue, as \"a trap for unwary plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and their unfortunate clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">The 1974 act, substituting the 1955 Uniform Act for the 1941 act, enacted RJA, \u00a7 2925d concerning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>the effect of a release of one tortfeasor on the liability of another:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-4\">When a release or a covenant not to sue or not to enforce judgment is given in good faith to 1 of 2 or more <em>persons liable i\u00fa tort </em>for the same injury or the same wrongful death:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-5\">(a) It does not discharge <em>any of the other tortfeasors </em>from liability for the injury or wrongful death unless its terms so provide.[<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>] [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">The lead opinion would read RJA, \u00a7 2925d as superseding <em>Geib </em>generally \u2014 for severally as well as jointly liable tortfeasors \u2014 but apply a different rule where the non-settling defendant is not himself a \"wrongdoer\u201d and is subject to vicarious liability for the wrongdoing of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">The basis of the proposed distinction is not policy. The Court considered in <em>Boucher v Thomsen, </em>328 Mich 312, 316; 43 NW2d 866 (1950), and declined to accept, policy arguments advanced in the instant case for excepting vicariously liable defendants from the rule that another tortfeasor is not relieved of liability if the injured person set-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>ties, by covenant not to sue, with another tortfeasor.

Accordingly, \"the collective liability of some <em>[tortfeasors, e.g., master and </em>servant,] as a group shall constitute a single share.\u201d It thus appears that the drafters of the Uniform Act intended that those vicariously liable would be subject to the language enacted as RJA, \u00a7 2925b and hence that they be regarded as tortfeasors within the meaning of that language.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">The intention of the drafters of the 1955 Uniform Act that a master be regarded as a \"tortfeasor\u201d is further manifested by the language of the 1955 Uniform Act adopted by the 1974 Legislature as RJA, \u00a7 2925a(7) and the accompanying commentary. RJA, \u00a7 2925a(7) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-5\">This section does not impair any right of indemnity under existing law.

[Emphasis supplied.][<footnotemark>42</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Reading the commentary together with RJA, \u00a7 2925a(7), it is clear that the drafters regarded a master, subject to vicarious liability under the common-law doctrine of respondeat superior for the tort of his servant, as a \"tortfeasor\u201d within the meaning of the phrase \"[wjhere 1 tort-feasor is entitled to indemnity from another.\u201d The master is the tortfeasor \"entitled to indemnity,\u201d and the servant is the \"another\u201d tortfeasor obliged to indemnify the master.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">The reference in the commentary to the master\u2019s right to \"recover contribution from any third tortfeasor\u201d indicates that the drafters of the 1955 Uniform Act regarded a master as a tortfeasor within the meaning of RJA, \u00a7 2925a(2) providing that \"[t]he right of contribution exists only in favor of a <em>tort-feasor </em>who has paid more than his pro-rata share of the common liability . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">In adopting the language of the 1955 Uniform Act, the 1974 Legislature evidenced an intention that an employer (master) as well as an employee (servant) was a \"tortfeasor\u201d for the purposes of RJA, \u00a7 2925a, concerning the enforcement of contribution against a \"wrongdoer,\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> RJA, \u00a7 2925b, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>concerning the determination of pro-rata shares of contribution, and RJA, \u00a72925d, concerning the effect of a release of one person subject to tort liability on the liability of other persons subject thereto.

The lead opinion continues that RJA, \u00a7 2925d, concerning the effect of a release on the liability of other tortfeasors, \"makes clear that a release or a covenant not to sue given to <em>A </em>would not discharge the 'other tortfeasors\u2019 <em>(B </em>and <em>O </em>from liability.\u201d The lead opinion continues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>the \"statute says no more, leaving in place the deep-rooted common-law principle that the release of <em>A </em>would discharge his principal.

RJA, \u00a7 2925d applies by its terms to \"a release or a covenant not to sue.\u201d The lead opinion, in declaring on policy grounds that RJA, \u00a7 2925d does not overrule the common-law principle that a release of an agent discharges the principal,<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> casts a shadow on the common-law principle set forth in <em>Boucher, </em>decided two and one-half years after <em>Geib, </em>that a covenant not to sue does not discharge even a vicariously liable defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">The arguments that there is \"only one share of the common liability\u201d and that it is \"illogical and unjust\u201d to hold liable the vicariously liable person after the release of the actual wrongdoer because the release removes the \"only basis for imputing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>liability\u201d to the person vicariously liable, are refinements, in the vicarious liability context, of the arguments that were made in rationalizing the development of the common-law doctrine that the release of one tortfeasor necessarily released all other tortfeasors.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">The theories of the common-law doctrine as enunciated in the case of persons acting in concert \u2014true joint tortfeasors \u2014 were that a release of one \"necessarily released the other, since there was in the eyes of the law but one cause of action against the two, liable for the same acts, which was surrendered.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> While there was no reason to apply the same analysis to independent wrongdoers, it was extended generally to all releases of all tortfeasors for, among other reasons, \"the cause of action is by its nature indivisible in the eyes of the law,\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> and \"the essential unity of the injury, and the fact that the injured party is entitled to but one compensation therefor, make it impossible for the injured person to settle with one tortfeasor without discharging the other.\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> The common-law rule relied on in the lead opinion was based on the same theories, that \"the damages recoverable for the tort are entire and not severable\u201d or that \"the injured person is entitled to receive but one compensation for his injury.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">These theories and the result, the unintentional release of a person otherwise subject to tort liability, were \"justly condemned.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Today, there can be no double recovery because any amount recovered in settlement from one tortfeasor must be deducted from a judgment rendered against anoth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>er.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Piecemeal collection from different defendants is clearly permitted after judgment.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> The \"one cause of action,\u201d \"indivisibility\u201d of the cause of action, and \"common liability\u201d arguments can be avoided by employing a covenant not to sue to reflect the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">While the single, indivisible cause of action analysis set forth in the lead opinion has, it might be argued, more substance in the context of vicarious liability than it had in the more general context in which the common-law doctrine concerning the effect of a release developed, such analysis and argument was rejected by the drafters of the 1955 Uniform Act on policy grounds: injured persons and those subject to tort liability should be encouraged to enter into partial settlements and a person subject to tort liability should not, by declining to join in a settlement of all claims, be able to preclude partial settlements with tortfeasors willing to buy their peace.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">By incorporating in 1974 the 1955 Uniform Act, the Legislature enunciated as the public policy of this state the policy grounds underlying the 1955 Uniform Act. This Court should not resurrect an outdated and repudiated analysis in support of a result inconsistent with that public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">Unless the analysis of the lead opinion is extended to a covenant not to sue, it is but a trap for unwary lawyers and their unfortunate clients. To extend that analysis to covenants not to sue would be to overrule <em>Boucher.</em><footnotemark><em>56</em></footnotemark><em> </em>_</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>D</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">The analysis of the lead opinion in effect attributes to the 1974 Legislature an intent to enact \"name and retain\u201d legislation for the benefit of hospitals and other defendants vicariously liable at common law (and possibly as well for the benefit of defendants vicariously liable by statute) although such legislation was enacted for the first time years later in the context of dramshop liability<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> and has not otherwise been enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">If it is thought that, on policy grounds, an injured person should not be able to enter into a partial settlement with a wrongdoer for whose acts another is vicariously liable at common law, then <em>Boucher </em>should, as a matter of common-law decision, be overruled. The injured person should, by further common-law decision, then no longer have the option of maintaining an action only against the person vicariously liable; the injured person should be required to maintain an action against the actual wrongdoer as well as the vicariously liable person.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">The injured person would then be barred from partially settling with the actual wrongdoer by covenant not to sue or by release, and the actual wrongdoer would be required to be named and retained throughout the litigation. The vicariously liable person would then be empowered to stymie a settlement that the actual wrongdoer was willing to enter into. Physicians and nurses, like those in the instant case, would as a practical matter be precluded from attempting to buy their peace <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>respecting independent as well as vicarious claims of negligence without the consent of the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">To be sure, a hospital might, by commencing or indicating that it will commence an action for indemnification as provided for in RJA, \u00a7 2925a(7), be able to frustrate the efforts of a physician or nurse to settle without the consent of the hospital. It is, however, somewhat unusual for a hospital to seek indemnification from a physician or nurse.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">Two cases from other jurisdictions have construed the 1955 Uniform Act to reach the same result as does the lead opinion but did so on a different analysis.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">The Supreme Court of Tennessee in <em>Craven v Lawson, </em>534 SW2d 653, 656 (Tenn, 1976), concluded that the act does not apply in the master/ principal, servant/agent relationships. The court rested that conclusion on the language of the 1955 Uniform Act, adopted in Michigan as RJA, \u00a7 2925a(7), providing in effect that the master/ principal is entitled to indemnification from the servant/agent. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-9\">Where no right of contribution exists, the act does not purport to intrude. Thus, the section providing that a covenant not to sue discharges the covenantee from contribution and does not discharge any other tort feasor, has no application to the master-servant, principal-agent relationship, where liability is solely derivative.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">An Illinois intermediate appellate court adopted the same view in <em>Bristow v Griffitts Const Co, </em>140 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>Ill App 3d 191, 198; 488 NE2d 332 (1986).<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> The court declared that the language of the 1955 Uniform Act, enacted in Michigan as RJA, \u00a7 2925d,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-4\">was designed to encourage settlements. Because we find an action for indemnity remains viable in cases involving vicarious liability, the employee in this case would gain nothing in return for his $20,000 and relinquishing his right to defend unless the covenant not to sue also extinguished the employer\u2019s vicarious liability. We, therefore, find a party whose liability is solely derivative is not \"any of the other tortfeasors\u201d within the meaning of [the language enacted in Michigan as RJA, \u00a7 2925d].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">The fallacy in the reasoning of the Tennessee and Illinois courts is that the drafters of the 1955 Uniform Act carefully excepted from the operative effect of that act the master/principal and servant/agent relationships only insofar as, but for such exception, it might be thought that an action for contribution might be maintained by one against the other.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">The question whether a release or a covenant not to sue a person for whose tort another is vicariously liable discharged the person so vicariously liable had arisen and been decided by a number of courts,<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> including this Court in <em>Geib, </em>in the construction of the 1939 act or language modeled thereon before the 1955 act was drafted. There is no basis for supposing that the drafters of the 1955 act, who so carefully excepted<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> the mas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>ter/principal, servant/agent relationships from the operative effect of the provisions enacted in Michigan as RJA, \u00a7 2925a concerning contribution, overlooked making, although they intended, a like exception regarding the master/principal, servant/ agent relationships in drafting the provisions enacted in Michigan as RJA, \u00a7 2925d concerning the effect of a release or covenant not to sue on the tort liability of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">The argument advanced by the Illinois intermediate appellate court that the employee would \"gain nothing in return for his $20,000\u201d unless the employer\u2019s vicarious liability is also extinguished ignores that the employee may not have expected that his employer\u2019s claim for indemnity would be extinguished. In all events, there is no claim here that the nurse and physician were misled or expected that their settlements with Theophelis extinguished the hospital\u2019s claim for indemnity. It is again relevant that it is unusual for a hospital to seek indemnity from a nurse or physician; the nurse and physician in the instant case may have gained something by their settlements with Theophelis.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">The majority of jurisdictions that have considered this issue have determined that the release of a servant/agent does not release the vicariously liable master/principal.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">In <em>Alaska Airlines, Inc v Sweat, </em>568 P2d 916 (Alas, 1977), the Supreme Court of Alaska construed the 1955 Uniform Act and concluded that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>settlement with an agent did not release a vicariously liable principal. Plaintiffs were injured in the crash of an airplane operated by Chitina Air Service, an independent contractor of Alaska Airlines. They entered into a covenant not to sue<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> with Chitina and a stipulation dismissing the claim with prejudice. The injured person brought an action against Alaska Airlines, which claimed that it was not subject to vicarious liability for Chitina\u2019s act because the \"release of Chitina automatically released Alaska.\u201d<footnotemark>65</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">The Alaska court considered the Alaska adoption of the 1955 Uniform Act, identical to RJA, \u00a72925d, that the act refers to \"two or more persons liable in tort\u201d and \"other tortfeasors\u201d without defining \"tortfeasors,\u201d and concluded that the act was \"intended to include those vicariously liable.

Utah had enacted a statute patterned after the 1939 Uniform Act which included the Uniform Act\u2019s definition of \"joint tortfeasor\u201d as \"one of two or more persons, jointly or severally liable in tort for the same injury to person or property . . . .\u201d The court relied on several cases<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> that construed the 1939 Uniform Act\u2019s definition of joint tortfeasor to include the master-servant relationship, and continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-6\">In 1955 the Uniform Act was revised. The 1955 version of the Uniform Act does not contain a definition of \"joint tort-feasor.\u201d However, the 1955 Act does state that the release provisions apply \"where two or more persons become jointly or severally liable in tort for the same injury to person or property. . . .\u201d All jurisdictions but one which have construed this language, which is essentially identical to the definition of joint tortfeasor contained in the 1939 Act, have also held that the master-servant relationship is subject to the 1955 Act\u2019s language making it applicable to those jointly and severally liable in tort.

Rationale. </em>At present, persons whose independent tortious conduct contributes to a tort are in most cases (see \u00a7 879) regarded as joint tortfeasors, without distinction between them and those who cooperate in producing a tortious result. Likewise today releases are effective if given for consideration although not under seal and are therefore regarded as contracts rather than grants. Furthermore, the tendency is to give effect to the intent of the parties to a transaction rather than to regard as controlling the formalities with which the transaction is executed. The law has now developed so that it is possible to carry out the intent of the parties as expressed in the document by which the release is given. Thus, if it is the understanding of the parties that the payment by the tortfeasor will be full compensation for the injury suffered and therefore full satisfaction of the claim, there is no longer an enforceable claim against any tortfeasor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-9\"><em>d. Limits and effect of rule. </em>A covenant not to sue clearly indicates by its form that it is not intended to discharge the liability of other tortfeasors jointly liable. On the other hand, a document in the usual form of a release given to one of them is normally construed as intended to discharge all claims for the tort and operates to discharge others also liable for the same harm. If, however, there is language in the release that manifests that the releasor intended to preserve his rights against the others, effect is given to this manifestation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-10\">It is not essential that the reservation of rights against other tortfeasors be expressed in the document itself. Such a requirement might easily prove a boobytrap for the unwary, since releases are commonly signed by individuals without legal advice. The agreement as to the effect of the release may be proved by external evidence; and the objection of the parol evidence rule is met by the fact that the second tortfeasor who raises the question is not a party to the instrument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-11\">A release obtained as the result of a basic mistake or of fraud or duress may be rescinded and after the rescission the claim against all the tortfeasors revives. On the circumstances under which there may be rescission of an agreement, see Restatement, 2d, Contracts, \u00a7\u00a7 301-319 (Tent. Draft).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b651-8\"><em> Zenith Radio Corp v Hazeltine Research, Inc, </em>401 US 321, 343; 91 S Ct 795; 28 L Ed 2d 77 (1971); <em>Aro Mfg Co, Inc v Convertible Top Replacement Co, Inc, </em>377 US 476, 581; 84 S Ct 1526; 12 L Ed 2d 457 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b651-9\"> <em>Zenith, </em>n 17 <em>supra, </em>p 347.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b651-10\"> <em>Id., </em>p 343.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b651-11\"> <em>Id., </em>p 347.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b652-9\"> RJA, \u00a7 2925d continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-10\">(b) It reduces the claim against the other tort-feasors to the extent of any amount stipulated by the release or the covenant or to the extent of the amount of the consideration paid for it, whichever amount is the greater.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-11\">(c) It discharges the tort-feasor to whom it is given from all liability for contribution to any other tortfeasor.

After the tympanotomy, and before commencement of the tonsillectomy, the child developed a drastic increase in heart rate and his legs and fingers became cyanotic. Jana Palmer, the certified nurse anesthetist who had administered anesthesia for the surgery, called in Jack Gilmore, D.O., the supervising anesthesiologist. Dr. Gilmore had not been present in the operating room during the surgery. The child subsequently suffered a cardiac arrest. After half an hour of resuscitative efforts, the child resumed a spontaneous heartbeat, and was taken to the intensive care unit where he was placed on a respirator and cardiac monitor. Various physicians on staff at the hospital examined the child and directed treatment in the intensive care unit. The following day, a second cardiac arrest occurred. While maintained on a respirator in the intensive care unit, the child\u2019s condition continued to deteriorate until his death six days later, on June 22, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Plaintiffs, the personal representative and the parents of the child, filed this wrongful death action in the Ingham Circuit Court on June 13, 1980. The defendants named were Jana Palmer, the certified nurse anesthetist, and Dr. Gilmore, the anesthesiologist, both of whom were employed by Capital Anesthesiologists, P.C. Capital had the exclusive contract to perform anesthesia within the hospital. The other defendants included Lansing General Hospital, Gerald Gilroy, D.O., the ear-nose-throat specialist who performed the tympano<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>tomy, David Sciamanna, D.O., the assisting resident pediatrician, and various medical personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Prior to trial, a number of physicians, as well as Capital Anesthesiologists, were dismissed for reasons unrelated to this appeal. Also prior to trial, a motion for an order authorizing settlement in the amount of $85,000 against nurse Palmer, only, was granted. After trial began, plaintiffs entered into a similar settlement in the amount of $172,739 with Dr. Gilmore, the anesthesiologist. In both instances, a release was executed in consideration of the settlement payments and a provision was included in the release specifically reserving plaintiffs\u2019 claims against the remaining defendants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There were no objections raised by the defendants as to the settlements, to the language of the release, or to the court\u2019s order authorizing the release.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Subsequently, during trial, the hospital moved to strike all allegations concerning the actions of Palmer and Gilmore as ostensible agents of the hospital (under <em>Grewe v Mt Clemens General Hosp, </em>404 Mich 240; 273 NW2d 429 [1978]). The motions were based upon the theory that the settlements released the hospital from vicarious liability for the actions of Palmer and Gilmore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>despite the express reservation of those claims in the settlement order. While the trial court ruled that the settlements released the hospital from vicarious liability for the actions of Palmer and Gilmore, it permitted the evidence concerning the conduct of the released defendants to go to the jury, reasoning that the evidence was necessary to a jury\u2019s understanding of the independent allegations of negligence against the remaining defendants, Lansing General, Dr. Sciamanna, and Dr. Gilroy. The trial court also recommended that the hospital request the return of special verdicts to determine whether the jury verdict was based upon the hospital\u2019s vicarious or independent liability. The defendants rejected the court\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">During trial, at the close of plaintiffs\u2019 proofs, and upon defendants\u2019 motion, the trial court struck certain allegations of independent hospital negligence from plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, but granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion to amend their complaint to conform to the proofs. The amended complaint continued to include allegations that the hospital failed to require use of a precordial stethoscope in pediatric cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">After a two-week trial, the jury returned a verdict against defendant Lansing General Hospital in the amount of $1 million. It found no cause of action as to Drs. Gilroy and Sciamanna. The verdict was reduced by the settlement amount of $257,739, and, on June 2, 1983, judgment was entered against Lansing General Hospital for $742,261.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">On March 4, 1985, the Court of Appeals affirmed the jury verdict, concluding that the acts of the settling tortfeasors were properly introduced where \"critical to the ability of plaintiffs to prove their independent claims against the hospital.\u201d <em>Theophelis v Lansing General Hosp, </em>141 Mich App 199, 205; 366 NW2d 249 (1985). On rehearing, a divided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>Court of Appeals set aside the jury verdict and remanded the case for a new trial. Having found that the trial court granted a directed verdict on all but one of plaintiffs\u2019 independent claims against the hospital, the Court of Appeals decided there was now \"no competent evidence or expert testimony\u201d to support the issue of independent liability on the, part of the hospital to send to the jury. <em>Theophelis v Lansing General Hosp (On Rehearing), </em>148 Mich App 564, 567; 384 NW2d 823 (1986).

An appreciation for the historical development of Michigan\u2019s contribution statute, MCL 600.2925d; MSA 27A.2925(4), is necessary for an understanding of our disagreement with the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">The common-law rule in Michigan is that a release of one or more <em>joint </em>tortfeasors releases the others, regardless of an express reservation of rights against another tortfeasor. <em>McBride v Scott, </em>132 Mich 176; 93 NW 243 (1903); <em>Lindsay v Acme Cement Plaster Co, </em>220 Mich 367; 190 NW 275 (1922); <em>Moffit v Endtz, </em>232 Mich 2; 204 NW 764 (1925); MacDonald v Henry Hornblower &amp; Weeks, 268 Mich 626; 256 NW 572 (1934). This rule is based upon the theory that there can be but one compensation for a joint wrong, and the action is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>satisfied once the injured party has been paid by any joint tortfeasors.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The harshness of and dissatisfaction with the common-law rule has resulted in a modern trend towards various devices designed to avoid its effect.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These devices included the use of covenants not to sue,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> uniform legislation abrogating the rule, such as the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and state statutes,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> among other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>things.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Generally, these devices obviate the need for the common-law rule by setting off the amount of any settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">In 1941, the Michigan Legislature chose to ameliorate the rigidity of the common-law rule by enacting a variation of the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act. The statute, 1941 PA 303, \u00a7 2, 1948 CL 691.562; MSA 27.1683(2), provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-6\">It shall be lawful for all persons having a claim or cause of action against <em>2 or more joint tortfeasors </em>to compound, settle with, and discharge, at any time prior to rendition of a judgment in said action, <em>any and everyone or more of said joint tortfeasors </em>for such sum as such person may deem fit, without impairing the right of such person or persons to demand and collect the balance of said claim or cause of action from the <em>remaining joint tort-feasors, </em>against whom such person, or persons, has such claim or cause of action, and not so released. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">Unlike the 1941 Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act, the original Michigan statute did not include the definition of \"joint tortfeasor.\u201d The use of the term \"joint tortfeasor\u201d without definition resulted in problems of interpretation. See <em>Geib v Slater, </em>320 Mich 316; 31 NW2d 65 (1948), overruled on other grounds <em>Moore v Palmer, </em>350 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>Mich 363; 86 NW2d 585 (1957); <em>Moyses v Spartan Asphalt Paving Co, </em>383 Mich 314; 174 NW2d 797 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">In <em>Geib, supra, </em>320, the issue was whether the defendant owner of an automobile driven by a negligent employee was a \"joint tort-feasor\u201d within the statute. This Court held that the statute did not apply to the liability of the automobile owner because the owner was not a \"joint tort-feasor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ady\">While the 1955 revision of the uniform act eliminated the term \"joint tortfeasor\u201d and substituted the term \"tortfeasor,\u201d the language of the 1961 Michigan revision authorizing release of a joint tortfeasor without discharging any others remained identical to the original 1941 act.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Later, in an effort to resolve the definitional problem, this Court in <em>Moyses, supra, </em>329, defined \"joint tortfeasors,\u201d stating,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-5\">[W]here two (or more) persons owe to another the same duty and by their common neglect of that duty such other is injured, the two (or more) have committed a. joint tort and therefore are <em>joint tortfeasors.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">The Legislature expressed its dissatisfaction with the various judicial interpretations that evolved following its failure to define \"joint tortfeasors\u201d in the 1941 statute and its 1961 amendment by amending MCL 600.2925d; MSA 27A.2925(4) to totally eliminate use of the term \"joint tortfeasor.\u201d The 1974 amendment provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-7\">When a release or a covenant not to sue or not to enforce judgment is given in good faith to 1 of 2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>or more <em>persons liable in tort </em>for the same injury or the same wrongful death:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-5\">(a) It does not discharge any of the other <em>tortfeasors </em>from liability for the injury or wrongful death unless its terms so provide. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">The 1974 change in language to include \"persons liable in tort\u201d and to eliminate the term \"joint tortfeasors\u201d indicates the Legislature\u2019s intention to apply the statute to all tortfeasors liable in tort for the same injury regardless of whether their liability was joint. To read the present statute, as amended in 1974, otherwise would render nugatory a related provision of the statute, \u00a7 2925d(b). Section 2925d(b) provides that a release or covenant not to sue \"reduces the claim against the other tort-feasors to the extent of the amount stipulated by the release or the covenant . . . .\u201d See n 1.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Every part of a statute should be given meaning and no part should be rendered nugatory. <em>Baker v General Motors Corp, </em>409 Mich 639, 665; 297 NW2d 387 (1980); <em>Stowers v Wolodzko, </em>386 Mich 119, 133; 191 NW2d 355 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">The 1974 amended statute, unlike its predecessor, does not limit its application to joint tortfeasors. Rather, the express language of the current statute applies to \"1 of 2 or more persons <em>liable in tort for the same injury or the same wrongful death.\u201d </em>Liability \"in tort for the same injury\u201d would include claims founded in vicarious liability. The defendant hospital is \"1 <em>of 2 or more . . . liable in tort for the same . . . wrongful death.\u201d </em>Thus, its vicarious liability falls within the statute. Other jurisdictions with statutes having language identical or similar to the 1974 amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>ment agree.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, I would find the principle established in <em>Geib, supra, </em>prior to the 1974 amendment to be in conflict with the plain language of \u00a7 2925d, and therefore, no longer valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">My interpretation is further supported by the recent decisions interpreting related provisions of \u00a7 2925a. See <em>O\u2019Dowd v General Motors Corp, </em>419 Mich 597; 358 NW2d 553 (1984), and <em>Piper Aircraft Corp v Dumon, </em>421 Mich 445; 364 NW2d 647 (1984). In both <em>O\u2019Dowd </em>and <em>Piper, </em>we acknowledged that the statute\u2019s focus is on the relationship between the defendants and the injured party rather than the relationship between the defendants themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">More importantly, a statute must be construed in light of legislative intent. <em>O\u2019Donnell v State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins Co, </em>404 Mich 524; 273 NW2d 829 (1979). Clearly, the Legislature\u2019s intention in enacting MCL 600.2925d; MSA 27A.2925(4) was to \"(1) encourag[e] settlements and (2) assur[e] that a plaintiff is fully compensated for injuries sustained.\u201d <em>Mayhew v Berrien Co Road Comm, </em>414 Mich 399, 411-412; 326 NW2d 366 (1982). This policy enables a plaintiff to settle with an agent without losing his cause of action against a party liable under a theory of respondeat superior, while allowing the remaining defendant complete access to the courts for a full adjudication of his liabilities and rights to indemnification. See <em>Knutson v Morton Foods, Inc, </em>603 SW2d 805 (Tex, 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">To allow the common-law rule to survive would deter the parties from settling because they would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>risk losing other claims necessary to obtain full compensation. Any inequities argued by the defendant are obviated by the setoff requirements imposed by related provisions of the statute. See MCL 600.2925a <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 27A.2925(1) <em>et seq. I </em>reject the hospital\u2019s argument that enforcement of the release in these cases would encourage a circuity of action in view of its right to indemnification. MCL 600.2925a(7); MSA 27A.2925(1)(7). I believe the remedial nature of \u00a7 2925d \u2014 to encourage settlements and assure full compensation to the plaintiff for injuries \u2014 takes precedence over possible indemnity problems. The defendant to be indemnified suffers no prejudice because the settlement actually results in the reduction of its possible liability by the amount paid in settlement. See <em>Knutson, supra. </em>Loss of indemnification is especially not a problem in cases where the agent or employee settles for the full amount of the policy limits under his liability insurance. See <em>Munson v United States, </em>380 F2d 976 (CA 6, 1967).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Furthermore, in cases where, as here, there is a question of active negligence as well as vicarious negligence, the defendant may have no right to indemnity.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">I also disagree with the hospital\u2019s argument that this Anew would create an atmosphere ripe for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>collusion.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> If there is any indication that a settlement involved collusion, a trial court can rely on the \"good faith\u201d requirement of \u00a7 2925d to find that the settlement was not made in good faith. To further avoid any impropriety, challenges to the good faith of the settlements should be made at the time of settlement or prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">Accordingly, under MCL 600.2925d; MSA 27A.2925(4), the release of defendants Palmer and Gilmore did not release the defendant hospital from vicarious liability for the actions of its agents or employees. I would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the judgment against defendant Lansing General Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Because I conclude that MCL 600.2925d; MSA 27A.2925(4) is applicable in cases of vicarious liability, I do not find it necessary to pursue the issue whether the releases, if not protected by the statute, should be reformed as covenants not to sue which discharge the hospital to effectuate the intent of the settling parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">Notwithstanding the applicability of MCL 600.2925d; MSA 27A.2925(4) to defendant hospital\u2019s vicarious liability, the record also reflects that it would have been possible for the jury to find the hospital liable for independent acts of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">While the trial court struck certain allegations of independent hospital negligence from plaintiffs\u2019 complaint upon the hospital\u2019s motion to direct a verdict, the trial court simultaneously allowed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>plaintiffs to amend their complaint to conform to the proofs. The hospital concedes that the issue whether defendant hospital had been independently negligent in failing to require the use of the precordial stethoscope as standard operating procedure remained a viable issue for the jury. When testifying at trial, plaintiffs\u2019 expert, Dr. Zsigmond, recognized, albeit in a different context, that failure to use the precordial stethoscope in this case was a \"very severe major deviation from the good standard of practice.\u201d The precordial stethoscope issue and Dr. Zsigmond\u2019s testimony were submitted, <em>without objection, </em>to the jury. If there is sufficient evidence tending to support the jury\u2019s verdict, a court cannot set it aside even if it might be in doubt as to the ultimate facts. <em>Baldwin v Nall, </em>323 Mich 25, 29; 34 NW2d 539 (1948). Hence, I agree with Judge Kelly\u2019s dissent on rehearing that when viewed in its entirety, the evidence introduced at trial regarding use of the precordial stethoscope <em>could </em>support the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">Finally, the hospital contends that a new trial would be required even if this Court held that the hospital could be vicariously liable for Palmer\u2019s and Gilmore\u2019s actions, as it cannot be determined from the jury\u2019s verdict, upon which basis it found liability. <em>Baker v Alt, </em>374 Mich 492, 497; 132 NW2d 614 (1965). However, the record reflects that the trial judge repeatedly recommended and encouraged the hospital to request the return of special verdicts at the close of proofs to determine upon what basis liability was found. The hospital rejected the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">Had the hospital made the request, any confusion as to the basis upon which the jury found the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>hospital liable would have disappeared. \"A party cannot sit back and after the jury decides against him claim error after he had been given the fullest opportunity to correct any alleged error at the trial.\u201d <em>Baldwin v Nall, supra, </em>31; <em>Watson v Dax, </em>334 Mich 320, 330; 54 NW2d 674 (1952). Accordingly, I would find that the hospital\u2019s failure to request special verdicts at the urging of the trial court invited impermissible error, thereby waiving its right to complain on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">I would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the judgment against Lansing General Hospital.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b676-8\"> When a release or a covenant not to sue or not to enforce judgment is given in good faith to 1 of 2 or more persons liable in tort for the same injury or the same wrongful death:</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">(a) It does not discharge any of the other tort-feasors from liability for the injury or wrongful death unless its terms so provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">(b) It reduces the claim against the other tort-feasors to the extent of any amount stipulated by the release or the covenant or to the extent of the amount of the consideration paid for it, whichever amount is the greater.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-11\">(c) It discharges the tort-feasor to whom it is given from all liability for contribution to any other tort-feasor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b678-7\"> The releases provide in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-8\">It is intended that this Release shall be operative as to Jana Palmer only and shall not be construed to release any other persons or entity who may be liable in tort for the same wrongful death.
