In <em>People v Adams, </em>we are also asked to consider whether the defendant\u2019s appeal should be dismissed because he had escaped from prison during its pendency. The Court of Appeals in both cases ruled that the sentencing judge may not consider perjured testimony in sentencing. In <em>People v Spangler, </em>429 Mich 29; 413 NW2d 1 (1987), five justices of this Court agreed that perjury may be considered by a sentencing judge. Because of our disposition of another issue, that view did not, in <em>Spangler, </em>constitute the law of the case. We now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>hold that a trial court may consider perjured testimony at sentencing. We reverse the decisions of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">\n<em>A. PEOPLE v ADAMS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b828-9\">During the evening of April 17, 1982, the home of Lester and Virginia Knorr was burglarized. The defendant was arrested and charged with breaking and entering an occupied dwelling with intent to commit larceny in violation of MCL 750.110; MSA 28.305. At trial, the defendant offered an alibi defense. He testified that on the evening of the break-in, he was home playing cards with his family and some friends. He further testified that, except for an eighteen-minute period between 7:55 p.m. and 8:13 p.m. when he went to buy cigarettes at a nearby gas station, he remained at his residence. This version of events was substantiated by the defendant\u2019s testifying witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-10\">The state offered the testimony of Gladys Blahovec. Mrs. Blahovec lived next to the Knorrs on Byrens Drive. She testified that a vehicle pulled into the victims\u2019 driveway at approximately 8:30 p.m. and stayed for fifteen minutes. She stated that she could not identify the vehicle as a car or truck, but that it did have one dim headlight. Her daughter, Betty Lavigueur, testified that sometime between 8:30 p.m. and 8:45 p.m., as she turned into Byrens Drive, she saw a blue or green pickup truck with an off-color door leaving Byrens Drive at the intersection of Byrens and Lewis. The Knorr residence is approximately one-eighth of a mile from the Lewis intersection. The defendant owned a blue-green pickup truck with a partially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>white door on the driver\u2019s side and the truck had one dim headlight.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">Samples of tire tracks taken from the victim\u2019s driveway were found to be similar to the tire treads on the defendant\u2019s truck. Also, boot prints taken were judged similar to the tread design on boots owned by the defendant. Finally, a toolbox taken from the victim\u2019s residence was found locked in a shed on the defendant\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">The defendant was convicted on November 16, 1982, and sentenced by Genesee Circuit Judge Earl E. Borradaile to a term of five to fifteen years. At sentencing, Judge Borradaile commented that incarceration was fitting because the defendant had victimized his brother-in-law\u2019s friend and had lied during his trial testimony. These factors, the judge concluded, militated against the prospect of rehabilitation and, therefore, the option of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">The defendant thereafter filed a timely claim of appeal on February 9, 1983. During the pendency of that appeal, prior to the submission of briefs, the defendant escaped from the Southern Michigan Prison at Jackson. He remained on escapee status until his capture on January 11, 1984. Because of defendant\u2019s \"unavailability,\u201d the Court of Appeals granted to defense counsel an extension of time in which to file her brief. As a result, there was a delay of nearly two months. While still a fugitive, the defendant\u2019s appeal proceeded to the Court of Appeals on briefs, oral argument not having been requested. By order of that Court dated January 30, 1984, the case was remanded to the trial court \"for an explanation of the court\u2019s reasons in imposing this sentence.\u201d In compliance, the trial court reiterated its earlier determination that defendant was unfit for probation because he had betrayed a family friendship and \"told a baldfaced lie in the courtroom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>In an unpublished per curiam opinion,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Court of Appeals rejected the prosecutor\u2019s request that defendant\u2019s appeal be dismissed because he had escaped from prison. The Court reasoned that dismissal would amount to a double punishment<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and further serve to deny defendant\u2019s right to appeal under art 1, \u00a7 20 of the Michigan Constitution. The Court also concluded that the trial court erred in considering the defendant\u2019s perjury in imposing sentence. <em>People v Anderson, </em>391 Mich 419; 216 NW2d 780 (1974); <em>People v McConnell, </em>122 Mich App 208; 332 NW2d 408 (1982), vacated on other grounds 418 Mich 881 (1983). Reasoning that a separate count of perjury was available if deemed appropriate, and that use of this criterion is improper under <em>People v Coles, </em>417 Mich 523, 550; 339 NW2d 440 (1983), the Court remanded the case for resentencing, to be completed before a different judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">The prosecutor appealed that ruling, and this Court granted leave. 425 Mich 852 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">\n<em>B. PEOPLE v STITT</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">The defendant was charged with larceny from a person in violation of MCL 750.357; MSA 28.589, resulting from a purse snatching outside of Mounir\u2019s grocery store in the City of Flint. The complaining witness, Sandra Fisher, testified that she saw the defendant standing alone outside Mounir\u2019s grocery as she approached the door. While shopping, she saw the defendant inside the store, and he was seen again outside the store when Ms. Fisher left. She identified the defendant as the man who stole her purse in the parking lot as she prepared to enter her car. Ms. Fisher was also able <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>to identify the defendant in a photo identification approximately two months after the theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\">The defendant testified that he was at Mounir\u2019s when Ms. Fisher\u2019s purse was stolen, but that he was inside the store playing video games, did not leave the store, and that one Val Rawls had taken the purse. He further testified that when asked by the police about the incident, he had informed Sergeant Richard Lewis of the Flint Police Department that Val Rawls had taken the purse. He also claimed to have accompanied Sergeant Lewis to a sewer drain where the purse was supposedly hidden.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">In rebuttal, Sergeant Lewis testified that when he questioned the defendant he indicated no knowledge of a purse snatching. He indicated, further, that he had not been in the area of the crime for over one and one-half years, and that he did not know where Mounir\u2019s market was located. Sergeant Lewis further testified that the defendant had never mentioned the name Val Rawls and that he did not conduct any type of field investigation with the defendant to locate the missing purse.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">The defendant was convicted by a Genesee County jury and was sentenced to a term of six years, eight months to ten years. In imposing sentence, Judge Robert M. Ransom considered, among other factors, his belief that the defendant had lied during his trial testimony. After concluding that the trial judge had impermissibly enhanced defendant\u2019s sentence by weighing his perjured testimony, the Court of Appeals vacated defendant\u2019s sentence and remanded the case for resentencing, citing <em>People v </em>McConnell, <em>supra; Scott v United States, </em>135 US App DC 377; 419 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>F2d 264 (1969).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The state moved in the Court of Appeals for a rehearing, requesting that the defendant\u2019s sentence be reinstated. That request was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">The prosecutor appealed in this Court, and leave was granted. 425 Mich 852 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">PERJURY</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">The Legislature has determined that the appropriate approach to sentencing is the individualization of a sentence to a given offender. MCL 769.8; MSA 28.1080. To achieve this objective, a sentencing judge is afforded \"wide discretion in the sources and types of evidence used to assist him in determining the kind and extent of punishment to be imposed within limits fixed by law.\u201d <em>Williams v New </em>York, 337 US 241, 246; 69 S Ct 1079; 93 L Ed 1337 (1949). \"Highly relevant \u2014 if not essential \u2014 to his selection of an appropriate sentence is the possession of the fullest information possible concerning the defendant\u2019s life and characteristics.\u201d Id, p 247.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-10\">Recognizing, however, that sentencing discretion may be arbitrarily applied, this Court established certain criteria to aid the sentencing judge in determining an appropriate sentence. In <em>People v </em>Snow, 386 Mich 586, 592; 194 NW2d 314 (1972), we listed four basic considerations for sentence determination: \"(a) the reformation of the offender, (b) protection of society, (c) the disciplining of the wrongdoer, and (d) the deterrence of others from committing like offenses.\u201d This list was intended to set out a framework for evaluation of the various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>facts and circumstances surrounding the yet-to-be-sentenced defendant. Just what facts properly may be weighed when considering reformation, protection of society, discipline, and deterrence, however, has never been rigidly classified, and we reject any invitation to do so. It remains the role of the sentencing judge to weigh facts deemed relevant to the sentencing decision. <em>People v Coles, supra, </em>550. Our function is to identify those factors which when injected into the sentencing process tread unfairly upon the defendant\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">Thus, a sentencing judge does not have unfettered discretion. Numerous checks shield the defendant from an arbitrary sentence and help to insure that the objective of personalized disposition is achieved. In addition to the compilation of a presentence report<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and scoring under the sentencing guidelines, other decisions of this Court limit consideration of factors deemed inappropriate in sentencing, helping to insure that the judge enjoys a broad, yet fair, knowledge of the defendant and the circumstances of the crime of which he is convicted.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">In the cases at bar, the sentencing judges considered the defendants\u2019 false testimony when passing sentence. This the defendants claim to be error. We must, therefore, decide whether it is appropriate to limit the trial court\u2019s discretion and exclude this factor. For the reasons set forth below, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>decline to do so. A sentencing judge may consider the defendant\u2019s false testimony when passing sentence. The issue becomes under what circumstances this may occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">In <em>People v Anderson, supra, </em>this Court stated that a trial judge\u2019s consideration at sentencing of his impression that the defendant was protecting a codefendant was error. Viewed as, in effect, <em>punishing </em>the accused for exercising his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent, the Court analogized this constitutional infirmity to the rule in <em>Scott v United States, supra, </em>where it was found to be error for a judge to impose additional punishment because the judge believed that the defendant committed perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">In <em>Anderson, </em>the sentencing error was found in the sentencing judge\u2019s consideration of the defendant\u2019s exercise of his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. In these cases now before the Court, however, the defendants chose to testify. Thus, the right to remain silent is clearly not involved, and the <em>Anderson </em>rationale is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">In <em>Scott v United States, supra, </em>the Court of Appeals predicated error on the sentencing judge\u2019s <em>punishment </em>of the defendant because he believed the accused perjured himself. Writing for the <em>Scott </em>court, Judge Bazelon observed that \"[i]t is indeed unlikely that many men who commit serious offenses would balk on principle from lying in their own defense. . . . But the defendant does have a right to testify in his own defense. ... If the Government for whatever reason concludes that prosecution for perjury is appropriate, he risks punishment for that as well.\u201d <em>Scott, supra, </em>p 382. See also <em>People v McConnell, supra. </em>To the extent that <em>Scott </em>stands for the rule that a trial judge may not punish a defendant merely because he perjured himself, we would agree. Under our con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>stitutional scheme, the defendant has both a right to testify and a right to remain silent. However, having voluntarily chosen to testify, the accused must speak truthfully. The constitution \"cannot be perverted into a license to use perjury by way of a defense . . . .\u201d <em>Harris v New York, </em>401 US 222, 225; 91 S Ct 643; 28 L Ed 2d 1 (1971); <em>United States v Wong, </em>431 US 174, 178; 97 S Ct 1823; 52 L Ed 2d 231 (1977); <em>People v Esters, </em>417 Mich 34; 331 NW2d 211 (1982).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">Thus, while we agree with the statement that a judge may not punish a defendant for perjury, we do not agree with the conclusion of the Court of Appeals in <em>Scott </em>that the Fifth Amendment forbids consideration of perjury in assessing the defendant\u2019s prospects for rehabilitation. We reject that conclusion as did the United States Supreme Court in <em>United States v Grayson, </em>438 US 41; 98 S Ct 2610; 57 L Ed 2d 582 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">In <em>Grayson, </em>the district judge at sentencing concluded that a prison term was warranted both to deter future criminal conduct, and because he viewed Grayson\u2019s defense as \" 'a complete fabrication without the slightest merit whatsoever.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>p 44. The Third Circuit Court reversed and remanded for resentencing, concluding that \"no additional penalty may be imposed upon a defendant because the trial judge believes that the defendant lied while testifying.\u201d 550 F2d 103, 108 (CA 3, 1976). See <em>Poteet v Fauver, </em>517 F2d 393 (CA 3, 1975). The dissenting judge would have found the trial judge\u2019s evaluation of the defendant\u2019s testimony proper stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>If under <em>Williams, supra, </em>and the legion of cases which have followed it, hearsay evidence as to prior arrests, pending indictments, or indictments tried but not resulting in convictions, may be considered constitutionally in the selection of an appropriate sentence, it seems to me there is even greater justification for the judge to consider the attitude and conduct of the defendant during trial. In the instant case, the judge personally observed the witnesses and the demeanor of the defendant; he was impressed by the <em>\"complete fabrication\u201d </em>of the defense and <em>its utter lack of merit. </em>His observation specifically goes to the sort of person the defendant is; it is precise, is pertinent to the sentence the defendant should receive, and to the desirable objective of making the punishment fit the offender. [550 F2d 112. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">The United States Supreme Court reversed, concluding that the sentence was not constitutionally impermissible. The Court observed that the critical inquiry in individualized sentencing requires exploration into the background, character, and demeanor of the person convicted and that \"[a] defendant\u2019s truthfulness or mendacity while testifying on his own behalf, almost without exception, has been deemed probative of his attitudes toward society and prospects for rehabilitation and hence relevant to sentencing.\u201d <em>Grayson, supra, </em>p 50. Rejecting the rule in <em>Scott, </em>the Court offered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-7\">The <em>Scott </em>rationale rests not only on the realism of the psychological pressures on a defendant in the dock \u2014 which we can grant \u2014 but also on a deterministic view of human conduct that is inconsistent with the underlying precepts of our criminal justice system. A \"universal and persistent\u201d foundation stone in our system of law, and particularly in our approach to punishment, sentencing, and incarceration, is the \"belief in freedom of human will and a consequent ability and duty of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>the normal individual to choose between good and evil.\u201d Given that long-accepted view of the \"ability and duty of the normal individual to choose,\u201d we must conclude that the defendant\u2019s readiness to lie under oath \u2014 especially when, as here, the trial court finds the lie to be flagrant \u2014 may be deemed probative of his prospects for rehabilitation. [Id., p 52. Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">Although we are not obligated to follow the holding in <em>Grayson, </em>we join the majority of our sister states addressing this issue<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and find the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>logic and reasoning compelling. If a sentencing judge is to exercise discretion and tailor a sentence to the individual, reason dictates that this Court not render the judge legally oblivious to evidence of a character trait which is probative of rehabilitation prospects. On this theme, Judge Marvin Frankel aptly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-6\">The effort to appraise \"character\u201d is, to be sure, a parlous one, and not necessarily an enterprise for which judges are notably equipped by prior training. Yet it is in our existing scheme of sentencing one clue to the rational exercise of discretion. If the notion of \"repentance\u201d is out of fashion today, the fact remains that a manipulative defiance of the law is not a cheerful datum for the prognosis a sentencing judge undertakes. . . . Impressions about the individual being sentenced\u2014 the likelihood that he will transgress no more, the hope that he may respond to rehabilitative efforts to assist with a lawful future career, the degree to which he does or does not deem himself at war with his society \u2014 are, for better or worse, central factors to be appraised under our theory of \"individualized\u201d sentencing. The theory has its critics. While it lasts, however, a fact like the defendant\u2019s readiness to lie under oath before the judge who will sentence him would seem to be among the more precise and concrete of the available indicia. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number><em>[United States v </em>Hendrix, 505 F2d 1233, 1236 (CA 2, 1974).][<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">We do not suggest that the trial judge has uncontrolled discretion in this area, or that there could not be circumstances in which the record would support a claim that the defendant\u2019s testimony did not display a flagrant willingness to lie under oath, that the trial court gave improper weight to false testimony on an irrelevant matter, or that the trial court improperly concluded that the perjury in question was wilful, that is, that although material the evidence could not rationally be attributed to the defendant and was therefore not relevant to the prospects for rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">However, when the record contains a rational basis for the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant\u2019s testimony amounted to wilful, material, and flagrant perjury, and that such misstatements have a logical bearing on the question of the defendant\u2019s prospects for rehabilitation, the trial court properly may consider this circumstance in imposing sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">We can perceive no basis for denying to a trial judge at sentencing the type of circumstantial inference that a factfinder may indisputedly draw from flight, or from fabrication of evidence. In such an instance, the factfinder may infer consciousness of guilt. In the sentencing process, the trial judge is required to presume guilt in fact and should be allowed to infer that a defendant\u2019s wilful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>material perjury under oath circumstantially indicates the absence of a character trait for being law-abiding that bears on the appropriate sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">Nor can we accept the premise that permitting consideration of such circumstance in evaluating a convicted defendant\u2019s prospects for rehabilitation will chill the exercise of the defendant\u2019s right to trial.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">The United States Supreme Court has recently and unanimously reaffirmed that there is no right, constitutional or otherwise, to testify falsely, <em>Nix v Whiteside, </em>475 US 157; 106 S Ct 988; 89 L Ed 2d 123 (1986), and the Court specifically rejected the chilling argument as \"without basis\u201d in <em>Grayson.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-8\">The right guaranteed by law to a defendant is narrowly the right to testify truthfully in accordance with the oath \u2014 unless we are to say that the oath is mere ritual without meaning. . . . Assuming, arguendo, that the sentencing judge\u2019s consideration of defendants\u2019 untruthfulness in testifying has any chilling effect on a defendant\u2019s decision to testify falsely, that effect is entirely permissible. There is no protected right to commit perjury. <em>[United States v Grayson, supra, </em>p 54.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b840-10\">The Legislature has declared that tailoring the sentence to the offender is the task of the trial judge. It is not attitudinal formulation but this legislatively imposed responsibility that requires the trial court to make the agonizing evaluation of the person who stands before the court awaiting judgment in light of the consequences of the crime committed and the need to protect society. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>would surely simplify the duties of trial court judges if sentences were to be imposed without these considerations, but it is just as surely inconsistent with the sentencing policy the Legislature has declared and that the defendant, the victim, and the public therefore have a right to expect. To fail to appreciate this fact is to fail to understand the significance of the obligation of a trial court judge to the oath of office. To a trial judge, wilful and flagrant mendacity is not an \"abstraction\u201d but part of the mix of considerations brought to bear in this process so vital to the defendant, to the victim, and to the community.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">As the Court in <em>Grayson </em>observed, the moral postulate of our legal system is that the normal individual has freedom of will and therefore the duty to choose between good and evil. That premise is reflected in decisions such as <em>Nix, </em>in the Canons of Professional Ethics, and in the rule we adopt today.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">The uniquely American commitment to procedural due process and our historical mistrust of government has fostered not only tolerance but admiration for the skillful ambush of the powers that be. We are not required, however, to hold harmless the creation of a wholly fabricated defense. As difficult as the process is, the fact is that trial judges, like trial lawyers, and particularly lawyers in criminal defense work, are constantly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>called upon to resolve issues regarding what conduct permissibly pushes the system to the limit, and what is abuse of the process. A system that imposes such refined and particularized responsibility rests on the notion that humankind has choices and that consequences flow from one choice or the other. This is a moral postulate ingrained in our tradition. That the postulate cannot be proven does not destroy its efficacy. The postulate is asserted to affirm both what we are and what we ought to be as a legal system and as a country. The opposing view reduces the individual defendant to an automaton, the lawyer to an appendage of the client\u2019s desires, and the system itself to the deterministic posture that in the face of adversity one cannot expect and therefore cannot judge another human being by the lengths to which they will go to escape the consequences of a current predicament.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">\n<em>A. PEOPLE v ADAMS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">The defendant argues that the record fails to show that Judge Borradaile considered his perjurious testimony as a rehabilitative factor. We cannot agree. At the original sentencing, Judge Borradaile indicated his reasons for the sentence imposed stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-8\"><em>The Court: </em>Mr. Adams, I have read through the presentence investigation report. And, of course, I\u2019ve heard the entire trial of this matter because I was the presiding Judge at the trial of the matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-9\">I consider that you got on the witness stand and lied to the Court, lied to the jury. And, the Court is satisfied that the evidence was exactly as I believe you told the probation officer in your comment that you say, quote, \"If I had been on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>jury, I would have come to the same decision,\u201d end quote.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-4\">I\u2019m satisfied you did it. I don\u2019t know if your ex-brother-in-law was involved with you. That\u2019s something that apparently the prosecutor and the police could not determine as to whether he had in fact was [sic] involved as well. So they did not proceed against him. But <em>I\u2019m satisfied you proceeded and I\u2019m satisfied that you got on the witness stand and lied to the jury and to the Court. And, for that reason I don\u2019t consider that there is any basis, when somebody lies, to justify attempting probation when they can\u2019t tell the truth when they\u2019re under oath. So I intend to incarcerate you. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-5\">Mr. Kittendorf, you may address the Court at this time relative to allocution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-6\"><em>Mr. Kittendorf: </em>Judge, first of all, Mr. Adams does have employment available to him. And, if the Court should see fit to send Mr. Adams to the county jail, we would request that he have a work release program so that he can both honor his support obligation to his previous family and his support obligation to his present family.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-7\">And, in addition to that, we recognize the \u2014 Of course, I was here during the course of the trial. And, I discussed the issue that you\u2019ve raised right now with the young lady that did the probationary report. And, I\u2019m not certain that I can totally \u2014 I can agree with you that he lied. I can certainly agree that \u2014 with Mr. Adams\u2019 comment that there was a significant amount of circumstantial evidence that was involved in this particular case. I would hope that the Court would decide this matter on the basis of what Mr. Adams can contribute to the community. And, that\u2019s really all that I have to say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-8\"><em>The Court: </em>All right, anything you wish to add, Mr. Adams?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-9\"><em>The Defendant: </em>No, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-10\"><em>The Court: </em>All right, <em>I don\u2019t consider that someone who takes advantage of a family where he had apparently been a guest before and then lies in the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number><em>trial of the matter has any basis for rehabilitation. </em>And, that\u2019s the Court\u2019s determination as to sending him to the state penitentiary. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">After remand from the Court of Appeals ordering \"an explanation of the court\u2019s reasons in imposing this sentence,\u201d Judge Borradaile similarly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-7\">And the Court notes that the testimony was quite clear in the instant case that the defendant had been a family friend of the family who was victimized in this matter. It was quite apparent that he knew that there was going to be a wedding and that the family would be away from the home. And the Court feels that he played upon that personal knowledge as well as his buddy and apparent brother-in-law who also attended the wedding and the wedding reception thereafter. And the Court is satisfied that the defendant used that acquaintance with the family and the personal knowledge through his brother-in-law that they were, going to be away as the basis for his going to the house when he knew that there would be no one there for a period of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-8\">So that the Court feels that that is an \u2014 is a factor that calls for increasing the sentence over what the sentence might have been as a matter of departure from what the guidelines would show.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-9\">The Court also felt that even though he had no previous record, and thus under some circumstances if there [sic] weren\u2019t for this violation of trust that he might be a fit subject for probation, the amount of money involved \u2014 over $3,000 was <em>paid </em>\u2014 the <em>fact that he took the witness stand and the Court was satis\u00f1ed that he told a bald-faced lie in the courtroom, and despite the Supreme Court recently ruling that there is a difference between various types of perjury committed in a criminal offense, the Court is of the opinion that he is not a f\u00edt subject for probation. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>Thus those two factors, the violation of trust and the lying on the witness stand, were the two factors, as noted in the previous transcript of the sentencing, that the Court took into account in determining the sentence of five years minimum to fifteen years maximum.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Review of these proceedings illustrates that the defendant\u2019s false testimony was but one element considered, and that rehabilitation was a motivating factor in Judge Borradaile\u2019s sentence. There is no indication from the record that punishment for perjury was intended or contemplated.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">In this case, the record reveals that defendant\u2019s perjured testimony was material to his defense. The defendant freely chose to testify after consulting with his defense counsel and offered corroborating testimony from other witnesses to substantiate his alibi defense. The defendant\u2019s testimony was entirely exculpatory and bore directly on the question of his guilt. The record supports Judge Borradaile\u2019s conclusion that the defendant lied while testifying and that, therefore, his use of that fact when assessing defendant\u2019s prospects for rehabilitation was not error. We, therefore, reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the defendant\u2019s original sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">In light of the foregoing analysis, we need not decide whether Adams\u2019 appeal should forfeit because he escaped during its pendency. In Michigan, a first appeal is a constitutional right. To wade into the waters of waiver or forfeiture is thus unnecessary. We adhere to the Court\u2019s practice \"not to grapple with a constitutional issue except as a last resort.\u201d <em>Taylor v Auditor General, </em>360 Mich 146, 154; 103 NW2d 769 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>B. <em>PEOPLE v STITT</em></p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">In this case, the defendant argues that he was denied the protections of a trial for perjury when Judge Ransom included among his reasons for the sentence imposed that the defendant lied to the jury. At the sentencing, Judge Ransom stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-7\"><em>The Court: </em>Mr. Stitt, the sentence guidelines which the court is to use as a guide in sentencing provides for a minimum sentence range from zero to twelve months. I\u2019m going to deviate from that sentence guideline and I\u2019m required to state on the record why I\u2019m not going to follow the guidelines and why I\u2019m going to impose the sentence that I\u2019m going to impose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-8\">So, I\u2019m compelled to say some things here that I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not going to like, but that\u2019s my obligation and I\u2019m going to tell it to you as I see it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-9\"><em>I\u2019m satis\u00f1ed that you lied to the jury. I\u2019m satistied that you have been manipulative in dealing with the pre-sentence investigator. I\u2019m satis\u00f1ed from the report that the pre-sentence investigator felt also that you lie [sic]. This is an assaultive offense and I\u2019m satis\u00f1ed that you have no scruples when it comes to your conduct and other peoples\u2019 rights. I think you\u2019re a threat to the community and for that reason I\u2019m going to impose the maximum sentence that can be imposed here. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-10\">Defendant\u2019s argument is predicated upon his belief that Judge Ransom was punishing him for lying at trial. Review of this excerpt indicates that this is not the case. Judge Ransom listed in support of the sentence given, his belief that the defendant lied, that he was manipulative with the presentence investigator, that his was an assaultive offense, that he had no respect for the rights of others, and that he was a threat to the community. For these reasons a lengthy prison term was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>selected.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We are satisfied that Judge Ransom was not punishing Mr. Stitt for lying. Rather, Mr. Stitt\u2019s mendacity while testifying was merely stated as a factor in sentencing which was \"probative of his attitudes toward society and prospects for rehabilitation . . . .\u201d <em>Grayson, supra, </em>p 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">As in <em>Adams, </em>the record in this instance supports the use of defendant\u2019s perjury at sentencing. He testified that he was inside Mounir\u2019s grocery store at the time of the theft and that Val Rawls had taken the purse. Further, he claimed that he had assisted Sergeant Richard Lewis in an attempt to locate the missing purse. These claims were completely contradicted by the testimony of Officer Lewis and by the identification of defendant as the perpetrator by the complaining witness Fisher. The defendant freely testified to these facts, and his testimony was obviously material to the issue of his guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">Judge Ransom indicated that the defendant\u2019s false testimony was but one factor he addressed when passing sentence. We find that factor to have been properly considered. The decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the defendant\u2019s original sentence is reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">Were the role of the sentencing judge merely to match the sentence to the crime, the burden of sentencing would be far less onerous. Our system, however, requires that focus be on the defendant. At this stage, character is always at issue. We observe, as did the <em>Grayson </em>Court, that_</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>[n]othing we say today requires a sentencing judge to enhance, in some wooden or reflex fashion, the sentences of all defendants whose testimony is deemed false. Rather, we are reaffirming the authority of a sentencing judge to evaluate carefully a defendant\u2019s testimony on the stand, determine\u2014 with a consciousness of the frailty of human judgment \u2014 whether that testimony contained willful and material falsehoods, and, if so, assess in light of all the other knowledge gained about the defendant the meaning of that conduct with respect to his prospects for rehabilitation and restoration to a useful place in society. <em>[Id., </em>p 55.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">We should not be understood as intimating that when assessing the prospects for rehabilitation perjured testimony should always be considered. We only hold that to do so based upon a wilful, material, and flagrant falsehood is not error.</p>\n<judges id=\"b848-7\">Riley, C.J., and Brickley, Archer, and Griffin, JJ., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b830-9\"> <em>People v Adams, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, decided December 12, 1985 (Docket No. 69537).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b830-10\"> See MCL 750.193; MSA 28.390, making prison escape a felony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b831-7\"> Ms. Fisher testified that someone had returned her purse through the mail.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b832-11\"> <em>People v Stitt, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, decided November 7, 1985 (Docket No. 79651).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b833-8\"> MCL 771.14; MSA 28.1144.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b833-9\"> See, e.g., <em>People v Fleming, </em>428 Mich 408, 429; 410 NW2d 266 (1987) (good-time release, disciplining credit, or effect of Prison Overcrowding Emergency Powers Act may not be considered); <em>People v Yennior, </em>399 Mich 892; 282 NW2d 920 (1977) (sentence may not be based on refusal to admit guilt); <em>People v Moore, </em>391 Mich 426, 440; 216 NW2d 770 (1974) (sentencing judge may not consider noncounseled convictions); <em>People v Earegood, </em>383 Mich 82, 85; 173 NW2d 205 (1970) (improper to consider defendant\u2019s last-minute plea or jury trial waiver); <em>People v Towns, </em>69 Mich App 475, 479; 245 NW2d 97 (1976) (sentencing judge may not consider polygraph results).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b835-8\"> Prosecution under the perjury statute, MCL 750.422; MSA 28.644, is the appropriate course when the circumstances indicate that <em>punishment </em>is warranted.

I am persuaded that the risks to the adversarial system and to the defendant\u2019s freedom to exercise his trial rights clearly and manifestly outweigh whatever improvement might result in the assessment of a defendant\u2019s prospects for rehabilitation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>A person charged with an offense should not be put in fear of providing truthful testimony because of the possibility that the trier of fact and the sentencing judge might perceive that he testified falsely and that the judge might, on that basis, summarily enhance the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">To protect the adversarial system and a defendant\u2019s unfettered opportunity to exercise his trial rights, this Court should state, as a matter of policy, that a sentencing judge should assess a defendant\u2019s prospects for rehabilitation without regard to whether he testifies or otherwise defends against the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">The defendant\u2019s right to testify and defend himself at trial is not, indeed, a license to commit perjury or suborn perjury.

We have all heard of a circuit judge who opened court with the statement: \"Let the perjury begin.\u201d Nor is it confined to defendants or witnesses for the defense. Witnesses for the prosecution also lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">Empowering judges to address this evil only when a defendant in a criminal case is perceived to have lied is not an appropriate judicial or governmental response to the troubling problem of lying in judicial proceedings. A more serious and meaningful response is called for, a response that addresses the evil in both civil cases and in criminal cases \u2014 where a witness for the prosecution or the defense lies, not only where the defendant lies.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">Suppose that after the conclusion of the trial of a civil action, the judge cited for contempt of court for lying<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> both the party whose position was rejected by the trier of fact and the party\u2019s witnesses and then summarily sentenced them to serve up to thirty days in the county jail and pay a fine of up to $250.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> If this were to occur, the general trial bar would no doubt be speaking to us most urgently about due process and the threat to the adversarial system.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">If judges were to move summarily against witnesses in civil actions or against witnesses for the prosecution on the basis that their disbelieved evidence constituted contempt, it would be clearer than it apparently is today that the issue of the defendant\u2019s guilt and the issue whether the defendant gave false evidence are separate issues<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and that traditional safeguards against possible abuse of power should not be short-circuited._</p>\n<p id=\"AfA\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">Suppose that the Legislature enacted a law providing that if a defendant pleads guilty, the minimum sentence for burglary <em>(Adams) </em>shall not exceed five years, and the minimum sentence for larceny from a person <em>(Stitt) </em>shall not exceed three years. Suppose the law further provides that if the defendant does not plead guilty, but rather stands trial and puts the people to their proofs but does not offer affirmative evidence in defense, the minimum possible sentence is increased by one year; if he offers evidence in defense, an additional year may be added, and, if he testifies, another year may be added to enhance the sentence <em>if, </em>in the opinion of the sentencing judge, the defendant indicated by his defense, evidence or testimony that he is not a good prospect for rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">I would hope that the Court would be uneasy about such legislation and would view it as authorizing the imposition of punishment without the safeguards of a trial and as penalizing a defendant\u2019s exercise of his constitutional rights to a trial, to be judged by a jury, to offer a defense, and to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">I see no significant difference between the potential effect of such legislation and the potential effect of the opinion that the Court announces today.

It would seem that the judge\u2019s perception that the defendant lacked any real defense<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> would be as demonstrative of poor prospects for rehabilitation as the judge\u2019s perception that the defendant committed perjury. Similarly, a defendant who offers evidence to rebut the prosecution\u2019s evidence or who permits his lawyer to cross-examine the complainant or other factual witnesses offered by the prosecution might also be seen as being unreceptive to rehabilitation.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">Simply stated, in that analysis, a guilty verdict may be seen to \"establish\u201d the defendant\u2019s intransigence in that he should have spared the complainant and the people the expense, inconvenience, and embarrassment of a trial. A defendant who fails to \"cooperate\u201d with the prosecution by entering a guilty plea thereby demonstrates that he has a poor attitude toward society and is unlikely to become rehabilitated and may therefore be sentenced more severely.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b857-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>The majority\u2019s attitudinal formulation thus can readily be extended to discourage exercise of trial rights without regard to whether the defendant testifies, commits perjury, or suborns perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Juries tend to view a defendant\u2019s failure to testify as signifying that he is guilty. Revised MRE 609 (impeachment by evidence of conviction of a crime) recognizes the importance of removing barriers in the way of a defendant testifying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-7\">If a determination of prejudicial effect is required, the court shall consider only the conviction\u2019s similarity to the charged offense and the <em>possible effects on the decisional process if admitting the evidence causes the defendant to elect not to testify. </em>The court must articulate, on the record, the analysis of each factor. [Emphasis added.]_</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>Today\u2019s decision presents the defendant with a difficult choice. If he fails to testify, the jury may be inclined to Anew his failure to testify as evidence of guilt. If he testifies and is convicted, his sentence may be summarily enhanced without meaningful judicial reAdew. Even if he testifies truthfully, he may receive a harsher sentence if the jury and the judge erroneously believe that he was lying and the judge, on that basis, believes that his prospects for rehabilitation warrant an enhanced sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">Under the majority\u2019s analysis, an innocent defendant who is convicted because his defense is disbelieved might receive a harsher sentence for haAdng testified and persisted in his assertion of innocence.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> One would expect that, at sentencing, an innocent person who has been erroneously convicted might say, \"Your honor, I am innocent. The jury made a mistake.\u201d Uttering those words may add years to a defendant\u2019s punishment because they may be perceived by the sentencing judge as eAddencing a poor attitude toward society.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">Today\u2019s decision unavoidably discourages a defendant from giving truthful, as well as false, testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">The majority argues that its holding logically flows from the legislative mandate that sentences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>be individually tailored to suit the offender, as well as the offense. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes cautioned, however: \"The life of the law has not been logic: it has been experience.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Asx\">I acknowledge that there is a certain logic to the majority\u2019s position. The Legislature has indeed determined that sentences should be individualized.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The offender\u2019s prospects for rehabilitation is a factor that the sentencing judge may consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\">Typically, truthfulness or mendacity is probative of character and hence of a person\u2019s attitude toward society. It may indicate whether he is law abiding and, if he does break the law, what his prospects for rehabilitation might be.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Those abstractions do not, however, provide a basis for individualizing the sentence of a particular offender absent evidence that there is in fact a correlation between mendacity and a particular offender\u2019s prospects for rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">And even if a correlation between a particular offender\u2019s mendacity and his prospects for rehabilitation were to be established, I nevertheless would urge that a judge not be permitted to consider the offender\u2019s apparent mendacity. Compelling policy reasons \u2014 the need to avoid diminishing the adversary system and the accused\u2019s opportunity to exercise his trial rights \u2014 militate against authorizing a judge to consider his perception of the bona fides of the defendant\u2019s testimony or defense at the time of sentencing._</p>\n<p id=\"b860-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>VI</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">In authorizing a judge to consider, at the time of sentencing, his belief that the defendant lied at the trial, the majority necessarily proceeds on the premise that a more accurate assessment of a particular offender\u2019s prospects for rehabilitation will be made if the judge can consider such perception than if the perception must be ignored.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">No evidence, in general or in particular, of the assumed correlation between lying and a defendant\u2019s prospects for rehabilitation has been presented to this Court. The sentencing judges apparently proceeded on essentially the same premise as does the majority: it is generally so well established that there is a meaningful correlation between a defendant\u2019s lying and his prospects for rehabilitation, that a judge may act on that generalization to \"individualize\u201d the sentence of a <em>particular </em>defendant without either evidence to support the premise that there is indeed a correlation as applied to <em>that </em>defendant or providing <em>that </em>defendant an opportunity to offer contrary evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">To be sure, sentencing proceedings do not have the formality of a trial. By characterizing a judge\u2019s perception that a defendant committed or suborned perjury as a sentencing factor, the safeguards of a trial are bypassed. The defendants in the instant cases were not notified in advance of the sentencing hearings that the sentencing judges had perceived that they had lied and were considering enhancing the sentences on that basis. There was no hearing on the accuracy of the judges\u2019 perceptions that Adams or Stitt lied at their trials. The judges did not state, except generally and only <em>after </em>the defendant\u2019s lawyer and the defendant were given an opportunity to address the court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>the evidence on which they relied in concluding that the defendants had lied. <em>After </em>the judges stated their determinations, the defendants were not given an opportunity to challenge the evidence on which the judges relied or to offer contrary evidence or argument. And, because there is no meaningful judicial review of such determinations and the resulting enhancement of sentences, the appellate review which a person convicted of perjury or subornation of perjury could obtain is effectively eliminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">I would anticipate that if inquiry into the validity of the premise that there is a meaningful correlation between a <em>particular </em>defendant\u2019s lying and his prospects for rehabilitation were required or permitted, it would appear that there is a variety of expert opinion on the validity of the assumed correlation, generally and in particular.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">Even if the assumed correlation between a particular defendant\u2019s lying and his prospects for rehabilitation were to be established, because of the risks to the adversarial system and the defendant\u2019s opportunity to exercise his trial rights in permitting a sentencing judge to consider his belief that the defendant gave false testimony, that perception should not be permitted to be considered unless it <em>signi\u00f1cantly </em>adds to other characterological information concerning the particular defendant whose sentence is to be \"individualized.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">The sentencing judges in the instant cases did not state bases for concluding that the defendants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>testifying falsely added significantly to other characterological evidence they had observed at trial or set forth in the presentence reports concerning the defendants\u2019 prospects for rehabilitation.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">There has been a recurring ebb and flow in penological theories. Few, if any, have stood the test of time. There has been sufficient disillusionment with penological theories that this Court should be cautious before embracing yet another.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">Before a judge sentences on the premise that a significant and meaningful correlation exists between a particular defendant\u2019s testimony and his prospects for rehabilitation, he should at least<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> follow a more formal procedure than is ordinarily followed in sentencing. He should observe procedures comparable to those applicable when a judge wishes to take judicial notice of an asserted fact and thereby provide a defendant with an opportunity to offer expert and other testimony and evidence in opposition.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">Lesser sentences may properly be imposed on defendants who are truly repentant and who, without regard to whether they have exercised their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>right to a trial, are perceived to have good prospects for rehabilitation.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">Some persons who accept responsibility for their wrongdoing may indeed take a significant step on the path to rehabilitation. But it is difficult to determine whether a particular defendant has in fact accepted responsibility for his wrongdoing<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> or whether taking that step is truly indicative of progress toward actual rehabilitation.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">Over ninety percent of criminal cases are disposed of by pleas of guilty. The recidivist rate would certainly be lower if admitting one\u2019s guilt reflected that one was a good prospect for rehabilitation. Since a large number of offenders commit further crimes \u2014 most of whom pled guilty when they were convicted \u2014 there may not be a significant difference in the prospects for rehabilitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>of persons who plead guilty compared to persons who stand trial and testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">No evidence has been adduced that persons who are convicted on their pleas of guilty are better prospects for rehabilitation than those who stand trial and are convicted after their testimony or defense is rejected. Study may establish that there is little basis for believing that either group of offenders has good prospects for rehabilitation or that the prospects of both groups are much the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">IX</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">I recognize that, under our system of justice, a defendant who stands trial may pay a price therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">Whatever one may think of the practice of plea bargaining,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> whether for charge reduction or sentence concessions, it is a fact of life in the criminal justice system. A defendant who rejects a plea bargain for charge reduction runs the risk that, if convicted, his sentence will be more severe than it might have been under the terms offered by the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">Even if no defense is presented, a sentencing judge might justifiably be more inclined to sentence the offender to a longer term than he would have imposed if the offender had pled guilty because, during trial, the judge learned the details of the offense and may have developed a greater appreciation of its enormity. Also, because the details of the offense might become notorious \u2014 as a result of publicity that would not have occurred but for the defendant\u2019s exercise of the right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>trial \u2014 a judge might enhance the defendant\u2019s sentence to deter others.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">A sentencing judge may consider what he observes in the courtroom as well as what he reads in the presentence report. But, because of the potential effect on the adversary system and the defendant\u2019s opportunity to exercise his trial rights, allowing a judge to consider his perceptions of a defendant formed on the basis of the defendant\u2019s courtroom behavior<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> differs from permitting him to consider his perception of the bona fides of the defendant\u2019s testimony or defense. The latter may affect all defendants who testify and are convicted while the former affects only those who so project themselves by their behavior apart from their defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">x</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">The policy question \u2014 whether a judge should consider his belief that a defendant testified falsely in assessing the defendant\u2019s prospects for rehabilitation \u2014 should not be avoided by postulating that judges are unable to exclude such a perception from consideration.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> At the time of sentencing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>judges are often informed of incidents in a defendant\u2019s history and of prior convictions that the defendant asserts should not be taken into consideration.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Rather than interrupt proceedings to hold a hearing at that time, the judge may state that he will exclude the incident or the prior conviction from consideration.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> We accept a judge\u2019s assertion that he has done so as a matter of course.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">Similarly, there are rules of law that preclude the trier of fact from considering certain evidence in deciding the merits of an issue in dispute. Where the judge sits as trier of fact, he will frequently have learned of subsequent remedial measures, liability insurance, amounts received by the plaintiff in settlement from other tortfeasors, offers in compromise, similar acts, or prior convictions<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> and will be obliged to exclude such information from consideration when, as trier of fact, he decides the meritorious question.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">It is also commonplace for juries to be instructed to ignore evidence inadvertently admitted on the assumption that the jury can be trusted to obey such an instruction. Judgments of conviction, assessments of damages, and findings of no cause of action are routinely affirmed by the appellate courts on that assumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>XI</p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\">The majority states that the \"sentencing judge does not have unfettered discretion. Numerous checks shield the defendant from an arbitrary sentence . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A0n\">The majority adds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-5\">We do not suggest that the trial judge has uncontrolled discretion in this area, or that there could not be circumstances in which the record would support a claim that the defendant\u2019s testimony did not display a flagrant willingness to lie under oath, that the trial court gave improper weight to false testimony on an irrelevant matter, or that the trial court improperly concluded that the perjury in question was wilful, that is, that although material the evidence could not rationally be attributed to the defendant and was therefore not relevant to the prospects for rehabilitation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-6\">However, when the record contains a rational basis for the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant\u2019s testimony amounted to wilful, material, and flagrant perjury, and that such misstatements have a logical bearing on the question of the defendant\u2019s prospects for rehabilitation, the trial court properly may consider this circumstance in imposing sentence. [Ante, p 693.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">The majority reviews the evidence and the sentencing proceedings in the instant cases and concludes that the judges\u2019 determinations that Adams and Stitt lied while testifying are supported by the record, that their perceptions were but one factor considered in determining the sentences that were imposed, that in the case of Adams \"rehabilitation was a motivating factor,\u201d and that in neither case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>does the record indicate that punishment for perjury was intended or imposed.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">It will be a rare case where a defendant\u2019s testimony will not bear \"directly on the question of his guilt.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> To the extent that the defendant does not testify \"directly on the question of his guilt\u201d on direct examination, the prosecutor will, on cross examination, surely focus \"directly on the question of his guilt.\u201d The record will always contain a rational basis for the conclusion that \"material\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> misstatements have been presented. If there is not record support for the conclusion that the defendant lied while testifying, there would assuredly have been insufficient evidence to convict, and the information should have been dismissed before sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">Since there will assuredly be record support for the conclusion that the defendant lied while testifying whenever a defendant is convicted after testifying, a search for record support does not provide a check serving to \"shield the defendant from an arbitrary sentence.\u201d Nor does such a limited search demonstrate that an appellate court has scrutinized the sentence to determine whether the judge abused his discretion or gave improper weight to perceived perjury on an irrelevant matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">Since the majority does not require that the record contain evidence establishing a correlation between lying and a particular defendant\u2019s prospects for rehabilitation, the conclusion that a particular defendant\u2019s \"misstatements have a logical bearing on the question of [his] prospects for rehabilitation\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> is effectively insulated from appellate challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"AEt\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>XII</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">Adams was twenty-nine years old, married, gainfully employed, and had no known juvenile or adult offense history aside from the instant offense. The probation officer stated that, \"aside from his recent conviction, he has led a relatively stable and law abiding life. However, he continues to deny his involvement in the instant offense, and, in view of this attitude, it would appear that probation supervision would serve little purpose for this individual.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> It was recommended that Adams be sentenced to serve a period of time in the county jail, i.e., no more than one year.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">The sentencing guidelines\u2019 minimum sentence for Adams\u2019 offense was zero to twelve months.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> He was sentenced to serve a minimum term of sixty months. The majority states that the sentencing judge did not err in considering that Adams \"lied while testifying\u201d in \"assessing defendant\u2019s prospects for rehabilitation,\u201d but it does not focus on the question whether the judge abused his discretion in sentencing Adams to five times the maximum minimum sentence recommended by the sentencing guidelines. Unless this Court is prepared to address that question, the assertions in the majority opinion that the sentencing judge does not enjoy \"unfettered discretion,\u201d that \"[n]umerous checks shield the defendant from an arbitrary sentence,\u201d and that the judge does not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>\"uncontrolled discretion in this area\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> are unpersuasive.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">XIII</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">The majority has, in effect, authorized a sentencing judge to perceive and characterize the defendant as a liar and determine on that basis that he is not a good prospect for rehabilitation in every case where the defendant has been convicted following a trial at which he testified \u2014 without requiring or permitting an evidentiary inquiry or opportunity to refute those conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">The Court should consider whether it would not be wiser to formally treat the assumed correlation between lying and prospects for rehabilitation as a sentencing guideline factor. The guideline could state that persons who are convicted after testify<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>ing or offering evidence can be charged with additional points in the sentencing guidelines, either in every case or in the discretion of the judge. This would be less threatening to the adversary system and the exercise of trial rights and would provide at least some structure for the administration of this \"attitudinal\u201d factor, some potential limitation on the amount of additional prison time to be served, and some basis for sentence review.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">XIV</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">Our reluctance to move with greater alacrity in providing meaningful judicial review of sentencing decisions suggests that aspirations should be raised, not lowered, and counsels caution in legitimating a sentencing factor that can be applied in a manner threatening bedrock values.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">An accused person has a constitutional right to an adjudication on the merits. He cannot, we all agree, be assessed increased punishment for exercising that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">The defense of every defendant who stands before a judge for sentencing has been rejected and, ordinarily, disbelieved by the trier of fact. Permitting a special perjury sentencing assessment to be levied against defendants who testify but nevertheless are convicted when their defense is rejected\u2014 on the unproven premise that they are less promising prospects for rehabilitation than those defendants who either offer no defense or plead guilty sometime before a jury is empaneled or renders a verdict \u2014 unnecessarily deprecates the fundamental principle that no court may enter a judgment before both the people and the defense have had an unfettered opportunity to offer evidence and to have their witnesses, including the defendant, testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">It is one thing to recognize and accept the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>legitimate needs of the justice system.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> It is quite another to legitimate yet another formulation that tends to discourage a defendant\u2019s exercise of trial rights and to claim, in doing so, that this new formulation will better determine defendants\u2019 prospects for rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">Sentencing is important, critically important, but providing a forum for the adjudication of controversies is the principal business of the courts. Preservation of the integrity of the adversarial system \u2014 an important safeguard against government oppression \u2014 requires greater protection of and respect for a defendant\u2019s right to stand trial than is secured by today\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">Today\u2019s decision creates the disturbing prospect that a defendant may understandably refrain from offering truthful testimony in fear that he may be additionally incarcerated if he is perceived to have testified falsely.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-8\">I would remand for resentencing, stating that a sentencing judge may consider his perception of the defendant formed on the basis of his courtroom behavior but not his perception of the bona fides of the defendant\u2019s testimony or defense.</p>\n<judges id=\"b872-9\">Cavanagh, J., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b848-10\"> <em>Ante, </em>p 689.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AY8\"> <em>Ante, </em>p 689.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b849-8\"> <em>Ante, </em>p 689.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">The majority adopts the analysis of the United States Supreme Court in <em>United States v Grayson, </em>438 US 41; 98 S Ct 2610; 57 L Ed 2d 582 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-10\">The <em>Grayson </em>position has been rejected by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts. <em>Commonwealth </em>v <em>Coleman, </em>390 Mass 797; 461 NE2d 157 (1984); <em>Commonwealth v Souza, </em>390 Mass 813; 461 NE2d 166 (1984); <em>Commonwealth v Gresek, </em>390 Mass 823; 461 NE2d 172 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-11\">The Supreme Court of Louisiana observed that <em>Grayson </em>declared that the defendant\u2019s perceived perjury at trial may be examined but cannot be the sole grounds for enhancing his sentence. \"[T]he U.

The indictment contained many counts. It was observed, first, that talk about rehabilitation frequently served as a cosmetic to disguise ugly realities in penal institutions that aggravate rather than cure criminality. It was noted, also, that the application of the rehabilitative ideal resulted in the exercise of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>broad discretion by judges and correctional personnel, a discretion affecting basic human concerns, but largely free of meaningful legal standards and therefore frequently abused. But more important than any of these concerns was the growing perception that rehabilitative measures do not work, that after decades of experimentation there exists no validated scientific evidence of the capacity of rehabilitative programs to reduce criminal recidivism.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-10\">The case against the rehabilitative ideal has achieved spectacular success. Rarely has there been so precipitous and complete a reversal of professional opinion. Today the talk is of deterrence and incapacitation: the law\u2019s promises to inflict punishment on those who violate it must be kept. Sentences should be fixed and not subject to the discretion of parole boards; in many cases minimum sentences of imprisonment are to be mandatory. Persons who demonstrate dangerous propensities to violence should be subjected to long terms of incarceration. The concept of deserved punishment is to be refurbished and pressed into service.

A consecutive sentence for perjury would be a meaningful deterrent to all such persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-10\">The deterrent effect of a consecutive sentence for perjury would be greater than the deterrent effect of the consecutive felony-firearm sentence because a defendant contemplating perjury has the opportunity to reflect, after committing the underlying offense and after consultation with counsel, and to consider whether he wishes to lie on the stand and thereby run the risk of further prosecution and a consecutive sentence for perjury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b854-8\"> See 17 Am Jur 2d, Contempt, \u00a7 33, pp 38-39; <em>In re Scott, </em>342 Mich 614; 71 NW2d 71 (1955).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b854-9\"> MCL 600.1715; MSA 27A.1715.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b854-10\"> See <em>People v Grimmett, </em>388 Mich 590, 608; 202 NW2d 278 (1972).

To the extent that there is delay in confession, the defendant could be considered less sincere and less credible, and the prospects for his rehabilitation could be seen as less promising.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-14\">Meaningful differences between offenders in each of the foregoing subclasses, in terms of their attitudes toward society and their prospects for rehabilitation, have not, however, been established by evidence in the trial courts or before this Court.

But, a defendant who does not ask for mercy on the ground that he is repentant should not be called upon at sentencing \u2014 as distinguished from at a trial for perjury or subornation of perjury or a separate contempt hearing \u2014 to justify his defense or testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-9\">A defendant may \u2014 at least until today \u2014 exercise his trial rights without explanation to the prosecutor, the presentence probation officer, or the court. This Court should protect the free exercise of those rights from direct or indirect invasion or penalty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b863-10\"> Whatever correlation there may be between recognition and acceptance by the offender of responsibility for personal character defects and the prospects for or actuality of rehabilitation, few persons, including judges, have the knowledge or experience to assess the significance of the correlation in particular cases.

He might have acknowledged his guilt to his family, friends, a therapist, or his employer and taken meaningful steps to reorganize his life and reform. He may have done so before the criminal justice system ran its course. Such a person might nevertheless have availed himself of the opportunity to stand trial in the hope that the trier of fact might conclude that he was guilty of a lesser offense than the prosecutor was willing to allow him to plead guilty to.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b864-9\"> See <em>People v Byrd, </em>12 Mich App 186; 162 NW2d 777 (1968) (Levin, J., concurring).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b865-8\"> A judge contemplating taking into consideration his perceptions of the defendant, formed on the basis of the defendant\u2019s courtroom behavior, should so indicate before sentencing and provide the defendant an opportunity to attempt to persuade the judge not to do so.

In the few months following commission of the instant offense, Stitt was charged with committing arson, assault and battery on two occasions, and, one year later, with breaking and entering an occupied dwelling. The two assault and battery charges were dismissed before sentencing in the instant case. A nolle prosequi was entered in respect to the arson charge a few months after such sentencing on the same day that Stitt was convicted of breaking and entering an occupied dwelling, a crime for which a consecutive sentence of four to ten years was imposed. See <em>People v Lee, </em>391 Mich 618, 631; 218 NW2d 655 (1974), where the Court addressed the issue of the consideration at sentencing of other criminal charges pending against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">Stitt was nineteen years old with a substance abuse problem and without steady employment. At the time of sentencing, Stitt and his attorney asked the judge to defer sentencing in accordance with the recommendation of the probation officer until it was determined \"what\u2019s going to happen to the arson charge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b870-10\">The judge declined to defer sentencing, stating that he was satisfied that Stitt had lied to the jury and the presentence investigator.

Discouraging the \"improvident\u201d exercise of trial rights by guilty persons may serve the needs of the judicial system to reduce the number of \"unnecessary\u201d trials by encouraging guilty pleas by persons who should plead guilty (but see <em>People v Snow, </em>386 Mich 586; 194 NW2d 314 [1972]; <em>People v Courts, </em>401 Mich 57; 257 NW2d 101 [1977]), and by summarily punishing defendants, without another \"time consuming\u201d hearing, for the threat and affront to the administration of justice represented by their perjury or subornation of perjury.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
