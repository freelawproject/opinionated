The statements concerned the details of the assault and the identity of her attacker.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">We hold that these statements were not admissible as excited utterances under MRE 803(2). Further, in light of the substantive use of this evidence by the prosecuting attorney, it cannot be concluded that this evidence was merely corroborative. Admitting this testimony for substantive use was error. Consequently, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the trial court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">William Straight was charged with first-degree criminal sexual conduct. The victim was four years old at the time of the alleged assault. The jury\u2019s verdict and the defendant\u2019s conviction of second-degree criminal sexual conduct were affirmed by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">The alleged assault took place in early October, 1982, when the victim\u2019s mother went to the bank late one night with the defendant\u2019s wife. The mother had asked defendant, her next-door neighbor, to look in on her children during the few minutes that she expected to be away. She actually was gone for quite some time. When she arrived home, she found defendant sitting on the floor of her dining room with his legs extended and his arms around the child, who was crying. The mother asked defendant what he was doing, and why the child was out of bed. He responded that when he had looked in on the children he had found the child crying at the top of the stairs and that he had been comforting her when the mother returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>At trial, the mother testified that during the next three to four weeks the child had recurring nightmares and a poor appetite, experienced vomiting, and was irritable. One evening when the child vomited, approximately one month after the mother had found defendant holding the child, the mother and the child\u2019s father took the child to a hospital where the conversation admitted as an excited utterance occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">The child was examined at the hospital where no physical evidence of molestation was found. When the parents and child were alone, they began questioning her about defendant. Both the mother and the child\u2019s father testified about the conversation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The victim, then five years old, also testified. _</p>\n<p id=\"ATO\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">This case represents the most recent example of the tension created in the trial courts and the Court of Appeals by the application of the Rules of Evidence to the unique situation of a child witness in an alleged sexual abuse case. The tension originates from the conflict between two underlying policies: a desire to protect the most vulnerable of our citizens from heinous and damaging exploita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>tion, and a need to protect the accused individual against both erroneous conviction and the devastating consequences that can follow. The tension is exacerbated by an ever-growing number of such cases,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and by what some members of the bench and bar may perceive as an overly rigid application and unfortunate effect of the Rules of Evidence in this category of cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The attempts to resolve this tension vary. The Court of Appeals in this case has urged us to reconsider the holding in <em>People v Kreiner, </em>415 Mich 372; 329 NW2d 716 (1982). What remains consistent, however, is the perception that existing rules of evidence and procedure may not adequately deal with these cases. This case illustrates an extension of the Rules of Evidence to accommodate facts which fail to neatly fall within a recognized exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">An excited utterance is defined as: \"A statement relating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition.\u201d MRE 803(2). Traditional justification for this rule lies in the belief that \"special reliability\u201d can be afforded a statement made while under sufficient stress or excitement because \"the declarant\u2019s powers of reflection and fabrication\u201d are removed. McCormick, Evidence (3d ed), \u00a7 297, p 855.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> To qualify as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>excited utterance, two requirements must be satisfied. First, there must be a startling event, and, second, the resulting statement of the declarant must be made while under the excitement caused by that event.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In <em>People v Gee, </em>406 Mich 279, 282; 278 NW2d 304 (1979), this Court summarized the criteria for the excited utterance as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-6\">To come within the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule, a statement must meet three criteria: (1) it must arise out of a startling occasion;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (2) it must be made before there has been time to contrive and misrepresent; and (3) it must relate to the circumstances of the startling occasion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">The second prong of <em>Gee </em>deals with the relative time, frame, i.e., the statement \"must be made before there has been time to contrive and misrepresent.\u201d Obviously this statement does not contemplate a sequence in which the utterance necessarily follows immediately on the startling event, just as it does not contemplate admission of a statement made while under control, even though made contemporaneously. Thus, <em>Gee </em>did not subordinate the requirements that the statement must be made while under the stress of excitement and relate to the startling event, to the time-to-contrive element of the formulation. Logically there is always time to contrive whether the statement begins as the event is observed or is made ten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>minutes later. Properly understood, Gee\u2019s requirement that the statement must \"be made before there has been time to contrive and misrepresent\u201d is simply a reformulation of the inquiry as to whether the statement was made when the witness was still under the influence of an overwhelming emotional condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">The focus of MRE 803(2), given a startling event, is whether the declarant spoke while still under the stress caused by the startling event. Because the justification for this rule is lack of capacity to fabricate rather than the lack of time to fabricate, which is the justification for the present sense impression exception, MRE 803(1), \"the period of acceptable time will frequently be considerably longer\u201d under 803(2) than is acceptable under 803(1). 4 Weinstein, Evidence, \u00b6 803(2)[01], p 803-90.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-7\">The crucial point is that the court must be able to find that the declarant\u2019s state at the time he made the declaration ruled out the possibility of conscious reflection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-8\">Physical factors, such as shock, unconsciousness or pain, may prolong the period in which the risk of fabrication is reduced to an acceptable minimum. The interaction of other factors may also affect the court\u2019s determination . . . including the nature of the startling event, the character of the statement, the condition of the declarant, the identity of the declarant, and the availability of other evidence. [Weinstein, <em>supra, </em>pp 803-91 to 803-94.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">Few could quarrel with the conclusion that a sexual assault is a startling event.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The difficulty in this case arises because the statements at issue were made approximately one month after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>alleged assault, immediately after a medical examination of the child\u2019s pelvic area, and after repeated questioning by her parents. Under these circumstances, it simply cannot be concluded that the statements were made \"while the declarant was under the stress of excitement <em>caused by the event or </em>conditionCertainly the declarant was under stress, but one cannot safely say that this stress resulted from the alleged assault rather than from a combination of the medical examination and repeated questioning.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">The prosecution argues that should we find the statements at issue inadmissible under MRE 803(2) we should nonetheless hold that the statement of a child should be admissible to corroborate the child\u2019s trial testimony.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We are unwilling to do so in the context of this case. The hearsay testimony of the parents was not offered merely to corroborate the child\u2019s testimony, but rather was offered and argued for its substantive worth as the prosecution\u2019s closing argument clearly reveals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-7\">And ladies and gentlemen, I would suggest to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>you that that was what was happening on that night in question that the statements made by [R_] at the hospital can be considered by you and even if she hasn\u2019t said on the stand what happened as she did yesterday, she just clammed up and said, \"I don\u2019t remember,\u201d or, \"I don\u2019t want to say anything,\u201d you can still find that the defendant is guilty merely from the testimony that the mother gave as to the information given to her and to the father as to what she said in the hospital.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">These comments establish that the parents\u2019 testimony was presented to the jury without limitation as substantive proof of defendant\u2019s guilt.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">The admission of this evidence being erroneous, we must determine whether a miscarriage of justice has resulted. MCL 769.26; MSA 28.1096. Our inquiry is to the \"effect the error had or reasonably may be taken to have had upon the jury\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Kotteakos v United States, </em>328 US 750, 764; 66 S Ct 1239; 90 L Ed 1557 (1946). To determine whether the defendant was so prejudiced that reversal is required, we evaluate the prejudicial effect of testimony in the light of other competent evidence. <em>People v Kregger, </em>335 Mich 457; 56 NW2d 349 (1953). In light of the emphasis placed on this evidence by the prosecution, we cannot safely conclude that the error did not have substantial influence on the jury\u2019s result. Although the child testified at trial regarding the facts related by her parents, these facts were denied by the defendant. When viewed as a one-to-one credibility contest between the child and defendant, the reinforcement provided by the people\u2019s hearsay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>evidence may have tipped the scales toward a guilty verdict. In any event, upon review of the whole record, we conclude that the error was such that failure to grant the requested relief would be inconsistent with substantial justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">Wigmore summarized the general rules regarding admission of out-of-court statements by the victim of a sexual offense as follows: 1) the fact of complaint, including the time and place, but not the identity of the perpetrator, is admissible through third-party testimony in the case in chief,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 2) the details of the complaint, by the majority rule, are not admissible as substantive evidence unless, 3) they come within a hearsay exception such as excited utterance or a res gestae or tender years exception (where recognized), and 4) the statement may be admitted to support the complainant\u2019s credibility where the rules of the jurisdiction would otherwise allow use of a prior consistent statement in rehabilitation. See 4 Wigmore, Evidence (Chadbourn rev), \u00a7\u00a7 1134-1138, pp 297-312.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>This Court long ago struck a balance. between the competing policy interests found in child sexual abuse cases and created a special hearsay exception. In <em>People v Gage, </em>62 Mich 271; 28 NW 835 (1886), the Court observed the uniform rule that the fact of complaint is admissible in the case in chief in a trial for sexual assault,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and recognized a special exception for the admission of a third party\u2019s testimony of the details of the complaint where the \"party outraged is of tender years, and her silence is the direct consequence of fears of chastisement induced by threats of the perpetrator of the wrong.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 274; <em>People v Baker, </em>251 Mich 322, 324-325; 232 NW 381 (1930). What was to become known as the \"tender-years exception\u201d was limited to forcible rape cases, it being determined that except for the most extreme offense of rape the admission of such evidence would upset the balance of competing interests and allow the victim \"to make corroborative evidence upon his own statement to a third party, and of which rule evilly-disposed persons would be likely to take advantage.\u201d <em>People v Hicks, </em>98 Mich 86, 90; 56 NW 1102 (1893).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Thus, in sex abuse cases involving children, the State of Michigan permitted third-party testimony in the case in chief of the fact of the complaint and the details of the complaint where the <em>Gage </em>conditions were met. While there is little case authority in Michigan, case law suggests that third-party testimony is admissible to rehabilitate where the impeachment of a child victim amounted to a claim of recent fabrication, or a claim of bias or interest, <em>People v Hamp, </em>110 Mich App 92; 312 NW2d 175 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">In <em>People v Kreiner, supra, </em>this Court held that the tender-years exception did not survive the adoption of the Michigan Rules of Evidence, barring the use of this theory to admit third-party testimony of the details of the offense. Use of third-party testimony to rehabilitate the impeached child has also been limited by the apparent requirement that the impeachment must amount to a suggestion of recent fabrication or contrivance and that the prior statement must have been made at a time when there was no motive to fabricate. <em>People v Washington, </em>100 Mich App 628, 632-633; 300 NW2d 347 (1980). See, e.g., <em>Cunningham v State, </em>100 Nev 396; 683 P2d 500 (1984) (impeachment by a suggestion that the victim\u2019s testimony was influenced by the mother and by demonstration that prior to the acts in question the victim was jealous of the attention paid by the defendant to the victim\u2019s sister; a prior consistent statement was admissible to rebut a charge of improper influence).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">Our review of cases on application for leave to appeal in the wake of <em>Kreiner </em>has shown increasing resort to the excited utterance exception to admit a young child\u2019s statements. The problems inherent in sex offense cases involving a young child cannot, however, be resolved by stretching <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>the excited utterance exception so far that its intended purpose is abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">It could be observed that adoption of the Michigan Rules of Evidence did not abrogate case law which permitted the use of prior consistent statements for limited purposes,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>People v Edwards, </em>139 Mich App 711, 715; 362 NW2d 775 (1984), or that a preferred approach to the problem is that taken by the Federal Rules of Evidence which define certain prior statements as nonhearsay.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>Some courts have relaxed the rules for corroboration testimony by holding that use of a prior consistent statement for rehabilitation may be permissible even where the statement was made after the motive to fabricate had already arisen, see <em>Nusunginya v </em>State, 730 P2d 172 (Alas App, 1986), <em>People v Koon, </em>724 P2d 1367 (Colo App, 1986), and cases cited in anno: <em>Admissibility of impeached witness\u2019 prior consistent </em>statement\u2014 <em>Modern state criminal cases, </em>58 ALR4th 1015, 1062-1065. Several states have enacted statutes which provide for the use of videotaped testimony of the child witness.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Others have enacted hearsay exceptions designed specifically for prosecutions of child sexual abuse.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Wisconsin has used the catchall residual hearsay exception to admit hearsay statements of a child. <em>Bertrang v State, </em>50 Wis 2d 702; 184 NW2d 867 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">We have yet to take steps specifically directed at the unique evidentiary problems which arise in the prosecution of child criminal sexual conduct cases. While we have declined the prosecution\u2019s invitation to overrule <em>Kreiner, supra, </em>we agree with the observation that this case illustrates the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>need for this Court to consider an amendment of the rules. The proposed court rule which we have ordered published today is directed at this problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">The trial court erred in admitting certain hearsay statements to the substantial prejudice of the defendant.

That she complained of a rape, or an attempt at rape, is all that principle permits; the further terms of her utterance (except so far as to identify the time and place with that of the one charged) are not only immaterial for the purpose, but practically turn the statement into a hearsay assertion, and as such it is inadmissible (except on the third theory).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aao\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>(2) <em>The woman must be a witness. </em>Since the only object of the evidence is to repel the supposed inconsistency between the woman\u2019s present testimony and her former silence, it is obvious that if she has not testified at all, there is no inconsistency to repel, and therefore the evidence is irrelevant. In a rape, for instance, charged to have been committed on a frequented way, and testified to by several bystanders, without calling the woman herself to the stand, it is entirely immaterial whether she made complaint or not; there is no story of hers before the court, and there is therefore no suspicion about such a story and nothing to repel. On the other hand, if the woman has taken the stand, it is immaterial whether she has been impeached or cross-examined (a matter of importance under the next theory); the fact of complaint may be introduced immediately, even by her own testimony in chief.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b575-5\"> This rule is still universally recognized, Wigmore, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1136, pp 307-310.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b577-7\"> The Court of Appeals has urged us to reexamine the holding in <em>Kreiner </em>with an eye towards breathing new life into the \"tender years\u201d rule. <em>Kreiner </em>was premised upon the language of MRE 802: \"Hearsay is not admissible except as provided by these rules.\u201d Because the exceptions listed in MRE 803 did not contain the \"tender years\u201d rule, that doctrine was deemed superseded when the Rules of Evidence were adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">Were we to reexamine <em>Kreiner </em>in light of the argument that the \"tender years\u201d rule is one allowing for corroboration of a victim\u2019s testimony rather than for its substitution with hearsay evidence, a majority might agree that <em>Kreiner </em>is distinguishable.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-9\">The rule in this State is that where the victim is of tender years the testimony of the details of her complaint <em>may be introduced in corroboration of her evidence, </em>if her statement is shown to have been spontaneous and without indication of manufacture; and delay in making the complaint is excusable so far as it is caused by fear or other equally effective circumstance.
