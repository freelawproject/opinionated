We hold that plaintiffs gross negligence claim, which arose out of the unlawful sale, giving, or furnishing of intoxicants, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>is preempted by the exclusive remedy of the dram-shop act.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">PACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">In September, 1982, plaintiff was seriously injured in a single vehicle accident while she was allegedly driving home from defendant\u2019s tavern. Plaintiff filed a complaint against the defendant to recover for her injuries. The complaint alleged that for several hours prior to the accident, plaintiff was a patron at defendant\u2019s tavern. During that time, she consumed excessive amounts of intoxicating liquors which rendered her visibly intoxicated and completely unable to safely operate a motor vehicle. The complaint further alleged that defendant knew or should have known that plaintiff was a compulsive, habitual alcoholic and that defendant was grossly negligent and acted wilfully, wantonly, intentionally, and recklessly in furnishing intoxicating beverages to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">Defendant moved for summary disposition pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(8), maintaining that plaintiff failed to state a valid claim. On October 8, 1985, the trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion. While noting a split of authority in the Court of Appeals, the trial court ruled that the dramshop act, MCL 436.22; MSA 18.993, provides the exclusive remedy against a licensee for injuries arising out of the unlawful sale or furnishing of intoxicating beverages.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">The Court of Appeals reversed the trial court\u2019s ruling and held that the dramshop act\u2019s exclusive remedy applied only to the rights of innocent third parties wrongfully injured by an intoxicated party and did not operate to bar plaintiff\u2019s common-law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>action to recover for her own injuries.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Court ruled that where the facts alleged are sufficient to constitute both gross negligence and actual notice of the plaintiffs condition, the complaint states a valid cause of action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals certified that its decision was in conflict with its prior decisions in <em>Gregory v Kurtis, </em>108 Mich App 443; 310 NW2d 415 (1981), and <em>Lucido v Apollo Lanes &amp; Bar, Inc, </em>123 Mich App 267; 333 NW2d 246 (1983), lv den 417 Mich 1087 (1983), pursuant to Administrative Order No. 1984-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">This Court granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal, limited to the issue whether plaintiffs claim for negligent or wilful serving of intoxicants states a cause of action outside MCL 436.22; MSA 18.993.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">COMMON-LAW LIABILITY OF TAVERN OWNERS</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">The law of this state is in conflict concerning the liability of tavern owners for injuries suffered by one of their intoxicated patrons as the proximate result of the patron\u2019s wrongful intoxication. The general rule at common law was that a tavern owner was not liable for furnishing alcoholic beverages to a customer who became intoxicated and who, as a result of his own intoxication, either injured himself or an innocent third person.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The rationale generally advanced to sustain this rule was that the consumption of the liquor, not the serving of it, was the proximate cause of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>injury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Furthermore, with regard to claims by the intoxicated customer, there was the additional defense of contributory negligence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">A few jurisdictions recognized a very narrow exception to the general rule of nonliability to the intoxicated person in a very limited number of unusual cases where the consumer could be said to have lost his free will, i.e., he was either an alcoholic or intoxicated to the point of helplessness and such condition was either known to the purveyor of the liquor or should have been.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, such an exception was never recognized in this jurisdiction, and it is well established that under the common law of this state it was not a tort to sell or furnish intoxicating liquor to an ordinary and able-bodied person, even though such intoxication resulted in injury to the intoxicated person or others. <em>Millross v Plum Hollow Golf Club, </em>429 Mich 178, 183; 413 NW2d 17 (1987); <em>Manuel v Weitzman, </em>386 Mich 157, 163; 191 NW2d 474 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">Several states, including Michigan, enacted dramshop acts to fill the void left by the common law\u2019s general rule of nonliability.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Under this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>state\u2019s dramshop act, the intoxicated person himself and those who contributed to his intoxication have no right of action under the act. <em>Kangas v Suchorski, </em>372 Mich 396, 401; 126 NW2d 803 (1964); <em>Plamondon v Matthews, </em>148 Mich App 737, 740; 385 NW2d 273 (1985). The inability of the intoxicated person to recover under the act has resulted in such persons attempting to recover damages from the tavern owner under a common-law theory of liability sounding in gross negligence. These efforts raised the question whether the Legislature, in enacting the dramshop act, intended the act to be the exclusive remedy against a tavern owner, thereby preempting other theories of common-law liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">SPLIT OF AUTHORITY IN THE COURT OF APPEALS</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">The present split of authority within the Court of Appeals over whether an intoxicated person may maintain a cause of action outside the dram-shop act for gross negligence or wilful, wanton, and intentional misconduct in selling or furnishing intoxicating liquor to an alcoholic or an individual in a helpless condition, when such sale or furnishing causes injury to that person, stems from this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Manuel v Weitzman. </em>In <em>Manuel, </em>the plaintiff sued the defendant tavern owner for injuries he sustained after being assaulted by another customer on the defendant\u2019s premises. In addition to bringing two counts under the dram-shop act, the plaintiff also alleged that the defendant\u2019s liability stemmed from his common-law duty to maintain a safe premises. The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>dismissed the latter count, ruling that the dram-shop act provided the exclusive remedy against a tavern owner for injuries inflicted by an intoxicated customer. <em>Id. </em>at 161.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">The <em>Manuel </em>Court reversed the trial court\u2019s ruling. In adopting the following language from <em>DeVillez v Schifano, </em>23 Mich App 72; 178 NW2d 147 (1970), the <em>Manuel </em>Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-5\">\"We hold that the dramshop act affords the exclusive remedy for injuries arising out of an unlawful sale, giving away, or furnishing of intoxicants. <em>King v Partridge </em>(1968), 9 Mich App 540, 543 [157 NW2d 417]. However, the act does not control and it does not abrogate actions arising out of unlawful or negligent conduct of a tavern owner other than selling, giving away, or furnishing of intoxicants, provided the unlawful or negligent conduct is recognized as a lawful basis for a cause of action in the common law.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 164-165.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The plaintiffs common-law claim based on the defendant\u2019s failure to maintain a safe premises was not contingent on or necessarily related to establishing the defendant tavern owner\u2019s negligence in furnishing intoxicants to the customer who assaulted the plaintiff. Thus, the Court concluded that the exclusive remedy of the dramshop act did not bar the plaintiffs independent common-law negligence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">The <em>Manuel </em>Court\u2019s holding that independent common-law claims were not abrogated by the dramshop act led to what we believe was an erroneous decision by the Court of Appeals in <em>Grasser v Fleming, </em>74 Mich App 338; 253 NW2d 757 (1977). In <em>Grasser, </em>the complaint alleged that the defendant tavern owner had actual notice that the plaintiffs decedent was a compulsive alcoholic and had agreed with the plaintiff not to serve the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>decedent any intoxicating beverages. The alleged agreement was not honored, and the plaintiffs decedent was fatally injured after becoming extremely intoxicated at the defendant\u2019s tavern. The plaintiffs complaint alleged a cause of action against the defendant tavern owner for gross negligence and wilful, wanton, and intentional misconduct for serving the decedent alcoholic beverages.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">On appeal from a denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the gross negligence claim, the <em>Grasser </em>Court expressed doubt as to whether the holding in <em>Manuel </em>precluded the plaintiffs common-law action for gross negligence. <em>Id. </em>at 345. In concluding that it did not, the <em>Grasser </em>Court noted: 1) <em>Manuel </em>concluded that some independent common-law negligence actions may be maintained outside the dramshop act\u2019s exclusive remedy; 2) although <em>Manuel </em>recognized that it was not a tort at common law to furnish intoxicating liquor to an able-bodied man, the plaintiff in the case before the Court was an elderly and sick man; 3) the narrow exception to the general common-law rule is recognized by some jurisdictions where the intoxicated person was in such a helpless state as to have lost his free will; and 4) finally, it would be inequitable to deny the plaintiff a remedy under the circumstances presented. <em>Id. </em>at 345-346.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">We conclude, however, that the <em>Grasser </em>Court\u2019s reasoning was flawed in that it failed to observe <em>Manuel\u2019s </em>express holding that the dramshop act affords the exclusive remedy for \"injuries arising out of an unlawful sale, giving away, or furnishing of intoxicants.\u201d <em>Manuel, supra </em>at 164-165. Cf. <em>Gregory v Kurtis. </em>The complaint in <em>Grasser </em>alleged that the plaintiffs decedent was already intoxicated when the defendant tavern furnished <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>the decedent further intoxicating beverages. Therefore, such furnishing was unlawful and his fatal injury clearly arose out of that misconduct. Thus, under <em>Manuel, </em>the plaintiffs common-law claim was preempted by the dramshop act\u2019s exclusive remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Subsequent to <em>Grasser, </em>this Court again addressed the scope of the exclusive remedy of the dramshop act, albeit in a different context, in <em>Browder v Int'l Fidelity Ins Co, </em>413 Mich 603; 321 NW2d 668 (1982). In <em>Browder, </em>the issue was whether the plaintiff could bring an action against the defendant tavern owner\u2019s surety on the defendant\u2019s class c liquor bond on a contract theory outside the dramshop act. The plaintiff had filed an amended complaint adding the defendant insurer outside the dramshop act\u2019s two-year limitation period and was seeking to benefit from the six-year limitation period for contract actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">In determining that the dramshop act barred the plaintiffs contract claim and provided the exclusive limitation period, the <em>Browder </em>Court closely examined the act\u2019s pertinent provisions to reach its conclusion that the Legislature intended the act to provide the exclusive remedy for any action arising under dramshop-related facts. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-8\">In summary, we find that the Legislature intended the dramshop act to be a complete and self-contained solution to a social problem not adequately addressed at common law. The plain and unambiguous language, together with the built-in checks and balances adopted by the Legislature to finely hone the rights and obligations of the parties under the act, lead to only one conclusion: the Legislature intended the statutory action of trespass on the case to be the exclusive remedy and \"any action\u201d arising under dramshop-related facts to be instituted within two years. <em>[Id. </em>at 615-616.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Notwithstanding this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Browder, </em>a split of authority continued to develop in the Court of Appeals as to whether an intoxicated person could maintain a common-law action, sounding in gross negligence, outside the dram-shop act to recover for injuries sustained under dramshop-related facts. In <em>Lucido v Apollo Lanes &amp; Bar, Inc, supra </em>at 271, the first panel to consider the question subsequent to <em>Browder, </em>the Court dismissed the intoxicated party\u2019s claim, citing <em>Browder </em>and <em>Manuel, supra, </em>as controlling authority, reasoning that the Legislature had preempted the field and that the dramshop act provided the exclusive remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">However, a second panel of the Court of Appeals found <em>Browder </em>and <em>Manuel </em>to be distinguishable because those cases pertained to the rights of innocent third parties. <em>Morris v Markley, </em>143 Mich App 12; 371 NW2d 464 (1985). In <em>Morris, </em>the plaintiff, an exotic dancer employed by the defendant tavern owner, sustained serious injury in a motor vehicle accident after being served intoxicating beverages while she was working. Similar to the instant case, the plaintiff contended that the defendant knew she was an alcoholic and brought an action against the defendant on a common-law gross negligence theory. The <em>Morris </em>Court reasoned that the holdings in <em>Browder </em>and <em>Manuel </em>concerning the exclusive remedy of the dramshop act only extended to the rights of innocent third parties because that class of claimants is expressly provided for in the act while the act is silent with regard to the rights of intoxicated persons. Furthermore, the Court viewed the action as not arising from the unlawful furnishing of liquor to the plaintiff, but rather from the defendant\u2019s reckless disregard of the plaintiffs welfare after the defendant had actual notice of the plaintiffs help<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>less condition. The Court indicated that its holding constituted a very limited exception to the general rule of nonliability to the intoxicated person. <em>Id. </em>at 15. Finding special significance in the fact that the plaintiff and the defendant were in an employee-employer relationship, the Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-6\">We hold that, in those circumstances where facts are alleged sufficient to constitute both gross negligence and actual notice of plaintiff\u2019s condition that would make the serving of alcohol wilful, wanton and intentional and a reckless disregard of plaintiff\u2019s helpless condition, the claim should be allowed to have a full trial. <em>[Id.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">The Court of Appeals panel in the instant case agreed with the <em>Morris </em>Court that where the facts alleged are sufficient to constitute both gross negligence and actual notice of the plaintiff\u2019s helpless condition, the complaint states a valid cause of action.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Court also similarly viewed the dram-shop act\u2019s exclusive remedy to be limited to the rights of innocent third parties to recover from the tavern owner.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">Subsequent to the Court of Appeals decision in this case, this Court reexamined the extent of the dramshop act\u2019s exclusive remedy and the nature of the common-law liabilities a tavern owner remains subject to under <em>Manuel </em>in <em>Millross v Plum Hollow Golf Club. </em>In <em>Millross, </em>the plaintiff brought an action against the defendant golf club, alleging negligence in the supervision of and failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>provide alternative transportation for an employee who had become intoxicated at a work-related dinner and, thereafter, fatally injured the plaintiffs decedent in a motor vehicle accident. The plaintiff also alleged that the defendant was liable under the dramshop act. The latter count was resolved and a consent judgment entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">The subject of the appeal was the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the plaintiffs negligence action for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted on the defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition. GCR 1963, 117.2(1) [now MCR 2.116(C)(8)]. The principal issue was whether the exclusive remedy of the dramshop act preempted the plaintiffs negligence claim. As we noted in <em>Millross, </em>the question whether a statutory scheme preempts the common law on a subject is a matter of legislative intent. <em>Id. </em>at 183. After applying the principles relevant to ascertaining the legislative intent,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> this Court unequivocally reaffirmed the <em>Browder </em>Court\u2019s conclusion \"that the Legislature intended the dramshop act to be a complete and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>self-contained solution to a problem not adequately addressed at common law and the exclusive remedy for any action arising under 'dramshop related facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Millross, supra </em>at 185-186.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As this Court noted in <em>Browder, supra </em>at 614-615:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-6\">[T]he Legislature has carefully considered and reconsidered the dramshop act to keep it internally balanced. As we have seen, the first adjustment was to add a specific two-year period of limitations where none had existed before. Compare 1958 PA 152, \u00a7 22(2) with 1933 [Ex Sess] PA 8, \u00a7 22 [1948 CL 436.22(2); MSA 18.993(2)]. Then the Legislature enacted a provision requiring that the bond automatically continue from year to year unless the Liquor Control Commission is given ten days\u2019 written notice by the surety of its intent to cancel the bond. 1961 PA 224. In 1972, several changes were made. Originally, the act provided for exemplary damages, 1933 [Ex Sess] PA 8, \u00a7 22, but this apparently tilted the act too far in favor of the claimant, so the Legislature modified the act to provide only for actual damages. The requirement of proximate causation was specifically added as was the provision giving the principal and surety all factual defenses which the intoxicated person or minor possessed. Finally the intricate balance was kept by requiring the plaintiff to name and maintain the intoxicated person who actually committed the injury as a defendant. 1972 PA 196, \u00a7 22(2). This, of course, is to avoid possible collusion between the plaintiff and the one who caused the injury. Cf. <em>Salas v Clements, </em>399 Mich 103, 110; 247 NW2d 889 (1976). In short, the Legislature has carefully created a self-contained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>package which has its own built-in checks and balances, among which are included a specified cause of action and period of limitations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">In striking the balance between the rights of persons injured under dramshop-related facts and the extent of the tavern owner\u2019s liability, the Legislature chose to omit intoxicated persons as a class protected by the act. We decline to view this omission as evincing an intention to permit an intoxicated party, regardless of condition or degree of intoxication, to pursue other common-law theories of liability which would effectively afford such persons greater rights and avenues of recovery than those available to innocent third parties. To the contrary, we believe the Legislature\u2019s failure to include the intoxicated party within the class of persons protected is indicative of its belief that the intoxicated party should not be afforded a remedy. To construe the statute otherwise would do violence to the Legislature\u2019s intent and its continuing efforts to keep the act internally balanced.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">Moreover, we further clarified the <em>Manuel </em>test for determining which claims are proscribed by the exclusive remedy provision and those claims that can still be maintained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-8\"><em>Manuel </em>sets forth a two-part analysis for determining what claims are proscribed by the exclusive remedy provision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-9\">(1) Does the claim against \"the tavern owner\u201d arise out of an unlawful sale, giving away, or furnishing of intoxicants? If so, the dramshop act is the exclusive remedy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-10\">(2) If the claim arises out of conduct other than selling, giving away, or furnishing of intoxicants, does the common law recognize a cause of action for the negligent conduct? If so, then the dram-shop act neither abrogates nor controls the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>mon-law action. If not, there is no independent common-law claim. <em>[Millross, supra </em>at 187.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">Upon applying this test to the facts of the instant case, it is readily apparent that plaintiff\u2019s common-law action for gross negligence is preempted by the dramshop act\u2019s exclusive remedy. In reviewing a grant of summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(8) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, this Court must accept as true all well-pled factual allegations to determine whether plaintiff\u2019s claim is so clearly unenforceable as a matter of law that no factual development could possibly justify a right of recovery. <em>Abel v Eli Lilly &amp; Co, </em>418 Mich 311, 323-324; 343 NW2d 164 (1984), cert den sub nom <em>ER Squibb &amp; Sons v Abel, </em>469 US 833; 105 S Ct 123; 83 L Ed 2d 65 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s complaint set forth the following pertinent allegations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-6\">16. On September 24, 1982, and September 25, 1982, between the hours of 4:00 p.m. and 2:30 a.m. the Plaintiff was a business invitee at Defendant\u2019s bar during which time the Plaintiff consumed excessive intoxicating liquors consisting of two fifths of rum, ten shot glasses of peppermint [s]chnapps and several shots of tequilla [sic], all of of [sic] which were served, sold or furnished to the Plaintiff by the agents, servants and employees of Defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-7\">17. As a direct and proximate result of Plaintiff\u2019s consumption of intoxicating liquors at Defendant\u2019s bar between the hours of 4:00 p.m. and 2:30 a.m. on September 24, 1982, and September 25, 1982, Plaintiff became visibly intoxicated rendering her completely unable to safely operate a motor vehicle, which Defendant knew or should have known, after which time Defendant sold the Plaintiff an additional two cases of beer prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>kicking her out at closing time to drive home with a blood alcohol content in excess of <em>.3%.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-5\">18. On September 25, 1982, at approximately 3:45 A.M., the Plaintiff was operating her motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquors which were wilfully, wantonly, intentionally and recklessly sold, served and furnished to her by the Defendant, which alcohol consumption caused the Plaintiff to lose control of her motor vehicle and strike a telephone pole while traveling in excess of 100 miles per hour.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-6\">19. At all times during the Plaintiffs patronage of Defendant\u2019s bar up to and including September 25, 1982, the Defendant through the actions and omissions of its agents, servants and employees wilfully, wantonly, intentionally and wrecklessly [sic] encouraged the Plaintiffs consumption of intoxicating liquors through the sale, service and furnishing of intoxicating liquors to Plaintiff by Defendant\u2019s agents, servants and employees which conduct constitutes gross negligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-7\">20. The Defendant, through the aforesaid grossly negligent conduct of its agents, servants, and employees breached its duties to the Plaintiff by wilfully, wantonly, intentionally and wrecklessly [sic] selling, serving and furnishing intoxicating liquors to the Plaintiff, who Defendant knew or should have known was a compulsive, habitual alcoholic who Defendant encouraged to consume excessive intoxicating liquors while on Defendant\u2019s premises, notwithstanding Plaintiffs inability to refrain from the consumption of intoxicating liquors sold, served or furnished to her by the Defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-8\">21. The aforesaid automobile accident occurred as a direct and proximate result of the Defendant\u2019s aforesaid grossly negligent conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">Accepting these allegations as true, they clearly establish that this action arose out of the defendant\u2019s unlawful furnishing of intoxicants to plaintiff. Therefore, her cause of action is barred by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>dramshop act\u2019s exclusive remedy. <em>Millross </em>and <em>Manuel, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">The Legislature intended the dramshop act to afford the exclusive remedy for injuries arising out of an unlawful s\u00e1le, giving away, or furnishing of intoxicants thereby preempting all common-law actions arising out of these circumstances. The allegations in plaintiff\u2019s complaint clearly reveal that her common-law action is predicated on defendant\u2019s alleged wrongful furnishing of intoxicants to her.

However, the statute hampers our ability to administer justice by precluding actions for gross negligence. The dramshop act, as it currently exists, provides no cause of action for an intoxicated patron. In this case, the defendant tavern owner profited from the extremely intoxicated patron. On the other hand, he bore no liability for the resultant harm to the intoxicated patron. The heightened culpability of the dramshop owner and the resultant harm to plaintiff cry out for redress in the form of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>action for gross negligence. The Legislature should consider amending the statute to afford a visibly intoxicated patron a remedy for the grossly negligent conduct of a tavern owner in selling, giving away, or furnishing intoxicants.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">In her complaint, plaintiff alleged that (1) she is an alcoholic, (2) she had been a regular nightly customer at defendant\u2019s bar for two years prior to her accident, and (3) during this two-year period, defendant knew that she was \"helplessly addicted to alcohol.\u201d Yet, on the evening of September 24, 1982, defendant served her drinks from 4:00 p.m. to approximately 2:30 a.m. the following morning. During this time she was served, and consumed, at least \"two-fifths of rum, ten shot glasses of peppermint Schnapps and several shots of tequilla [sic] . . . .\u201d In addition, defendant sold her two cases of beer as she was preparing to leave.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">On the basis of these facts, there should be a cause of action for gross negligence. After plaintiff became visibly intoxicated, defendant should have stopped serving intoxicants to her. At that point, defendant became the \"least cost avoider\u201d of the harm suffered by plaintiff. The \"least cost avoider\u201d theory has been explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-7\">The theory of the least cost avoider asserts that the entity that can avoid the accident at the least cost to society should bear liability if an accident should occur. The logic behind this theory is that liability will encourage the least cost avoider to prevent the accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-8\">The least cost avoider initially is the intoxicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>patron. He or she can prevent any alcohol-related accident by not drinking at all. However, after the patron has become intoxicated, the server becomes the least cost avoider. An extremely intoxicated person is no longer an \"ordinary able-bodied m[a]n.\u201d He cannot make a rational decision to stop drinking and cannot acknowledge the risk of his intoxication. On the other hand, the server is likely to recognize the signs of intoxication and can refuse to continue serving the intoxicated person. The server should be aware of the various indicators of intoxication. Those courts allowing intoxicated persons to recover have recognized that the intoxicated person is incompetent and helpless, is unable to care for himself, and has a subnormal capacity for self-control.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-4\">This dual aspect of the least cost avoider theory \u2014the intoxicated patron and the server being least cost avoiders at different points in time \u2014 suggests that application of comparative negligence is the best approach to dramshop liability because it is the fairest way to apportion liability. Comparative negligence would encourage both parties to avoid the accident by making both of them liable for resulting injuries, according to each party\u2019s degree of fault.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">According to this theory, plaintiff was initially the least cost avoider. However, after plaintiff became visibly intoxicated, defendant became the least cost avoider and, therefore, had a duty to stop serving intoxicants to plaintiff. It did not stop. Instead, it continued to profit from plaintiff\u2019s lack of control.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">If the statute were amended to afford a visibly intoxicated patron a remedy for the grossly negligent conduct of a tavern owner in selling, giving away, or furnishing intoxicants, then the courts could apply the \u201dleast cost avoider\u201d theory to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>produce an equitable and more efficient resolution of cases arising under these circumstances. In the instant case, the finder of fact could have apportioned liability by applying comparative negligence principles.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">The dramshop act requires that I concur. However, the Legislature should explore the wisdom of amending the statute to afford a visibly intoxicated patron a remedy for the grossly negligent conduct of a tavern owner in selling, giving away, or furnishing intoxicants._</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b426-9\"> The trial court granted appellant\u2019s motion for summary disposition.
