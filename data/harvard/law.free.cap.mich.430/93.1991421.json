Do[ ] the capture of revenues by a local development finance authority (formerly \"tax increment financing authority\u201d) and use of such revenues by the authority for purposes authorized by the act unconstitutionally divert tax revenues from taxing entities in violation of the Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 6?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-10\">2. Do[ ] the capture of revenues by a local development finance authority (formerly \"tax increment financing authority\u201d) and use of such revenues by the authority for purposes authorized in the act unconstitutionally lend the credit of the state or a municipality in violation of Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 18 or art 7, \u00a7 26?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>By order of March 4, 1987, we agreed to consider the requests for an advisory opinion and asked the Attorney General to brief both sides of the questions. Other interested parties were also invited to file briefs amicus curiae. The order further indicated that this Court would decide after oral argument whether to grant the requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">In light of the specificity of the issues,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the fact that resolution of these narrow but important<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> questions of law does not depend upon \"factual situations the Court would be forced to hypothesize,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we agree to consider the questions presented. We conclude that the provisions of ldfa that allow the capture and use of tax increment revenues do not violate Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 6. In addition, application of the same provisions does not on its face constitute an unconstitutional lending of credit in violation of Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 18, or art 7, \u00a7 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>However, in addition to the more obvious fact that our decision is not based on the policy merits of tax increment financing, we caution that the instant holdings are limited. The particular facts of a future litigation case, or questions premised upon other constitutional provisions or questions of statutory construction not presented in the request for advisory opinion, may present different problems that are not addressed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">The Legislature enacted the ldfa \"to encourage local development to prevent conditions of unemployment and promote economic growth . . . .\u201d Preamble to 1986 PA 281. It authorized the creation of local development finance authorities to carry out government programs that further the purposes of the act, and it grants to them certain powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Tax increment financing is one of the authorized means of financing these programs, see MCL 125.2160(c), (d); MSA 3.540(360)(c), (d), and represents the primary aspect of the ldfa that is in question here. The Legislature has authorized tax increment financing in the past, in the act establishing downtown development authorities, 1975 PA 197, MCL 125.1651 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 5.3010(1) <em>et seq., </em>and in the Tax Increment Finance Authority Act (tifaa), 1980 PA 450, MCL 125.1801 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 3.540(201) <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">According to the bill analysis prepared by the House Legislative Analysis Section on House Bills 5728 and 5729, October 16, 1986, which became 1986 PA 281, the ldfa was designed to improve upon, and to eliminate some of the problems of the tifaa. The analysis notes that the ldfa</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aos\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>would duplicate much of the [tifaa], yet would differ by expanding local government influence on authority decisions, narrow the scope of projects for which tax increment financing may be used and make other changes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Initially, the ldfa empowers municipalities to establish not more than one local development financing authority, MCL 125.2153(1); MSA 3.540(353)(1), according to a prescribed notice and hearing process. MCL 125.2154(1), (2); MSA 3.540(354)(1), (2). After the hearing, should the municipality decide to proceed with creation of the authority, it must adopt a resolution establishing the authority and designating the boundaries of the authority district or districts. <em>Id., </em>subsection (3). The authority is under the supervision and control of a board appointed by the chief executive officer of the municipality. MCL 125.2155; MSA 3.540(355).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">Sections 12, 13, 14, and 17 of the ldfa govern tax increment financing by the local development financing authorities. Basically, once a tax increment financing plan<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> has been approved, the property values covered by the tax increment financing plan are, in effect, frozen.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Future ad valorem tax revenues that are attributable to any subsequent increase in value above the base value are turned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>over to the authority in order to further implement the development plan.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Stated another way,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-4\">[a] tax increment financing (tif) plan allows a local government to finance public improvements in a designated area by capturing the property taxes levied on any increase in property values within the area. Under a tif plan, a base year is established for the project area. In subsequent years, any increase in assessments above the base year level is referred to as the captured value. All, or a portion, of the property taxes levied on the captured value (sev) is diverted to the area\u2019s development plan. [Department of Treasury, <em>Analysis of Tax Increment Financing in Michigan for 1986 </em>(April, 1987), p A-2.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Tax increment financing \"is premised on the theory that, without the redevelopment project, property values would not increase,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> or \"that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>increases in land values and assessments in the project area are <em>caused </em>by the redevelopment authority\u2019s own construction of economic activity in the district.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The ldfa details the requirements for implementing a tax increment financing plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">First, the ldfa requires the authority board to submit a tax increment financing plan to the governing body of the municipality, to be approved in accordance with the notice, hearing, disclosure, and approval provisions that apply to development plans. See MCL 125.2162(2), (5); MSA 3.540(362)(2), (5). The tax increment financing plan must conform to certain requirements,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-7\">shall only provide for the use of tax increment revenues for public facilities[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>] for eligible property whose captured assessed value produces the tax increment revenues or, to the extent the eligible property is located within a certified industrial park, for other eligible property located in the certified industrial park. [MCL 125.2162(3); MSA 3.540(362)(3).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">If the construction of certain property will result in \"transferring employment of 50 or more full-time jobs from 1 or more local governmental units ... to the municipality in which the eligi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>ble property is located,\u201d the affected local governmental units must consent to the property\u2019s inclusion in the district for purposes of the tax increment plan. MCL 125.2162(4); MSA 3.540(362)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">Once a tax increment financing plan is adopted, it is \"binding on all taxing units levying ad valorem property taxes or specific local taxes against property located in the authority district.\u201d MCL 125.2162(6); MSA 3.540(362)(6). However, those taxing authorities are provided an opportunity \"to express their views and recommendations regarding the tax increment plan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In addition, the authority may agree to share part of the captured assessed value of the district with those taxing jurisdictions and the governing municipality. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Section 13 of the ldfa describes the mechanics of transmitting the tax increments to the authority.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-6\">The amount of tax increment that shall be transmitted to the authority by the city, village, township, school district, and county treasurers shall be that portion of the tax levy of all taxing jurisdictions paid each year on the captured assessed value of each eligible property included in a tax increment financing plan excluding millage specifically levied for the payment of principal and interest of obligations approved by electors or obligations pledging the unlimited taxing power of the local governmental unit. [MCL 125.2163(1); MSA 3.560(363X1).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">The same section requires that the tax increments be spent only as provided in the tax increment plan. It also provides for the disposition of excess tax increment revenues, the abolishment of the tax increment plan, and the annual financial report. See id., subsections (2), (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">Section 14 of the act, MCL 125.2164; MSA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>3.540(364), governs tax increment bonds. It allows the authority to authorize, issue, and sell its tax increment bonds to finance a development program. The bonds are subject to the Municipal Finance Act, MCL 131.1 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 5.3188(1) <em>et seq. </em>\"The authority may pledge for debt service requirements the tax increment revenue to be received from an eligible property.\u201d MCL 125.2164(1); MSA 3.540(364)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">In regard to a municipality\u2019s support for tax increment bonds, \u00a7 14(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-7\">The municipality by majority vote of the members of its governing body may make a limited tax pledge to support the authority\u2019s tax increment bonds or, if authorized by the voters of the municipality, pledge its full faith and credit for the payment of the principal of and interest on the authority\u2019s tax increment bonds. [MCL 125.2164(2); MSA 3.540(364)(2).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">Section 14 further provides that bonds and notes issued by the authority and their interest on income are exempt from state and local taxes. Id., subsection (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">The remaining substantive sections of the act govern the requirements for development plans, MCL 125.2165; MSA 3.540(365), the specifics of the notice and hearing procedure, MCL 125.2166; MSA 3.540(366), the determination of public purpose and the approval process for development or tax increment plans, MCL 125.2167; MSA 3.540(367), relocation, MCL 125.2168; MSA 3.540(368), budgetary matters, MCL 125.2169; MSA 3.540(369), and dissolution of the authority, MCL 125.2170; MSA 3.540(370). Section 24 expresses the Legislature\u2019s intent to request an opinion of this Court regarding the constitutionality of the act. MCL 125.2174; MSA 3.540(374).</p>\n<p id=\"AW7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b251-3\">The first question presented is: Do the capture of revenues, i.e., revenues derived from captured assessed value, by a local development authority and use of such revenues for purposes authorized by the act, i.e., for public facilities or as authorized in \u00a7 14, unconstitutionally divert tax revenues from local taxing entities in violation of Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 6? Because we do not interpret the applicable portions of art 9, \u00a7 6, as governing the capture and use of tax increment revenues, we find no violation of that constitutional provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">Article 9, \u00a7 6, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\">Except as otherwise provided in this constitution, the total amount of general ad valorem taxes imposed upon real and tangible personal property for all purposes in any one year shall not exceed 15 mills on each dollar of the assessed valuation of property as finally equalized. Under procedures provided by law, which shall guarantee the right of initiative, separate tax limitations for any county and for the townships and for school districts therein, the aggregate of which shall not exceed 18 mills on each dollar of such valuation, may be adopted and thereafter altered by the vote of a majority of the qualified electors of such county voting thereon, in lieu of the limitation hereinbefore established. These limitations may be increased to an aggregate of not to exceed 50 mills on each dollar of valuation, for a period of not to exceed 20 years at any one time, if approved by a majority of the electors, qualified under Section 6 of Article II of this constitution, voting on the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-6\">The foregoing limitations shall not apply to taxes imposed for the payment of principal and interest on bonds approved by the electors or other evidences of indebtedness approved by the electors or for the payment of assessments or contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>obligations in anticipation of which bonds are issued approved by the electors, which taxes may be imposed without limitation as to rate or amount; or, subject to the provisions of Section [sic] 25 through 34 of this article, to taxes imposed for any other purpose by any city, village, charter county, charter township, charter authority or other authority, the tax limitations of which are provided by charter or by general law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-4\">In any school district which extends into two or more counties, property taxes at the highest rate available in the county which contains the greatest part of the area of the district may be imposed and collected for school purposes throughout the district.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">There are two rules that guide our interpretation of art 9, \u00a7 6 and the rule of art 9, \u00a7 18 and art 7, \u00a7 26 as they apply to the ldfa. First, we note \"that legislation is clothed with the presumption of constitutionality\u2019 and must be sustained if within constitutional limits.\u201d <em>W A Foote Memorial Hosp, Inc v Jackson Hosp Authority, </em>390 Mich 193, 209; 211 NW2d 649 (1973). In <em>Oakland Co Taxpayers\u2019 League v Oakland Co Supervisors, 355 </em>Mich 305, 323; 94 NW2d 875 (1959), we noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">this Court will not declare a statute unconstitutional unless it is plain that it violates some provisions of the Constitution and the constitutionality of the act will be supported by all possible presumptions not clearly inconsistent with the language and the subject matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">Second, Const 1963, art 7, \u00a7 34 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-8\">The provisions of this constitution and law concerning counties, townships, cities and villages shall be liberally construed in their favor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">The Constitutional Convention Comment regarding this provision indicates that it was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>intended to direct the courts to give a liberal or broad construction to statutes and constitutional provisions concerning all local governments. [2 Official Record, Constitutional Convention 1961, p 3395.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">Thus, those arguing against the constitutionality of the ldfa must bear the burden of proof. They have failed to meet this burden as to art 9, \u00a7 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The Attorney General, arguing in opposition to the constitutionality of 1986 PA 281, advances an unusual argument. After summarizing art 9, \u00a76, the Attorney General states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-7\">This provision for the levy of property taxes in inter-county school districts recognizes the uniformity clause of art 9, \u00a7 3, which requires that school taxes be uniform throughout the school district\u2019s territory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">The remainder of the Attorney General\u2019s first argument opposing the constitutionality of the ldfa focuses on the uniformity clause, art 9, \u00a73. Given that this is an advisory opinion rather than a case in controversy, we decline to expand our inquiry into the constitutionality of 1986 PA 281 beyond the two questions posed by the Governor, neither of which concerns the uniformity clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">The various amici curiae arguing against the constitutionality of the tax increment financing provisions of 1986 PA 281 focus on the so-called <em>diversion </em>of tax revenues from the levying governmental units to the authority. This diversion is said to be violative of \u00a7 3 of the Property Tax Limitation Act, MCL 211.203; MSA 7.63, which, the amici curiae argue, implements Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>MCL 211.203; MSA 7.63 governs the method by which elections are to be held for the purpose of increasing the total tax rate limitation as provided in art 9, \u00a7 6. The statute provides, inter alia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-4\">Where a previous increase in the total tax limitation on property is about to expire and a new increase for the identical amount is proposed, the ballot proposal may be presented as a renewal or continuation of the previous increase for a specified number of years. <em>The ballot shall specify the intended purpose of the renewed or new funds. The ballot may also state the purpose for which the funds derived from the voted increase over the constitutional tax rate limitation may be used </em>.... [MCL 211.203(3); MSA 7.63(3).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The amici curiae Michigan Association of School Boards, et al., and Michigan Education Association and amicus curiae Livingston County argue that once the voters have adopted an extra-voted millage proposition for school funding purposes, any diversion of that millage to a local development funding authority is violative of MCL 211.203(3); MSA 7.63(3), and hence of Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 6. Amici curiae also observe that \u00a7 1216 of the School Code provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-6\">money raised by tax shall not be used for a purpose other than that for which it was raised without the consent of a majority of the school electors .... [MCL 380.1216; MSA 15.41216.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">As a final argument, opponents of constitutionality maintain that, in addition to violating art 9, \u00a7 6, the ldfa amends by implication both the Property Tax Limitation Act and the School Code, in violation of art 4, \u00a7 25.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>In response, the Attorney General, arguing in favor of constitutionality, focuses upon the language of art 9, \u00a7 6. He maintains that that provision limits <em>only </em>the <em>rate </em>of general ad valorem tax, not the amount or use of revenues generated by that tax:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-4\">To find that Art 9, \u00a7 6, imposes a limit on the revenues which may be generated by application of the various millage limits contained in the provision, or their use, would be to read something into the provision which is not expressly provided.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">The Attorney General also relies on the Legislature\u2019s inherent power to allocate tax revenues. See <em>Huron-Clinton Metropolitan Authority v Bds of Supervisors of Five Counties, </em>300 Mich 1, 19; 1 NW2d 430 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The amici curiae in favor of constitutionality emphasize similar points. They maintain that there is no violation of art 9, \u00a7 6, because under tax increment financing no new or higher millage rates are levied. They argue that there is no \"diversion\u201d because the taxing units continue to receive the tax revenue they would have received had the authority not been created, and that those units are not required to give up any revenues to which they would otherwise be entitled. Finally, they cite the Legislature\u2019s exclusive power to allocate the use of taxes, which, they maintain, is what it did in enacting the ldfa.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">b</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">As we have noted above, our inquiry into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>constitutionality of the ldfa is limited. The statute is vested with a presumption of constitutionality, and it is not our role to second-guess the Legislature regarding the wisdom of tax increment financing from a public policy perspective.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">We turn first to the words of the constitutional provision. The first sentence of Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 6 states the general rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-8\">[T]he total amount of general ad valorem taxes imposed upon real and tangible personal property for all purposes in any one year shall not exceed 15 mills on each dollar of the assessed valuation of property as finally equalized.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">The next sentence of the provision describes the \u2022 first exception to the general rule. In lieu of the fifteen-mill limitation,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-10\">separate tax limitations for any county and for the townships and for school districts . . . may be adopted and thereafter altered by the vote of a majority of the qualified electors ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-11\">These separate tax limitations must be adopted \"[u]nder procedures provided by law,\u201d and the aggregate of the limitations \"shall not exceed 18 mills . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-12\">The third sentence provides yet another excep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>tion: The aggregate of the limitations may exceed eighteen mills \"if approved by a majority of the electors . . . voting on the question.\u201d The voter-increased aggregate may not \"exceed 50 mills on each dollar of valuation, for a period of not to exceed 20 years at any one time . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">It is obvious that the tax increment financing provisions of the ldfa do not violate these provisions. By capturing tax revenues attributable to the increased value that is assumed to result from the development plan, tax increment financing has no effect on \"the total amount of general ad valorem taxes imposed . . . .\u201d The <em>amount </em>of taxes paid by taxpayers will be the same whether or not a tax increment plan is adopted by the authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The Attorney General arguing in opposition to constitutionality, and the amici curiae who oppose the constitutionality of the ldfa, would have us read into these provisions of art 9, \u00a7 6 a limitation on the <em>use </em>as well as on the amount of millage imposed. However, the first paragraph of art 9, \u00a7 6 does not govern the allocation of revenues once the fifteen-mill or voter-approved additional millage has been imposed. Therefore, we cannot accept the argument that tax increment financing violates art 9, \u00a7 6 by diverting taxes from the purposes for which they were levied or by diverting to the authority district revenues that were levied by local taxing units. We emphasize that the first paragraph of art 9, \u00a7 6 does not address the question of \"purpose\u201d; it places a limitation on the tax <em>rate, </em>not on tax revenues or their use.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The second paragraph of art 9, \u00a7 6, known as the nonapplication provision provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-7\">The foregoing limitations shall not apply to taxes imposed for the payment of principal and interest on bonds approved by the electors or other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>evidences of indebtedness approved by the electors or for the payment of assessments or contract obligations in anticipation of which bonds are issued approved by the electors, which taxes may be imposed without limitation as to rate or amount; or, subject to the provisions of Section 25 through 34 of this article, to taxes imposed for any other purpose by any city, village, charter county, charter township, charter authority or other authority, the tax limitations of which are provided by charter or by general law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">This provision does speak of purpose or use in that it creates a millage limitation exception for taxes imposed for the payment of certain bonding and other evidences of indebtedness when that indebtedness was approved by a vote of the people. We do not, however, have to speak to the constitutionality of millage enacted pursuant to this provision inasmuch as 1986 PA 281 specifically exempts from captured tax increment \"millage specifically levied for the payment of principal and interest of obligations approved by electors or obligations pledging the unlimited taxing power of the local governmental unit.\u201d MCL 125.2163(1); MSA 3.540(363X1). Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Therefore, as to millage enacted pursuant to the first paragraph of art 9, \u00a7 6, the Legislature retains the power to allocate tax revenues. As we stated in regard to the precursor of art 9, \u00a7 6 in Const 1908:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-8\">The constitutional amendment contains no provision for a division of the total one and one-half per cent taxes between the State, counties, cities, villages, townships, or school districts. Nor is there any statutory provision relative to such division or allocation. . . . Taxation is a legislative power vested by the Constitution in the legislative branch of the State government. <em>Determination of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number><em>the sources of tax revenue and the apportionment of taxation require legislative action. </em>1 Cooley on Taxation (4th ed), \u00a7\u00a7 64, 74; 2 Cooley on Taxation (4th ed), \u00a7 539. <em>As noted, this amendment to the Constitution contains no provision for allocation of taxes. </em>It is not self-executing. <em>[Pontiac School Dist v Pontiac, </em>262 Mich 338, 353; 247 NW 474 (1933). Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">In <em>Huron-Clinton Metropolitan Authority, supra, </em>p 19, we again stressed the inherent power of the Legislature in areas left unaddressed by the constitution.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-5\">The advisability or wisdom of statutory enactments which are not violative of constitutional provisions is a matter for legislative consideration, but not for the courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">This inherent power derives from the fact that constitutional provisions are to be regarded as limitations on the exercise of power, not a grant of power. <em>Oakland Co Taxpayers\u2019, supra, </em>p 323.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Other state courts have drawn similar conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-8\">[T]he law is well settled that in exercising the powers of the state the legislature may require the revenue of a municipality, raised by taxation, to be applied to uses other than that for which the taxes were levied. Its power is, of course, subject to constitutional limitations, but here we see no specific constitutional limitation which has been offended .... <em>[Tribe v Salt Lake City Corp, </em>540 P2d 499, 504 (Utah, 1975).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">See <em>People ex rel City of Canton v Crouch, </em>79 Ill 2d 356, 369-370; 403 NE2d 242 (1980). (\"It is not the function of this court to assess the advisability of taxation schemes . . . .\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>Some states found no diversion even in the face of a constitutional prohibition against changes in the purpose to which tax revenues are put. See <em>Kelson v Pensacola, </em>483 So 2d 77, 78 (Fla App, 1986); <em>State v Daytona Beach, </em>484 So 2d 1214, 1215 (Fla, 1986); <em>Meierhenry v City of Huron, </em>354 NW2d 171, 181 (SD, 1984). These courts have found no diversion because \"[t]he [tax increment financing] Act has no impact on taxes levied prior to the creation of a tax incremental district^]\u201d <em>id., </em>p 181; because purposes in aid of an authority may also be considered \"County purposes,\u201d <em>Kelson, supra, </em>p 79; and because it is assumed that any increase in tax revenues that derives from captured assessed value is directly attributable to the activities of the authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Other courts have recognized the underlying assumption of tax increment financing when rejecting the diversion argument. See <em>Sigma Tau Gamma Fraternity House Corp v City of Menomonie, </em>93 Wis 2d 392, 414; 288 NW2d 85 (1980); <em>State v Daytona Beach, supra, </em>p 1215; <em>Salt Lake Co v Murray City Redevelopment, </em>598 P2d 1339, 1342 (Utah, 1979). The Wisconsin Supreme Court observed that if the local development financing authority were</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-7\">unable to undertake such projects in the first place, the other taxing authorities would be completely without the additional revenue .... The increased tax revenue is due, after all, to the [authority]-sponsored project. In light of this fact it is difficult to see how the other local governmental entities are being forced to relinquish any revenue to which they would otherwise be entitled. <em>[Sigma Tau, supra, </em>p 414.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">See also <em>South Bend Public Transportation Corp v South Bend, </em>428 NE2d 217, 224 (Ind, 1981); David <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>son, <em>Tax increment financing as a tool for community redevelopment, </em>56 U Det J Urb L 405, 411 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">Regardless of the logic of these arguments, it is unnecessary to address any question of diversion under art 9, \u00a7 6. That provision leaves the Legislature free to alter the purposes to which tax revenues are put.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Courts finding tax increment financing legislation to be an unconstitutional diversion of tax revenues have based their conclusions on constitutional provisions that are far more specific than art 9, \u00a7 6.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> For example, in <em>Miller v Covington Development Authority, </em>539 SW2d 1, 5 (Ky, 1976), the Kentucky Supreme Court held the Kentucky Tax Increment Act unconstitutional as violative of \u00a7 184 of the Kentucky Constitution. The court noted that \u00a7 184 had</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-6\">always been construed as meaning that money collected for the purposes of education in the common school system cannot be spent for any other purpose, public or not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Like the Supreme Court of Illinois, we decline to follow <em>Miller </em>because of \"[t]he fact that our constitution provides for no such limitation on education revenues . . . .\u201d <em>City of Canton v Crouch, supra, </em>p 368. The Attorney General and amici curiae would have us read certain requirements of the Property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>Tax Limitation Act and the School Code into art 9, \u00a7 6. We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Thus, we find that the opponents of the constitutionality of 1986 PA 281 have failed to bear the burden of proving that the provisions of the ldfa regarding tax increment financing are, on their face, violative of art 9, \u00a7 6. The Legislature is not prohibited by art 9, \u00a7 6 from allowing the capture of tax revenues attributable to future increases in property values to be used for the purposes designated by the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">The second question presented is: Do the capture of revenues, i.e., revenues derived from captured assessed value, by a local development authority and use of such revenues for purposes authorized by the act \u2014 i.e., for \"public facilities,\u201d and as provided in \u00a7 14 \u2014 unconstitutionally lend the credit of the state or a municipality in violation of Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 18 or art 7, \u00a7 26? Again, in light of the presumption of constitutionality, and the burden of proof that operates in the municipalities\u2019 favor, we find that the challengers of the ldfa\u2019s constitutionality have failed to demonstrate that the capture and use of tax increment revenues as specified in the act violate the rule of art 9, \u00a7 18 and art 7, \u00a7 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">Article 9, \u00a7 18 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-10\">The credit of the state shall not be granted to, nor in aid of any person, association or corporation, public or private, except as authorized in this constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-11\">This section shall not be construed to prohibit the investment of public funds until needed for current requirements or the investment of funds accumulated to provide retirement or pension ben<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>efits for public officials and employees, as provided by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">Article 7, \u00a7 26 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-5\">Except as otherwise provided in this constitution, no city or village shall have the power to loan its credit for any private purpose or, except as provided by law, for any public purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">The Attorney General makes an abbreviated argument in opposition to the constitutionality of 1986 PA 281 in reliance upon these two provisions. He maintains that to the extent the ldfa permits the diversion of revenue from counties and school districts to finance \"public facilities\u201d that benefit property in a local development district, it lends the credit of the state in violation of art 9, \u00a7 18. He argues that the same alleged diversion also constitutes a violation of art 7, \u00a7 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">The essence of this argument, however, is its unwillingness to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-9\">accept the legislative finding that it is necessary \"to legislate tax increment financing,\u201d to achieve the public purpose of creating jobs and promoting economic growth in the State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">The brief in opposition proposes other means for achieving the legislative goals of the ldfa.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">The amici curiae who oppose the constitutionality of the act provide a more analytical approach to the problem. They maintain that the pledge of a portion of future property tax levies to repay the bonded indebtedness of an authority constitutes a lending of the state\u2019s credit, and that there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>exception in the constitution that would authorize such an extension of credit. Therefore, they argue that \u00a7 14(1) of the ldfa, allowing tax increment bonds, is violative of art 9, \u00a7 18. It is the <em>state\u2019s </em>credit, according to the amici curiae, because the tax levying agency, i.e., the school district, is under the strict control of the state and is acting in furtherance of a state-mandated activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Other opponents of the constitutionality of the ldfa argue that, to the extent a city pledges its own increased property tax revenues within its own constitutional debt limitation, art 9, \u00a7 18 and art 7, \u00a7 26, are not violated. It is th\u00e9 fact that the indebtedness is repaid from revenues generated by millage applicable to both the city and the county that makes the act unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">In favor of the constitutionality of the act, the Attorney General argues that the tax increment financing provisions of the act do not constitute a lending of the state\u2019s credit per se, in violation of art 9, \u00a7 18, or art 7, \u00a7 26 because the purpose of the act is a public one, and the tax increment revenues may only be used for public facilities. The Attorney General argues that tax increment bonds are not unconstitutional because captured tax increment revenues are a restricted, readily identifiable fund; a pledge of such limited restricted funds does not constitute a lending of the state\u2019s or the municipality\u2019s credit since there is no pledge of full faith and credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">Amicus curiae Michigan Townships Association argues that even the granting of a municipality\u2019s full faith and credit to underwrite tax increment bonds should be upheld since tax increment financing serves a public purpose and is provided by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">In addition to these arguments, amici curiae argue that the two constitutional provisions are not violated because, when tax increment revenues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>are used according to the act, no property is being given away without consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Article 9, \u00a7 18 states the general rule that the state shall not lend its credit except as provided in the constitution.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-6\">The purpose of this provision is to make certain that the State, which itself cannot borrow, except as authorized, does not accumulate unauthorized debts by indorsing or guaranteeing the obligations of others. <em>[Advisory Opinion re Constitutionality of 1966 PA 346, </em>380 Mich 554, 564; 158 NW2d 416 (1968).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">The prohibition of art 9, \u00a7 18 applies to local governments as political subdivisions and instrumentalities of the state. <em>Oakland Co Drain Comm\u2019r v Royal Oak, </em>306 Mich 124, 142; 10 NW2d 435 (1943) (construing the predecessor to Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 18: Const 1908, art 10, \u00a7 12).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">As we observed in <em>Gaylord v Gaylord City Clerk, </em>378 Mich 273, 292; 144 NW2d 460 (1966), art 7, \u00a726 is an exception to the general rule of art 9, \u00a7 18, governing the lending of credit by municipalities. In order to conform to the requirements of the art 7, \u00a7 26 exception, the loan of a municipality\u2019s credit must be both: (1) authorized by law, and (2) for a public purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">Thus, the threshold question is whether the capture and use of tax increment revenues authorized in the act constitute a loan of credit? If the act authorizes the lending of the state\u2019s credit, it is unconstitutional pursuant to art 9, \u00a7 18. If it is a loan of municipal credit, then the two requirements of art 7, \u00a7 26, must be considered. If not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>loan of credit at all, then there is no need to consider art 7, \u00a7 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">There are, therefore, two ways in which the prohibition of art 9, \u00a7 18 might be found inapplicable altogether. If the capture and use of tax increment revenues as authorized in the act do not amount to a loan of credit at all, or if the use of such revenues does not amount to a loan of credit by the state or one of its municipalities, then there is no constitutional hurdle posed by art 9, \u00a7 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Section 14 of the ldfa is the provision that opponents find violative of art 9, \u00a7 18. Section 14(1) permits the authority to sell tax increment bonds,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-6\">pledging] for debt service requirements the tax increment revenue to be received from an eligible property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">Section 14(2) allows the municipality, by majority vote of its governing body, to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-8\">make a limited tax pledge to support the authority\u2019s tax increment bonds or, if authorized by the voters of the municipality, pledge its full faith and credit for the payment of the principal of and interest on the authority\u2019s tax increment bonds. [MCL 125.2164; MSA 3.540(364).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">l</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">In determining whether tax increment bonds amount to a loan of credit at all, we turn to a rule articulated frequently in the decisions of this Court. In general, self-liquidating, special obligation, or revenue bonds are excluded from the constitutional definition of loan of credit. Gaylord, <em>supra, </em>p 294; <em>Alan v Wayne Co, </em>388 Mich 210; 200 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>NW2d 628 (1972); <em>Advisory Opinion re Constitutionality of 1966 PA 346, supra, </em>p 565.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-4\">If the . . . bonds are revenue bonds Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 18 is not pertinent.

Consequently the credit of the state or county \u2014 state includes its subdivision county . . . \u2014 is not involved in a true revenue bond situation. <em>[Alan, supra, </em>p 324.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">See <em>Advisory Opinion on Constitutionality of 1976 PA 295 &amp; 297, </em>401 Mich 686, 701; 259 NW2d 129 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">We have noted the relevant distinction between revenue bonds and special obligation bonds, on the one hand, and general obligation bonds, on the other:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-7\">Revenue bonds and special obligation bonds share an essential distinction from general obligation bonds. The credit of the State is pledged for the payment of general obligation bonds. It is not for revenue bonds and special obligation bonds. Special obligation bonds are retired from special tax revenues earmarked for that purpose. Revenue bonds are retired from the proceeds of the operation of the public structure or enterprise supporting their issuance. <em>[Schureman v State Hwy Comm, </em>377 Mich 609, 611-612; 141 NW2d 62 (1966).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">The question, then, is whether tax increment bonds, as described in \u00a7 14 of the act, are more like general obligation bonds or revenue and special obligation bonds. Proponents of the act emphasize that tax increment revenues are a \"restricted, readily-identifiable fund,\u201d whereas the opponents maintain that they are general obligation bonds, since the municipality may pledge its full faith and credit in support of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>First, we observe that tax increment bonds are distinguishable from the bonds at issue in <em>1966 PA 346, </em>which were held to be self-liquidating revenue bonds. The revenue pledged for payment of the housing authority bonds in that case was money to be received for the repayment of loans made to housing associations. Likewise, in <em>State Hwy Comm\u2019r v Detroit City Controller, </em>331 Mich 337, 349; 49 NW2d 318 (1951), the bonds at issue were held to be \"closely analogous\u201d to revenue bonds in that the funds to be used to repay the bonds were vehicular taxes which were \"earmarked exclusively for highway purposes . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Similarly, in <em>1976 PA 295, supra, </em>p 702, the notes and bonds in question were held to be special obligation bonds because their payment was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-7\">strictly limited to the proceeds of constitutionally restricted highway revenues placed by law in the General Transportation Fund, being derived from taxes on gasoline and other constitutionally restricted highway taxes ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">Tax increment bonds that are backed by a municipality\u2019s pledge of credit are not highly analogous to bonds that will be repaid with vehicular or gasoline taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">In <em>Advisory Opinion re Constitutionality of 1973 PA 1 &amp; 2, </em>390 Mich 166; 211 NW2d 28 (1973), we reviewed the history of the revenue bond exception in the context of \"indebtedness\u201d under art 9, \u00a7 12. The exception was not applied to the notes in question, which were payable from loan payments made by school districts. The funds pledged for their payment were</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-10\">\"any funds of the district legally available therefor,\u201d including a newly-levied income tax of not exceeding 1% or a newly-levied ad valorem tax of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>not more than 2.25 mills . . , and as secondary security future \"state aid moneys and any other funds of the district . . . .\u201d <em>[Id., </em>pp 175-176.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">We declined in <em>1973 PA 1 &amp; 2 </em>to further extend the so-called revenue bond exception.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-5\">The plan proposed by the acts now before us does not comprehend repayment of the loan from revenue derived from the operation of a facility. These are not \"revenue bonds.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-6\">The plan does not provide for repayment of the loan from privilege taxes levied on users of the facility. These are not \"special obligation\u201d bonds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-7\">These loans will be repaid from general taxes, an income tax or an ad valorem tax or payments received from the school aid fund made up of constitutionally dedicated sales tax revenue and appropriations largely derived from general taxation. <em>[Id., </em>p 177.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">We distinguished the notes at issue in <em>1973 PA 1 &amp; 2 </em>from highway bonds and from the notes of <em>1966 PA 346, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-9\">The state notes here involved, in contrast with the notes of the State Housing Development Authority dealt with in <em>[1966 PA 346, supra], </em>are direct obligations of the state. It is not contemplated that they will be repaid with revenue but with taxes. The taxes are levied generally, not merely against users of facilities to be constructed with the proceeds of the bonds. The bonds in that case are more closely akin to revenue bonds or users\u2019 privilege tax bonds than the bonds in this case. <em>[Id., </em>p 179.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">One commentator has observed:</p>\n<p id=\"b269-11\">When compared to other public borrowing techniques, tip is a hybrid between revenue bonds,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>based on the expected returns from a given project, and special purpose bonds to meet a public objective such as industrial development or provision of low and moderate income housing. With revenue bonds, the public authority obtains financing for a major public improvement by pledging expected income from user charges to retirement of debts incurred in the construction process. It is used most often for projects such as toll bridges or water and electric utility improvements, where an existing demand for the particular service is shown. Although tip is similar in that expected revenues generated by construction are pledged to bond retirement, redevelopment projects in blighted areas may not be as attractive to investors, particularly since public redevelopment presumes that the private market is unwilling to invest without additional incentives. <em>In this sense, tif is not totally self-\u00f1nancing, since the government authority must provide additional guarantees in cases of non-payment or insufficient tax increments to service the outstanding debt. </em>[Davidson, <em>supra, </em>p 413. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">We agree with this analysis, and it comports with the argument of at least one of the amici curiae. The Michigan Townships Association notes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-6\">If tax increment financing is held to be constitutional by this Court, to make it of any immediate use to the ldfa\u2019s would require issuance of bonds, and the credit of the municipality may very well be needed in order to carry out the purpose, of 1986 PA 281.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">Section 14 of the ldfa permits municipalities to make a \"limited tax pledge to support the authority\u2019s tax increment bonds or, if authorized by the voters of the municipality, pledge its full faith and credit . . . .\u201d MCL 125.2164(2); MSA 3.540(364X2). Therefore, the exception to art 9, \u00a7 18, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>allows revenue and like bonds to be considered something other than a loan of credit, should not be extended to include tax increment bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">The courts of other jurisdictions have come to similar conclusions in response to the question whether tax increment bonds constitute indebtedness within the meaning of their constitutions. Although some courts concluded otherwise, see, e.g., <em>South Bend Public Transportation Corp, supra; Wolper v Charleston City Council, </em>287 SC 209, 213-214; 336 SE2d 891 (1985); <em>Denver Urban Renewal Authority </em>v <em>Byrne, </em>618 P2d 1374 (Colo, 1980), we prefer the reasoning of those courts that found no application of the \"revenue bond\u201d exception to the constitutional debt question.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The Iowa Supreme Court, in <em>Richards v City of Muscatine, </em>237 NW2d 48, 64 (SD, 1984), observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-6\">The taxes which will be used to pay the proposed urban renewal bonds and interest will be general taxes. This is not a case of a special assessment tax which was never intended to be used, and could not be used, to meet other expenses of the city. Nor is this a case where the bonds are to be paid from the operating revenues of a municipal enterprise which generates income, such as a power plant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-7\"><em>Ultimately the \u2019\u2019credit\u201d of a city is its power to levy general taxes. When it pledges all or part of that power, it pledges its credit </em>and in a realistic sense incurs an obligation. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">Accord <em>Meierhenry, supra, </em>pp 178-179; <em>Tucson v Corbin, </em>128 Ariz 83, 87-88; 623 P2d 1239 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">The courts that found no general obligation, and therefore no constitutional impediment, focused on the specific bonds in question and concluded that they were \"not secured by the full faith, credit and taxing power of the municipality, and therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>cannot be classified as a general obligation debt.\u201d <em>Wolper, supra, </em>p 215. The Supreme Court of Indiana stated simply: \"If the value of property does not increase, the bonds will not be repaid.\u201d <em>South Bend Transportation Corp, supra, </em>p 221.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Given the nature of the case at bar, we cannot draw similar conclusions. The ldfa permits the municipality to make a limited tax pledge. We must assume that some municipalities will take advantage of this opportunity to back up the bonds of the authority. Indeed, at least one amicus curiae has indicated that such support is necessary to the success of tax increment bonds. Therefore, in contrast to these courts, we find that tax increment bonds, as envisioned in the ldfa, do bring into play the general taxing authority of the sponsoring municipality, and do not fit within the revenue bond exception to the definition of a loan of credit. Our conclusion does not foreclose the possibility that tax increment bonds may at some time in the future be issued as revenue bonds if the municipality is not responsible in any way for repayment of the bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">There is another means by which tax increment bonds might be found outside the definition of a loan of credit, as contemplated in art 9, \u00a7 18. If the state or a municipality receives value in return for what it gives away, there is no loan of credit under the constitution. We articulated this rule in <em>Alan, supra, </em>p 325:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-8\">Michigan case law interpreting Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 18 is neither ample nor precise. It is clear the state or its subdivision the county cannot give anything away without consideration. [Citations omitted.] Note that the constitution as far as the state and county are concerned makes no difference between a public and a private purpose in this regard. When the state acquires or transfers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>something of value in return for value the state does not offend Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 18.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Normally, \"the Legislature or Executive Branch is the judge of what is fair value in matters in which it is concerned .... Their judgment, however, is subject to judicial review for abuse of judgment.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 330.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">The proponents of constitutionality argue that a municipality gives nothing away by using tax increment financing because the financing is used only for the construction of \"public facilit[ies],\u201d see MCL 125.2152(k); MSA 3.540(352)(k), to which the municipality retains title. They note that such \"public facilities]\u201d inure to the public\u2019s benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">We cannot accept this argument. In our view, the public facilities that are provided by the authority through the mechanism of tax increment financing are, at least in part, facilities that would otherwise be paid for by the levy of a special assessment on the affected property. The municipality, through its authority, is essentially giving away something of value in the hope that general economic growth will result within the district. We are hard pressed to characterize this arrangement as \"value for value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">In sum, because tax increment bonds fit neither within the revenue bond exception of art 9, \u00a7 18, nor the value rule of <em>Alan, </em>we hold that, as envisioned in the ldfa, such bonds do constitute a loan of credit to which the proscription of art 9, \u00a7 18 applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">The next question under art 9, \u00a7 18 is whether the bonds in question amount to a loan of the <em>state\u2019s </em>credit. If it is the state\u2019s credit that is involved, then the exception of art 7, \u00a7 26 does not apply. Some of the opponents of the ldfa maintain that the pledging of future tax levies under the act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>amounts to an extension of the school district\u2019s credit and that, therefore, because the district is an agency of the state, it amounts to a loan of the state\u2019s credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">We do not agree. We find that in the case of tax increment bonds under the ldfa it is the credit of the municipality that created the local development authority, and not the state, which is at stake. Therefore, art 7, \u00a7 26 applies. As in <em>1966 PA 346, supra, </em>p 567, the ldfa \"does not obligate the State of Michigan ... to repay moneys borrowed . . . .\u201d However, the act does appear, at least in theory, to obligate the sponsoring municipality to repay the bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Some state courts have concluded that the tax increment financing schemes at issue did not amount to a pledge of credit by the municipality, but only by the authority. See, e.g., <em>Denver Urban Renewal, supra, </em>p 1383. The Colorado Supreme Court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-8\">Denver is not indebted as a result of the tax-allocation financing scheme. The obligation incurred is solely [the authority\u2019s]. The [authority\u2019s] resolution authorizing the bonds clearly provides that only [the authority] is obligated to repay the bonded indebtedness, and the financing scheme bears this out.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">Considering the entire statutory scheme of the ldfa, and \u00a7 14 in particular, it is apparent that some pledge of credit by the municipality is envisioned. The local development financing authority is wholly a creature of the municipality; the governing body of the municipality must approve of all development and tax increment financing plans; MCL 125.2162(2), (5); MSA 3.540(362)(2), (5) and MCL 125.2166; MSA 3.540(366); the municipal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>ity\u2019s governing body dissolves the authority; and the municipality retains all property and assets of the authority after the satisfaction of its obligations. MCL 125.2170; MSA 3.540(370).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">Thus, we conclude that the capture of tax increment revenues and use of those revenues, i.e., as a pledge for tax increment bonds, do constitute a loan of credit under art 9, \u00a7 18, but do not amount to a violation of that provision in that the State of Michigan is not obligated in any way. Rather, the permissible uses of tax increment revenues may amount to an extension of the municipality\u2019s credit, and must therefore satisfy the requirements of art 7, \u00a7 26. Under that provision, a municipality\u2019s loan of credit must be (1) provided by law, and (2) for a public purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">As in <em>Sinas v City of Lansing, </em>382 Mich 407, 412; 170 NW2d 23 (1969), \"the legislature has provided ample statutory authority to remove the [loan of credit] . . . from the constitutional disability.\u201d Obviously, the ldfa, through \u00a7 14, authorizes municipalities to pledge their credit, in the form of anticipated future tax revenues, in support of tax increment bonds. This is sufficient to overcome the first constitutional hurdle under art 7, \u00a726.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">The second hurdle is not so easily cleared, as the question of public purpose has plagued tax increment financing schemes since their inception. However, in Michigan we have recognized a liberal version of the public purpose doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">Expressing the doctrine generally in <em>Gaylord, supra, </em>we stated that the theme of public purpose running through the constitutional and the public policy of this state limits the powers of the Legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>ture and of government generally to acts that exhibit a public purpose. We observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-4\">\" 'The consensus of modern legislative and judicial thinking is to broaden the scope of activities which may be classed as involving a public purpose. <em>... It reaches perhaps its broadest extent under the view that the economic welfare is one of the main concerns of the city, State, and the Federal governments.\u2019\u201d [Id., </em>p 298 (quoting <em>Harrison v Claybrook, </em>372 P2d 602, 605 [Okla, 1962]). Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Relevant to this observation, the legislative findings section of the ldfa states that the purpose of the act is \"to eliminate the causes of unemployment, underemployment, and joblessness therefore benefiting the economic growth of the state.\u201d MCL 125.2151(l)(b); MSA 3.540(351)(l)(b). The Legislature found \"[t]hat the creation of jobs and the promotion of economic growth in the state are essential governmental functions and constitute essential public purposes.\u201d MCL 125.2151(l)(f); MSA 3.540(351)(l)(f). Although the ldfa indirectly benefits private interests and to some extent goes beyond the rather limited public purposes that have been recognized as sufficient in other tax increment financing cases, under the broad public purpose doctrine recognized in Michigan, we find that the ldfa satisfies this constitutional criterion.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Like the courts of other states, we decline to second-guess the wisdom of the Legislature in the area of public purpose determinations. See <em>Wolper, supra, </em>p 216; <em>R E Short Co v Minneapolis, </em>269 NW2d 331, 337 (Minn, 1978) (court will \"pay great deference to the initial legislative determination that a particular project serves a public purpose\u201d). In <em>State v Daytona Beach, supra, </em>p 1216, the Supreme, Court of Florida found</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>that it is within the legislature\u2019s power to make community redevelopment one of the \"respective purposes\u201d of special taxing districts and to broaden the purpose of a special taxing district if it determines there is a need to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">In <em>1976 PA 295, supra, </em>p 696, we noted</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\">that this Court has recognized that the determination of what constitutes a public purpose is primarily the responsibility of the Legislature, and that the concept of public purpose has been construed quite broadly in Michigan. <em>Advisory Opinion on Constitutionality of 1975 PA 227 (Questions 2-10), </em>396 Mich 465, 495-498; 242 NW2d 3 (1976). For example, this Court has found that promoting the sale of Michigan apples, the payment of dues by a city for a membership in the Michigan Municipal League, the construction of a port marina by a city, the issuance of bonds by a city to finance the construction of privately owned industrial buildings, <em>[Gaylord, supra,] </em>the construction of a sports arena, public financing of gubernatorial elections and the creation of a state authority authorized to make loans directly to, or guarantee loans made to, private business enterprises for financing job development projects may all serve a valid public purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The stated purpose of the ldfa appears to fall within this range of recognized public purposes. In addition, it conforms to the more general definition of public purpose described in <em>Gaylord, supra, </em>p 300:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-8\">\" '[A] public purpose has for its objective the promotion of the public health, safety, morals, general welfare, security, prosperity, and contentment of all the inhabitants or residents within the municipal corporation, the sovereign powers of which are used to promote such public purpose.\u2019 \u201d [Quoting 37 Am Jur, Municipal Corporations, \u00a7 120, p 734.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>The finding of a public purpose is generally unaffected by the fact that private interests may benefit from implementation of the statutory scheme. See <em>Sinas, supra, </em>p 412; <em>1966 PA 346, supra, </em>p 585. This is true in other jurisdictions as well. See, e.g., <em>Crouch, supra, </em>p 369; <em>Richards, supra, </em>p 60; <em>Wolper, supra, </em>p 216; <em>Denver Urban Renewal Authority, supra, </em>p 1384.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Opponents of the ldfa are troubled by the fact that the act does not require the municipality to make a finding of urban blight or deterioration before creating a local development financing authority or implementing other provisions of the act. It is true that a majority of the tax increment financing cases from other jurisdictions have rested findings of sufficient public purpose on the fact that the legislation in question required the municipality to make a finding of \"urban blight\u201d before implementing a tax increment financing program. See Newman, <em>Tax increment \u00f1nancing for development and redevelopment, </em>61 Or LR 123, 141 (1982); Huddleston, <em>A comparison of state tax increment \u00f1nancing laws, </em>55 State Gov\u2019t 29, 31 (1982). We have also recognized the elimination of urban blight as a legitimate public purpose, see, e.g., <em>Sinas, supra, </em>p 412. However, in light of the broad public purpose doctrine recognized in this state, we decline to limit the doctrine, as it applies to tax increment financing, to the elimination of urban blight.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Thus, in response to the second question presented, we find that the capture and use of tax revenues, as authorized in \u00a7 14 of the ldfa, amount to a loan of credit under art 9, \u00a7 18. However, the loan of municipal credit permitted under the act is constitutional pursuant to art 7, \u00a7 26, in that it is authorized by law and furthers a public purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>In sum, we answer both of the questions presented in the negative. Neither Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 6 nor the rule of Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 18 and Const 1963, art 7, \u00a7 26, are violated by the capture and use of tax increment revenues as authorized in 1986 PA 281. We express no opinion on the potential applications of other constitutional provisions or on possible violations of the act itself. It goes without saying that future cases in controversy that arise from application of the act to particular sets of facts may present questions left unaddressed by this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b279-4\">Cavanagh, Boyle, Archer, and Griffin, JJ., concurred with Brickley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b243-12\"> Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 8 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-13\">Either house of the legislature or the governor may request the opinion of the supreme court on important questions of law upon solemn occasions as to the constitutionality of legislation after it has been enacted into law but before its effective date.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b244-7\"> As we have noted in the past,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-8\">the request for an advisory opinion must \"particularize any claims of unconstitutionality.\u201d <em>Advisory Opinion re Constitu tionality of 1972 PA 294, </em>389 Mich 441, 484 [208 NW2d 469 (1973)]; <em>Advisory Opinion re Constitutionality of 1974 PA 242, </em>394 Mich 41, 53; 228 NW2d 772 (1975).

We disagree insofar as ad valorem tax revenues generated as a result of a vote of the people are so diverted. Ad valorem tax revenues generated as a result of tax limitations adopted or increased by the vote of the electors may not be so diverted and may only be used for the purposes of the school district or other district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>or authority, the electors of which authorized the additional millage that generated the revenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Art 9, \u00a7 6, provides that the total amount of the general ad valorem taxes imposed upon real and tangible personal property shall not exceed fifteen mills on each dollar of the assessed valuation of property. It provides further that separate tax limitations for any county and for the townships, and school districts therein, not exceeding eighteen mills on each dollar, may be adopted and thereafter altered by a majority of the qualified electors of the county in lieu of the fifteen-mill limitation. It is still further provided that these limitations may be increased to an aggregate not to exceed fifty mills if approved by a majority of the electors.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">We recognize that the constitution does not expressly require, when voters have approved a millage increase from fifteen to eighteen mills and have established separate township, school district, and county tax limitations, that the ad. valorem tax revenues generated by these specific separate limitations be allocated to the particular township, school district or the county for which established. Such a requirement is, however, in our opinion, implicit in the constitution. The Legislature may not constitutionally divert ad valorem tax revenues generated by the separate tax limitations adopted for, say, school districts to township or county purposes or possibly even to state purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Nor do we agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the constitution does not require that ad valorem tax revenues generated by increased millage voted by the electors of a school district be used for school purposes. The majority states that \"the first paragraph of art 9, \u00a7 6 does not address the question of purpose\u2019; it places a limitation on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>the tax <em>rate, </em>not on tax revenues or their use.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Emphasis in original.) According to the majority, when school district electors authorize the levy of additional millage they have simply authorized an increase in the ad valorem tax that may be levied upon their real and tangible personal property; the constitution does not imply that the ad valorem tax revenues generated as a result of such a voter-authorized increase in the tax rate shall be used solely for school purposes. The Legislature might, under the majority\u2019s reading of the constitution, constitutionally divert ad valorem tax revenues generated by school district voted millage to other local uses and purposes or possibly even to statewide uses or purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">A statute does indeed provide that ad valorem tax revenues generated by millage authorized by the vote of school district electors shall be used solely for school purposes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Many statutes restate constitutional requirements. The enactment of a statute restating a constitutional requirement does not imply that absent the statute the constitution does not require what the statute states. Otherwise, the Legislature could repeal a constitutional requirement by enacting and then repealing a statute enunciating that constitutional requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The majority does not reach the question whether the statutory provision takes precedence over the provision of the Local Development Financing Act that it is claimed permits the diversion to purposes authorized by the Local Development Financing Act of ad valorem tax revenues generated by a voter-authorized increase in the millage leviable against property located in a school district. We agree with the majority that we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>may not properly reach that question, both because it is not presented by the request for an advisory opinion and because an advisory opinion can only be given on constitutional questions<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and not on a question of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">The justices have not heretofore agreed to give an advisory opinion on the constitutionality of the Local Development Financing Act; we expressly left open until after oral argument, and only today, by issuing our opinions, have we decided whether to do so.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The justices could justifiably, and, we believe, should decline to answer whether revenues generated by millage approved by the voters of a school district may be used for non-school purposes. This aspect of the request need not be decided until after the Court decides, when presented,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the statutory construction question whether one legislative enactment or the other takes precedence. It is well established that a constitutional question will not be reached if the matter can appropriately be decided on some other basis.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">The majority distinguishes the first paragraph of art 9, \u00a7 6 from the second paragraph of art 9, \u00a7 6, which provides that the \"foregoing [fifteen-mill] limitation[] shall not apply to taxes imposed for the payment of principal and interest on bonds approved by the electors . . . which taxes may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>imposed without limitation as to rate or amount.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The majority finds that the second paragraph \"does speak of [the] purpose or use\u201d to which ad valorem tax revenues generated by millage approved by the electors pursuant to the second paragraph may be put<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and does not simply place a limitation on the tax rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">The majority has not stated an adequate reason for concluding that the second paragraph speaks of the purpose or use to which ad valorem tax revenues generated pursuant to that paragraph may be put, but that the first paragraph does not. The first paragraph provides that separate tax limitations may be \"adopted and thereafter altered,\u201d and that such limitations may be \"increased\u201d \"by the vote\u201d of or if \"approved\u201d by the electors. The second paragraph provides that such limitations \"shall not apply\u201d when the additional tax imposition is \"approved\u201d by the electors. Those are, however, just different ways of saying the same thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The policy arguments and rationalizations advanced in support of the diversion of ad valorem tax revenues generated by millage voted pursuant to the first paragraph of art 9, \u00a7 6, apply with equal force to revenues generated by millage voted for the payment of bonds or other evidence of indebtedness pursuant to the second paragraph of art 9, \u00a7 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">We would advise that the Local Development Financing Act does not unconstitutionally divert ad valorem tax revenues insofar as the revenues diverted are not generated as the result of tax limitations adopted or increased by the electors. We would, however, advise that revenues generated as the result of a tax limitation adopted or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>increased by the electors may not constitutionally be so diverted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b284-4\">Riley, C.J., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b279-7\"> See <em>ante, </em>p 105.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b281-6\"><em> Ante, </em>p 111.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b281-7\"> MCL 380.1216; MSA 15.41216.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b282-8\"> Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 8.

The parties so concerned could commence an action for a declaratory judgment in a circuit court respecting the statutory construction question. We could urge that if they do so the circuit judge give the cause a high priority and promptly decide the question. After decision by the circuit court, we could grant leave to appeal prior to decision by the Court of Appeals and resolve this remaining aspect of the request for an advisory opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b282-11\"> <em>Lisee v Secretary of State, </em>388 Mich 32, 40; 199 NW2d 188 (1972); <em>Cole v Battle Creek, </em>298 Mich 98, 104; 298 NW 466 (1941).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b283-7\"> Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"AIr\"> <em>Ante, </em>p 112.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
