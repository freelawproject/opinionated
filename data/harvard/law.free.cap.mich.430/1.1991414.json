The issues now before us relate solely to liability for interest on the judgment. We are required to examine the extent of the obligation of, and the relative responsibilities as between, the two insurance carriers for prejudgment and post-judgment interest. Our review affirms the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">With supplementation as provided in the course of our discussion, we adopt the statement of facts set forth in the opinion of the Court of Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-11\">Plaintiff brought a products liability action against defendant Modern Research Corporation (Modern) which, after a jury trial, resulted in a May 20, 1983, judgment in the amount of $2,250, 000. Canadian Universal Insurance Company (Canadian) was Modern\u2019s primary insurer under a policy with a liability limit of $300,000. An excess liability policy was written by the Insurance Company of North America (ina), with a liability limit of $1,000,000. Canadian defended the suit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>on behalf of Modern at trial and, other than being apprised of the suit, ina did not actively participate in the defense. Following the entry of judgment, Modern moved for new trial, <em>remittitur, </em>and judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-5\">During the pendency of Modern\u2019s posttrial motions, the parties engaged in settlement negotiations which culminated in an agreement, the terms of which were placed on the record on November 18, 1983. The agreement proposed to discharge Modern from any liability on the judgment and add Canadian and ina as parties defendant in the action. Further, the defendant insurers agreed to pay the full sum of their respective policy limits. Any disagreement over the insurers\u2019 respective liability for interest on the judgment would be litigated in circuit court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-6\">After several versions of a proposed settlement order were exchanged by counsel for the plaintiff and the two insurance carriers, a consent judgment drafted by plaintiffs counsel[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] was agreed upon and entered by the court on February 27, 1984. Thereupon, Canadian paid plaintiff $508,044.81, representing its $300,000 policy limit, $43,928.25 in costs, and postcomplaint/prejudgment interest on its policy limit and interest on the entire judgment from the date of entry until July 8, 1983, when Canadian allegedly tendered the amount of its policy limit to ina. On the same date, ina paid plaintiff its $1,000,000 policy limit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-7\">Both carriers then filed motions for satisfaction of judgment, and plaintiff responded with a motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>to determine liability for interest on the judgment. Plaintiff asked the trial court to award him prejudgment interest on the excess over the $300,000 policy limit of Canadian; postjudgment interest on the entire judgment amount between July 8, 1983, the date plaintiff and Canadian asserted that Canadian actually tendered its policy limit to ina, and February 27, 1984, the date the consent judgment was entered by the trial court; and interest on the unpaid balance of the judgment accruing since February 27, 1984.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-6\">After oral arguments were heard on the motions, the trial court ruled that Canadian had paid all interest for which it was liable under its policy with the insured and Michigan law and was thus entitled to a satisfaction of judgment. As to ina, the court ruled that that defendant was not required to pay any prejudgment interest but was liable for postjudgment interest on the $1,000,000 policy limit from July 8, 1983, to February 27, 1984. [146 Mich App 813, 817-818; 381 NW2d 834 (1985).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Affirming in part and reversing in part, the Court of Appeals determined that each carrier was responsible for prejudgment interest only on its policy limits; that the obligation of ina, the excess carrier, for prejudgment interest was not relieved because Canadian, the primary carrier, controlled the underlying litigation; and that, in addition to postjudgment interest on its policy limits, each carrier was liable on a pro-rata basis for postjudgment interest on the amount by which the judgment exceeded the combined policy limits. We granted leave to appeal. 425 Mich 871 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">Absent a statutory or contractual obligation, it was the rule at common law that a judgment did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>not bear interest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In Michigan a statutory basis for allowing postjudgment interest has been in place for many years;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> however, there was no statutory provision for prejudgment interest until 1965. Since then, interest on a money judgment has been allowed by statute, MCL 600.6013; MSA 27A.6013, \"from the date of filing the complaint\u201d to \"the date of satisfaction of the judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Ballog v Knight Newspapers, Inc, </em>381 Mich 527; 164 NW2d 19 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Although a prevailing party is entitled by statute to judgment interest, the question \"who ultimately pays?\u201d has stirred considerable controversy in situations where the defendant has liability insurance, but the insurance contract does not expressly place responsibility for interest upon the insurer, or where the judgment amount plus interest exceeds the policy limits.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>We are required in this case to address questions of first impression including a dispute between the primary and excess insurance carriers concerning prejudgment interest. Purchase by an insured of two insurance policies establishes contractual rights and obligations as between the insured and each of the insurers. However, there being no privity of contract, such a purchase does not create a contractual relationship between the two carriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">In dealing with differences which inevitably arise between primary and excess carriers, courts have been forced to look beyond contract law to public policy considerations and principles of equity to determine respective rights and liabilities as between two carriers.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At the same time, a court must harmonize the relationship between the two insurers with the responsibilities which each insurer owes to the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">As one commentator has counseled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-8\">It is important in such instances to be certain that the court does not become confused and succeed in exonerating both companies. Each should retain its legal liability; if any question arises as to which should pay, that can be settled between them by agreement or by litigation. It should not diminish the rights either of the insured or of the victim. [8A Appleman, Insurance Law &amp; Practice, \u00a7 4894.25, p 103.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">In the instant case the tripartite relationship <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>which otherwise would exist is affected by the fact that the insured (Modern), the primary carrier (Canadian), and the excess carrier (ina) joined with plaintiff in approving and subscribing to a consent judgment which was entered by the trial court. The consent judgment served to resolve all differences among the parties except those relating to plaintiffs entitlement to judgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Each of the courts below based its decision in part upon the construction of language in the consent judgment, which reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-6\">It is further hereby ordered that Canadian Universal Insurance Company, Ltd., and Insurance Company of North America, <em>shall pay </em>to the said Steven P. Matich, and his attorneys, Zeff and Zeff, <em>interest owed if any, on the amount of their policy limits from the date of filing of the Complaint in this action until the date of Judgment, along with interest owed, if any, on the entire amount of the Judgment ($2,250,000.00) from the date of entry of said Judgment until the date of payment of said insurer\u2019s policy limits, </em>under the terms of its insurance policy or otherwise to be paid by such insurance carrier under the laws of the State of Michigan; <em>it being ordered and understood </em>between the parties <em>that the alleged liability of Canadian Universal Insurance Company, Ltd., and Insurance Company of North America for any interest claimed owing on the Judgment by either carrier shall be litigated </em>in this action before the Honorable James A. Hathaway and it is further understood between the parties and ordered that neither the Canadian Universal Insurance Company, Ltd., nor the Insurance Company of North America shall be relieved of its liability to the Plaintiff for the payment of such interest by reason of the release of Modern Research Corporation from liability under the Judgment. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">In this appeal, the plaintiff maintains that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>italicized language, when read in light of the record of hearings held by the trial court, \"makes crystal clear that . . . any and all questions relating to liability of either insurer for any interest . . . would be litigated\u201d and resolved \"under the terms of [the] insurance policies] or . . . under the laws of the State of Michigan . . . As plaintiff points out, in commenting upon the meaning of the consent judgment language, counsel for Canadian, the primary insurer, at the February 27, 1984 hearing, expressed his agreement that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-6\">whether either insurance carrier owes interest ... is to be determined solely by references to the policies or the law of the state of Michigan ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">Judge Kelly, dissenting in part from the Court of Appeals decision, expressed this view:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-8\">I construe this language [of the consent judgment] to mean that the parties had agreed to submit to the courts the question of the amount upon which postjudgment interest was due and the issue was to be decided in accordance with the terms of the insurance contracts and in accordance with the general principles of Michigan law. I do not agree that the consent judgment created substantive rights and obligations on the subject of postjudgment interest. <em>[Matich, supra </em>at 828-829.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">After a careful examination of the language in the consent judgment and the record of the hearings held by the trial court, we are persuaded by the argument of plaintiff on this point. We believe Judge Kelly correctly took exception to the use of the consent judgment to \"create[ ] substantive rights and obligations on the subject of postjudg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>ment interest.\u201d Indeed we reach the same conclusion with respect to prejudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Accordingly, as a preliminary matter, we reject the invitation to resolve the issues presented in this case on the basis of the consent judgment. Although we resolve the issues presented by looking to the terms of the insurance policies and the law of Michigan, rather than the consent judgment, we observe that our resolution, it so happens, is not at odds with the results reached by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">We turn now to the issues raised in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">First, defendant ina, the excess insurer, assigns error to the Court of Appeals holding that it is responsible for prejudgment interest on its policy limits of $1,000,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">Citing <em>Michigan Milk Producers v Commercial Union Ins Co, </em>493 F Supp 66 (WD Mich, 1980),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> ina argues that liability for all prejudgment interest should fall on the insurer which controlled the defense of the underlying litigation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Pointing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>the fact that Canadian, the primary insurer, controlled the litigation, ina maintains that it should not be liable for any prejudgment interest, and it claims that such a result is required by the reasoning of this Court in <em>Denham v Bedford, </em>407 Mich 517; 287 NW2d 168 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">In <em>Denham, </em>the Court held the insurer liable for payment of prejudgment interest on its policy limits, even though such payment exceeds the policy limits.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Focusing on the fact that the insurer, not the insured, controlled the litigation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>the Court was unanimous in the view that sound public policy considerations justified its decision.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-5\">The result we reach today is fully supported by considerations of public policy. If we were to rule in favor of the insurer, the following would take place: the insured, not the insurer, would be responsible for the payment of the prejudgment interest in excess of the policy limits and, presumptively, interest on the entire judgment as well. Such a result would appear unconscionable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-6\">We note that by the very terms of the insurance policy the insurer retained control over any investigation process, settlement or litigation. The insured had no control over the process and if the insured chose to act or attempted to settle of his own volition, he would run the risk of forfeiture of any rights under the policy. [407 Mich 535.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">The <em>Denham </em>Court did not base its decision solely on the narrow ground that the insurer controlled the litigation. As the Court further explained the insurer not only controls the litigation, but at the same time retains control for investment purposes of the money which represents its policy limits.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>The Court\u2019s reasoning continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">The insurer had complete control over the . . . policy limits from . . . the date of filing the complaint, until . . . when it tendered [that amount] without interest. Even assuming that the insurer were required to set the funds aside from its general investment fund because of the pending litigation, the funds did not remain idle. The funds were invested. And, again, even assuming that the funds were invested in conservative short-term enterprises, the insurer certainly would not lose anything by paying the prejudgment interest but would probably retain a profit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-7\">Payment of prejudgment interest not only compensates the prevailing party but also liability for prejudgment interest may act as an incentive to the insurer to promptly settle a meritorious claim. Without such an incentive, the insurer may refuse to settle a meritorious claim in hopes of forcing plaintiff to settle for less than the claim\u2019s true value. The insurer risks nothing. Even if protracted litigation results, the insurer will only be liable for its policy limits \u2014 all the while reaping a tidy sum from its investment of the policy limits. [407 Mich 536.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>It is the combination of these circumstances which reduces incentive for prompt settlement by the insurer of a meritorious claim, and which justifies on public policy grounds the requirement that the insurer, rather than the insured, pay prejudgment interest on that part of the judgment which the insurer controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Other courts have also reasoned that it would be inimical to the sound administration of justice to allow an insurer to control the settlement process while retaining investment profits on its policy limits, and leaving the insured to pay prejudgment interest occasioned by delays in the process. See <em>Busik v Levine, </em>63 NJ 351; 307 A2d 571 (1973). Also 8A Appleman, Insurance Law &amp; Practice, \u00a7 4894.25, pp 77-79 and cases cited in n 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Although the <em>Denham </em>Court looked to the fact that the insurer, not the insured, \"retain[s] control over any investigation process, settlement or litigation,\u201d 407 Mich 535, it is important to recognize that <em>Denham </em>involved only a single insurer, and its focus was on the relationship between the insured and the insurer, not the relationship between two insurers.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">While ina, the excess insurer, did not participate in defending the insured in the underlying litigation, there is no question that ina had timely notice of the suit. We also note that under the terms of its own insurance policy ina had \"the right and duty to defend any suit against the insured . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">In the instant case, during the prejudgment period, Canadian, the primary insurer, had control for investment purposes of the $300,000 which represented its own policy limits. But neither Canadian nor the insured had control over or use of the $1,000,000 which represented ina\u2019s policy lim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>its. Ina had effective use of that money throughout the period of the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">We find no compelling consideration which persuades us that the full obligation for all prejudgment interest should be shouldered by only one of the carriers. On the contrary, we believe, in the absence of special circumstances, that the obligation should be shared by both carriers on a prorata basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">When the liability of a primary carrier for prejudgment interest is related to its policy limits, the insurer has a basis for assessing the extent of its exposure and fixing its premiums. However, since a primary carrier has no control over the amount of excess coverage which an insured may purchase, if the rules were otherwise, the exposure of the primary carrier would be uncertain and impossible to assess. It is essential that public policy considerations strike a balance which allows</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-6\">[a]n insurance company [to] limit the risks it assumes and fix its premiums accordingly. <em>[Lehr v Professional Underwriters, </em>296 Mich 693, 696; 296 NW 843 (1941).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">See <em>Cosby v Pool, </em>36 Mich App 571, 578; 194 NW2d 142 (1971), and <em>Celina Mutual Ins Co v Citizens Ins Co of America, </em>133 Mich App 655, 659; 349 NW2d 547 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">We reject the rationale of <em>Michigan Milk Producers, supra, </em>and <em>Michigan Milk Producers v Commercial Union Ins Co, </em>564 F Supp 1545 (WD Mich, 1983), for another reason. As already noted, this Court in <em>Denham </em>said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-9\">Payment of prejudgment interest not only compensates the prevailing party but also liability for prejudgment interest may act as an incentive to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>the insurer to promptly settle a meritorious claim. Without such an incentive, the insurer may refuse to settle a meritorious claim in hopes of forcing plaintiff to settle for less than the claim\u2019s true value. <em>[Denham, supra </em>at 536.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The approach advocated by ina would encourage an excess insurer to refuse to aid in the \"investigation process, settlement or litigation,\u201d <em>Denham, supra </em>at 535, since, under such reasoning, any participation in the process could render the excess insurer liable for prejudgment interest. We believe that would serve not only to undermine \"a good faith vigorous defense of an action,\u201d <em>Celina, supra </em>at 659, on behalf of the insured, but also to discourage \"prompt[] settle[ment] [of] a meritorious claim\u201d of an injured party, <em>Denham, supra </em>at 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">In light of these considerations, we believe, as did the Court of Appeals panel in <em>Celina, supra </em>at 659, that \"pro-rata apportionment of liability for prejudgment interest is the better result . . . .\u201d Accordingly, we conclude that ina is liable for prejudgment interest on its $1,000,000 policy limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">Next, we are required to determine whether the liability of each insurer for prejudgment interest should be calculated on its policy limits or the full amount of the judgment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Plaintiff maintains that ina and Canadian are obligated under the terms of their own insurance contracts to pay prejudgment interest on the entire judgment, not just the policy limits. Plaintiff points to the \"standard interest clause,\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> language that is common to both contracts. Each policy provides that the insurer shall pay</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">all interest on the entire amount of any judgment therein which accrues after entry of the judgment and before . . . [the insurer] has . . . tendered or deposited in court that part of the judgment which does not exceed the limit of [the insurer\u2019s] liability thereon.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">The interpretation of this \"standard interest clause\u201d and its relationship to judgment interest statutes has generated considerable controversy throughout the country.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">In support of his argument, plaintiff calls attention to the fact that the standard interest clause, promulgated by the National Bureau of Casualty Underwriters, was revised to its present form in 1956. In a communication issued to its members, the bureau explained the revision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-9\">\"Several court cases have held that an insurer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>obligation to pay interest extends only to that part of the judgment for which the insurer is liable. The respective rating committees have agreed that this is contrary to the intent. As a result, the wording with respect to payment of interest in the new Family Automobile Policy has been restated, in order that it be entirely clear that all interest on the <em>entire amount of </em>any judgment, which accrues <em>after entry of the judgment, </em>is payable by the insurer until the insurer has paid or tendered or deposited in court that part of the judgment which does not exceed the limit of the insurer\u2019s liability thereon.\u201d [Ramsey, <em>Interest on judgments under liability insurance policies, </em>1957 Ins L J 407, 411.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">See also note, <em>Insurance: Interest payments under the supplementary payments provision of the standard automobile liability policy, </em>52 Marquette L R 396 (1969).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>It is apparent from the explanation provided by the bureau that prior to 1956, when the standard interest clause was changed, some courts had held that an insurer was obligated under the earlier version of the standard interest clause to pay interest only up to or on <em>its policy limits </em>\"which accrues <em>after </em>entry of the judgment.\u201d Obviously the clause was revised to make clear that the insurer is obligated for all interest <em>on the entire judgment </em>\"which accrues <em>after </em>entry of the judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">As we read the standard interest clause, it clearly imposes a contractual obligation only with respect to postjudgment interest \u2014 interest which accrues after entry of judgment. It does not pertain to prejudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">While the exact amount of prejudgment interest due is not ascertainable until after the amount of the judgment has been determined, it cannot be said that prejudgment interest \"accrues <em>after </em>entry of the judgment.\u201d Prejudgment interest vests or becomes fixed at the time the judgment is entered, while postjudgment interest continues to accumulate or \"accrue\u201d after the time the judgment is entered. This is consistent with the ordinary and popular sense of the language of the policy. <em>Edgar\u2019s Warehouse, Inc v United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co, </em>375 Mich 598; 134 NW2d 746 (1965); <em>Kingsley v American Central Life Ins Co, </em>259 Mich 53, 55; 242 NW 836 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">For support of his argument that the insurers in this case should pay prejudgment interest on the entire judgment, rather than on policy limits, plaintiff also points to this Court\u2019s decision in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number><em>Denham, </em>particularly the following portion of Justice Moody\u2019s opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-4\">The only issue, tangentially related to the present one, which remains unresolved at common law is not whether an insurer is liable for interest on the policy limits but whether the insurer is liable for interest on the whole judgment. The courts have split on this issue although the majority and modern trend is in favor of holding the insurer liable for interest on the whole judgment. [407 Mich 533.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Footnote 9 which was inserted as support for those two sentences in the opinion is more important for purposes of our analysis than the text itself. The footnote reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-6\">For a thorough discussion of this issue, see 76 ALR2d 983. Although there is some Michigan authority to the contrary, see, <em>e.g., Cates v Moyses, </em>57 Mich App 405; 226 NW2d 106 (1975), <em>mod </em>394 Mich 762; 228 NW2d 380 (1975); <em>Cosby, supra, </em>this Court has never fully addressed the issue whether an insurer should be held liable for interest on the entire judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">In addition to noting that the quoted language from <em>Denham </em>obviously is dicta, we find that plaintiffs reliance upon it for support of his position is unwarranted, as examination of the authority and cases cited clearly reveals. The cases collected in 76 ALR2d 983 relate to the scope of liability for postjudgment interest contractually assumed by an insurer under the standard interest clause. They do not focus on liability for prejudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">The footnote correctly acknowledges that prior decisions in Michigan do not require an insurer to pay prejudgment interest on the whole judgment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>In <em>Cosby, supra, </em>the policy obligated the insurer to pay interest \"accruing on verdict or after judgment\u201d to date of payment or tender. The Court of Appeals in <em>Cosby </em>held that the insurer was <em>not </em>liable for prejudgment interest on the entire judgment but only on its policy limits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-6\">An insurer can limit the risk it assumes. [Citation omitted.] It follows that the insurer should be liable only for the interest that accrues on the amount of risk it has assumed. Otherwise, it would be paying interest on a risk it did not assume and for which it did not charge premiums. [36 Mich App 578-579.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">The <em>Denham </em>footnote also refers to <em>Cates, supra. </em>In that case a judgment was entered against the defendant for $60,000; the limits of his insurance policy were $10,000. The policy included the same standard interest clause which is in the policies at issue in the instant case. The Court of Appeals held in <em>Cates </em>that the insurer was required to pay interest on $60,000, the <em>entire judgment, </em>from the date the complaint was filed until payment in full was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">Leave to appeal was granted, and this Court sua sponte by order, 394 Mich 762-763 (1975), amended the Court of Appeals decision \"so as to require the insurer to pay prejudgment interest only on the limit of the . . . policy of insurance . . .,\u201d citing <em>Cosby, supra. </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">This Court\u2019s order in <em>Cates </em>recites also that \"[t]he judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed in all other respects,\u201d leaving in place the requirement that the insurer pay posijudgment interest on the entire amount of the judgment which accrued after entry of judgment and before payment.</p>\n<p id=\"A2F\">Except for our order in <em>Cates, </em>this Court has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>previously addressed the issue whether an insurer should be held liable for postjudgment interest on the entire judgment. However, the law of Michigan with respect to an insurer\u2019s liability for prejudgment interest is well settled, at least to this extent: An insurer whose policy includes the standard interest clause is required to pay prejudgment interest from the date of filing of a complaint until the entry of judgment, calculated on the basis of its policy limits, not on the entire judgment, and interest on the policy limits must be paid even though the combined amount exceeds the policy limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Accordingly, we hold that Canadian and ina are each liable for prejudgment interest only on the amount of their respective policy limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Finally, we must determine whether the liability of defendants ina and Canadian for postjudgment interest should be calculated on the basis of their respective policy limits or the full amount of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">With respect to this issue, the Court of Appeals majority found the language<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> of the consent judgment to be dispositive, reading it as an agreement on the part of the insurers to pay postjudgment interest on the entire judgment. As before, we proceed on the basis that the consent judgment did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>not create \"substantive rights and obligations\u201d on the subject of judgment interest, and that the parties intended to leave their differences concerning judgment interest to be resolved through litigation \"under the terms of [the insurer\u2019s] insurance policies] or . . . under the laws of the State of Michigan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">In deciding this issue, we look to the standard interest clause which, as noted earlier, is common to the policies of both insurers. Once again, the clause provides that each insurer shall pay</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-7\">all interest on <em>the entire amount of </em>any judgment therein which <em>accrues after entry of the judgment </em>and before . . . [the insurer] has tendered or deposited in court that part of the judgment which does not exceed the limit of [the insurer\u2019s] liability thereon. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">It is unnecessary to repeat the analysis already provided in our discussion of prejudgment interest. We believe it provides compelling justification for the conclusion that in the instant case each insurer contractually obligated itself to pay interest on \"the entire amount\u201d of the judgment which \"accrue[d] after entry of the judgment . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ah\">As we have previously observed, \"[a]n insurer may limit the risk that it assumes.\u201d <em>Cosby, supra </em>at 578. However, as the court in <em>Highway Casualty </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number><em>Co v Johnston, </em>104 So 2d 734, 736 (Fla, 1958), aptly stated long ago:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-5\">The casualty company could, of course, have limited its liability on interest .... This it did not do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\">We are not unaware of the fact that the insurance companies fix their premiums in direct ratio to their contractual obligations. Everyone knows that the insurance field is highly competitive. Had [the insurer] entertained any doubt with reference to its obligation [under the standard interest clause] it could have revised the verbiage of its contract before the issuance thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-7\">The dilemma in which the carrier finds itself appears to us to be of its own making. We cannot find any justification for the casualty company\u2019s contention that it is not liable for interest on the entire judgment. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">In terms of its relationship with the insured, it is both understandable and reasonable that an insurer would contractually assume responsibility for all interest that accrues after entry of judgment. At the point when a judgment is entered by the trial court, the insurer has an option. It may tender its policy limits (together with other amounts it may owe), and thus avoid liability for postjudgment interest, or it may proceed with an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">As one commentator has observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-10\">It seems fair to compel the insurer to pay all the interest which accrues <em>pending an appeal, </em>even though the judgment is in excess of the policy limits, for the reason that the insured might desire to pay the excess judgment and thus prevent the running of interest, but the insurer\u2019s control of the litigation would prevent him from doing so.

This, however, overlooks the fact that an integral part of the insurance business is investing money. The return on investments, as well as the amount of losses, is used to set rates. If insurance companies are required to pay prejudgment interest, it must inevitably affect rates. Professor Glavin, Professor of Law, Wayne State University, commenting on <em>Cosby </em>[n 5 <em>supra], </em>said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-9\">\"This result seems questionable.

In <em>Denham v Bedford, </em>407 Mich 517; 287 NW2d 168 (1980), this Court concluded that the prejudgment interest statute, MCL 600.6013; MSA 27A.6013, becomes part of the insurance contract and that it replaces any contractual provisions with which it conflicts. <em>Id., </em>p 530. Consequently, to properly measure an insurer\u2019s liability for prejudgment interest we must first examine the insurance contract in light of the statute together with any other agreements between the parties to discern the limits of their understanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The policies for both defendants provided for the payment of postjudgment interest only.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>rule in <em>Denham, </em>MCL 600.6013; MSA 27A.6013 also is part of both agreements.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, the \"contracts\u201d provided that Canadian Universal and ina would be responsible for prejudgment interest to be calculated from the date of filing the complaint, and postjudgment interest on the entire judgment to be calculated from the date of entry of the judgment until payment, tender, or deposit with the court of their portions of the judgment. The only question left unanswered from the language of the agreement as modified by MCL 600.6013(2); MSA 27A.6013(2) is whether prejudgment interest would be calculated on the basis of the limits of their respective policies or the entire judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">On this issue the majority concludes that the proper resolution is that of <em>Cosby v Pool, </em>36 Mich App 571; 194 NW2d 142 (1971), and <em>Cates v Moyses, </em>57 Mich App 405; 226 NW2d 106 (1975), modified 394 Mich 762; 228 NW2d 380 (1975). The rule to be gleaned from these decisions is that because \"[a]n insurer can limit the risk it assumes . . . [i]t follows that the insurer should be liable only for the interest that accrues on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>amount of risk it has assumed.\u201d <em>Cosby, supra, </em>p 578. Applying this rule, the majority then concludes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-5\">[T]he law of Michigan with respect to an insurer\u2019s liability for prejudgment interest is well settled, at least to this extent: An insurer whose policy includes the standard interest clause is required to pay prejudgment interest from the date of filing of a complaint until the entry of judgment, calculated on the basis of its policy limits, not on the entire judgment, and interest on the policy limits must be paid even though the combined amount exceeds the policy limits. <em>[Ante, </em>P 23.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">I am not persuaded that it is necessary or appropriate to resolve this question as a matter of law. Rather, we should resolve this case on the basis of an examination of the understanding of the parties as to that which Canadian Universal and ina had bound themselves. I would look to the language of the amended order of judgment and consent judgment entered into by Canadian Universal, ina, Modern Research Corporation, and Steven Matich.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">The relevant portion of the consent judgment provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-9\">It is further hereby ordered that <em>Canadian Universal Insurance Company, Ltd., and Insurance Company of North America, shall pay to the said Steven P. Matich, and his attorneys, Zeff and Zeff, interest owed if any, on the amount of their policy limits from the date of filing of the Complaint in this action until the date of Judgment, </em>along -with interest owed, if any, on the entire amount of the Judgment ($2,250,000.00) from the date of entry of said Judgment until the date of payment of said insurer\u2019s policy limits, under the terms of its insurance policy or otherwise to be paid by such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>insurance carrier under the laws of the State of Michigan; <em>it being ordered and understood between the parties that the alleged liability of Canadian Universal Insurance Company, Ltd., and Insurance Company of North America for any interest claimed owing on the Judgment by either carrier shall be litigated in this action before the Honorable James A. Hathaway </em>and it is further understood between the parties and ordered that neither the Canadian Universal Insurance Company, Ltd., nor the Insurance Company of North America shall be relieved of its liability to the Plaintiif for the payment of such interest by reason of the release of Modern Research Corporation from liability under the Judgment. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">In my view, the parties agreed that interest owed on the judgment, if any, would be limited to the policy limits for prejudgment interest and extend to the entire judgment for postjudgment interest. That portion of the order dealing with postjudgment interest is consistent with the language of the standard interest clause. The portion pertaining to prejudgment interest appears also to be consistent with the parties\u2019 understanding of the obligations that Canadian Universal and ina had agreed to assume.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">At issue, then, is simply a construction of the agreement between Canadian Universal, ina, Modern Research, and Steven Matich. It is the consent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>judgment that reflects the intent of those parties. <em>Union v Ewing, </em>372 Mich 181, 186; 125 NW2d 311 (1963); <em>Dora v Lesinski, </em>351 Mich 579, 582; 88 NW2d 592 (1958). Because the parties each have agreed to limit the insurers\u2019 prejudgment interest liability to the limits of their respective policies, it is unnecessary for this Court to decide that the award of prejudgment interest must, as a matter of law, be confined to the limits of an insurance policy. Certainly the parties could agree to measure prejudgment interest on the basis of the actual judgment. Similarly, as in this case, the parties could agree that if a court should find interest to be due, that interest would be calculated on the basis of the limits of the insurance policy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Canadian Universal and ina could have drafted their policies to limit their obligations to pay prejudgment interest to their respective policy limits; this they did not do. Instead, a provision for prejudgment interest was drafted into the consent judgment. We need only construe that which the parties have agreed to; having done so, we need go no further.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">I concur in the result reached today on the issue of prejudgment interest. To the extent that our ruling mandates that prejudgment interest must be limited to the limits of an insurer\u2019s policy, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Archer, J., concurred with Boyle, J.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b174-7\"> See anno: <em>Liability insurer\u2019s liability for interest and costs on excess of judgment over policy limit, </em>76 ALR2d 983.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b174-8\"> The interest clause found in Canadian Universal\u2019s policy provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-9\">\"The company will pay, in addition to the applicable limit of liability:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-10\">\"(a) all expenses incurred by the company, all costs taxed against the insured in any suit defended by the company and <em>all interest on the entire amount of any judgment therein which accrues a\u00f1er entry of the judgment </em>and before the company has paid or tendered or deposited in court that part of the judgment which does not exceed the limit of the company\u2019s liability thereon.\u201d [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0x\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>Similarly, the ina policy provided that ina would pay:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-7\">\"all expenses incurred by ina, all costs taxed against the Insured in any suit defended by ina and <em>all interest on the entire amount of any judgment therein which accrues after entry of the judgment </em>and before ina has paid or tendered or deposited in court that part of the judgment which does not exceed the limit of ina\u2019s liability thereon.\u201d [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b175-8\"> MCL 600.6013(2); MSA 27A.6013(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-9\">(2) For complaints filed before June 1, 1980, in an action involving other than a written instrument having a rate of interest exceeding 6% per year, the interest on the judgment shall be calculated from the date of filing the complaint to June 1, 1980, at the rate of 6% per year and on and after June 1, 1980, to the date of satisfaction of the judgment at the rate of 12% per year compounded annually.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b177-7\"> On February 27, 1984, Canadian Universal tendered its draft to plaintiffs counsel in the amount of $508,044.81 representing their policy limits of $300,000, costs and taxes of $43,928.25, and interest of $164,116.56. The interest payment represented interest on the entire judgment from May 20, 1983, the date of entry of the judgment, to July 8, 1983, the date of Canadian Universal\u2019s tender to ina, and prejudgment interest on its policy limits. Further, a review of the relevant transcripts of proceedings before Judge Hathaway reveals that ina believed that it was not responsible for any interest because it was an excess insurer, but that if liability was found, it only could be liable for prejudgment interest on $1,000,000, its policy limits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b178-7\"> The determination of prejudgment interest, although statutorily provided, need not be considered at all.
