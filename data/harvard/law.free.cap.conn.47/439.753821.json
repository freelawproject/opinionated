She afterwards, and within the time limited, presented to him a sheet of paper on which were written the different sums lent, with a computation of the interest on each, but with nothing else to indicate its character or object. The administrator received it as being what he had requested, but afterwards disallowed the claim. Held that the claim had been sufficiently presented to the administrator..</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-5\">Assumpsit for money lent to the defendant\u2019s intestate; brought to the Superior Court in Windham County, and tried to the court on the general issue, with notice, before <em>Hovey, J. </em>The matters set up in the notice were the statute of limitations, and the neglect to present the claim to the defendant as administrator before the bringing of the suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-6\">On the trial it was admitted that the defendant was administrator of the estate of Erastus Hammett, late of Plainfield, in Windham County, deceased; that the estate was in the course of settlement in the court of probate for the district of Plainfield as a solvent intestate estate; and that the court, on the 16th of August, 1876, made an order limiting sis months as the time within which claims against the estate should be presented to the administrator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-7\">The plaintiffs introduced the defendant as a witness, who, among other things, testified that Mrs. Hammett informed him in December, 1876, that she had a claim against the estate\u2014that she lent to the deceased $30 twenty-five years before, $150 twenty-three years before, and $225 fifteen years before, and that this money had never been repaid to her; that the defendant then asked her if she had a note or anything to show for it, and she replied that she had not, and that he, then supposing that the claim was barred by the statute of limitations, told her that he was sorry to say that it was beyond his jurisdiction; that afterwards on the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>day he told her to make up her account in figures with interest and present it to him, and he would see if Erastus (a son) and the old lady (the widow of the deceased,) would agree to allow her something; that a short time afterwards, in the early part of January, 1877, and within the time limited for the exhibition of claims against the estate, she made out her account in figures and writing as the defendant had directed, and handed it to him.

But afterwards the defendant, believing the claim to be barred by the statute of limitations, disallowed the same, and he disallowed it for no other cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-5\">Upon these facts the defendant\u2019s counsel requested the court to rule that no lawful presentation of the claim had been made by Mrs. Hammett to the defendant as administrator. But the court ruled that the presentation was sufficient, and rendered judgment for the plaintiffs for the sum of $895.30 damages and costs of suit. The defendant moved for a new trial for error in the rulings of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b442-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number><em>T. F. </em>Graves, in support of the motion.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b442-4\">The only question in the case is, was the \u201cclaim\u201d of Mrs. Hammett \u201cexhibited\u201d to the administrator as required by law. By the statute claims are barred unless \u201cexhibited\u201d within the time limited by the court of probate. Gen. Statutes, p. 888, sec. 5. To exhibit a claim is to \u201cpresent it for inspection.\u201d Webster\u2019s Diet. An \u201cexhibit\u201d is a paper or writing produced on motion or otherwise. Bouvier Law Diet. The parol statement of the claim was not a legal exhibit. And the mass of figures in the case is not an intelligent statement of anything, and was not given or taken as an exhibit, but for entirely another purpose. The administrator had no power to waive the requirements of the law in the case <em>\u25a0 </em>nor is his reason for disallowance, known only to himself, of any consequence.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b442-5\"><em>J.

If it lacks anything in these respects the accompanying oral explanation supplied the deficiency; if there is any mystery the key to it was placed in the hands of the administrator. To him the written presentation became clear and precise to his expressed satisfaction. He, representing heirs and creditors, was made to comprehend the extent of the plaintiffs\u2019 demand upon the estate, and the time and character of each of the several transactions out of which it grew. He was put in possession of all information requisite for the defence of the estate against it if it was without foundation. This matter of substance secured, the law is satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">A new trial is not advised. -</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
