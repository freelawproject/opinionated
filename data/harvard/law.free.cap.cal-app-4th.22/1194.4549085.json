Kuykendall on portions of her amended complaint; and an order requiring the Board to transfer the moneys to the County of San Diego (San Diego) to be held in trust pending further court order. The Board also seeks mandate. We reverse the judgment and orders. We dismiss as moot the petition for mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">This case arises from the California Supreme Court\u2019s determination a local sales tax in San Diego was unconstitutional. In this consumer class action lawsuit, Kuykendall seeks refund of the illegally collected tax moneys. During pendency of this lawsuit, the Legislature enacted a statutory scheme for refunding such moneys. We are asked to decide whether the legislation should prevail over a conflicting refund plan ordered by the superior court. We conclude such legislation has supplanted the superior court\u2019s rulings and is not facially unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b721-12\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b721-13\">In <em>Rider </em>v. <em>County of San Diego </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 1 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 490, 820 P.2d 1000] <em>(Rider </em>I), the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1200\">*1200</page-number>San Diego County Regional Justice Facility Financing Agency (Agency) supplemental sales and use tax (Jail Tax). The court concluded the Jail Tax was invalid because it was not approved by at least two-thirds of San Diego\u2019s voters as required under article XIII A, section 4 of the California Constitution. (1 Cal.4th at pp. 5-16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">In <em>Rider </em>v. <em>County of San Diego </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1410 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 885] <em>(Rider II), </em>the appellate court reversed a Riverside County Superior Court ruling insofar as it imposed a \u201csales tax offset\u201d as the method for redistributing the invalidly collected Jail Tax funds. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1417-1421, 1427.) The appellate court remanded the matter to the Riverside trial court to order such funds and accrued interest be deposited with and retained by the Board \u201cpending and subject to any such administrative and/or judicial proceedings as may hereafter be undertaken with respect thereto.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1427.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">In January 1993 the Board announced a plan for refund claims to be made through San Diego retailers who had transferred Jail Tax moneys to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">Later in January 1993 Kuykendall filed this consumer class action lawsuit against the Board, the Agency and retailer Discover Infiniti, Inc. (Discover), seeking direct reimbursement plus interest to consumers who effectively paid the Jail Tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">In August 1993 by preliminary injunction the superior court ordered the Board to deposit the Jail Tax moneys into an interest-bearing escrow account. The Board appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">Later in August 1993 the court certified the plaintiff class for purposes of establishing a method for the Jail Tax refund. The court also granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment and effectively imposed a constructive trust on the Jail Tax moneys. The court ruled all consumers were \u201ctaxpayers\u201d entitled to a full direct refund of the Jail Tax they paid and the Board was not to make any refunds without the court\u2019s prior approval of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1201\">*1201</page-number>reimbursement plan. The court ordered the Board to submit a reimbursement plan for court approval.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Board again appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">On October 8, 1993, the court entered judgment favoring Kuykendall against the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">On October 11, 1993, Senate Bill No. 263 (SB 263), codified at Revenue and Taxation Code<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> section 7275 et seq., became effective. (Stats. 1993, ch. 1060.) SB 263 created a statutory refund scheme for the unconstitutionally collected sales tax funds, to wit, a sales tax rollback and direct refunds for claims of $5,000 or more in documented purchases. (\u00a7\u00a7 7276, 7277.)</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">On October 15, 1993, at a hearing to consider the Board\u2019s reimbursement plan, the Board asserted enactment of SB 263 rendered moot the superior court\u2019s rulings in this litigation. The court stated it did not believe its rulings were moot. The court also stated it thought SB 263 was unconstitutional under the separation of powers doctrine and violated consumers\u2019 rights to due process and equal protection. The court ordered the Board to transfer the Jail Tax funds to San Diego pending appellate review.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Board again appealed and also sought mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">We have consolidated the Board\u2019s appeals and petition into this one case for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b723-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b723-11\">\n<em>The Board\u2019s Appeals</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b723-12\">The Board contends the superior court lacked jurisdiction to grant relief because plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit assertedly did not qualify under applicable California constitutional and statutory law controlling tax refund actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-13\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b723-14\">In June 1993 upon remand in <em>Rider II, supra, </em>11 Cal.App.4th 1410, the Riverside Superior Court ordered the Agency to deposit with the Board all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1202\">*1202</page-number>Jail Tax funds it held. In August 1993 the Riverside court\u2019s order became final and was not appealed. Later that month the Agency delivered almost $386 million to the Board. The record is silent whether the Agency subsequently transferred the earned interest to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">\u201cUnder the rule of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction, \u2018when two superior courts have concurrent jurisdiction over the subject matter and all parties involved in litigation, the first to assume jurisdiction has exclusive and continuing jurisdiction over the subject matter and all parties involved until such time as all necessarily related matters have been resolved.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Plant Insulation Co. </em>v. <em>Fibreboard Corp. </em>(1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 781, 786-787 [274 Cal.Rptr. 147].)  Citing <em>Plant Insulation Co., </em>the Board contends the San Diego Superior Court could not properly assume jurisdiction over the Jail Tax funds because jurisdiction assertedly remained in the Riverside court for purposes of resolving necessarily related matters. Specifically, the Board contends the Riverside court retained jurisdiction to enforce its order until the Agency fully complied by transferring to the Board all Jail Tax funds, including interest. However, the Board seeks to raise this issue for the first time on appeal without having made such contention in the superior court. Further, even if the Riverside court retained jurisdiction to enforce its order against the Agency, such continuing jurisdiction did not preclude the San Diego court from asserting jurisdiction over Kuykendall\u2019s consumer class action lawsuit seeking refunds. Kuykendall was not a party to <em>Rider II, supra, </em>11 Cal.App.4th 1410. Moreover, the appellate court in <em>Rider II </em>stated: \u201cThis case does not call upon us to decide, and we do not decide, any issues relating to the refund proceedings which may be undertaken to recover any invalidly collected sales tax revenues . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1420.) The court also stated nothing in its opinion precluded San Diego retail consumers from pursuing remedial reimbursement of the Jail Tax funds in another action. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1421.)</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">Article XIII, section 32 of the California Constitution provides: \u201cNo legal or equitable process shall issue in any proceeding in any court against this State or any officer thereof to prevent or enjoin the collection of any tax. After payment of a tax claimed to be illegal, an action may be maintained to recover the tax paid, with interest, in such manner as may be provided by the Legislature.\u201d  Citing that constitutional provision, the Board contends the court erroneously permitted a tax refund action not prescribed by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">In <em>Woosley </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 758 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 30, 838 P.2d 758], the Supreme Court stated: \u201cThe California Constitution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1203\">*1203</page-number>expressly provides that actions for tax refunds must be brought in the manner prescribed by the Legislature. Article XIII, section 32, of the California Constitution provides in this regard: \u2018After payment of a tax claimed to be illegal, an action may be maintained to recover the tax paid, with interest, <em>in such manner as may be provided by the </em>Legislature.\u2019 (Italics added.) This constitutional limitation rests on the premise that strict legislative control over the manner in which tax refunds may be sought is necessary so that governmental entities may engage in fiscal planning based on expected tax revenues. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 789; cited in <em>Rider II, supra, </em>11 Cal.App.4th at p. 1419.) In <em>Woosley, supra, </em>the Supreme Court stated article XIII, section 32 of the State Constitution \u201cprecludes this court from expanding the methods for seeking tax refunds expressly provided by the Legislature.\u201d (3 Cal.4th at p. 792.) \u201cThe lesson of <em>Woosley </em>we take to be that statutes governing administrative tax refund procedures, backed as they are by a plenary constitutional authority, are to be strictly enforced. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Farrar </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd. </em>(1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 10, 20-21 [18 Cal.Rptr .2d 611], fn. omitted.) \u201cIt is well established that the only remedy for recovering taxes asserted to have been incorrectly paid is to comply with statutory provisions for obtaining a refund. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Willbarb Petroleum Carriers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cory </em>(1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 269, 278 [256 Cal.Rptr. 51]; accord, <em>Patane </em>v. <em>Kiddoo </em>(1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 1207, 1213-1214 [214 Cal.Rptr. 9].)</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">The parties acknowledge before enactment of SB 263 refund of the Jail Tax directly to consumers was not specifically authorized by statute because the \u201ctaxpayer\u201d was the retailer and not the consumer. <em>(De Aryan </em>v. <em>Akers </em>(1939) 12 Cal.2d 781, 783 [87 P.2d 695].) Since plaintiffs were not statutory \u201ctaxpayers\u201d with access to administrative remedies, Kuykendall contends the superior court properly exercised its jurisdiction to afford the plaintiff class a remedy. Kuykendall contends her common law class action was proper under legal and equitable principles established in <em>Decorative Carpets, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Board of Equalization </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 252 [23 Cal.Rptr. 589, 373 P.2d 637], and <em>Javor </em>v. <em>State Board of Equalization </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 790 [117 Cal.Rptr. 305, 527 P.2d 1153] <em>(Javor I).</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Kuykendall asserts since the Legislature \u201cdefined away\u201d any right to seek a statutory refund, consumers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1204\">*1204</page-number>may properly maintain a common law reimbursement action based on principles of restitution and constructive trust without complying with statutory conditions, specifically section 6932\u2019s requirement of exhaustion of administrative remedies and section 6904\u2019s class administrative claim requirements. Thus, according to Kuykendall, the superior court acted within its authority and fashioned an appropriate remedy by ordering the Board to refund the Jail Tax moneys to consumers.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">The Board concedes although Kuykendall was not a taxpayer under applicable law \u201cshe had available to her the power to bring suit in a form similar to that described and suggested in <em>Javor I, Javor II,[</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em>] Decorative Carpets, </em>and <em>II </em>against the retailer/taxpayers, and thereby compel retailers to pursue administrative remedies for refund of the Jail Tax.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, the Board contends case law precludes the court from assuming jurisdiction on an equity basis to order the Board to issue tax refunds directly to consumers. The Board notes the Supreme Court in <em>Javor I </em>stated \u201cto give customers a direct cause of action against the Board for all erroneously collected sales tax reimbursements which have already been paid to the Board by the retailer would neither be consonant with existing statutory procedures nor with the import of <em>Decorative </em>Carpets.\u201d <em>(Javor I, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d at p. 800.)</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">In light of the enactment of SB 263 we need not decide the extent of common law remedies, if any, previously available to Kuykendall and the plaintiff class. \u201cIn light of the fact that the class action remedy continues to be essentially equitable in nature, and given that equity will defer to statute, the common law features of class action administration are subject to legislative displacement. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Farrar </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd., supra, </em>15 Cal.App.4th at p. 17.)

Kuykendall asserts applying SB 263 here would contravene the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers which \u201cprecludes the Legislature from establishing itself as a \u2018court of last resort\u2019 to review final court judgments on a case-by-case basis . . . (29 Cal.3d at p. 536.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Although acknowledging the Legislature may prescribe an appropriate remedy for future violations adjudicated in future cases, Kuykendall contends the Legislature may not restrict a court\u2019s power to remedy violations already found. According to Kuykendall, reading SB 263 in the manner suggested by the Board would contravene the Constitution by effectively mandating the judiciary make specific findings about the rights of the specific parties to this lawsuit.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>(County of Contra Costa </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1986) <em>111 </em>Cal.App.3d 62, 76 [222 Cal.Rptr. 750].)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Kuykendall characterizes application of SB 263 to reverse the superior court judgment here as the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of allowing the Legislature to reverse the court\u2019s entry of judgment favoring plaintiff class.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">However, Kuykendall\u2019s reliance on <em>Mandel </em>v. <em>Myers, supra, </em>29 Cal.3d 531, and <em>County of Contra Costa </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, 177 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>Cal.App.3d 62, is inapposite. For purposes of importing the separation of powers doctrine, the superior court judgment challenged here on appeal does not constitute a final judgment. \u201cCalifornia law is settled that <em>pending </em>appeal a trial court judgment is not final. . . .\u201d <em>(Sandoval </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1983) 140 Cal.App.3d 932, 936 [190 Cal.Rptr. 29], italics in original; accord, <em>Republic Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 160 Cal.App.3d 1253, 1257 [207 Cal.Rptr. 241]; <em>Hardy </em>v. <em>Western Landscape Construction </em>(1983) 141 Cal.App.3d 1015, 1016-1017 [190 Cal.Rptr. 766]; <em>American Federation of Labor </em>v. <em>Employment Dev.

[Citations.]\u201d <em>(Beckman </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 481, 489 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 60].) In sum, SB 263 enacted a comprehensive legislative scheme for distributing tax refunds where, as here, the tax has been declared to be unconstitutional and the revenues impounded. As this action brought by Kuykendall is on appeal and thus remains pending, SB 263 applies to her lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Kuykendall also meritlessly contends applying SB 263 here would effectively preclude a remedy assertedly permitted by <em>Rider II, supra, </em>11 Cal.App.4th 1410. Applying SB 263 here is not inconsistent with <em>Rider II. </em>Kuykendall mischaracterizes the import of statements in <em>Rider II </em>indicating consumers might have potential remedies through further judicial proceedings. The appellate court in <em>II </em>did not designate any specific remedy as appropriate. Indeed, the court stated: \u201cThis case does not call upon us to decide, and we do not decide, any issues relating to the refund proceedings which may be undertaken to recover any invalidly collected sales tax revenues: \u2018The well-established rule is that we should avoid advisory opinions. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citations.] In a similar vein, we decline to decide any issues relating to the ultimate \u2018redistribution\u2019 of invalidly collected supplemental sales tax revenues remaining after the above referenced refund proceedings are completed, if any: Inasmuch as we cannot be sure that there will be any such remaining funds, any decision concerning the \u2018redistribution\u2019 of such funds would be entirely speculative and conjectural.\u201d <em>(Rider II, supra, </em>11 Cal.App.4th at p. 1420.) The appellate court in <em>Rider II </em>simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1208\">*1208</page-number>made observations about its \u201cpurposefully restrained judicial response\u201d to the redistribution issue by indicating what its decision did not mean. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1421.) The court noted the fact it did not provide a direct reimbursement remedy for San Diego retail consumers did not mean those consumers were without means of seeking reimbursement of the Jail Tax revenues. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court also noted nothing in its decision \u201cshould be deemed as an expression of opinion as to the substantive merit or proper outcome\u201d of any other action. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1421, fn. 4.) Further, the court specifically stated \u201c. . . neither this court nor the trial court has unfettered discretion to \u2018fashion an equitable remedy on behalf of the retail consumers of San Diego County.\u2019 The supplemental sales tax revenues at issue in this case have already been collected and paid to the [Board] and, as noted in <em>Woosley, </em>the California Constitution places \u2018strict legislative control over the manner in which tax refunds may be sought.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1421.)</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">(c)</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Kuykendall characterizes the Legislature\u2019s enactment of SB 263 as \u201cirrelevant to this appeal.\u201d According to Kuykendall, nothing in SB 263 suggests it should be applied \u201cretroactively\u201d to superior court judgments already entered. Kuykendall contends section 7275 et seq. applies only prospectively because the Legislature did not clearly state its intent about retroactivity. <em>(Evangelatos </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 1188, 1206-1207 [246 Cal.Rptr. 629, 753 P.2d 585].) Thus, according to Kuykendall, by its express terms SB 263 provides a statutory refund remedy only for cases commenced after its adoption.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Generally \u201ca statute will not be retroactively applied unless legislative intent to the contrary is clear. [Citations.] [\u00b6] Although it is sometimes stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1209\">*1209</page-number>that such intent must be \u2018expressly declared\u2019 by the Legislature [citations], the general rule \u2018is not a strait-jacket. Where the Legislature has not set forth in so many words what it intended, the rule . . . should not be followed blindly in complete disregard of factors that may give a clue to the legislative intent. It is to be applied only after, considering all pertinent factors, it is determined that it is impossible to ascertain the legislative intent.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(City of Sausalito </em>v. <em>County of Marin </em>(1970) 12 Cal.App.3d 550, 557 [90 Cal.Rptr. 843].) \u201cThe rule that statutes are ordinarily construed to operate prospectively is based upon the presumed intent of the Legislature. [Citations.] It has no application where the Legislature manifests a contrary intent. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Caminetti </em>v. <em>Pac. Mutual L. Ins. Co. </em>(1943) 22 Cal.2d 344, 353 [139 P.2d 908].) \u201cAlthough legislative enactments are generally presumed to operate prospectively and not retroactively [citations], this presumption does not defy rebuttal. We have explicitly subordinated the presumption against the retroactive application of statutes to the transcendent canon of statutory construction that the design of the Legislature be given effect. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Bouquet </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 583, 587 [128 Cal.Rptr. 427, 546 P.2d 1371], fn. omitted.) Thus, our central inquiry is whether the Legislature intended SB 263 to operate retroactively. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">Manifestly, the Legislature enacted SB 263 as a curative statute to end any confusion about reimbursement of the Jail Tax funds.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> SB 263\u2019s language clearly and unambiguously \u201cindicates the Legislature intended a retrospective operation. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Caminetti </em>v. <em>Pac. Mutual L. Ins. Co., supra, </em>22 Cal.2d at p. 353.) Review of SB 263\u2019s legislative history also discloses a legislative intent SB 263 would apply in all cases not reduced to final judgment on the statutory effective date.

The Board contends the issue of SB 263\u2019s constitutionality was not properly before the superior court and is not ripe for appeal. Kuykendall responds the issues of SB 263\u2019s applicability and constitutionality were presented to the superior court when the Board argued the statute mooted the entry of summary judgment. We conclude the superior court effectively declined to apply SB 263 because it believed the statute to be unconstitutional.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We thus proceed to consider the issue and determine SB 263 is not unconstitutional on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">Kuykendall contends plaintiffs were unlawfully deprived of their property and SB 263 authorizes additional withholding of such property with denial of refunds to most injured consumers, to wit, those unable to prove $5,000 in purchases. Thus, according to Kuykendall, the Board\u2019s plan constitutes \u201ca continuing deprivation of property without due process of law.\u201d Kuykendall also contends SB 263\u2019s statutory scheme (e.g., \u00a7 7277, subd. (b)(3)(A))<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> denies equal protection by arbitrarily favoring the wealthy and large businesses likely to maintain actual receipts and providing minimal, if any, remedy to the lower and middle classes. Kuykendall asserts SB 263\u2019s requirement of actual receipts unjustly deprives consumers of refunds and is unlawfully discriminatory. According to Kuykendall, a sales tax rollback is an inadequate substitute for a refund with interest to every citizen who demonstrates entitlement to a refund and also violates equal protection by permitting double recovery by business and the wealthy.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Kuykendall further contends conveying refund benefits to some citizens but not others violates constitutional guarantees of equal protection.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1213\">*1213</page-number>\u201cAt the outset we must recognize that since we are dealing with a tax measure the state is to be accorded very great latitude. [Citations.] Flexibility and variety of tax schemes are appropriate [citations], and the state may permissibly distinguish in favor of a given class [citations]. Tax statutes are generally not subjected to close scrutiny, and distinctions can be justified on the basis of administrative convenience and promotion of legitimate state interests. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Haman </em>v. <em>County of Humboldt </em>(1973) 8 Cal.3d 922, 925-926 [106 Cal.Rptr. 617, 506 P.2d 993]; <em>Willbarb Petroleum Carriers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cory, supra, </em>208 Cal.App.3d at p. 277.) \u201cThe distinction between classes drawn by a tax statute \u2018must rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Haman </em>v. <em>County of Humboldt, supra, </em>at pp. 926-927.) \u201cA legislative scheme which is reasonably structured to accomplish a recognized and proper governmental objective is not rendered unreasonable or unconstitutional simply because the objective might have been achieved in some other or even more efficient manner. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Allyn </em>v. <em>Allison </em>(1973) 34 Cal.App.3d 448, 452 [110 Cal.Rptr. 77].)</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">SB 263 provides for reimbursement of the collected Jail Tax funds through a sales tax rollback (\u00a7 7276) and direct refunds for claims of $5,000 or more in documented purchases (\u00a7 <em>7277).</em><footnotemark><em>26</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The primary means of reimbursement was through the rollback. Under section 5 of SB 263, the Legislature expressly found and declared \u201cthat the system of tax credits provided by this act is adopted by the Legislature as the most efficient way to return revenues derived from the illegally collected taxes to the persons who bore the economic burden of those taxes.\u201d Such finding was well within legislative discretion. Indeed, a legislative committee analysis noted the lack of any easy or equitable way to return the Jail Tax funds: \u201cAny refund or rate reduction scheme is bound to have an element of rough justice, since an elaborately designed method to ensure that each taxpayer receives the same amount he or she paid would entail substantial administrative costs.\u201d (Sen. Com. on Rev. and Tax., Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 263, <em>supra, </em>as introduced.) Further, plaintiffs did not have any vested right to direct refunds for claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1214\">*1214</page-number>under $5,000. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Union Oil Co. </em>(1957) 48 Cal.2d 476, 481 [310 P.2d 409].)<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">In sum, any refund scheme would likely be vulnerable to criticism because of potential inequities resulting from various consumers\u2019 not retaining adequate records documenting their expenditures. Further, since a consumer with under $5,000 in purchases would be entitled to a return of less than $25, the administrative costs associated with the court-ordered scheme of direct refunds to all consumers would likely neutralize a substantial portion of the scheme\u2019s asserted benefits. Thus, given the great latitude accorded the Legislature in tax matters, we conclude the statutory $5,000 threshold requirement for refunds is not impermissible. Similarly within legislative discretion is SB 263\u2019s sales tax rollback, an equitable feature absent from the court-ordered scheme. The probable effect of the rollback will be reimbursement of most consumers who paid the unconstitutional tax. Finally, the Legislature reasonably provided for payment to San Diego\u2019s general fund of the residual funds remaining after the rollback and refunds. In contrast, implementing the superior court order directing transfer of the residue to San Diego to build justice facilities would effectively undercut the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Rider I, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th 1, which held collecting the sales tax for that precise purpose was unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Accordingly, we conclude SB 263 is not facially unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">4</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">The Agency and the Board entered into a contract for the Board to collect the Jail Tax on the Agency\u2019s behalf. The agreement provided upon entry of final judgment invalidating the tax and requiring a rebate or refund to the taxpayers, the Agency would pay the Board\u2019s costs of administering refunds and transmit to the Board the amount of any taxes and interest the Board was required to rebate or refund to taxpayers. According to the Agency, the agreement did not require it to transmit any revenues that the Board was not required to rebate or refund, to wit, the amounts for which no valid claims were filed.  Thus, the Agency contends in granting summary judgment on its cross-complaint involving its contractual agreement with the Board, the superior court properly ruled the Agency was contractually entitled to those portions of the Jail Tax revenues not subject to a valid refund claim or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1215\">*1215</page-number>payable to offset the Board\u2019s administrative expenses. Citing <em>Caminetti </em>v. <em>Pac. Mutual L. Ins. Co., supra, </em>22 Cal.2d 344, the Agency characterizes as impermissible legislative interference and an unconstitutional impairment of its assertedly vested rights under the summary judgment and its contract with the Board any attempt under SB 263 to distribute by a rollback the residue of the Jail Tax money remaining after direct refunds. (U.S. Const., art. I, \u00a7 10.)<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> However, as noted, SB 263 can properly apply here because the judgment is before us on appeal and thus not final.

Kuykendall replies the summary judgment and attendant orders replaced the preliminary injunction and rendered moot the issue of its propriety. Under the circumstances here, we need not separately discuss the propriety of the preliminary injunction.

[\u00b6] The legislation was specifically amended after this court rendered its decision on summary judgments, afterwards.\u201d The court also stated: \u201cThe bill would only allow a taxpayer to secure a refund if they [sic] can demonstrate $5,000 or more in a single purchase or several purchases put together had to be $5,000, or they could not get a refund. . . . And I happen to think it\u2019s unconstitutional to suggest that you have to have a minimum amount before you are entitled to a refund. That\u2019s number one. [\u00b6] Number two, there is the question of equality in that the people who are able to demonstrate $5,000 or more in purchases will not only get the benefit of the refund, but get the benefit of the rollback as well.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Section 7277, subdivision (b)(3)(A), provides: \u201cOnly a claim for refund made with respect to a single purchase or aggregate purchases of five thousand dollars ($5,000) or more shall be eligible for refund pursuant to this section.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b734-7\">Similarly, the Agency contends SB 263 permits an unconstitutional double recovery of tax paid in violation of equal protection guarantees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b734-8\">Kuykendall also asserts by permitting only those consumers who can document $5,000 in purchases to seek a refund of the Jail Tax money, SB 263 violates California Constitution, article XIII, section 32\u2019s mandate that an action for reimbursement \u201cmay be maintained.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b735-5\">The Legislative Counsel\u2019s Digest of SB 263, Statutes 1993, chapter 1060, stated: \u201cThis bill would require, whenever a local sales or transactions and use tax is finally determined to be invalid for failure to comply with . . . constitutional requirements, that a portion of the revenues collected under that tax be credited to taxpayers located in the jurisdiction in which that tax was imposed. . . .

Specifically, Discover asserts since the consumers were not taxpayers, the direct refunds to consumers under section 7277 constituted improper gifts of public money, violating article XVI, section 6 of the California Constitution. Citing <em>Golden Gate Bridge etc. Dist. </em>v. <em>Luehring </em>(1970) 4 Cal.App.3d 204, 214 [84 Cal.Rptr. 291], Discover also asserts the Legislature may not take money from one group of people (retailers) and pay it to another group (consumers). Discover characterizes as a facially unconstitutional taking of property SB 263\u2019s authorizing direct reimbursement of Jail Tax moneys to consumers who did not pay the tax. However, at the same time, Discover asserts we should \u201cconfirm the lower court\u2019s ruling the consumer is the taxpayer.\u201d We decline to reach Discover\u2019s contentions of constitutional violation because, as acknowledged by Discover, they were not raised in the superior court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
