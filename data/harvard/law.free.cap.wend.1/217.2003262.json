Nathan Williams, one of the circuit judges.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b217-5\">The declaration, after stating the making of a certain promissory note by the defendant, proceeded as follows: \u201cAnd then and there delivered the said note to the said plaintiffs, by which said note the said defendant promised to pay, four months after the date thereof, to the order of the said plaintiffs, at the Mohawk Bank, $179 13, for value received.\u201d The note produced and proved on the trial, was payable to the order of <em>Wardell, Van Bur\u00e9n Co. </em>and the plaintiffs proved that they composed a firm, and transacted business as grocers under that name. The defendant objected that there was a variance between the note produced and that described in the declaration. A verdict was taken for the plaintiffs, subject to the opinion of this court The case was submitted 09 written arguments,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b217-6\">P. <em>Be Witt, </em>for plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AoC\">The note is set out in the declaration according to its legal effect. It is declared on, as payable to the plaintiffs, and the plaintiffs are proved to be known by the name of the payees of the <em>note; </em>there is therefore no mis-description. In an action by a plaintiff of the name of <em>Willis, </em>as the payee of a promissory note, when the note produced was payable to <em>Willison, </em>evidence was received that the plaintiff was intended. (2 <em>Starkie, </em>29. 3 <em>Campb. </em>29.) In an action on a promissory note against <em>Christopher </em>B., a note signed with the abbreviation of <em>Christ. </em>B. was admitted in evidence, on proof that such was the usual and ordinary way in which the defendant signed his name. It was not shewn that there were any other persons than the plaintiffs, who were known by the name mentioned in the note; not a shade of doubt was raised as to their right to recover, under the note.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>\u2022TV*. <em>S. Benton, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXVS\">The declaration commencing in the name of Owen Wardell, Samuel Van Bur\u00e9n and Charles Wardell, and averring that by the note set forth the defendant promised to pay to the older of <em>the said plaintiffs, </em>virtually alleged that the note in its terms was payable to the order of Owen Wardell, Samuel Van Buren and Charles Wardell. It is not averred that the note was made payable to the order of the plaintiffs, in the name of their firm, nor that they were partners and transacted business under such name : there was therefore a fatal variance between the note described and that produced. (1 <em>Chitty's Pl. </em>307. 4 T. <em>R. </em>611. 3 <em>Bos. &amp; Pul. 562. </em>4 <em>T. R. </em>314. 8 <em>Johns. R. </em>256. 7 <em>Johns. R. 468.) </em>In the declaration, it should have been averred that the plaintiffs were partners, doing business under a particular name and firm. (1 <em>Caines, </em>192.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b218-4\">\n<em>By the Court,</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"A9W7\">Savage, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQud\">The declaration contained a count on a note, payable <em>to the order of the plaintiffs. </em>The note produced was payable <em>to the order of Wardell, Van Bur\u00e9n Co. </em>This was objected to on the ground of variance, but received subject to the opinion of this court. It was proved that the plaintiffs were partners, doing business as merchants under the firm of <em>Wardell, Van Buren </em>&amp; <em>Co. </em>Had the declaration stated the note as given to the plaintiffs, by the name, style and description of Wardell, Van Bur\u00e9n &amp; Co., there would have been no ground of objection. (3 <em>Caines, </em>170.) There was, surely, no variance: the plaintiffs were shewn to be known by the description of the payees in the note, and I can see no objection to such testimony. In <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Bulkley, </em>(13 <em>Johns. R. </em>486,) a note signed <em>Christ. </em>Bulkley, was held to prove an averment of a note made by <em>Christopher </em>Bulkley, it being proved that the defendant usually abbreviated his name in that manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">This case does not come within the principle of the case of the <em>Manhattan Company </em>v. <em>Ledyard, </em>(1 <em>Caines, </em>192.) When an <em>act </em>is done by one of a firm, in the name of the firm, then it is proper to aver the partnership; and evidence that one of the firm made an instrument, using the partnership name, Is sufficient to support an averment that the firm made the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>instrument. When, therefore, a note is made payable to a firm, evidence that the plaintiffs compose the firm to whom the note is made, is sufficient to rebut any objection of a variance arising from the fact that it is not made payable to the plaintiffs by their individual names.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">Judgment for plaintiffs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
