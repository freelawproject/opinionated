The declaration in ejectment in this cause was served on the tenant, who is the step-father of the infants, who claim title to the premises in question, and reside with the tenant on the same. The father of the infants held the premises under a contract of purchase, and since his decease, the title has been conveyed to them by the vendor. The lessor of the plaintiff claims the premises by virtue of a purchase at sheriff\u2019s sale, under an execution on a judgment in his favor, against the tenant and his wife, for a debt of the wife whilst sole. The tenant and his wife have been in possession for a number of years, exercising acts of ownership. The lessor alleges the title of the infants to be fraudulent.
