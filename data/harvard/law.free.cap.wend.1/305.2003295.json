The defendant was arrested on a capias containing an <em>ac etiam </em>clause in <em>trespass, </em>for entering the close of plaintiff and debauching his daughter. The defendant filed special bail, and the plaintiff declared against him in case, and not receiving a plea, entered the defendant\u2019s default, and gave notice of executing a writ of inquiry. <em>A </em>motion was made to set aside the rule to plead, and all subsequent proceedings for irregularity.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b305-6\"><em>H.

R. </em>484, set aside the proceedings as irregular. It is said this is not conformable to the English cases; that the only effect of such variance, according to those cases, is to discharge the bail, whether the proceeding be by bill or original. Without deciding this question, it is enough that this court has a right to regulate its own practice ; and this precise question having been decided in the case alluded to, the court will not depart from the decision there made, The motion is granted with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
