Bar Counsel alleged that Respondent violated Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMRPC\u201d), 8.1(a) (Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 8.4(a), (c) and (d) (Misconduct).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>In accordance with Maryland Rules 16-752(a) and 16-757(c),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we referred the petition to Judge Dana M. Levitz of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County for an evidentiary hearing and to make findings of fact and conclusions of law. Judge Levitz held a hearing on June 27, 2007, and issued Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law on August 7, 2007, in which he concluded by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent had violated Rule 8.4(c) by executing an authorization to transfer the ownership of a Washington Mutual Investors Fund account owed by Respondent and his former wife as tenants by the entireties prior to their divorce, based upon Respondent\u2019s representation that he was entitled to sole possession. Judge Levitz did not conclude that there were violations of Rules 8.1(a) or 8.4(c) with respect to Respondent\u2019s explanation to Bar Counsel that he titled the Fund in his ow name to hold the account in a \u201cself imposed trust,\u201d nor of Rule 8.4(a) or (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">\n<em>FINDINGS OF FACT</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AA8\">\n<em>I. Undisputed Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">\u201cPursuant to Rule \u00a7 16-757(c), this Court finds the following facts, which are undisputed, by clear and convincing evidence:</p>\n<p id=\"AKK\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>1. Respondent Alan Edgar Harris has been a member of the Maryland Bar since I960.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">2. Mr. Harris was suspended from the practice of law in 2002, and has not been reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">3. Mr. Harris was married to Frances M. Harris until they were divorced sometime in 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">4. The divorce was filed in Baltimore City and as a result Ms. Harris received the marital home, located at 1 Charles Ridge Garth in Towson; she also retained a mutual fund, unbeknownst to Mr. Harris, named \u201cWashington Mutual Investors Fund-Class A\u201d (\u201cthe Fund\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">5. The Fund was owned by both Mr. and Ms. Harris as tenants by the entireties until, as a result of the divorce, their respective interests were automatically changed to tenancies in common by operation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">6. Carroll Klingelhofer, III, esq., was retained by Ms. Harris in 1988 to prepare a will for herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">7. Ms. Harris resided at 1 Charles Ridge Garth until her death on June 3, 2005; her will was found soon after her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">8. In the subsequent probate proceeding, Mr. Klingelhofer represented the estate and Meryk Jankowski was named personal representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-12\">9. Mr. Harris had been given the original will by the person who found it, and he in turn gave the will to Mr. Klingelhofer.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-13\">10. During the course of investigating the nature and extent of Ms. Harris\u2019 assets, Mr. Klingelhofer discovered a quarterly statement from the Fund, which listed the owners of the Fund, Mr. and Ms. Harris, as tenants by the entire-ties, and had a value of approximately $97,514.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-14\">11. Mr. Klingelhofer sent Mr. Harris a letter dated July 21, 2005, which informed Mr. Harris that the Fund was, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>operation of law, now held by Mr. Harris and Ms. Harris as tenants in common (Exhibit # 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">12. Mr. Harris, in the middle of August, 2005, executed a transfer authorization/stock assignment that had the effect of changing the title of the Fund from being held by Alan E. Harris and Frances Harris as tenants by the entireties to sole ownership in the name of Alan E. Harris (Exhibit # 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">13. On or about August 16, 2005, Mr. Klingelhofer discovered that Mr. Harris had initiated the transfer that gave Mr. Harris sole ownership of the Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">14. On or about September 28, 2005, at Mr. Klingelhofer\u2019s suggestion, American Funds froze the account that held the Fund, pending a determination of ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">15. In March of 2007, the estate of Ms. Harris received one half of the Fund from Mr. Harris.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">16. From the time Mr. Harris indirectly transferred ownership of the Fund to himself, in August of 2005 to March of 2007, Mr. Harris never depleted the Fund and any dividends earned were reinvested into the Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">17. Mr. Harris cited concern regarding income taxes assessed against the Fund as the reason for making the transfer. He also expressed the view that he did not trust Mr. Klingelhofer and was suspicious of his motivation for asking questions about this asset and his divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">18. Mr. Harris misled Mr. Klingelhofer by saying that he would check the ownership status of the Fund by reviewing divorce papers from 1985; instead of reviewing divorce files, Mr. Harris used this opportunity to cause the transfer of the Fund to himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">II. Disputed Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b181-12\">Although the following facts are disputed, this Court has heard evidence from both parties and finds these facts, pursuant to Rule \u00a7 16-757(c), by clear and convincing evidence:</p>\n<p id=\"b181-13\">19. Mr. Harris knew, when he took possession of the entire Fund, that he did not have the right to transfer the Fund to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>himself. Mr. Harris testified that when he received the letter dated July 21, 2005, he did not know what tenancy in common was. He claims that when he transferred the Fund into his name in the middle of August, 2005, he thought that he was entitled to ownership of the Fund as a result of the death of Ms. Harris. This Court finds Mr. Harris\u2019 testimony regarding his lack of legal knowledge to be unconvincing. Mr. Harris knew that the Fund\u2019s ownership had been converted to tenancy in common. In the letter Mr. Klingelhofer implied that Mr. Harris does not have the sole proprietary right to the Fund if Mr. Harris and Ms. Harris owned the Fund as tenants in common <em>{See </em>exhibit # 1). Having been an attorney for more than 40 years, it is more than likely that Mr. Harris had a basic knowledge of property law when he transferred the Fund to himself. A first year law student is taught that tenants in common do not have the right of survivorship; when one tenant in common dies, her interest in the property goes to her estate, not to the other tenant in common. Mr. Harris knew what his interest in the Fund was, and if he had forgotten, the July 21 letter put him on notice that he did not own 100% of the Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">20. Mr. Harris had no reasonable basis for the belief that Mr. Klingelhofer was trying to defraud him with regard to the Fund. Mr. Harris, in a rambling quasi-monologue, testified that he believed that Mr. Klingelhofer was trying to hide the Fund from him. At the hearing Mr. Harris contended that this alleged fraud was the reason that he transferred the Fund to himself. Mr. Harris testified that he believed that he would have waived a claim for fraud against the estate if he did not take possession of the Fund. Mr. Harris argued that he was simply putting the Fund in a \u201ctrust\u201d pending future litigation against the estate. This Court finds these contentions to be unconvincing. Mr. Harris, who practiced law for 40 years, could not have believed that a claim for fraud against Ms. Harris\u2019 estate would be waived if he did not take full possession of the Fund. Even if Mr. Harris did actually believe in this Ma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>ehiavellian rule of waiver, no reasonable attorney would believe it. Thus, Mr. Harris\u2019 fear of waiving a fraud claim is not a reasonable excuse for transferring the Fund to himself when he knew he was only entitled to half of its value.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">21. Mr. Harris did not intend to defraud the estate of Ms. Harris when he transferred the Fund to himself. The Attorney Grievance Commission alleges that Mr. Harris sought to keep and use the value of the Fund for himself when he took possession of 100% of the Fund. The Commission did not present evidence that would support this inference, however. Mr. Harris claims that he was concerned about his own tax liability concerning the Fund. Mr. Klingelhofer, the Commission\u2019s only witness, conceded that the value of the Fund was not depleted when it was in Mr. Harris\u2019 possession. Furthermore, Mr. Klingelhofer testified that all the dividends from the Fund were reinvested during Mr. Harris\u2019 possession of the Fund. Mr. Harris\u2019 actions during the time period that he held the Fund, <em>ie. </em>August of 2005 to March of 2007, do not suggest that he wanted to convert the money to his own use. Mr. Harris never <em>used </em>the value of the Fund at all: not as collateral, cash, or otherwise. Mr. Harris simply wanted to <em>control </em>the Fund, so that he would not be personally liable for anything the estate of Ms. Harris did, or did not do, regarding the Fund. In March of 2007, the estate of Ms. Harris received every penny that it was entitled to from the Fund. The fact that American Funds froze the account, does not help to prove that Mr. Harris had the intent to convert the Fund to his own use or otherwise defraud the Estate of Ms. Harris.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">22. Mr. Klingelhofer acted ethically at all times in this matter. Mr. Harris has made many and varied allegations of fraud and misconduct against Mr. Klingelhofer. Mr. Harris never presented any support for these allegations besides his own testimony. Mr. Harris\u2019 testimony regarding Mr. Klingelhofer\u2019s motives regarding the Fund was implausible, to say the least. Mr. Klingelhofer acted as any reasonable estate attorney would when he inquired about Mr. Harris\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>divorce. An attorney representing an estate in this situation has a duty to find out who is entitled to any significant financial asset owned by the decedent. Mr. Klingelhofer had a duty to discover who had what ownership interest in the Fund; asking Mr. Harris about his divorce settlement was the most logical way to achieve this end.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">\n<em>CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">There is no doubt that Mr. Harris violated Rule 8.4(c) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> when he executed the transfer order that gave him sole ownership of the Fund. Mr. Harris knew that he was not entitled to 100% of the Fund, yet he still requested the transfer. The requested transfer was a misrepresentation of the ownership of the Fund to American Funds, whose employees did not know that the ownership of the Fund had been converted to tenancy in common by Mr. and Ms. Harris\u2019 divorce. Mr. Harris indirectly represented, by making it look like he was entitled to sole possession of the Fund, that he and Ms. Harris were still married. He allowed American Funds employees to believe that he and Ms. Harris still owned the Fund as tenants by the entireties, and so he could take full possession of the Fund when Ms. Harris died. An honest attorney would not have allowed this misconception to remain uncorrected. Mr. Harris argues that he never directly stated that he and Ms. Harris were still married when he requested the transfer. Nevertheless, any competent attorney would know that that was what was implied. Thus, Mr. Harris violated Rule 8.4(c) when he requested the August 2005 transfer of the Fund to himself.</p>\n<p id=\"Ah3\">Mr. Harris did not violate Rule 8.4(d),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> however, by his actions regarding the Fund. Misconduct that is so extreme that it inherently harms the administration of justice is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>considered prejudicial to the administration of justice. <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Link, </em>380 Md. 405, 429, 844 A.2d 1197 (2004). Mr. Harris\u2019 misconduct does not rise to this standard. Mr. Harris certainly did not show good faith, and was certainly dishonest, when he caused the Fund to be transferred to himself. The type of dishonesty that was present in this case does not necessarily prejudice the administration of justice. Here, Mr. Harris was dishonest, but his conduct did not prejudice the administration of justice. While it is troubling that Mr. Harris would mislead another member of the Bar, this conduct was not while acting as an attorney. Mr. Harris\u2019 actions and omissions occurred in his capacity as the ex-husband of Ms. Harris, not as an attorney representing one of the parties. While this does not excuse his misconduct under the Maryland Rules of Professional Responsibility, it is a mitigating factor. Mr. Harris did not damage the legal process in a significant way by initiating the transfer of the Fund to himself. The estate of Ms. Harris got the value of half of the Fund in the end, just as it was entitled to.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">(emphasis in original)</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">In proceedings involving attorney discipline, this Court has original and complete jurisdiction and conducts an independent review of the record. <em>Attorney Grievance v. Webster, </em>402 Md. 448, 459, 937 A.2d 161, 167 (2007); <em>Attorney Grievance v. Nussbaum, </em>401 Md. 612, 632, 934 A.2d 1, 12 (2007); <em>Attorney Grievance v.

In our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>review of the record, the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact generally will be accepted unless they are clearly erroneous. Maryland Rule 16-759(b)(2);<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Webster, </em>402 Md. at 459-60, 937 A.2d at 167-68; <em>Nussbaum, </em>401 Md. at 632, 934 A.2d at 12; <em>Lawson, </em>401 Md. at 572, 933 A.2d at 863; <em>Attorney Grievance v.

Potter, </em>380 Md. 128, 151, 844 A.2d 367, 380-381 (2004). As to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law, such as whether provisions of the MRPC were violated, our consideration is essentially <em>de novo. </em>Maryland Rule 16\u2014759(b)(1);<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Webster, </em>402 Md. at 460, 937 A.2d at 168; <em>Nussbaum, </em>401 Md. at 632, 934 A.2d at 13; <em>Lawson, </em>401 Md. at 572, 933 A.2d at 863; <em>Attorney Grievance v.

Petitioner also took exception to some of the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>A. <em>Respondent\u2019s Exceptions to Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">1. <em>Exceptions to Findings of Fact</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">We have reviewed the record and conclude that Judge Levitz\u2019s findings of fact are supported by clear and convincing evidence, even though Respondent takes exception to most of the judge\u2019s factual findings, each of which we will address and overrule.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-6\"><em>Exception </em># 1: Respondent excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that he was suspended from the practice of law in 2002 and has not been reinstated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Respondent argues that this finding was unnecessary, as it was immaterial and irrelevant to any alleged violation of the MRPC. The issue of this finding\u2019s relevancy is dictated by Rule 16-757(c), which states that the hearing judge \u201cshall prepare and file or dictate into the record a statement of the judge\u2019s findings of fact, including findings as to any evidence regarding remedial action, and conclusions of law.\u201d It is clear that findings regarding Respondent\u2019s status as an attorney are relevant and material to any \u201cremedial action.\u201d Respondent admitted, when he testified, that he has been suspended from the practice of law since 2002. We, therefore, conclude that the hearing judge\u2019s factual findings are supported by clear and convincing evidence and overrule this exception.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-8\"><em>Exception </em># 2: Respondent excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that the Fund was held by both Respondent and his ex-wife as tenants by the entireties until, as a result of their divorce, their respective interests were automatically changed to tenancies in common.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">Respondent argues that this finding is not supported by clear and convincing evidence because \u201c[s]ome of the parties or witnesses below may have considered that the Fund was not held by the entireties, but as a joint asset.\u201d Regardless, the hearing judge\u2019s finding is an accurate expression of the applicable legal principle to the facts of this case. It is well settled that an asset owned as a tenancy by the entirety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>between a husband and wife becomes a tenancy in common in the event of divorce. <em>McCally v. McCally, </em>250 Md. 541, 542, 243 A.2d 538, 539 (1968); <em>Tucker v. Dudley, </em>223 Md. 467, 469, 164 A.2d 891, 893 (1960); <em>Keen v. Keen, </em>191 Md. 31, 37, 60 A.2d 200, 204 (1948). We, therefore, conclude that the hearing judge\u2019s factual findings are supported by clear and convincing evidence and overrule this exception.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-4\"><em>Exception </em>#3: Respondent excepts to the finding that \u201cDuring the course of investigating the nature and extent of Ms. Harris\u2019 assets, Mr. Klingelhofer discovered a quarterly statement from the Fund, which listed the owners of the Fund, Mr. and Ms. Harris, as tenants by the entire-ties and had a value of approximately $97,514.00.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Respondent argues that Mr. Klingelhofer did not \u201cdiscover\u201d the Fund\u2019s quarterly statement because Mr. Jankowski delivered the statement to him, and that Mr. Klingelhofer had knowledge of the Fund prior to Ms. Harris\u2019 death. Respondent bases his argument on his belief that both Ms. Harris and Mr. Klingelhofer had planned to prevent Respondent from acquiring any part of the Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Consistent with the standard of review for factual findings in attorney discipline cases, we have iterated that the judge \u201cmay elect to pick and choose which evidence to rely upon.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v. Harris, </em>371 Md. 510, 543, 810 A.2d 457, 477 (2002); <em>Attorney Grievance v. Garfield, </em>369 Md. 85, 99, 797 A.2d 757, 765 (2002); <em>Attorney Grievance v. Hines, </em>366 Md. 277, 291, 783 A.2d 656, 664 (2001); <em>Attorney Grievance v. Sheridan, </em>357 Md. 1, 17, 741 A.2d 1143, 1152 (1999). With respect to this exception, Judge Levitz did just that. Although Respondent testified to his belief that Mr. Klingelhofer had knowledge of the Fund before his ex-wife\u2019s death, Mr. Klingelhofer testified to the contrary, stating that he had \u201cabsolutely no knowledge whatsoever about the existence of this particular account in any way, shape or form until Mr. Jankowski handed me that piece of paper mid to late June of 2005.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Moreover, if Respondent is challenging the hearing judge\u2019s choice of the word \u201cdiscovered,\u201d his argument is misplaced. Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 357 (11th ed.2005) defines discover as \u201cto obtain sight or knowledge of for the first time.\u201d From Mr. Klingelhofer\u2019s testimony, it is evident that he found out about the Fund\u2019s quarterly statement for the first time during his investigation of Ms. Harris\u2019 assets after her death. We have reviewed the record and conclude that the hearing judge\u2019s factual findings are supported by clear and convincing evidence and overrule this exception.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AT7\"><em>Exception # 4: </em>Respondent excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s findings in paragraphs 11, 12, 13 and 14 \u201cto the extent, if at all, that the content of those paragraphs, collectively or separately, had any binding legal effect on the manner in which the Fund was registered with American Funds, or were held, or were owned.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-5\"><em>Exception </em># 5: Respondent excepts to the finding in paragraph 16 that he \u201cindirectly transferred ownership of the Fund to himself\u2019 when he submitted the transfer authorization form to American Funds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-6\"><em>Exception </em># 9: Respondent excepts to the finding in paragraph 21 that he \u201ctransferred the Fund to himself\u2019 when he submitted the transfer authorization form to American Funds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">In order to clarify Respondent\u2019s exceptions, it is necessary to reconcile what was actually said in the findings of fact. In paragraph 11, Judge Levitz found that Mr. Klingelhofer sent Respondent a letter dated July 21, 2005, which informed him that the Fund was, by operation of law, held by him and his ex-wife as tenants in common. In paragraph 12, Judge Levitz found that Respondent, in the middle of August 2005, executed a transfer authorization that had the effect of changing the title of the Fund from being held by Respondent and his ex-wife to sole ownership in the name of Respondent. In paragraph 13, Judge Levitz found that on or about August 16, 2005, Mr. Klingelhofer discovered that Respondent had initiated the transfer that gave him sole ownership of the Fund. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>paragraph 14, Judge Levitz found that on or about September 28, 2005, at Mr. Klingelhofer\u2019s suggestion, American Funds froze the account that held the Fund pending a determination of ownership. In paragraph 16, Judge Levitz found that from the time Respondent transferred ownership of the Fund to himself, until March 2007 when the Estate of Ms. Harris received its share of the Fund, Respondent did not deplete the account and any dividends earned were reinvested into the Fund. In paragraph 21, Judge Levitz found that Respondent did not intend to defraud the Estate of Ms. Harris when he transferred the Fund to himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">In Respondent\u2019s exceptions, he argues that these factual findings were incorrect because \u201che did not transfer the Fund to himself, but only applied for its transfer, which was under the control of\u2014and was accomplished by\u2014American Funds____\u201d Therefore, Respondent asserts, his actions did not have any binding legal effect on the manner in which the Fund was titled. However, the Fund was owned by both Respondent and his ex-wife as tenants by the entireties until, as a result of their divorce, their respective interests were automatically changed to tenancies in common. Then, in August 2005, Respondent submitted and executed a transfer authorization form that prompted his gaining sole ownership of the Fund. The intent of Respondent\u2019s execution and submission of the authorization to American Funds was to induce American Funds to transfer the Fund to him; Respondent would have us \u201cparse\u201d the language of the trial court, which we decline to do. We, therefore, conclude that the hearing judge\u2019s factual findings are supported by clear and convincing evidence and overrule these exceptions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-7\"><em>Exception </em># 6: Respondent excepts to the finding that \u201cMr. Harris misled Mr. Klingelhofer that he would check the ownership of the Fund by reviewing divorce papers from 1985; instead of reviewing divorce files, Mr. Harris used the opportunity to cause the transfer of the Fund to himself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>Respondent argues that he did not mislead Mr. Klingelhofer because he only told him that he would locate, review and make copies of the divorce file, and that he did not use the opportunity to cause the transfer of the Fund to himself. However, Mr. Klingelhofer\u2019s unrefuted testimony was that when Respondent contacted him in July 2005, Respondent told him that he would find the divorce file and check to determine whether the Fund was referenced in the settlement agreement or other stipulation. Instead of reviewing the agreement and getting in touch with Mr. Klingelhofer, Respondent contacted American Funds and induced the transfer of the Fund to himself. The hearing judge\u2019s factual findings are supported by clear and convincing evidence, and we overrule this exception.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-4\"><em>Exception </em># 7: Respondent excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that Respondent knew what his interest in the Fund was, and that if he had forgotten, the July 21, 2005, letter put him on notice that he did not own 100% of the Fund.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Respondent argues that these findings are not supported by clear and convincing evidence because he believed the account was a \u201cjoint account.\u201d Nevertheless, Respondent testified that at the relevant time, i.e. when he executed the transfer in August 2005, he had been told that the account was held by himself and Ms. Harris as tenants in common after their divorce. After being notified of the Fund, Respondent testified that he sought the services of his broker, telling him that \u201cI have this American Funds. And I\u2019d like it to be transferred over to my sole account.\u201d Respondent testified, however, that his broker told him he could not do that \u201cbecause it\u2019s a tenancy in common. And I said, tenancy in common? At that time I was told by the broker it was a tenancy in common.\u201d Therefore, Respondent \u201cadmitted] it was tenancy in common.\u201d We conclude that the hearing judge\u2019s factual findings are supported by clear and convincing evidence and overrule this exception.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number><em>Exception </em># 8: Respondent excepts to the finding that he had no reasonable basis for the belief that Mr. Klingelhofer was trying to defraud him with regard to the Fund.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-4\"><em>Exception </em># 10: Respondent excepts to the finding Mr. Klingelhofer acted ethically and reasonably in this matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Respondent argues that the record supports his contention that Mr. Klingelhofer had knowledge of the Fund before Ms. Harris\u2019 death and was involved in some sort of fraud to prevent Respondent from receiving his portion of the Fund. Mr. Klingelhofer, however, testified that he did not have any knowledge of the Fund until Mr. Jankowski brought it to his attention in June 2005 after Ms. Harris had died. There is no evidence, other than Respondent\u2019s own unsubstantiated allegations, that Mr. Klingelhofer had information about the Fund\u2019s existence prior to his ex-wife\u2019s death. Moreover, the record indicates that Mr. Klingelhofer acted as any reasonable attorney would when tasked with the administration of an estate. After being informed of Ms. Harris\u2019 death, Mr. Klingelhofer, who testified that he has practiced estate and trusts law for thirty five years, sought to determine what assets Ms. Harris owned at the time of her death. That inquiry precipitated his discussion with Respondent about his divorce from Ms. Harris and what property disposition resulted. Mr. Klingelhofer\u2019s queries of Respondent were entirely justified, logical, and reasonable. We conclude that the hearing judge\u2019s factual findings are supported by clear and convincing evidence and overrule these exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">2. <em>Exception to Conclusions of Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">Respondent took exception to Judge Levitz\u2019s conclusion of law that he violated Rule 8.4(c) when he executed the transfer order that gave him sole ownership of the Fund because Respondent knew that he was not entitled to 100% of the Fund, yet he still requested the transfer. We overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">Recently, in <em>Attorney Grievance v. Floyd, </em>400 Md. 286, 929 A.2d 61 (2007), we concluded that Floyd violated Rule 8.4(c) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>when she concealed the nature of her relationship with another attorney in order to obtain a higher starting salary with the Federal Trade Commission. We determined that although Floyd did not explicitly misstate any fact, she concealed a material fact, which was dishonest and deceitful in violation of Rule 8.4(c). <em>See also Attorney Grievance v. Sweitzer, </em>395 Md. 586, 911 A.2d 440 (2006) (attorney violated Rule 8.4(c) by attempting to transfer title of a vehicle purchased at a public auction by means of a fraudulent gift certification form); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Haupt, </em>285 Md. 39, 399 A.2d 1350 (1979) (per curiam) (attorney violated Disciplinary Rule 1-102 of the Code of Professional Responsibility, which prohibits a lawyer from \u201cengaging] in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation,\u201d by failing to inform a courthouse employee that the individual accompanying him to visit with the defendant in lock-up was the defendant\u2019s fiancee, rather than his secretary).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">In this case, although Respondent did not expressly make any false statement to American Funds, i.e. he never explicated that he and Ms. Harris were still married, he concealed the fact that he was no longer married to her. Accordingly, we conclude that Respondent violated Rule 8.4(c) and overrule Respondent\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">B. <em>Petitioner\u2019s Exceptions to Conclusions of Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Bar Counsel does not except to Judge Levitz\u2019s conclusion that Respondent did not violate Rule 8.4(a) or (d). Petitioner does except to Judge Levitz\u2019s failure to find that Rules 8.1(a) and 8.4(c) were violated by Respondent\u2019s false explanation to Bar Counsel that he titled the Fund, ostensibly held by Respondent and Ms. Harris as tenants in common, in his own name in order to hold the account in a \u201cself imposed trust.\u201d Respondent contends, conversely, that any misconduct in violation of Rules 8.1(a) and 8.4(c) is not supported by the record because Respondent held the Fund in trust and did not remove any money from the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Rule 8.1 (a) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>An applicant for admission or reinstatement to the bar, or a lawyer in connection with a bar admission application or in connection with a disciplinary matter, shall not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-5\">(a) knowingly make a false statement of material fact----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-6\">Rule 8.4, section (c) states in relevant part that [i]t is professional misconduct for a lawyer to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-7\">(c) engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">We have said that Rules 8.1(a) and 8.4(c) are violated when an attorney acts dishonestly and deceitfully by knowingly making false statements to Bar Counsel. In <em>Attorney Grievance v. Lee, </em>393 Md. 385, 903 A.2d 360 (2006), the attorney intentionally misled the investigator for Bar Counsel by stating that the reason for the delay in a client\u2019s case was due to unavailable, and then late delivery of, transcripts. In fact, the hearing judge found that the inactivity was because of Lee\u2019s failure to review the case materials for two years and his failure to manage his case load. We concluded that respondent violated Rules 8.1(a) and 8.4(c):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-9\">Respondent\u2019s letter to the Commission offers several possible reasons/representations for the lack of activity in the case: unavailable transcripts; the Complainant \u201ceventually\u201d delivering a box of transcripts (the letter is unclear as to whether the box the Complainant delivered contained the \u201cunavailable transcripts\u201d) and case materials to Respondent that, the hearing judge found, Respondent did not review until January 2003; the voluminous nature of the case materials; and Respondent\u2019s paralegal\u2019s absence from September 2002 up to the 9 January 2003 meeting. As revealed by the hearing judge\u2019s previously sustained findings, the true reason for inactivity in the case was Respondent\u2019s failure personally to review the case materials for two years and his failure to manage his case workload in a manner that would allow for the timely research, review, evaluation, and pursuit of the matters for which he was retained-not any unavailable transcript or \u201cvoluminous\u201d box of case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>materials. Moreover, Respondent intentionally misrepresented the time period when the Complainant delivered the single box of transcripts and case materials because he acknowledged receipt of the materials from the Complainant in April 2001 in a letter dated 4 May 2001. We therefore conclude that Respondent violated MRPC 8.1(a) and 8.4(c) by misrepresenting his reasons for inactivity in Mr. Smith\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 412-13, 903 A.2d at 376-77 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">In <em>Attorney Grievance v. Sutton, </em>394 Md. 311, 906 A.2d 335 (2006), the attorney failed to properly file a complaint and affidavit to foreclose the right of redemption on a property. Sutton, however, misrepresented to Bar Counsel investigators that he had filed the necessary paperwork with the court and that the delay in processing was the court\u2019s fault. We concluded that these misrepresentations violated Rules 8.1(a) and 8.4(c). <em>Id. </em>at 325, 906 A.2d at 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Here, Respondent told Bar Counsel that he titled the Fund in his own name to hold the account in a \u201cself imposed trust.\u201d Respondent\u2019s February 6, 2006, letter to Bar Counsel in response to the letter advising him of the complaint, admitted as Bar Counsel\u2019s Exhibit # 5, iterated that the purpose of the transfer \u201cwas to hold the shares of the fund in my name in a self imposed trust on behalf of the Internal Revenue Service, myself and the estate of Frances M. Harris until I could be assured that the U.S. Government\u2019s taxes, penalties and interest were not going to be assessed against me.\u201d We agree with Judge Levitz that the Respondent\u2019s assertion regarding a self-imposed trust is \u201cunconvincing,\u201d and thereby, sustain Bar Counsel\u2019s exception and conclude that Respondent violated Rules 8.1(a) and 8.4(c) when he acted dishonestly and deceitfully by knowingly misrepresenting to Bar Counsel that he titled the Fund in his own name to hold the Fund in a \u201cself imposed trust.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">\n<em>SANCTION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Respondent violated Rule 8.4(c) when he executed the transfer authorization that gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>him sole ownership of the Fund because he misrepresented to American Funds that he was entitled to sole possession of the Fund, and also violated Rules 8.1(a) and 8.4(c) when he acted dishonestly and deceitfully by knowingly misrepresenting to Bar Counsel that he titled the Fund in his own name to hold it in a \u201cself imposed trust.\u201d Petitioner has recommended a sanction of disbarment. Respondent suggests that this disciplinary action should be dismissed and no sanction imposed, or at a minimum that a reprimand is appropriate, because he posits that \u201cthe issues involved are in substantial part attributable to acts or omissions regarding the Fund on the part of a person or persons other than him and which had consequences detrimental to him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">The appropriate sanction for a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct generally \u201cdepends on the facts and circumstances of each case, including consideration of any mitigating factors,\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

In this case, factors (a), (b), (d), (f), (g) and (i) are implicated. Respondent has substantial experience in the practice of law, as he has been practicing law since 1960. Additionally, Respondent has not acknowledged the wrongful nature of his misconduct, which is of the most serious nature because it involves dishonesty. Rather, Respondent still contends that his actions were attributable to the acts or omissions of Ms. Harris and Mr. Klingelhofer.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">Most imperative in this case, however, is factor (a). Respondent has an inauspicious history of prior disciplinary offenses, with five previous sanctions imposed by this Court. In 2002, <em>Harris, </em>371 Md. at 510, 810 A.2d at 457, Respondent was indefinitely suspended for violating Rules 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 3.2 and 8.4(a) and (d) by failing to serve all of the defendants in a case, failing to file a case within the statute of limitations, failing to keep clients reasonably informed of the status of their cases, failing to explain to a client what would occur if he was unable to effectuate service of process, failing to appear at scheduled court proceedings, charging an unreasonable fee in a case, purchasing a client\u2019s house at a foreclosure sale, as well as representing that client, who was his tenant, without obtaining written consent, and filing suit against the same client to recover unpaid rent. In 2001, <em>Attorney Grievance v. Harris, </em>366 Md. 376, 784 A.2d 516 (2001), Respondent was suspended six months for violating Rules 1.1,1.3,1.4,1.16(a), 3.2 and 8.4(d) by failing to appear at scheduled court proceedings, failing to serve a defendant in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>case, failing to withdraw from representation while he was attending to family problems, failing to keep clients reasonably informed of the status of their cases, and failing to act diligently by filing a complaint promptly. In 1999, <em>Attorney Grievance v. Harris, </em>354 Md. 368, 731 A.2d 459 (1999), Respondent was reprimanded by consent of this Court for violating Rules 1.3 and 1.4 by failing to file suit on behalf of his client within the statute of limitations. In 1996, in an unreported disposition, Respondent was reprimanded for neglect of a client\u2019s legal matter and failure to communicate with a client. Finally, in 1987, <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Harris, </em>310 Md. 197, 528 A.2d 895 (1987), Respondent was suspended for six months for various disciplinary violations including neglecting a legal matter, failing to represent his client zealously, and providing financial assistance to a client not advanced in connection with contemplated or pending litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">We also, however, consider mitigating factors, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\">absence of a prior disciplinary record; absence of a dishonest or selfish motive; personal or emotional problems; timely good faith efforts to make restitution or to rectify consequences of misconduct; full and free disclosure to disciplinary board or cooperative attitude toward proceedings; inexperience in the practice of law; character or reputation; physical or mental disability or impairment; delay in disciplinary proceedings; interim rehabilitation; imposition of other penalties or sanctions; remorse; and finally, remoteness of prior offenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-7\"><em>Lawson, </em>401 Md. at 585, 933 A.2d at 871; <em>Attorney Grievance v.

Respondent has presented no evidence of mitigation, nor did the hearing judge find any, other than to state that Respondent was not acting as an attorney when he engaged in the misconduct we consider here. Although we concluded in <em>Attorney Grievance v. Link, </em>380 Md. 405, 429, 844 A.2d 1197, 1211-12 (2004), that purely private conduct is not violative of Rule 8.4(d) unless it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>\u201ccriminal or so egregious as to make the harm, or potential harm, flowing from it patent\u201d such that the conduct is prejudicial to the administration of justice, Rule 8.4(d) is not implicated here; Rule 8.4(c) is, which requires \u201cconduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation,\u201d as was proven in the present case. <em>See Sweitzer, </em>395 Md. at 596, 911 A.2d at 446 (attorney violated Rule 8.4(c) while not acting as an attorney when he attempted to transfer title of a vehicle purchased at a public auction by means of a fraudulent gift certification form).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">Respondent\u2019s intentionally dishonest conduct, coupled with his extensive prior disciplinary record, compel us to state that the public only will be protected by the imposition of a sanction of disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">\n<em>IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE 16-761, FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Concurring and dissenting opinion by GREENE, J., which RAKER, J., Joins.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">I concur with majority\u2019s holding that disbarment is the appropriate sanction in this case because of the hearing judge\u2019s factual findings and conclusions of law. I disagree, however, with the majority\u2019s determination that the hearing judge erred in failing to find that Rules 8.1(a) and 8.4(c) were violated on the theory that Respondent lied to Bar Counsel when Respondent said that he titled the Fund, in his own name, in order to create a \u201cself-imposed trust.\u201d The basis for the majority\u2019s conclusion that Respondent made a false statement to Bar Counsel is the hearing judge\u2019s determination that Respondent\u2019s testimony regarding the self-imposed trust was \u201cunconvincing.\u201d Because the hearing judge did not believe Respondent\u2019s explanation for arranging the transfer of funds to his own name is not necessarily clear and convincing evidence that Respondent either testified falsely during disci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>plinary proceedings or that he knowingly misrepresented the facts to Bar Counsel during the investigation of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">In Maryland, a party seeking to establish an express, resulting, or constructive trust must prove the existence of the trust by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Kelley v. Kelley, </em>178 Md. 389, 399, 13 A.2d 529, 533 (1940). In <em>From, the Heart Church Ministries, Inc. v.

[the] purpose and intention [of the settlor], rather than the use of any particular term, that determines whether a valid trust has been established.\u201d Here, Respondent failed to satisfy his burden of proof that an express trust had been created. The facts, however, are neither clear nor convincing that Respondent intended to deceive anyone or intended to misappropriate the Fund. To be sure, it would be a more accurate interpretation of the hearing judge\u2019s findings, as to the transfer of the Fund, to conclude that the judge was not persuaded that Respondent intended to create a \u201cself-imposed trust,\u201d rather than that the judge believed Respondent lied. To say that the hearing judge was not convinced that Respondent intended to create a trust is clearly more consistent with the hearing judge\u2019s ultimate determination that \u201cRespondent did not intend to defraud the Estate or Ms. Harris when he transferred the Fund to himself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Further, I agree that Rules 8.1(a) and 8.4(c) are violated when an attorney acts dishonestly and deceitfully by knowingly making false statements to Bar Counsel. I disagree, however, that because the hearing judge was not persuaded that Respondent intended to create a \u201cself-imposed\u201d trust that Respondent knowingly made a false statement either to Bar Counsel or to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Judge RAKER authorizes me to state that she joins the views expressed in this concurring and dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b178-10\">.
