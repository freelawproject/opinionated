The Petition alleged that Respondent, who was admitted to the Bar of this Court on December 13,1994, violated Rules 1.1 (Competence),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 1.3 (Diligence),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 1.5 (Fees),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 1.15 (Safekeeping <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>Property),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 8.4 (Misconduct)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the Maryland Rules of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>Professional Conduct (\u201cMRPC\u201d) in her representation as Co-Personal Representative of the Estate of Judith Nina Kerr, deceased (\u201cEstate\u201d). Pursuant to Maryland Rules 16-752(a)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and 16-757(c),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we referred the matter to the Honorable Timothy J. Doory of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City to conduct an evidentiary hearing and to submit to this Court proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. Judge Doory held a hearing on the Petition on August 6, 2007, and August 13, 2007. On September 6, 2007, Judge Doory issued findings of fact and conclusions of law, in which he found that Respondent violated Rules 1.1, 1.3, 1.5(a), 1.15(a), 1.15(d), and 1.15(e). Judge Doory\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law read in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-4\">FINDINGS OF FACT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\">Pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-757(c), this court finds that the following facts have been proven by clear and convincing evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">1. On March 4, 1999, Respondent, a close personal friend of deceased, and Oliver Kerr, the brother of the deceased, were appointed co-Personal Representatives of the Estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>of Judith Nina Kerr, deceased. <em>See Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit </em># <em>1 p. 5.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-4\"><em>2. </em>On March 22, 1999, Oliver Kerr paid $3,000.00 from estate funds to the Law Offices of Dwight Pettit, with whom Respondent was an associate at the time. <em>See Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit </em># <em>2.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-5\">3. On May 24,1999, Mr. Kerr paid $3,000.00 to Respondent from estate funds. <em>See Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit </em># <em>2.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-6\">4. Respondent has failed to file a Petition with the Orphans\u2019 Court for Baltimore County to authorize the payment of these fees. <em>See Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit </em># <em>1 Printout of Estate Entries.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-7\">5. Respondent has defended her collection of the $6,000.00 in attorneys fees from Estate funds time and time again; she asserts that the two checks were written, signed, and thus ratified by Mr. Kerr, Co-Personal Representative and sole heir to the Estate, and that $3,000.00 of the payments were in appreciation of her efforts to reduce a MBNA credit card balance from $17,540.47 to $13,155.31. <em>See Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit </em># <em>Ip. 127.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-8\">6. On August 28, 2002, the Orphans\u2019 Court for Baltimore County ordered the removal of Respondent and Mr. Kerr as co-Personal Representatives, finding them to be unable or incapable with or without their own fault to discharge their duties and powers effectively. The Orphans\u2019 Court further ordered Respondent and Mr. Kerr to file their Third and Final Administration Account within 30 days of that Order and ordered them to turn over all Estate assets to the successor Personal Representative. The Orphans\u2019 Court further ordered the appointment of Roland M. Schrebler, Esquire as Successor Personal Representative. <em>See Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit #Ip. 58.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-9\">7. On October 15, 2002, the Orphans\u2019 Court reissued its demand that Respondent and Mr. Kerr file their Third and Final Administration Account within 30 days of that Order as well as turn over all assets of the Estate and all financial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>records in their possession to the Successor Personal Representative Mr. Schrebler. <em>See Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit </em># <em>Ip. 66.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-5\">8. Respondent, rather than complying with the Orphans\u2019 Court Orders of August 28, 2002 and October 15, 2002, filed a Motion to Reconsider the Appointment of a Successor Personal Representative <em>(See Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit </em># <em>1 p. 67), </em>which was denied on November 18, 2002 (See Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit # 1 p. 69), and an Appeal to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County <em>(See Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit </em># <em>lp. 70), </em>in which the Honorable Dana M. Levitz ruled against the Respondent and in favor of Mr. Schrebler. <em>See Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit </em># <em>lp. 79.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-6\">9. Respondent, again rather than complying with the previous Court Orders, filed an Appeal of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County\u2019s decision to the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland, in which the Court of Special Appeals on July 27, 2004 reaffirmed the Circuit Court\u2019s decision. <em>See Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit #lp. 82.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-7\">10. Respondent immediately filed a Motion for Reconsideration in the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland[]on September 1, 2004 which was denied. <em>See Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit #lp. 83.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-8\">11. Respondent then filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari with the Court of Appeals of Maryland on October 27, 2004 appealing the decision of the Court of Special Appeals which was denied on December 23, 2004. <em>See Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit #lp. 86.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-9\">12. On February 11, 2005, Mr. Schrebler filed a Petition to Hold Former Personal Representatives in Civil Contempt and request for A Hearing. <em>See Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit </em># <em>lp. 86.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-10\">13. On June 2, 2005 after the hearing on the Petition to Hold Former Personal Representative in Civil Contempt, the Orphans\u2019 Court found that there is a cash balance of $6,616.26 in the Account of the Estate which has not been turned over to the Successor Personal Representative, that there is an Account retention amount of $2,755.58 which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>funds have not been accounted for and have not been turned over to the Successor Personal Representative, and that the Respondent was in possession of a Caref\u00edrst BCBS of Maryland check payable to the Estate of Judith Nina Kerr in the amount of $196.80 which the Respondent was then unable to locate and had failed to turn over to the Successor Personal Representative. <em>See Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit </em># <em>1 p. 102.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-5\">14. The Orphans\u2019 Court on June 2, 2005 Ordered Mr. Kerr and the Respondent to be held in civil contempt of Court, that Respondent shall reimburse the Estate $6,000.00 in legal fees that were found to be disbursed from Estate assets without Court authority and send the reimbursement to Mr. Schrebler, and that Mr. Kerr and Respondent shall make payment to the Successor Personal Representative the balance of the value of the estate assets unaccounted for consisting of the $6,616.26 cash balance reflected in Respondent\u2019s Third and Final Administration Account, the $2,755.58 retention amount reflected on the Account, and the $196.80 representing the Caref\u00edrst BCBS check made payable to the Estate. <em>See Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit </em># <em>1 p. 102.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-6\">15. On July 5, 2005, Respondent filed an Appeal in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County of the Order of the Orphans\u2019 Court dated June 2, 2005; on November 29, 2005, the Circuit Court found Respondent to be held in civil contempt, ordering her to turn over all Estate assets to Mr. Schrebler, and to file an affidavit indicating that there are no other assets or reports to turn over to the Successor Personal Representative and/or that all reports and assets have been turned over to the Successor Personal Representative. <em>See Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit </em># <em>1 p. 111.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-7\">16. On May 2, 2006, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County ordered that Respondent shall file her Revised Third and Final Administration Account with the Orphans\u2019 Court. <em>See Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit </em># <em>Ip. 120.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-8\">17. On May 16, 2006, Respondent attempted to file her Revised Third and Final Administration Account with the Orphans\u2019 Court, but it was intercepted and held by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Court Auditor!,] Mr. Tony Butta because it was not sufficient for submission to the Court. <em>See Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit #lp. 115.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-4\">18. That according to Mr. Butta, the Court Auditor, an Account is not deemed to be properly filed until it is approved by the Orphans\u2019 Court. <em>See Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit #lp. 123.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-5\">19. On September 11, 2006, a Show Cause Order was signed by the Circuit Court for Baltimore County ordering Respondent to:'show cause why she should not be held in civil contempt of court for allegedly disobeying the May 2, 2006 Order. <em>See Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit </em># <em>lp. 123.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-6\">20. On November 8, 2006, Respondent filed a Second Revised and Not Final Administration Account and a Petition for Allowance of Commissions and Counsel Fees <em>(See Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit </em># <em>1 p. 125); </em>on November [ ] 29, 2006, the Orphans\u2019 Court denied the Respondent\u2019s Petition and denied the submission of the Second Revised and Not Final Administration Account. <em>See Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit </em># <em>1 p. 137.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-7\">21. On January 3, 2007, Respondent filed a Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment <em>(See Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit </em># <em>1 p. 135); </em>said Motion was denied on January 18, 2007 by the Orphans\u2019 Court. <em>See Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit </em># <em>lp. 137.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-8\">22. On February 21, 2007, Respondent filed an Appeal with the Circuit Court for Baltimore County of the January 18, 2007 Order of the Orphans\u2019 Court. <em>(See Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit </em># <em>1 p. 138); </em>on February 27, 2007, .the Clerk of the Orphans\u2019 Court sent a letter to Respondent advising her that she must send a check for $129.00 before the Appeal is transmitted to the Circuit Court. <em>See Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit </em># <em>lp. HO. </em>There is no further indication in evidence of the Appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-9\">23. Because of the Respondent\u2019s failure to file a Third and Final Administration Account, the Estate of Judith Nina Kerr remains open and the matter cannot move forward <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>until Respondent files a Final Accounting that is approved by the Orphans\u2019 Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-4\">24. This [cjourt finds that the Respondent was close to the family of Judith Nina Kerr, deceased, and finds that the Respondent believes that her actions as Co-Personal Representative were beneficial to the Estate, despite subsequent Court Orders and findings against her.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">This court makes the following conclusions of law based upon the facts adduced in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">\n<em>Rule 1.5 (Fees)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">The Respondent violated Rule 1.5 when she accepted $6,000.00 in attorneys fees on behalf of the Estate. Rule 1.5 of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct states that an attorney \u201cshall not make an agreement for, charge, or collect an unreasonable fee or an unreasonable amount for expenses.\u201d The Rule further states that \u201cthe factors to be considered in determining the reasonableness of a fee include the following: (1) the time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly; ... and (3) the fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services.\u201d The amount of attorney\u2019s fees collected by the Respondent in this matter far exceeds the fee customarily charged for estates of similar size. According to the Petitioner\u2019s witness, Mr. Schrebler, Maryland Probate Law only allows for attorneys fees for an estate of this size at a maximum of $3,522.00. The collection of $6,000.00 in fees is far beyond the fee amount allowed by State law.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">The Respondent\u2019s defense of her collection of $3,000.00 of the $6,000.00 in attorney\u2019s fees as appreciation for her efforts in reducing an MSBA credit card balance from $17,540.47 to $13,155.31 does not sway this [c]ourt in its determination that the attorney\u2019s fees collected by the Respondent are unreasonable. A fee of $3,000.00 for reducing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>a credit card balance by $4,385.16 hardly seems reasonable in light of the time and labor the Respondent must have spent in reducing the balance, which could not have been more than a couple of hours on the phone with a credit card company representative. Her assertion that Mr.. Kerr wished for her to be paid the $6,000.00 in attorney\u2019s fees is not a valid argument either and cannot negate the-fact that the fees are far above the maximum amount of attorney\u2019s fees allowed by law for an Estate the size of this present matter\u2019s Estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">Upon review of the evidence and assessing the credibility of the Respondent, this [cjourt is not convinced that the Petitioner\u2019s actions are motivated by avarice; rather the [c]ourt believes that the Respondent is motivated by a genuine belief that she is entitled to the fees involved and remains stubbornly resistant to any suggestions that she is not entitled to them. She clings to her misguided belief against all advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">For these reasons, the court finds that the Respondent violated Rule 1.5 when she collected $6,000.00 in attorneys fees on behalf of the Estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">\n<em>Rule 1.1 (Competence)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">The Respondent violated Rule 1.1 when she repeatedly failed to file her Third and Final Administration Account and ultimately caused the Estate to remain open and unable to be closed due to her failure to file an Account that is approved by the Orphans\u2019 Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">The Respondent admitted that she had very little experience in probating an Estate, but inexperience does not necessarily amount to a violation of this Rule. The comment for Rule 1.1 in the 2006 edition of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct explains that \u201c[2] A lawyer need not necessarily have special training or prior experience to handle legal problems of a type with which the lawyer is unfamiliar. A newly admitted lawyer can be as competent as a practicioner [sie] with long experience. A lawyer can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>provide adequate representation in a wholly novel field through necessary study.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">This Court finds that the Respondent began to probate this Estate with very little experience and direction, and despite the eight years of problems that she has been experiencing with several courts in administering this Estate, the Respondent refuses to admit to her ignorance of the probate procedures involved or to seek and accept help from qualified legal professionals in getting her problems resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Her stubbornness over the past eight years to find the guidance necessary to close the Estate amounts to incompetence, and therefore, this court finds that the Respondent violated Rule 1.1</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">\n<em>Rule 1.3 (Diligence)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">The Respondent violated Rule 1.3 when she repeatedly failed to file a Third and Final Administration Account approved by the Orphans\u2019 Court and to turn over all assets of the Estate and all financial records in her possession to the Successor Personal Representative, Mr. Schrebler, thus preventing Mr. Schrebler from performing his duties and closing the Estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">The comment to Rule 1.3 in the 2006 edition of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct explains that the \u201clawyer must act with the commitment and dedication to the interests of the client and with zeal in advocacy upon the client\u2019s behalf.\u201d The comment further reads that \u201c(a) client\u2019s interests often can be adversely affected by the passage of time or the change of conditions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">This Court is satisfied that the Respondent acted for her own benefit rather than for the benefit of her client; the Respondent choose to file motion upon motion to vacate the Orphans\u2019 Court\u2019s decision to remove her as Co-Personal Representative of the Estate and appeal upon appeal of the Circuit Court\u2019s upholding the Orphans\u2019 Court\u2019s decision, rather than file an approved Third and Final Administration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>Account. In fact, this [e]ourt received a copy of an Order of the Orphans\u2019 Court for Baltimore County denying yet another Motion to Revise Alter or Amend Judgment filed by Respondent a week after this Court concluded its hearing on this matter, demonstrating the Respondent\u2019s stubborn pursuit to be proven \u201cright\u201d rather than her pursuit of the best interest of the Estate. <em>See Respondent Exhibit </em># <em>H and Respondent\u2019s Exhibit </em># <em>15. </em>Simply the fact that the Estate remains open after eight years demonstrates the Respondent\u2019s lack of diligence. Therefore, this Court finds that the Respondent violated Rule 1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">\n<em>Rule 1.15 (Safekeeping Property)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">The Respondent violated Rule 1.15 when she failed to turn over all assets of the Estate and all financial records in [her and the Co-Personal Representative\u2019s] possession to the Successor Personal Representative, when she admittedly failed to locate a Carefirst BCBS of Maryland check payable to the Estate of Judith Nina Kerr in the amount of $196.80, and when she failed to file a Third and Final Administration Account approved by the Orphans\u2019 Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Rule 1.15(a) requires an attorney to keep complete records of account funds and other property the attorney has in her possession. On June 2, 2005, the Orphans\u2019 Court found that there is an Account retention amount of $2,755.58 which funds have not been accounted for and have not been turned over to the Successor Personal Representative, in violation of Rule 1.15(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Rule 1.15(d) requires an attorney to promptly deliver to a client or third party any funds or other property the client or third party is entitled to receive, and upon request by the client or third party, shall promptly render a full accounting regarding such property. The Respondent has failed to turn over all Estate assets to the Successor Personal Representative as of the date of this Court\u2019s hearing and has failed to file an Accounting that is accurate enough to be accepted by the Orphans\u2019 Court, in violation of Rule 1.15(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Rule 1.15(e) requires an attorney, when in the course of representation a lawyer is in possession of property in which two or more persons claim interests, to promptly distribute all portions of the property as to which the interests are not in dispute. In this case, the $6,000.00 in attorney\u2019s fees is in dispute; the Respondent believes that the fees are justifiable. However, the retention amount of $2,755.58 is not <em>in </em>dispute. The Respondent has failed to turn over both disputed and non-disputed property to the Successor Personal Representative, in violation of Rule 1.15(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">\n<em>Rule 84 (Misconduct)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The Petitioner alleged that the Respondent violated Rule 8.4(b), Rule 8.4(c), and Rule 8.4(d). Under Rule 8.4, it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to:</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">(b) commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer\u2019s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects;</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">(c) engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation;</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">(d) engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">This [cjourt finds that the Respondent is not in violation of Rule 8.4(b) as the allegation that the Respondent committed a criminal act has not been proven by the Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-11\">This [cjourt is not satisfied that the Respondent engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation. The [cjourt believes that the Respondent\u2019s conduct during the past eight years in this matter is motivated by stubbornness, not greed, and therefore finds that the Respondent is not in violation of Rule 8.4(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-12\">As to Rule 8.4(d), the [cjourt believes that it would only be cumulative to the other findings to also find that the Respondent is in violation of Rule 8.4(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">\u201cIn proceedings involving attorney discipline, this Court has original and complete jurisdiction and conducts an independent review of the record.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Cherry-Mahoi, </em>388 Md. 124, 152, 879 A.2d 58, 76 (2005). \u201cIn our review of the record, the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact generally will be accepted unless they are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Harris, </em>403 Md. 142, 155-56, 939 A.2d 732, 740 (2008). <em>See also </em>Maryland Rule 16-759(b)(2). ******<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As we noted in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

This Rule provides that Bar counsel has the burden of proving the averments of the petition by clear and convincing evidence, and the attorney who asserts an affirmative defense or a matter of mitigation or extenuation has the burden of proving the defense or matter of mitigation or extenuation by a preponderance of the evidence. Weighing the credibility of witnesses and resolving any conflict in the evidence are tasks proper for the fact finder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">(Internal citations and quotations omitted). \u201cAs to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law, such as whether the provisions of the MRPC were violated, our consideration is essentially <em>de </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number><em>novo.\u201d Harris, </em>403 Md. at 156, 939 A.2d at 740; <em>see also </em>Maryland Rule 16\u2014759(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">In this case, the hearing judge concluded that Respondent violated Rules 1.1, 1.3, 1.5 and 1.15, but did not violate Rule 8.4. Respondent filed written exceptions to several of the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Bar Counsel filed no exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Respondent\u2019s Exception To Hearing Judge\u2019s Conclusions Concerning Rule 1.5</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Respondent first excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that she violated Rule 1.5 by collecting an attorney\u2019s fee of $6,000.00 for her work on the Estate, a sum the hearing judge found far exceeded the amount permitted by Maryland probate law. Respondent counters, stating that \u201cthe fees incurred by Respondent ... as attorney and co-personal representative were received for actions taken by Respondent ... in good faith and with just cause[,] protected and benefitted the estate and meets the requirements\u201d of the Maryland Estates and Trust Article. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 7-602, 7-603, 7\u2014401(a)(1) and 7-401(y). Specifically, Respondent states that her negotiations with creditors of the Estate \u201csaved the estate over fifteen thousand dollars;\u201d therefore, \u201cthe compensation that she received is not out of line with her successful negotiations.\u201d Respondent notes that she negotiated with MNBA to reduce the decedent\u2019s credit card balance from $17,540.47 to $13,155.31. Respondent also points out that she negotiated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>the Termination of Lease obligation down from $11,400.00 to $1,980.00. Last, Respondent contends that \u201cBar Counsel and the [hearing judge] ignored the fact that the ultimate distribute^] and sole heir of the estate, the decedent\u2019s brother, and former co-personal representative, Oliver Kerr, made these checks out to the Respondent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">MRPC 1.5(a) states that \u201c[a] lawyer shall not make an agreement for, charge for, or collect an unreasonable fee or an unreasonable amount for expenses.\u201d The Rule further lays out the \u201cfactors to be considered in determining the reasonableness of a fee.\u201d MRPC 1.5(a). They include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-5\">(1) the time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill requisite to perform the legal sendee properly;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-6\">(2) the likelihood, if apparent to the client, that the acceptance of the particular employment will preclude other employment of the lawyer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-7\">(3) the fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-8\">(4) the amount involved and the results obtained;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-9\">(5) the time limitations imposed by the client or by the circumstances;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-10\">(6) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-11\">(7) the experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the services; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-12\">(8) whether the fee is fixed or contingent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-13\">MRPC 1.5(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-14\">The Maryland Estates and Trust Article permits reasonable compensation to be paid to personal representatives and attorneys for their services in administering an estate. <em>See </em>Md. Code (1974, 2001 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 7-601 &amp; 7-602 of the Estates and Trust Article. An attorney serving as an estate\u2019s personal representative is entitled to receive reasonable compensation for his or her services in the form of either a commission or an attorney\u2019s fee or both. If the attorney/personal repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>sentative seeks both a commission and attorney\u2019s fees, the court is charged with considering both requests together. <em>See </em>\u00a7 7-602(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Sections 7-601 and 7-602 set forth a framework for the reasonable allowance of compensation for the personal representative(s) and/or attorney(s) of an estate. Section 7-601, which is entitled \u201cCompensation of personal representative and special administrator,\u201d reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-6\">(a) A personal representative or special administrator is entitled to reasonable compensation for services. If a will provides a stated compensation for the personal representative, additional compensation shall be allowed if the provision is insufficient in the judgment of the court. The personal representative or special administrator may renounce at any time all or a part of the right to compensation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-7\">(b) Unless the will provides a larger measure of compensation, upon petition filed in reasonable detail by the personal representative or special administrator the court may allow the commissions it considers appropriate. The commissions may not exceed those computed in accordance with the table in this subsection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-8\">If the property subject to ad- The commission may not</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-9\">ministration is: exceed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-10\">Not over $20,000 ..........................9%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-11\">Over $20,000 ...........................$1,800 plus 3.6% of the</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-12\">excess over $20,000</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-13\">Section 7-602, which prescribes \u201ccompensation for services of an attorney,\u201d reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-14\">(a) An attorney is entitled to reasonable compensation for legal services rendered by him to the estate and/or the personal representative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-15\">(b) Upon the filing of a petition in reasonable detail by the personal representative or the attorney, the court may allow a counsel fee to an attorney employed by the personal representative for legal services. The compensation shall be fair and reasonable in the light of all the circumstances to be considered in fixing the fee of an attorney.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>Nevertheless, the attorney/personal representative may not accept or take funds from the estate without complying with the procedural guidelines set forth in \u00a7 7-502 and \u00a7 7-604. Section 7-502(a) requires the personal representative to \u201cgive written notice to each creditor who has filed a claim\u201d against the estate and to any other interested party of any proposed payment to the personal representative or attorney. <em>See also </em>\u00a7 7-602(b) (requiring the personal representative or attorney to file a petition with the court when seeking attorney\u2019s fees). \u201cThe notice shall state the amount requested, and set forth in reasonable detail the basis for the request.\u201d \u00a7 7-502(a). Creditors and/or interested parties are then given twenty days in which to request a hearing on the payment. <em>Id. </em>The court may then approve the payment(s). The proposed payment(s), however, may be made without court approval if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-4\">(1) Each creditor, who has filed a claim that is still open, and all interested parties consent in writing to the payment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-5\">(2) The combined sum of the payments of commissions and attorney\u2019s fees does not exceed the amounts provided in \u00a7 7-601 of this subtitle; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-6\">(3) The signed written consent form states the amounts of the payments and is filed with the register of wills.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">\u00a7 7-604(a). Section 7-604(b) requires, however, that the personal representative designate any such payment(s) made to the personal representative and/or the attorney as an expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">In the case sub <em>judice, </em>it is clear from the record that Respondent accepted, prior to any court approval, $6,000.00 from the Estate for her services. On March 22, 1999, Co-Personal Representative Oliver Kerr issued check number 104, in the amount of $3,000.00, to the Law Offices of Dwight Petitt, with whom Respondent was an associate at the time of the check\u2019s issuance. On May 24, 1999, Mr. Kerr issued a second check, number 114, in the amount of $3,000.00; this time the check was issued directly to the Respondent. We hold that the acceptance of these payments by Respondent without court approval and without compliance with the requirements set forth in \u00a7 7-604, violated Rule 1.5. The record is devoid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>of any compliance by Respondent and/or Mr. Kerr with the relevant statutory provisions governing the allowance of payments from an estate to the personal representative(s) and/or attorney(s). We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">There is no evidence in the record that either Respondent and/or Mr. Kerr sought court approval for the payment of the attorney\u2019s fees/commission, prior to the actual payment to Respondent. Indeed, there is no evidence in the record that Respondent and/or Mr. Kerr ever provided written notice to creditors of the Estate of their intention to pay Respondent $6,000.00 for her work on the Estate, as required under \u00a7 7-502. In addition, if these payments were intended to compensate Respondent for legal services she performed, neither Respondent nor Mr. Kerr filed the required petition with the Orphans\u2019 Court requesting approval of the fees. <em>See </em>\u00a7 7-602(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Respondent contends that her acceptance of these fees is permitted because Mr. Kerr, the Estate\u2019s Co-Personal Representative and \u201cthe ultimate distributee,\u201d approved the payments. Respondent\u2019s statement of Maryland\u2019s probate law is incorrect. As explained above, if the personal representative chooses not to seek the Orphans\u2019 Court\u2019s approval of a payment for services rendered to the estate, the personal representative must seek the consent of every creditor who still has a claim open with the estate and every interested party of that estate. <em>See </em>\u00a7 7-604(a)(l). Each qualifying creditor and interested party must then consent to the payment in writing, and these consents must be filed with the register of wills. \u00a7 7-604(a)(3).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> There is no evidence that Respondent and/or Mr. Kerr sought to comply with this alternative method of approval for these payments. There is nothing in the record to suggest that Respondent and/or Mr. Kerr requested the consent of the creditors of the Estate for these payments, received the written consent of any of the Estate\u2019s creditors, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>filed the consent forms with the Register of Wills.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Indeed, at the time of the two payments to Respondent, it is unclear if Respondent and/or Mr. Kerr knew the identities of persons or entities with claims against the Estate.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It is clear, however, that after March 3, 1999, several creditors filed notice of their claims against the Estate, including First National Bank of Maryland, Nordstrom, Chadwick\u2019s, MBNA America, Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric Company, and Allfirst Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Furthermore, even if Respondent had sought the consent of the creditors, the amount of money accepted by Respondent exceeds the permissible amount set forth in the \u00a7 7-601(b) compensation schedule, thereby necessitating court approval. Pursuant to \u00a7 7-604(a)(2), the personal representative of the estate may pay commissions or attorney fees without prior court approval, if, among other things, the amount sought does not exceed the amount allowed pursuant to the compensation schedule contained in \u00a7 7-601(b). At the time of the \u201cPetition for Probate,\u201d filed on March 4, 1999, Respondent and Mr. Kerr valued the decedent\u2019s estate at $100,000.00. Under the \u00a7 7-601(b) compensation schedule, the maximum commissions allowed by law, without court approval, for an estate valued at $100,000.00, is \u201c$1,800 plus 3.6% of the excess over $20,000\u201d or $4,680.00. Respondent\u2019s acceptance of $6,000 for her \u201clegal engagement fee\u201d exceeded the permissible amount under \u00a7 7-601(b).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>Respondent\u2019s Exception To Hearing Judge\u2019s Conclusions Concerning Rule 1.1</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Respondent next excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that she violated Rule 1.1 (Competence). Respondent claims that her \u201calleged failure to file [the] Third and Final Administration Account ... is due to the fact that Respondent ... has been continually harassed by the Orphans\u2019 Court [and its] failure to give Respondent ... notice and due process.\u201d Specifically, Respondent complains that the Orphans\u2019 Court failed to give advanced notice of its intent to remove her and Mr. Kerr as Co-Personal Representatives of the Estate. Respondent also asserts that she \u201chas been diligently attempting to file the Third and Final Administration Accounts, but the Orphans\u2019 Court ... has hindered her efforts\u201d by not allowing her to correct the account after its filing on May 5, 2005, and by not providing her with notice of the Orphans\u2019 Court\u2019s approval or disapproval of her filed accounting. In addition, Respondent claims the \u201cOrphans\u2019 Court held her in Civil Contempt a second time \"without any proper notice.\u201d We shall overrule Respondent\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Respondent\u2019s exception does not address the underlying reasoning for the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that she violated Rule 1.1 (Competence), except to complain about her treatment by the Orphans\u2019 Court. The hearing judge concluded that Respondent\u2019s handling of the Estate violated Rule 1.1 because \u201cdespite the eight years of problems that she ha[d] been experiencing with several courts in administering this Estate, [ ] Respondent refuse[d] to admit her ignorance of the probate procedures involved or to seek and accept help from qualified legal professionals in getting her problems solved.\u201d The hearing judge found that \u201c[h]er stubbornness over the past eight years to find the guidance necessary to close the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Estate amounts to incompetence.\u201d The record clearly supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion. The record shows that Judith Nina Kerr died on February 27, 1999. According to the records of the Register of Wills of Baltimore County, the Estate, valued at approximately $60,000, was not closed until December 20, 2007. Those findings indicate 8 years, 9 months and 23 days had lapsed from the date of Ms. Kerr\u2019s death until the closing of her Estate. In addition, the record shows that Respondent collected fees in a manner in direct contravention to the statutory provisions contained in the Maryland Estates and Trust Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Moreover, the record shows that Respondent failed to timely file many of the documents necessary to administer the Estate, leading to her removal as Co-Personal Representative. Pursuant to \u00a7 7-201, Respondent and/or Mr. Kerr had the duty to file an Inventory with the Register of Wills within three months after their appointments as CoPersonal Representatives. On June 11, 1999, the Orphans\u2019 Court issued a Delinquent Notice to Mr. Kerr and Respondent for their failure to file an Inventory and Information Report.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thereafter, a summons and a request for show cause order was issued to the Sheriff of Baltimore County to \u201ccite and summons\u201d Respondent to appear before the Orphans\u2019 Court to explain why the Inventory had not been filed as of July 13, 1999. On July 26, 1999, Respondent filed the required Inventory.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">On December 10, 1999, the Orphans\u2019 Court issued a Delinquent Notice to Mr. Kerr and Respondent for their failure to render and file a First Administration Account for the Estate. Pursuant to \u00a7 7-305(a)(l), Respondent and Mr. Kerr were required to render an account of the Estate within 9 months of their appointment, on or before December 4, 1999. In response to the notice, Respondent requested two extensions, which were granted; however, a second Delinquent Notice was then issued on February 18, 2000, when Respondent did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>not comply with the extended deadline. A hearing on the delinquency was then scheduled for March 8, 2000; neither Respondent nor Mr. Kerr appeared for that hearing. On March 9, 2000, the Orphans\u2019 Court issued a summons and a request for show cause order was issued to the Sheriff of Baltimore County to \u201ccite and summons\u201d Respondent and Mr. Kerr to appear before the Orphans\u2019 Court to explain why the First Administration Account had not been filed as of February 11, 2000. Respondent and Mr. Kerr did not file the \u201cFirst, Not Final Administration Account\u201d with the Register of Wills until April 10, 2000.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The Orphans\u2019 Court\u2019s issuance of Delinquent Notices and Summones continued throughout the administration of the Estate. The court issued a Delinquent Notice on October 17, 2000, for Respondent\u2019s and Mr. Kerr\u2019s failure to file a Second Administration Account within six months after the First Administration Account, October 10, 2000. <em>See </em>\u00a7 7-305(a)(2). Respondent and Mr. Kerr then failed to appear on November 11, 2000, for a scheduled hearing on the matter. On November 27, 2000, the Orphans\u2019 Court issued a summons and a request for show cause order directing Respondent and Mr. Kerr to appear before the Orphans\u2019 Court to explain why the Second Administration Account had not been filed as of October 10, 2000. Respondent and Mr. Kerr thereafter filed the \u201cSecond, Not Final Administration Account\u201d on January 8, 2001. The Orphans\u2019 Court approved the account the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">The Orphans\u2019 Court then had to issue a Delinquent Notice on July 16, 2001, for Respondent\u2019s and Mr. Kerr\u2019s failure to file a Third Administration Account on or before July 9, 2001. In response, Respondent requested an extension from the Orphans\u2019 Court to complete the account; an extension was granted until September 10, 2001. On February 22, 2002, the Orphans\u2019 Court issued a sixth Delinquent Notice, this time for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>Respondent\u2019s and Mr. Kerr\u2019s failure to file a Third Account, an Amended Inventory, and a Supplemental Information Report by September 10, 2001. On April 1, 2002 and then on May 3, 2002, the Orphans\u2019 Court issued summons and requests for show cause order directing Respondent and Mr. Kerr to appear before the Orphans\u2019 Court to explain why these requested documents still had not yet been filed.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It was not until May 1, 2002 that Respondent and Mr. Kerr filed a \u201cThird, Not Final Administration Account.\u201d The Orphans\u2019 Court initially approved the account, but denied the account two days later when Respondent indicated in a letter to the Register of Wills that she had not included several assets in the accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Despite repeated interactions with the Register of Wills and the Orphans\u2019 Court regarding Respondent\u2019s and Mr. Kerr\u2019s tardiness in filing the documents, Respondent and Mr. Kerr did not seek assistance in the administration of the Estate. Consequently, on May 3, 2002, a petition to remove Respondent and Mr. Kerr as Co-Personal Representatives was initiated by the Orphans\u2019 Court because of Respondent\u2019s and Mr. Kerr\u2019s failure to file a Supplemental Inventory, a Supplemental Information Report, and a Third Administration Account. The petition was granted and the Court removed Respondent and Mr. Kerr as CoPersonal Representatives of the Estate on August 28, 2002.. The Order mandated that Respondent and Mr. Kerr file the \u201cThird and Final Administration Account\u201d and turn over all assets and financial records in their possession within thirty days of the date of the Order. Despite this significant action, Respondent failed to file the Third and Final Administration Account within the 30 day time-limit prescribed by the order of the Orphans\u2019 Court, leading to additional court interactions including the imposition of Civil Contempt by the Orphans\u2019 Court on June 2, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">It is clear from the record that Respondent\u2019s failure to properly comply with probate law-in the administration of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>Estate was due to her inexperience and her unwillingness to obtain the help she needed to properly administer the estate. As the hearing judge stated in his analysis, \u201cinexperience does not necessarily amount to a violation of this Rule.\u201d We have said, however, that attorneys who undertake legal work in areas unfamiliar to them \u201cmust take careful thought as to their competence to practice in \u2018specialty\u2019 areas,\u201d like the administration of estates. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Brown, </em>308 Md. 219, 234, 517 A.2d 1111, 1118 (1986). If an attorney \u201cplunges into a field in which he or she is not competent, and as a consequence makes mistakes that demonstrate incompetence, the Code [of Professional Responsibility] demands that discipline be imposed; that one is simply a general practitioner who knew no better is no defense.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>308 Md. at 234-35, 517 A.2d at 1119. As Comment [2] to Rule 1.1 explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-5\">A lawyer need not necessarily have special training or prior experience to handle legal problems of a type with which the lawyer is unfamiliar. A newly admitted lawyer can be as competent as a practitioner with long experience. Some important legal skills, such as the analysis of precedent, the evaluation of evidence and legal drafting, are required in all legal problems. Perhaps the most fundamental legal skill consists of determining what kind of legal problems a situation may involve, a skill that necessarily transcends any particular specialized knowledge. A lawyer can provide adequate representation in a wholly novel field through necessary study. Competent representation can also be provided through the association of a lawyer of established competence in the field in question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">It is clear that Respondent did not employ the requisite knowledge and skill to administer the Estate or to comply with the Orphans\u2019 Court\u2019s orders. Therefore, we overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Respondent\u2019s Exceptions To Hearing Judge\u2019s Conclusions Concerning Rule 1.15</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">Respondent also excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s statement that \u201cRespondent violated Rule 1.15 when she failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>turn over all assets of the Estate and all financial records in [her and Mr. Kerr\u2019s] possession to the Successor Personal Representative, when she admittedly failed to locate a Care-first BCBS of Maryland check payable to the Estate of Judith Nina Kerr in the amount of $196.80, and when she failed to file a Third and Final Administration Account approved by the Orphans\u2019 Court.\u201d We shall address each of Respondent\u2019s three exceptions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">As to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that Respondent \u201cadmittedly failed to locate a CareFirst BCBS of Maryland check ... in the amount of $196.80,\u201d Respondent asserts that: \u201c[I]f there is a problem with the [CareFirst BCBS] check, it can be reissued, because after six months the check [is] no longer a negotiable instrument. The [Successor] Personal Representative has had this information since 2005 and on information and belief has not sought the reissuance of the check.\u201d Respondent\u2019s argument fails to address the hearing judge\u2019s finding that the Orphans\u2019 Court found that Respondent \u201ctestified she has in her possession a CareFirst BCBS of Maryland check made payable to the Estate of Judith Nina Kerr for $196.80 which she is now unable to locate and has failed to turn over to the Successor Personal Representative.\u201d Instead, Respondent\u2019s statement merely explains what actions the Successor Personal Representative could have taken to resolve Respondent\u2019s failure to safe keep this asset of the estate. The hearing judge\u2019s findings are based on the June 2, 2005, order of the Orphans\u2019 Court holding Respondent and Mr. Oliver W. Kerr, Jr. in Civil Contempt. The Orphans\u2019 Court made the following finding in its order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-5\">WHEREAS Ms. Kendrick testified she has in her possession a Carefirst BCBS of Maryland check made payable to the Estate of Judith Nina Kerr for $196.80 which she is now unable to locate and failed to turn over to the Successor Personal Representative[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Respondent did not appeal the Order and may not now attempt to relitigate that decision before this Court. As such, we conclude that the hearing judge\u2019s finding is supported by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>Second, as to the hearing judge\u2019s statement that \u201cshe failed to turn over all assets of the Estate and all financial records in [her] possession to the Successor Personal Representative,\u201d Respondent asserts that: \u201cUnder oath and penalty of perjury on August 6, 2007, Successor Personal Representative Schrebler admitted that these estate assets were turned over to him in May 2005.\u201d The record, however, clearly establishes that Respondent did not transfer to the Successor Personal Representative the CareFirst BCBS check. The record also indicates that on June 2, 2005, the Orphans\u2019 Court found an \u201cAccount retention amount of $2,755.58,\u201d an amount which Respondent neither accounted for nor had transferred to the Successor Personal Representative. The failure of Respondent to account for $2,755.58, of Estate funds, is a clear violation of MRPC 1.15(a), which requires that \u201c[c]omplete records of such account funds and of other property [ ] be kept by the lawyer.\u201d Therefore, the exception is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">Last, as to the hearing judge\u2019s statement that Respondent \u201cfailed to file a Third and Final Administration Account approved by the Orphans\u2019 Court,\u201d Respondent asserts that she filed the Third and Final Administration Account on May 5, 2005, but was denied the opportunity to correct the account. She explains: \u201cHad Respondent ... been permitted by the Orphans\u2019 Court to correct the record, the retention amount [of $2,775.58], which is in dispute, would have been accounted for.\u201d Respondent\u2019s explanation, however, does not address her failure to file the Third and Final Administration within the 30-day time period prescribed by the Orphans\u2019 Court. While her numerous appeals of the Orphans\u2019 Court\u2019s order removing her as co-personal representative stayed the Orphans\u2019 Court\u2019s original 30-day mandate until this Court\u2019s denial of her petition for writ of certiorari on December 23, 2004, Respondent did not file the Estate\u2019s Third and Final Administration Account until May 5, 2006\u20141 year, 3 months, 11 days after the Orphans\u2019 Court\u2019s January 24, 2005, deadline. Respondent provided no explanation for her failure to adhere to the mandate of the Orphans\u2019 Court. In neglecting to do so, Respondent also failed to provide the required accounting of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>the- Estate\u2019s assets. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Roberson, </em>373 Md. 328, 818 A.2d 1059 (2003). Respondent\u2019s exception is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Respondent\u2019s Exceptions To Hearing Judge\u2019s Conclusions Concerning Rule 1.3</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Lastly, Respondent excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that she violated Rule 1.3, asserting that the Orphans\u2019 Court failed to comply with \u201cthe notice requirements and due process safeguards granted\u201d to her. Specifically, Respondent states that she attempted to refile documents with the Register of Wills on August 6, 2007, but has not been given \u201cproper notice that those filings were denied.\u201d In addition, Respondent complains of an invasion of her privacy as she was detained by the Baltimore County Sheriffs Office on a Writ of Body Attachment. Again, Respondent\u2019s exception does not address the underlying analysis used by the hearing judge. The hearing judge noted that Respondent \u201crepeatedly failed to file a Third and Final Administration Account approved by the Orphans\u2019 Court.\u201d The record clearly supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Respondent failed to properly file the required Third and Final Administration Account.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The record indicates that Respondent (and Mr. Kerr) attempted several times to file a Third and Final Administration Account with the Register of W ills, but the accounts were not approved by the Orphans\u2019 Court. For example, on or about May 1, 2002, Respondent and Mr. Kerr filed a \u201cThird, Not Final Administration Account.\u201d The Orphans\u2019s Court approved the account the same day. The approval, however, was short lived as on May 3, 2002, the Orphans\u2019 Court rescinded its initial approval of the account. Its reasoning for doing so is not clear from the record, though a letter from Respondent to the Register of Wills indicates that the accounting did not include' recently discovered assets. After being removed as Co-Personal Representative of the Estate and ordered to file the Third and Final Administration Account by the Orphans\u2019 Court, in August 2002, Respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>waited until May 16, 2006, to file a \u201cRevised Third and Final Administration Account.\u201d This filing was intercepted by Mr. Anthony C. Butta, the court auditor<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> because of deficiencies he found in the accounting. Specifically, Mr. Butta noted in a memorandum to Respondent that the \u201cstart figure [of the account] is incorrect.\u201d On September 21, 2006, Mr. Butta, sent Respondent, Mr. Kerr, and the Successor Personal Representative a detailed letter advising Respondent how to properly file the \u201cRevised Third, Not Final Administration Account.\u201d Thereafter, on or about November 8, 2006, Respondent filed a \u201cPetition for the allowance of commissions and counsel fees\u201d along with a \u201cSecond Revised Third And Not Final Administration Account.\u201d Both were denied by the Orphans\u2019 Court. The account was not approved because of Respondent\u2019s and Mr. Kerr\u2019s failure to pay the required inheritance tax on the Estate and because Respondent included, in the final accounting, her request for counsel fees.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Thereafter, Respondent filed, in the Orphans\u2019 Court, a Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment, which was denied as untimely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">It is clear from the record that Respondent has violated Rule 1.3. Respondent was not diligent in responding to the Orphans\u2019 Court\u2019s requests to properly file the Third and Final Administration Account, not diligent in responding to the guidance given by Mr. Butta concerning the correct procedure or form for submission of an account, and not diligent in timely filing documents with the Register of Wills. In sum, Respondent failed to handle the administration of the Estate in a reasonably diligent matter. Therefore, Respondent\u2019s exception is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>\n<em>SANCTION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">Having concluded that Respondent violated Rules 1.1, 1.3, 1.5, and 1.15, we must determine- the proper sanction. Bar Counsel recommends that Respondent be indefinitely suspended from the practice of law \u201cuntil she has . made full restitution to the Estate and has proven that she is capable of competently practicing law.\u201d Bar Counsel contends this is an appropriate sanction because Respondent accepted fees \u201cwhich exceeded the statutory amount permitted to be-taken without Orphans\u2019 Court approval,\u201d failed to return fees to the Estate after the Orphans\u2019 Court denied her approval for her proposed fees, failed to pay the required inheritance tax before making distributions to the decedent\u2019s heirs, and failed to both account for and turn over estate funds and assets to the Successor Personal Representative. Bar Counsel, cites the following cases: <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Seiden, </em>373 Md. 409, 818 A.2d 1108 (2003), <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Owrutsky, </em>322 Md. 334, 587 A.2d 511 (1991), <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Thompson, </em>376 Md. 500, 830 A.2d 474 (2003), and <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Sullivan, </em>369 Md. 650, 801 A.2d 1077 (2002). Further, Bar Counsel points out that \u201c[t]his Court has imposed severe sanctions on attorneys who have improperly taken fees from an estate without approval of the Orphans\u2019 Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Respondent asserts that the cases cited by Bar Counsel are inapposite because \u201c[i]n this case, [ ] Respondent [ ] had the .approval and authorization of the heir, ultimate distributee, and former copersonal representative when he signed the checks.\u201d In addition, Respondent notes that she has paid the Estate\u2019s creditors and has \u201cpaid the inheritance tax on non-probate assets from Estate funds with the approval of Mr. Kerr.\u201d Last, Respondent notes that the hearing judge did not find that she had acted with dishonesty in violation of MRPC 8.4. Respondent does not offer this Court a suggestion as to her sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">\u201cIt is well settled that our obligation in disciplinary matters is to protect the public and maintain the public\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>confidence in the legal system rather than to punish the attorney for misconduct.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Ward, </em>394 Md. 1, 32-33, 904 A.2d 477, 496 (2006) (citing <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Powell, </em>369 Md. 462, 474, 800 A.2d 782, 789 (2002) and <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Kolodner, </em>316 Md. 203, 208, 557 A.2d 1332, 1334 (1989)). This Court\u2019s goal, however, \u201cwhen imposing sanctions[,] is to maintain the integrity of the legal profession and to prevent misconduct by other attorneys.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The severity of the sanction depends on several things, including \u201cthe circumstances of each case, the intent to which the acts were committed, the gravity, nature and effects of the violations as well as any mitigating factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To be sure, we have stated that \u201cthe gravity of misconduct is not measured solely by the number of rules broken but is determined largely by the lawyer\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Briscoe, </em>357 Md. 554, 568, 745 A.2d 1037,1044 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">Violations of the Rules stemming from the taking of fees without prior court approval and the mishandling of accounts have warranted both suspensions and disbarments in prior cases before this Court. In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Seiden, </em>373 Md. 409, 818 A.2d 1108 (2003), we imposed a indefinite suspension, with leave to reapply after thirty days, because an attorney took his fee from the estate without the permission of the Orphans\u2019 Court. In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Sullivan, </em>369 Md. 650, 801 A.2d 1077 (2002), we disbarred an attorney who, as the personal representative of an estate, failed to administer the estate and took over $50,000 from the estate without prior approval of the Orphans\u2019 Court. In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Thompson, </em>376 Md. 500, 830 A.2d 474 (2003), we indefinitely suspended an attorney for mishandling the estate, including failing to timely file reports and accounts, failing to pay estate taxes at the time of distribution, and failing to obtain prior approval of the Orphans\u2019 Court before taking fees. Last, in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Owrutsky, </em>322 Md. 334, 587 A.2d 511 (1991), we suspended an attorney for three years for his careless and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>neglectful handling of an estate, his mishandling of estate funds, and his taking of fees without prior court approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">In this case, the hearing judge concluded, and we agree, that Respondent\u2019s misconduct was not due to greed or dishonesty, but rather due to obstinateness and incompetence in probate matters. Respondent\u2019s inability to accept responsibility in the mishandling of the Estate leaves much to be desired. Respondent, however, has not been previously sanctioned by this Court for professional misconduct. Under the totality of the circumstances and in light of our relevant prior cases, we conclude that the appropriate sanction is an indefinite suspension. Re-application for admission should abide until, at a minimum, Respondent provides full restitution to the Estate.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The suspension shall commence thirty (30) days after the filing of this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">IT IS SO ORDERED.
