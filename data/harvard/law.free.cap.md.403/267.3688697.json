In urging us to conclude it was not, he relies on two grounds. The first is that the trial court improperly exercised its discretion in denying Jones counsel, where, after a concededly knowing and voluntary initial waiver of counsel, Jones effectively elected to withdraw his waiver and requested coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>sel before trial began. Second, Jones complains that, as of the day of trial, he had not had sufficient time to review discovery responses from the State and, therefore, the trial court improperly exercised its discretion in denying a postponement. In addition to these arguments, he also points to assertedly improper procedural consideration of his postponement request by the trial judge and the County Administrative Judge\u2019s designee.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">On 15 July 2003, Baltimore City police attempted to conduct a traffic stop on a stolen car being driven by Jones. Instead of stopping, Jones proceeded at a high rate of speed south on Interstate 95. Pursuit continued through Montgomery County west on Interstate 495 to River Road. A police helicopter pilot observed Jones exit the car at this point, flag down another vehicle, forcibly remove its driver, and commandeer the vehicle. Two small children remained in the back seat of the second vehicle as the chase continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">The chase went on for nearly two hours, during which Jones drove erratically and at speeds up to 130 miles per hour. Finally, he stopped the vehicle on the shoulder of Maryland Route 50 in Anne Arundel County, but refused to exit. Police officers broke the windows and forcibly removed him.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">Jones was charged in Montgomery County and Anne Arundel County with a number of crimes arising out of the incident, including kidnaping, carjacking, and assault. In his trial in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, Jones, represented by counsel, was convicted of charges of carjacking and second degree assault. He was sentenced to 40 years\u2019 imprisonment. While he was incarcerated in Montgomery County, the State commenced proceedings against him in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. Jones, who represented himself in the Anne Arundel County proceedings, was convicted by a jury of two counts of second degree assault, two counts of kidnapping, one count of resisting arrest, one count of reckless driving, and one count of failure to maintain a reasonable and prudent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>speed. Jones was sentenced to 30 years\u2019 imprisonment and fines of $500 for each of the three driving offenses. The 30-year term of imprisonment in the Anne Arundel County prosecution was to run consecutive to the 40-year term sentence from the Montgomery County prosecution. The present issues arise out of the Anne Arundel County proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">In the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, Jones\u2019s initial appearance was before Judge Michael E. Loney on 22 November 2004. He was advised at that time of his rights pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-213(e).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The transcript of the proceeding notes in pertinent part the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">The Court: I just want to make sure today that you understand you have a right to be represented by an attorney on these charges. If you cannot afford a lawyer the Office of Public Defender will represent you if you apply and also if you qualify. Have you made any arrangements for any attorney to represent you on these charges?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-7\">Jones: As I indicated, I have been talking to an attorney in reference to this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-8\">But, no, I haven\u2019t retained one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">At his next appearance, a status conference on 7 January 2005 before the County Administrative Judge, the Honorable Joseph P. Manck, Jones again was advised of his right to counsel Tie transcript of the status conference reveals the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>The State: This Defendant is here today without an attorney. It is a very serious case he is facing____ I have told him I think a Public Defender would be very helpful for him to have today. He has told me several times that he does not want a Public Defender. For the record, if I could just hand him a Public Defender card.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUo\">The Court: What the State said is true, you certainly are entitled to have an attorney represent you. If you can\u2019t afford one, the Public Defender may represent you, but it is your responsibility to contact them. An attorney can be very helpful and go over the whole case with you, preparing you for trial, preparing the whole case for trial, generally protect your constitutional rights and if necessary helping you at time of sentencing. I cannot stress enough how important it is to have counsel. If you intend on representing yourself that is certainly your right, but please don\u2019t minimize the fact that an attorney can be extremely helpful on these very serious offenses. Your trial date is scheduled for February 17th at 9:00, and if you come in here without counsel and without good reason for not having an attorney a judge could find that you waived your right and make you go forward without a lawyer. Do you understand all those rights, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Acx\">Jones: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">On 17 February 2005, the first scheduled trial date, Jones, without counsel, appeared before a third judge, the Honorable Paul A. Hackner. He again was advised of his rights according to Maryland Rule 4-213 and found to have waived his right to counsel in accordance with Maryland Rule 4-215.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>The relevant colloquy between Judge Hackner and the parties was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-4\">The State: Your Honor, just to catch the Court up to speed, I have spoken with Defendant, and the first thing I asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>him today was whether or not he wanted a lawyer to represent him. And he told me he had a lawyer, and I asked who it was and he said, \u201cMe.\u201d And I went on to discuss the matter with him further, and he reminded me that at the status conference that I talked to him then, that he said he didn\u2019t have a lawyer, that he didn\u2019t want a lawyer, and that I asked him to take a green Public Defender card. He reminded me that we had already had that conversation and that there was nothing more to talk about with respect to him getting a lawyer, so I just ask\u2014 and I know Judge Manck at the time of the status conference advised him of his rights, but perhaps just another advisement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-5\">The Court: All right. Mr. Jones, is it your intention to proceed without a lawyer, or do you wish to have a lawyer represent you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-6\">Jones: Proceed without a lawyer, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-7\">The Court: All right. Now, I am going to ask you a whole bunch of questions to make sure that you are clear on what your rights are and that you knowingly and voluntarily are giving up your rights to an attorney. I am going to start by telling you I think it is a very serious mistake that you are making, because you are facing charges that could result in a significant amount of incarceration. And even though you might feel that you understand the issues and perhaps are able to represent yourself, I can almost guarantee you that you can\u2019t. Even if you had a law degree it would be a bad idea for you to represent yourself. But I am going to go through this process with you, and I hope that you will listen to me carefully and make an intelligent decision. How much education have you had?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-8\">Jones: I\u2019m a high school graduate. Also Baltimore International Culinary College graduate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-9\">The Court: All right, and so I assume you can read and write?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-10\">Jones: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>The Court: I presume that you have not had any legal training, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-5\">Jones: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-6\">The Court: And tell me why you want to represent yourself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-7\">Jones: I decided that I would like to represent me, myself, on this case because there\u2019s a lot of motion issues in reference to this case. There\u2019s a lot of double jeopardy in reference to this case, you know, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-8\">The Court: So you think you know more about those issues than a trained attorney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-9\">Jones: No, I don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-10\">The Court: So why do you want to be\u2014if you have these good issues, then why do you want to take those issues and take the responsibility for addressing them without the advice of somebody who understands whether they are true issues or not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-11\">Jones: I totally understand that, Your Honor, and I came to the decision that\u2014actually I came to the conclusion that I would prefer to represent myself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-12\">The Court: Do you understand that lawyers are specially trained and they understand those issues that you are addressing and they can recognize issues that perhaps you haven\u2019t thought of and raise those in an effective way before the Court so that your likelihood of success on those issues is significantly greater than if you present them yourself? Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-13\">Jones: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-14\">The Court: And do you understand that an attorney can assist you in determining whatever defenses you might have and any mitigation that there might be in the event that you are found guilty? Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-15\">Jones: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>The Court: Do you understand that an attorney can assist you in preparing and conducting the trial by cross-examining State witnesses, by calling witnesses for you on your behalf, by making legal arguments, by making presentation of facts that might be favorable to you? Do you understand that, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-5\">Jones: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-6\">The Court: Do you understand that even if you decide to plead guilty or you are found guilty an attorney can assist you in obtaining a favorable disposition? Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-7\">Jones: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-8\">The Court: Do you understand also, sir, that if you are unable to hire a private attorney, the Public Defender or a Court-appointed [attorney] would be available to represent you? Do you understand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-9\">Jones: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-10\">The Court: And that you would have a number of trial rights which you are going to still have, but you are not likely to be able to exercise them as effectively. Those are the rights to call witnesses on your behalf; the rights to confront and cross-examine those witnesses; the right to obtain witnesses by compulsory process, in other words, by subpoenas; the right to require proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Those are the rights that you have, but an attorney could assist you in exercising those rights more effectively. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-11\">Jones: I understand that part, Your Honor, but what I\u2019m in limbo in reference to that part is the fact that why is it there is a difference from actually having a legal counsel on my behalf instead of me to present those same motions or to present those same issues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-12\">The Court: You have the right to present them just like I have a right to fix my toilet. I am just not as good as a plumber. That is all I am telling you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Okay? If I want to fix my toilet or try to tune my car, I can do it. But if that car blows up in my face because I don\u2019t know what I am doing then it is my fault for not going to a mechanic, and that is what you are doing here. If this case blows up in your face you can\u2019t go to the Court of Appeals and say, \u201cWell, I\u2019ve changed my mind. I decided I\u2019m not as smart as a lawyer, and therefore I want a new trial.\u201d It won\u2019t happen. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-5\">Jones: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-6\">The Court: Because the law applies to you just like it does for a lawyer, and the rules of evidence apply to you the same way. The Court can\u2019t assist you in trying this case. All I can do is do the same thing I would do if you were represented by counsel. Understand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-7\">Jones: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-8\">The Court: So understanding these rights, is it still your desire to give up the right to be represented by counsel and represent yourself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-9\">Jones: As I indicated, Your Honor, I came to the conclusion I feel as though I\u2019d like to represent myself. I had the opportunity to talk to a few attorneys.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-10\">In Anne Arundel County and I decided that I want to represent myself in reference to this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-11\">The Court: All right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-12\">Before formal acceptance of his express waiver of counsel, Jones complained that the State had not provided him with discovery materials sought pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-263.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>He expressed a desire to view audio and video police communications and police notes relating to the charges. He assert<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>ed that he had not been provided these materials. Judge Hackner reset the trial for 10 May 2005 and ordered the State to provide complete discovery. Judge Hackner also instructed Jones on filling out subpoenas for documents in support of his defense. After further discussion, the Court concluded by stating, \u201cI find that [Jones] has knowingly, freely, and voluntarily waived his right to counsel and he will represent himself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Before the new trial date, Jones subpoenaed as a witness Rene Sandler, Esquire, his defense counsel in the Montgomery County proceedings. On 25 April 2005, he appeared before Judge Philip T. Caroom on a motion filed by Ms. Sandler to quash the subpoena. The record documents that on this occasion, Jones\u2019s express waiver of counsel was revisited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-6\">The Court: [L]et me confirm the Court I think twice has advised you about your right to have an attorney initially in November on this case. You advised that you thought you were going to make arrangements for a private attorney, and then in January the Court advised you again and you were provided information on how to contact a Public Defender. Since that time have you been making arrangements you think for a private attorney or a Public Defender, sir, or is it your choice that you want to go ahead and speak for yourself when you get to that trial date?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-7\">Jones: Your Honor, first of all, I have talked to some private attorneys in reference to this case as the State already knows.... I decided that I\u2019m ready to proceed by defending myself, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">Judge Caroom followed up with questions similar to those asked by Judge Hackner, inquiring to ensure Jones knowingly and voluntarily waived counsel. After finding that Jones had waived counsel, the court moved on to determine Ms. Sandler\u2019s motion to quash the subpoena. Jones agreed that Ms. Sandler had no personal knowledge of the facts and all parties agreed that she should be excused from having to testify at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>Jones took advantage of the 25 April hearing to claim that he had not received any discovery. The State averred that it sent some discovery to him at the jail, but that there had been some problem with it getting to him because of an incorrect Department of Corrections (DOC) number.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The prosecutor proffered that she had sent \u201chundreds and hundreds of pages of discovery.\u201d Jones admitted that he received police reports, but claimed he had not received audio and video discovery or medical reports. The State reported that the former had been sent the Friday prior to the hearing. The prosecutor also represented that she subpoenaed the medical reports, but that the subpoena remained outstanding. Jones argued that he was prejudiced by the State\u2019s failure to provide these discovery materials and therefore the case against him should be dismissed, claiming \u201cwith the passage of time and continuous confinement ... [h]ow can I prepare ... without the discovery?\u201d Regarding the discovery situation, Judge Caroom opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-5\">[a]s to discovery ... the State should not be permitted to use the tapes and medical records[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] in its case because of the delay in production of those to you. They can present anything based on ... the police reports____ That was disclosed to you apparently ... many weeks ago. However, as to the medical records and the actual audiotapes themselves, I would exclude those. Unless, sir, if you want to put them in you can offer them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">The court explained to Jones that, if he chose in his defense to submit partial information from the tapes, the State then may be able to offer other evidence to complete the \u201cpicture\u201d created thereby. The court continued,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-9\">[s]o you ought to be cautious in offering some part of it yourself. Now the other aspect, sir, that you are raising is if you think that you don\u2019t have enough time to- complete <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>preparation of your case because you haven\u2019t had a chance to listen to the tapes yet. You have not asked for a postponement. All you have asked is [that] the case be dismissed. I am denying your request to dismiss it. If you are asking for a postponement that would have to be considered by Judge Manck [the County Administrative Judge], and you need to make that request ASAP if you want to make it____ Any question about that, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-6\">Jones: Not in particular reference to that. I\u2019m crystal clear on that....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">As the hearing continued, Jones questioned whether he had received all the police reports. He asserted that he had received only police reports from Montgomery County, but none from Anne Arundel County. The court found it prudent to have what it called a \u201cstatus conference and continued hearing\u201d to determine what discovery materials he had received. The court scheduled this hearing for the following week (3 May 2005) and instructed the State that it would need to provide evidence showing that Jones had received all required discovery materials. If those materials had not been provided, postponement of trial or dismissal for failure to provide discovery materials would again be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">Jones again appeared, without counsel, before Judge Ca-room on 3 May 2005. He repeatedly declined to request a postponement in order to have more time to prepare for the trial, stating that he preferred to proceed to trial on 10 May 2005. The transcript of the hearing chronicles that the court again asked Jones if he should be representing himself. He reiterated that this was his choice. In reference to the discovery dispute, Jones elected that he would not need the audio, video, and medical records at trial. Nonetheless, with regard to the delivery of 937 pages of written police reports, he made a \u201cmotion to dismiss for violation of discovery rules.\u201d The State showed, and the court found, that Jones signed for and received piecemeal delivery at the jail of various discovery materials on the 11th, 13th, and 21st of April. Additionally, he received anew, in a single delivery on 28 April, the full 937 pages of police reports. The court, in denying Jones\u2019s motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>to dismiss, nonetheless urged him, \u201c[t]he Court is not going to count it against you [if you ask] for a postponement.\u201d The Court continued, \u201cif this case is delayed a few extra days or even a few weeks extra, however much time you might like, it is not going to make a big impact.\u201d \u201cI will give you as much time as you want to prepare, or at least I think that if you asked for a postponement [the] Court would give you more time to prepare.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Jones expressed some concern over his inability to interview witnesses while he was incarcerated. The court responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgsD\">Well, sir, it is not the job of the Court to be a Defense lawyer for you and tell you how to arrange for witnesses to be interviewed and how to have them subpoenaed and so forth. If you wanted a lawyer you were given the opportunity and the advice about how to make those arrangements ---- A lawyer could arrange to have another person go out and interview that person for you, an investigator. He or she ... could go out and interview them himself. But if you have some built in constraints in DOC I am not going to advise you on ... other methods that you might use. That would be up to you to figure out yourself if you are representing yourself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-7\">Again, sir, if you think that more time would solve the situation I will give you a last opportunity today. You can still ask for more time. We will send the case upstairs and you can request that postponement and in all likelihood Judge Manck would grant it. Do you want to ask that, or do you want to go ahead in the position that you are in? Jones: As of today, Your Honor, I am not postponing this trial date.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">Accordingly, the case remained scheduled for trial on 10 May 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">On the morning of 10 May 2005, a hearing on Jones\u2019s request for a postponement of trial took place before Judge Pamela L. North, designee of the County Administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Judge. The transcript of the hearing shows that she questioned Jones concerning his lack of an attorney.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-4\">The Court: Okay, and having considered what the charges are I see that you are here without an attorney today, is that right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-5\">Jones: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-6\">The Court: All right. Did you think of getting an attorney before today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-7\">Jones: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-8\">I didn\u2019t want one, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">Judge North asked Jones the same questions that Judge Hackner and Judge Caroom asked concerning his waiver of counsel. He shifted the verbal exchange to his ongoing complaints about the discovery situation. He asked Judge North if he could have a continuance to review the discovery, claiming he hadn\u2019t had a chance to go through the many pages. She asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-10\">The Court: Okay. Sir, will the request for postponement have any bearing on ... whether or not you want to have an attorney represent you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-11\">Jones: Well, right now I haven\u2019t made that decision, but I want to contemplate ... that decision in reference to ... my continuance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-12\">The Court: Okay. All right. Well, sir, you do ... understand ... that you don\u2019t have an unlimited time to decide whether you want an attorney or not. That decision has to be made between your initial appearance date and your trial date, and today is your first trial date.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] Now I am not saying whether I would grant you a postponement or not, but I am just explaining to you that is the time period when you have to make the decision about wanting an attorney or not. Because we expect all defendants to come into Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>knowing whether they want an attorney and actually having their attorney with them on the trial date.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Judge North attempted to separate Jones\u2019s decision to represent himself from his discovery complaint for seeking a trial postponement. She asked, \u201ccan we just decide the waiver of counsel issue first____ Is there any connection between the fact that you did not get to finish looking at all your discovery and whether or not you want an attorney?\u201d Jones evaded a forthright response, stating that he \u201cwould like to keep [his] options open in reference to that.\u201d The Administrative Judge\u2019s designee allowed him to renew his claim that he had not received discovery properly. He reiterated that the' discovery problems raised previously entitled him to a postponement. In response, the State pointed out that Judge Caroom, when Jones appeared before him on 25 April and 3 May, asked him if he would like a postponement and that he had declined to make such a request. The State argued that \u201cthese issues were all exhaustively litigated.\u201d The State continued, \u201cwe have brought witnesses in from all over the State, from Montgomery County ..., Baltimore City, ... [and] Annapolis ...,\u201d concluding that \u201c[h]e is just trying to stall this trial, and it is a shameless tactic and you should consult with Judge Caroom and deny the Defendant\u2019s postponement.\u201d The exchange between the Judge, the prosecutor, ' and Jones continued, bouncing between waiver of counsel and the discovery situation. When further questioned about why he had not sought a continuance before Judge Caroom, Jones reiterated that he wanted to keep his options open. He continued,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-9\">[a]s of today I\u2019m stating for the records that I don\u2019t have adequate time to go through this discovery. That\u2019s one. Two is the fact that I\u2019m in limbo as far as getting some counsel[ ] in reference to these charges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-10\">I feel content with what I\u2019m basically doing. But my whole point as far as today is concerned is that I would like ... a continuance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>Judge North questioned Jones as to whether he was consulting attorneys and whether he had funds to engage a private attorney. He responded that he did consult with attorneys, but that he was indigent. She observed that he had had six months to apply for a Public Defender. When pressed on whether he needed an attorney, Jones again responded that he wanted to keep his options open. Judge North responded, \u201cWe can\u2019t just postpone cases indefinitely as you can imagine and let people reconsider and reconsider their options.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">After a brief recess, Judge North ruled on Jones\u2019s request for postponement.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">[CJlearly Judge Caroom had asked repeatedly it appears ... whether or not Defendant would want a postponement and that you declined that and said numerous times\u2014he made that request to you and you said no---- Now the State is disadvantaged. They have all their witnesses here today. So I am not going to grant your request for a postponement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">Evincing an incomprehension of what \u201cNo\u201d means in any of its parts, Jones continued to press his arguments before her. Once again, he bounced between the discovery and counsel issues until Judge North stopped him and renewed her denial of his postponement request:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-10\">The Court: Okay. Your request is denied, sir. And part of the reason, sir, is that you had this opportunity at least on three occasions\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-11\">Jones: Well, I\u2019m not capable of representing myself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-12\">The Court: Three occasions on May 3rd you could have asked for a postponement. You said you didn\u2019t need any additional time to prepare. You knew you had 900 pages of discovery, and also the fact that ... you have answered my questions that you made no attempt to get a Public Defender ... you would be a lot better off with a Public Defender....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-13\">The trial proceeded the same day. Judge Paul G. Goetzke, the assigned trial judge, inquired of Jones if he wanted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>elect a jury or a bench trial. He responded that he wanted an attorney to represent him. The court, however, finding that this issue had been considered and determined by Judge North, denied the request. Jones next asked that he be sent back to Judge North. This request also was denied. After explaining the characteristics of a jury trial in great detail, Judge Goetzke asked whether there was anything that he should know that would preclude Jones from making a knowing and intelligent decision about the mode of trial he wished. Jones again asserted that he needed counsel. He averred that he was not capable of making a decision on the mode of trial. The court, however, determined that Jones was capable of making that decision based upon his education and mental and physical condition. After Jones insisted that he did riot have the capacity to make the decision and refused to make it, the court elected a jury trial for him in order to protect his fundamental right. During the jury selection, Jones again asked for legal representation. His request was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Trial proceeded with Jones representing himself. Throughout the trial, he continued to protest that he needed legal representation. At one point, he told the jury he had been forced to represent himself. In closing arguments, he emphasized to the jury that he had done a lot of things during the case that he didn\u2019t know how to do; that he did not know how to defend himself. The trial took five days. At its conclusion, the jury convicted Jones of two counts of second degree assault, two counts of kidnaping, one count of resisting arrest, one count of reckless driving, one count of negligent driving, and one count of failure to maintain a reasonable and prudent speed. He was acquitted of two counts of first degree assault and one count of second degree assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">At sentencing, Jones claimed that he finally had procured counsel, although counsel was not present and he admitted that he had not paid an attorney to represent him. Judge Goetzke responded, \u201c[a]ll right, sir. You have been using this issue time and time ... again in your case, and that is an attempt to buy you\u2014to get postponements in this case, because you show up at court without a lawyer and then you ask <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>for one.\u201d Jones was sentenced to 30 years\u2019 incarceration, as noted previously, and fines totaling $1500.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Jones, represented by an Assistant Public Defender in the Appellate Division of the Office of the State Public Defender, appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, presenting four arguments for reversal: 1) he was improperly denied his right to the assistance of counsel; 2) his postponement requests were denied improperly; 3) the trial court failed to comply with the provisions of Maryland Rule 4-215; and 4) the trial judge erred in failing to merge for sentencing purposes the convictions for speeding and negligent driving into that for reckless driving. The intermediate appellate court decided the appeal in a reported opinion. <em>Jones v. State, </em>175 Md.App. 58, 924 A.2d 336 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Of pertinence to the case as it reaches us, the intermediate appellate court determined that Jones expressly waived his right to counsel. <em>Jones, </em>175 Md.App. at 79, 924 A.2d at 348. The court next considered whether Judge Goetzke properly denied Jones the right to revoke his waiver of counsel. <em>Id. </em>Finding that a postponement would have been necessary if the revocation were to be granted, the court noted that only the County Administrative Judge (or his/her designee) was authorized to exercise that discretion. <em>Jones, </em>175 Md.App. at 79-85, 924 A.2d at 348-51. The Court of Special Appeals found that Judge North, acting in that capacity, properly exercised her discretion and that the postponement request was properly denied. <em>Id. </em>Further, the Court of Special Appeals determined that Judge Goetzke had not abused his discretion in finding that Judge North had determined the postponement for the purposes of securing counsel. <em>Jones, </em>175 Md.App. at 84-85, 924 A.2d at 351-52. Finally, the court determined that Judge Goetzke properly exercised his discretion in denying Jones\u2019s request to be sent back to Judge North. <em>Id. </em>The intermediate appellate court also examined his assertion that Judge North improperly denied his request for a postponement to further review the State\u2019s provided discovery materials. Applying to Judge North\u2019s actions the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>standard of Maryland Rule 4-271 (a),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the court determined that she had not abused her discretion in denying Jones\u2019s request. <em>Jones, </em>175 Md.App. at 85-86, 924 A.2d at 352. Finally, the Court of Special Appeals agreed with his claim that the convictions for negligent driving and failure to maintain a reasonable and prudent speed merged into the conviction for reckless driving as lesser included offenses. <em>Jones, </em>175 Md.App. at 86-89, 924 A.2d at 352-54. Thus, the court vacated Jones\u2019s fines for \u201cnegligent driving\u201d and \u201cfailure to maintain a reasonable and prudent speed,\u201d but otherwise affirmed the convictions. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Granting Jones\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (401 Md. 172, 931 A.2d 1095 (2007)),. we accepted this case to consider whether Judge North, the County Administrative Judge\u2019s designee, and Judge Goetzke, the trial judge, properly exercised their respective discretion regarding Jones\u2019s postponement requests and his attempt to revoke his waiver of the right to counsel.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">\n<em>A.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">According to the Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, made applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defense.\u201d Doubtlessly, \u201c[t]he right of one charged with [a] crime to counsel may not be deemed fundamental and essential to fair trials in some countries, but it is in ours.\u201d <em>Gideon v.

He lacks both the skill and knowledge adequately to prepare his defense, even though he have a perfect one. He requires the guiding hand of counsel at every step in the proceedings against him.

If that be true of men of intelligence, how much more true is it of the ignorant and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>illiterate, or those of feeble intellect. If in any case, civil of criminal, a state or federal court were arbitrarily to refuse to hear a party by counsel, employed by and appearing for him, it reasonably may not be doubted that such a refusal would be a denial of a hearing, and, therefore, of due process in the constitutional sense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-5\"><em>Powell v.

Such a relinquishment is established by an inquiry ascertaining first, whether a defendant \u201cclearly and unequivocally\u201d wants to defend himself/herself, and second, whether the defendant has made a competent and intelligent waiver of the right to counsel. <em>Snead v.

The right to revoke an earlier waiver of counsel, however, is not an unqualified right exercisable without regard to the prevailing circumstances in, or posture of, a given case. Specifically, if a defendant, having waived counsel expressly, desires thereafter to revoke that waiver, \u201cno postponement of a scheduled trial or hearing date will be granted to obtain counsel <em>unless the court finds it is in the interest of justice to do so.\u201d </em>Maryland Rule 4-215(b) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">As the Court of Special Appeals noted in this case, \u201c[a] discretionary ruling will generally not be deemed an abuse of discretion unless it is \u2018well removed from any center mark imagined by the reviewing court\u2019 or is \u2018beyond the fringe of what\u2019 the reviewing court \u2018deems minimally acceptable.\u2019\u201d <em>Jones, </em>175 Md.App. at 81, 924 A.2d at 349 (citing <em>Gray v.

As the Court of Special Appeals noted in its opinion in the present case, \u201cthat phrase is found elsewhere in the Maryland Rules of Procedure, and its meaning has- been illuminated in the case law.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>175 Md.App. at 80, 924 A.2d at 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">In the context of Maryland Rule 4-331 (a), the term \u201cin the interest of justice\u201d is the standard used by a trial court in determining whether to order a new trial in a criminal matter. The Court of Special Appeals interpreted the term in that context in <em>Love v. State, </em>95 Md.App. 420, 427, 621 A.2d 910, 919 (1993) as \u201cvirtually open-ended.\u201d The court noted that the sweep of the term encompasses a \u201cbroad latitude.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Gray, </em>388 Md. at 382 n. 7, 879 A.2d at 1073 n. 7, we addressed the phrase as used in describing the basis upon which a court may reopen a post-conviction proceeding\u2014when it determines that such an action is in the \u201cinterest of justice.\u201d <em>See also </em>Maryland Code, Criminal Procedure Article (2001), \u00a7 7-104. There, we agreed that the term includes \u201ca wide array of possibilities.\u201d <em>Gray, </em>388 Md. at 382 n. 7, 879 A.2d at 1073 n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">The phrase is used in many other places in the Maryland Code and the Maryland Rules. <em>See, e.g., </em>Maryland Code, Courts and Judicial Proceedings (1974, 2006 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 10-408 (empowering the court to determine what portions of an intercepted communication \u201cin the interest of justice\u201d may be provided to an aggrieved person for inspection); Maryland Code, Criminal Procedure (2001), \u00a7 12-401 (noting that a court may take actions that protect the right of innocent persons that are \u201cin the interest of justice\u201d); Maryland Code, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>Family Law (1984, 2006 Repl.

As the Court of Special Appeals noted, \u201c[tjhis conclusion is in accord with the general rule that the decision to grant or deny a postponement is discretionary.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>175 Md.App. at 81, 924 A.2d at 349 (citing <em>Abeokuto v. State, </em>391 Md. 289, 329, 893 A.2d 1018, 1041 (2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Jones suggests that, in aid of the exercise of this discretion, this Court should adopt five factors he discovered in a California case, <em>People v. Elliott, </em>70 Cal.App.3d 984, 139 Cal.Rptr. 205 (1977).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Were we to do this, he avers, a trial court may \u201cexercise meaningful discretion in ruling on a defendant\u2019s request to change from self-representation to representation by counsel.\u201d We decline to bind trial courts to such specific considerations when confronting whether to grant a defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>who expressly waives counsel previously, a postponement of trial to secure counsel. An individual case presents individual considerations tailored to its unique circumstances.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">For example, in <em>Love, </em>the intermediate appellate court discussed an illustrative list of grounds on which a new trial might be granted. 95 Md.App. at 427, 621 A.2d at 914 (citing <em>State v. Devers &amp; Webster, </em>260 Md. 360, 374, 272 A.2d 794, 801 (1971)). The court noted the difficulties that adhere, however, when appellate courts place limiting factors on the exercise of broad discretion \u201cin the interest of justice.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-6\">It was the holding of <em>State v. Devers and Webster </em>that a new trial could be granted on grounds of evidentiary insufficiency only in the case where the evidence was so legally insufficient, as a matter of law, that it could not, even if believed totally and given maximum weight, support the verdict. Since that time, the decision in the case of <em>In re Petition for Writ of Prohibition, </em>312 Md. 280, 539 A.2d 664 (1988), has overruled that limiting provision of <em>State v. Devers and Webster </em>and empowered the trial judge to grant a new trial not simply when the evidence is legally insufficient as a matter of law but also when the verdict, in the judgment of the trial judge, is so against the weight of the evidence as to constitute a miscarriage of justice. This broader latitude is in keeping with the provision ... that a judge may order a new trial \u201cin the interest of justice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQx\"><em>Love, </em>95 Md.App. at 427, 621 A.2d at 914.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">The prevailing common law standard for the review of the exercise of trial court discretion\u2014an abuse of discretion exists when a ruling does not \u201c \u2018logically follow from the findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>upon which it supposedly rests\u2019 \u201d or when a ruling \u201c \u2018has no reasonable relationship to its announced objective\u2019 \u201d\u2014suffices to guide trial courts in acting on a request for postponement of trial based on a defendant\u2019s desire to secure counsel. <em>Gray, </em>388 Md. at 383, 879 A.2d at 1073-74 (quoting <em>Dehn v. Edgecombe, </em>384 Md. 606, 628, 865 A.2d 603, 616 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">\n<em>D.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">We turn now to whether the denial of Jones\u2019s request for a postponement was \u201can abuse of discretion.\u201d Of central import to this question is the issue of <em>who </em>has discretion to act on a trial postponement request. As to this, the Maryland Rules are clear. Only a County Administrative Judge, or that judge\u2019s designee, may act on a postponement request advanced in a criminal trial in a circuit court. Maryland Rule 4-271 (\u201cOn motion of a party, or on the court\u2019s initiative, and for good cause shown, the county administrative judge or that judge\u2019s designee may grant a change of a circuit court trial date.\u201d). Despite Jones\u2019s attempts to persuade us otherwise, a full review of the record indicates that Judge North, acting as the designee of then County Administrative Judge Manck, properly denied a postponement upon consideration of both Jones\u2019s desire for more time to review discovery and his late-blooming desire for an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Jones characterizes the substance of his appearance before Judge North as one in which she considered only his request for a postponement based on his asserted need for additional time to review the police reports delivered as discovery responses. Jones asserts that Judge North did not consider or rule on a request for time to obtain counsel. Rather, according to Jones, he broached the issue of a postponement in order to procure counsel for the first time solely before Judge Goetzke, the trial judge, at which point Jones asked to be returned to Judge North\u2019s chambers or courtroom. Jones selectively proffers portions of the record before Judge North so that it might appear that the issue of counsel was not part of her postponement consideration. Jones focuses on two points in the transcript. First, after Judge North initially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>brought up the issue of counsel, Jones asserted \u201c[w]ell, actually, Your Honor, this [postponement request] is not an issue of representation as far as counsel. This is an issue in reference to me having discovery.\u201d Second, at the end of the hearing, Judge North stated to Jones, \u201cyou would be a lot better off with a public defender who has been to law school.\u201d While these short brush strokes may create an illusion that Judge North did not determine whether Jones sought or should receive a postponement to procure counsel, i.e., revoking his prior express waiver of counsel, it is not difficult for us to color the remaining numbers in the overall picture that is the complete record. In consideration of the full record, we conclude that Judge North considered Jones\u2019s postponement request based on a late articulation of a desire to secure counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Our review of the transcript indicates that Jones demonstrated, as matters unfolded before Judge North, an evolving realization that he wanted counsel. Judge North considered whether to grant Jones a continuance to procure counsel before finally and conclusively denying postponement of the trial. The Court questioned Jones, \u201c[s]ir, will the request for postponement have any bearing on ... whether or not you want to have an attorney represent you?\u201d Jones responded, \u201c[w]ell, right now I haven\u2019t made that decision, but I want to contemplate ... that decision in reference to ... my continuance.\u201d Later, Jones stated, \u201cas of today I\u2019m stating for the records that I don\u2019t have adequate time to go through this discovery. That\u2019s one. Two is the fact that I\u2019m in limbo as far as getting some counseling in reference to these charges.\u201d Jones explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-6\">[b]ecause I had the opportunity to confer with a few attorneys in reference to the nature of the charges the State is charging me with.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-8\">And under their understanding, I mean, I\u2014the only reason why I\u2019m basically doing this, Your Honor, is the fact that I feel content with what basically I\u2019m doing. But my whole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>point as far as today is concerned is that I would like ... a continuance</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">On the State\u2019s suggestion that Judge North confer with Judge Caroom, before whom Jones had declined three times to seek a postponement, Judge North stated that she would speak to him. Before she might, however, she asked Jones, \u201c[s]ir, what attempts have you made to speak to attorneys? You said you conferred with several attorneys.\u201d Jones responded that he consulted with attorneys every other day from the jail, but that he did not have the funds to pay a private attorney. Judge North pushed on, \u201c[w]ell did you have a reasonable expectation that someone was going to take your case for free?\u201d In response, Jones alluded to the \u201chigh-profile\u201d nature of the case, pointing out that it had been going on for two years, and that he believed there were double-jeopardy issues. He concluded, \u201cI would like this continuance ... to weigh out my options.\u201d The court responded by pointing out that Jones had had six months to think about and pursue his options concerning representation. The court continued,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-6\">you can\u2019t keep your options open forever. There are time limits. The time for you to decide whether you wanted an attorney was between that November date and your trial date. You are supposed to consider those options [and] come in with your attorney on your trial date. We can\u2019t just postpone cases indefinitely as you can imagine and let people reconsider and reconsider their options.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">The dialogue continued. Jones \u201cclarified\u201d that he would accept a private attorney or a pro bono attorney appointed by Judge North, but that he did not want a public defender. At this point, the court recessed so that Judge North could review Judge Caroom\u2019s notes. The court returned and announced, \u201c[s]o, sir, I think that you have been offered the opportunity to have a postponement prior to today. Now the State is disadvantaged. They have all their witnesses here today. So I am not going to grant your request for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>postponement.\u201d Yet, while still before Judge North, Jones repeated his arguments regarding his asserted inability to review discovery and his lack of counsel. The hearing finally ended with the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-5\">The Court: Okay. Your request is denied, sir. And part of the reason, sir, is that you had this opportunity at least on three occasions\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHZ\">Jones: <em>Well, I\u2019m not capable of representing myself </em>The Court: Three occasions on May 3rd you could have asked for a postponement. You said you didn\u2019t need any additional time to prepare. You knew you had 900 pages of discovery, <em>and also the fact that ... you have answered my questions that you made no attempt to get a Public Defender </em>... you would be a lot better off with a Public Defender....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">Although Jones <em>may </em>have begun the hearing before Judge North with the purpose of seeking a continuance to review discovery responses, as events unfolded, Jones apparently came to the view, albeit rather late in the \u201cday\u201d of his case, that he wished counsel going forward and needed a continuance from Judge North to pursue that. When Judge -North told Jones that he would not have, unlimited time to decide whether to obtain counsel, he tried to negotiate for an attorney other than a public defender.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Judge North denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>postponement even as Jones continued exclaiming, \u201c[wjell, I\u2019m not capable of representing myself.\u201d Just as the panel of the Court of Special Appeals concluded from this record, we find that Judge North, the designee of the County Administrative Judge, considered, when denying his request for a postponement, Jones\u2019s pleas regarding discovery and his epiphany regarding the desirability of legal counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Jones also contends that Judge North did not exercise properly her discretion in denying Jones\u2019s request for a postponement in another regard. He asserts that Judge North could not have acted independently because she reviewed Judge Caroom\u2019s notes and considered them in denying Jones\u2019s request for a postponement. Alternatively, Jones argues that Judge North abused her discretion by denying Jones\u2019s request for a postponement because, in his view, \u201ccomplete discovery\u201d was not provided until twelve days before trial and no previous request for a postponement had been made by Jones. Jones\u2019s argument here is couched solely in terms of the discovery situation because, in his view, he made no request before Judge North for a postponement to secure counsel. As noted above, we disagree with this characterization of the record. We conclude that Judge North properly exercised her discretion in considering the postponement for <em>either </em>reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">As to his first contention, Jones would have us believe that Judge North, after listening to Jones\u2019s request for a postponement, took a recess to review Judge Caroom\u2019s notes, and, upon returning and without hearing further from either party, ruled that \u201cbased on Judge Caroom\u2019s findings a postponement is denied.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The transcript tells another tale. Jones\u2019s hearing before Judge North consumed nearly 100 pages of transcript. During this time, Judge North questioned Jones extensively about both the discovery issue and the need for an attorney. As to the discovery matter, Jones <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>received a full version of the relevant discovery responses at least 12 days before trial. Moreover, the State explained that the discovery responses also had been provided in three batches prior to the date on which the sum version was provided, and that Judge Caroom had not found the State in violation of discovery rules thereby. Judge North offered Jones the opportunity to explain why he did not want a postponement a week earlier when it was virtually offered to him by Judge Caroom. The record demonstrates that Judge North considered Jones\u2019s answers. She observed that nothing had changed between the time of Jones\u2019s appearance before Judge Caroom and his appearance before her.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">We disagree with Jones\u2019s characterization that Judge North could not be said to have acted independently assuming she reviewed Judge Caroom\u2019s notes. Indeed, as we wrote in <em>State v. Frazier, </em>298 Md. 422, 453, 470 A.2d 1269, 1285 (1984), an important reason that we delegate to a County Administrative Judge or his/her designee the power to decide postponements is that \u201cit is the administrative judge who has an overall view of the court\u2019s business.\u201d We find it <em>preferable </em>that such a judge review all relevant and available facts when determining whether to grant or deny a postponement. We said in <em>Frazier, </em>\u201cthe judgment of the administrative judge, concerning the need for a postponement and the rescheduling of a criminal case, should be accorded the greatest weight.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Abeokuto v. State, </em>391 Md. 289, 329, 893 A.2d 1018, 1041 (2006) (\u201cThe decision whether to grant a request for continuance is committed to the sound discretion of the court.\u201d (citing <em>Ware v. State, </em>360 Md. 650, 706, 759 A.2d 764, 794 (2000))). We find unpersuasive Jones\u2019s arguments that we should disturb the judgment here. It appears to us that Judge North\u2019s decision \u201clogically follow[s] from the findings upon which it supposedly rests\u201d and that the ruling has a \u201creasonable relationship to its announced objective\u201d\u2014to uphold the \u201cinterests of justice.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Gray, </em>388 Md. at 383, 879 A.2d at 1073-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>\n<em>E.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">We reject Jones\u2019s contention that he was improperly denied by Judge Goetzke a second chance to appear before Judge North. The lynchpin of this argument is that \u201c[Jones\u2019s] request for a postponement in order to secure the assistance of counsel was adduced for the first time before Judge Goetzke.\u201d We already determined that this is a mischaracterization of the record. While it was within Judge Goetzke\u2019s discretion to send Jones back to Judge North, he was not duty-bound to do so on the facts of this case. Recognizing that Judge North exercised her discretion on the issue, Judge Goetzke stated, \u201c[t]he issue has been exhaustively considered in this Court. The fact that you have a new Judge does not change the previous rulings, but you may\u2014I will consider that motion to be renewed and denied again.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The record indicates that Jones had many opportunities to secure counsel prior to the day of trial, but knowingly waived those opportunities despite the solicitous suggestions by various judges that he would be better off with legal representation. <em>Compare Richardson v. State, </em>381 Md. 348, 361, 849 A.2d 487, 495 (2004), where we held that (\u201cmerely showing a defendant a videotape of a judge providing the advice and instruction required by Rule 4-215(a) is an insufficient predicate for a finding of waiver of counsel____ At the least there must be some inquiry to determine the defendant\u2019s understanding of the advice or instructions so given.\u201d). We agree with the Court of Special Appeals that <em>Fowlkes v. State, </em>311 Md. 586, 536 A.2d 1149 (1988), is \u201cparticularly apt in this case.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>175 Md.App. at 84-85, 924 A.2d at 351. There we upheld a trial court\u2019s denial of Fowlkes\u2019s day-of-trial request to discharge his attorney. We noted, \u201c[although the right to counsel generally embodies a right to retain counsel of one\u2019s choice, a defendant may not manipulate this right so as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>to frustrate the orderly administration of criminal justice.\u201d <em>Fowlkes, </em>311 Md. at 605, 536 A.2d at 1159. We see in this case the sentiment of <em>Fowlkes </em>echoed by both Judge North (\u201cWe can\u2019t just postpone cases indefinitely ... and let people reconsider and reconsider their options.\u201d) and Judge Goetzke (\u201cAll right, sir. You have been using this issue time and time ... again in your case, and that is an attempt to buy you\u2014to get postponements in this case, because you show up at court without a lawyer and then you ask for one.\u201d). For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that Judge North and Judge Goetzke properly exercised their respective discretion in this case to deny Jones \u00e1 postponement of his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b301-10\">. Maryland Rule 4-213 states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-11\">(c) In Circuit Court Following Arrest or Summons. The initial appearance of the defendant in circuit court occurs when the defendant (1) is brought before the court by reason of execution of a warrant pursuant to Rule 4-212(e) or (f)(2). or (2) appears in person or by written notice of counsel in response to a summons. In either case, if the defendant appears without counsel the court shall proceed in accordance with Rule 4-215. If the appearance is by reason of execution of a warrant, the court shall inform the defendant of each offense with which the defendant is charged, ensure that the defendant has a copy of the charging document, and determine eligibility for pretrial release pursuant to Rule 4-216.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b302-9\">. This rule reads in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-10\">(a) First Appearance in Court Without Counsel. At the defendant\u2019s first appearance in court without counsel, or when the defendant appears in the District Court without counsel, demands a jury trial, and the record does not disclose prior compliance with this section by a judge, the court shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-11\">(1) Make certain that the defendant has received a copy of the charging document containing notice as to the right to counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>(2) Inform the defendant of the right to counsel and of the importance of assistance of counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-6\">(3) Advise the defendant of the nature of the charges in the charging document, and the allowable penalties, including mandatory penalties, if any.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-7\">(4) Conduct a waiver inquiry pursuant to section (b) of this Rule if the defendant indicates a desire to waive counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-8\">(5) If trial is to be conducted on a subsequent date, advise the defendant that if the defendant appears for trial without counsel, the court could determine that the defendant waived counsel and proceed to trial with the defendant unrepresented by counsel. The clerk shall note compliance with this section in the file or on the docket.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-9\">(b) Express Waiver of Counsel. If a defendant who is not represented by counsel indicates a desire to waive counsel, the court may not accept the waiver until after an examination of the defendant on the record conducted by the court, the State\u2019s Attorney, or both, the court determines and announces on the record that the defendant is knowingly and voluntarily waiving the right to counsel. If the file or docket does not reflect compliance with section (a) of this Rule, the court shall comply with that section as part of the waiver inquiry. The court shall ensure that compliance with this section is noted in the file or <em>on </em>the docket. At any subsequent appearance of the defendant before the court, the docket or file notation of compliance shall be prima facie proof of the defendant\u2019s express waiver of counsel. After there has been an express waiver, no postponement of a scheduled trial or hearing date will be granted to obtain counsel unless the court finds it is in the interest of justice to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-10\">(d) Waiver by Inaction\u2014Circuit Court. If a defendant appears in circuit court without counsel on the date set for hearing or trial, indicates a desire to have counsel, and the record shows compliance with section (a) of this Rule, either in a previous appearance in the circuit court or in an appearance in the District Court in a case in which the defendant demanded a jury trial, the court shall permit the defendant to explain the appearance without counsel. If the court finds that there is a meritorious reason for the defendant\u2019s appearance without counsel, the court shall continue the action to a later time and advise the defendant that if counsel does not enter an appearance by that time, the action will proceed to trial with the defendant unrepresented by counsel. If the court finds that there is no meritorious reason for the defendant\u2019s appearance without counsel, the court may determine that the defendant has waived counsel by failing or refusing to obtain counsel and may proceed with the hearing or trial.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b307-13\">. <em>In </em>relevant part, this rule reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-14\">Discovery and inspection in circuit court shall be as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-15\">(a) Disclosure Without Request.
