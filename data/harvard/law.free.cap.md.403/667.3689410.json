WILNER, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Aoa\">(Retired, specially assigned).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Appellant, Kevin Wilson-X, is upset at an order of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City directing him to pay $50 a month in child support. He complains that his only source of income, from which the child support would have to be paid, is in the form of Supplemental Security Income payments (SSI) he receives from the Social Security Administration and that, under both State and Federal law, those payments may not be counted as income for purposes of mandated child support. He thus asks that we reverse the child support order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because the issues raised by appellant that go to the validity of the child support order are not properly before us, we shall deny his request for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">What occurred in the Circuit Court needs to be considered in light of the statutory regime that governs the setting of child support in Maryland. The heart of that regime, embodied in Maryland Code, \u00a7 12-202(a) of the Family Law Article (FL), consists of (1) the requirement that, in any proceeding to establish or modify child support, the court must use the child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>support guidelines set forth in FL \u00a7 12-204, to the extent they are applicable, and (2) the creation of a rebuttable presumption that the amount of child support that would result from application of those guidelines is the correct amount to be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">The child support guidelines are based on the \u201ccombined adjusted actual income\u201d of the parents. The term \u201cactual income\u201d is defined very broadly in FL \u00a7 12-201(b). Section 12\u2014201(b)(5), however, excludes from the definition \u201cbenefits received from means-tested public assistance programs,\u201d including SSL Those kinds of benefits may not, therefore, be considered as \u201cactual income\u201d when determining child support under the guidelines. \u201cAdjusted actual income\u201d is calculated by deducting from \u201cactual income\u201d preexisting reasonable child support obligations actually paid, alimony or maintenance obligations actually paid, and, for purposes of this case, the actual cost of providing health insurance for a child for whom the parents are jointly and severally responsible. <em>See </em>\u00a7 12\u2014201(c).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">The format of the guidelines is to establish, first, the amount of \u201cbasic child support obligation,\u201d which is done through a table set forth in FL \u00a7 12-204(e). That table specifies a monthly dollar amount based on the combined adjusted actual income of the parents and the number of children involved. Where the combined adjusted actual income of the parents is between 0 and $850 per month, the table sets the basic child support obligation as \u201c$20-$150 Per Month, Based on Resources And Living Expenses Of Obligor And Number Of Children Due Support.\u201d The basic child support obligation, as established from the table, is then divided between the parents in proportion to their adjusted actual incomes. <em>See </em>FL \u00a7 12-204(a)(l). The custodial parent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>is presumed to spend that parent\u2019s total child support obligation directly on the child. With exceptions not relevant here, the non-custodial parent\u2019s child support obligation is to be satisfied by payments to the non-custodial parent. <em>See </em>FL \u00a7 12-204(0-</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">This case began with a petition filed by the State\u2019s Attorney in February, 2006, to establish that appellant was the father of a minor child, Shallah, determine who should have custody of the child, and establish appellant\u2019s child support obligation. The child, born in 1996, apparently lived with her mother and appellant until the couple separated in 2005. After reviewing the results of a blood test which indicated a 99.99% probability that he was the father, appellant decided not to contest paternity, and, as appellant did not then contest custody, the only issue was child support. At a hearing held before Judge Pierson on June 13, 2006, it was essentially stipulated that appellant was receiving SSI benefits. A document in the record from the Social Security Administration showed the monthly SSI benefit to be $603. Counsel for the State acknowledged that SSI income could not be considered in the calculation of actual income but argued that, under the guidelines, an award of between $20 and $150 was permissible where the income was between $100 and $800.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Counsel asked for an award of $50, noting that that amount was acceptable to the mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Appellant testified that he could not afford to pay any amount of child support. He said that his rent was $568 a month, his telephone bill was $56 per month, that he was on nine medicines, four of which were to treat his HIV condition, and that his \u201cco-pay\u201d for those medicines was $5, apparently per medicine. He gave no indication of what his other living expenses were\u2014food, clothing, heat and electricity, etc. Appellant said that he last worked about eight or nine years ago and that he lived alone. When the court noted that his necessary expenses exceeded his SSI benefits and suggested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>that he must have some other source of income, appellant acknowledged that he got money from his mother from time to time, although not recently. The child\u2019s mother, who was working part time and had income of her own, testified that appellant was living with a new girlfriend who received welfare benefits and was helping him pay the rent. Appellant denied that was the case. Having heard the evidence, the court concluded that appellant\u2019s testimony regarding his ability \u201cis not supported by the facts that he\u2019s demonstrated because it\u2019s clear that he has some means beyond those that he has actually produced to the court\u201d and that $50 \u201cis a reasonable amount of support.\u201d Upon that finding, the court entered a judgment that determined appellant to be the father, awarded custody of the child to the mother, and ordered appellant to pay $50 per month in child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">No appeal was taken from that June 13 order. On July 13, 2006, appellant, acting <em>pro se, </em>filed a motion for reconsideration in which he asked the court to \u201c[t]ake into consideration [appellant\u2019s] limited income and current established Bills and reduce set amount of child support.\u201d He also asked that the court establish visitation rights and award joint custody. Counsel from a non-profit organization entered her appearance on behalf of appellant and, in a request for hearing, averred that appellant\u2019s sole source of support was the SSI benefit, which may not be counted as income, that he was totally disabled, and that he was unable to supplement his income. The essence of her argument, articulated in a memorandum in support of the motion for reconsideration, was that \u201cif an individual\u2019s only income with which to pay child support is SSI, and the person cannot work, the court runs afoul of federal authority in ordering child support because it forces federal money to be used for a purpose other than that for which it was initially allocated, that is the survival of a disabled individual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Neither the motion for reconsideration nor counsel\u2019s written or oral argument in support of it alleged any new or changed circumstance, not considered by Judge Pierson, that would warrant a reduction in child support, but only that the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>had erred in establishing the $50 amount. At a hearing before Judge Doory in March, 2007, appellant noted that the monthly SSI benefit had been increased to $623, but claimed that was \u201call the money he has\u201d and that the law prohibited the court from imputing the SSI benefit as income. Appellant contended that Judge Pierson had ordered the $50 based on a finding that appellant lived with another individual who contributed to the rent, which freed up more of his income to pay the child support, and urged that it was legally inappropriate for the court to consider that person\u2019s contribution because she had no obligation to support appellant\u2019s child.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">The State responded that when a court applies the guidelines, it ordinarily does not consider the obligor\u2019s general expenses; the guidelines are based on gross income, not expenses. When the combined adjusted actual income falls below a minimum amount, however\u2014when it is between 0 and $850\u2014the guidelines require that the court consider the resources and living expenses of the obligor, and <em>that, </em>in the State\u2019s view, is what Judge Pierson did. On the evidence presented, he concluded that appellant had sufficient resources to pay $50 per month. Judge Doory, having apparently read the transcript of the hearing before Judge Pierson, which is in the record, decided not to interfere with Judge Pierson\u2019s decision and denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">This appeal was then filed, within 30 days after denial of the motion for reconsideration but long beyond the time allowed to appeal from Judge Pierson\u2019s order. We granted <em>certiorari </em>on our own initiative, before any meaningful proceedings in the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AfI\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">The first dispute between the parties is over the standard of review to be applied. Appellant recognizes that the only timely appeal was from the denial of his motion for reconsideration, that the ruling on a motion for reconsideration is ordinarily discretionary, and that the standard of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>review in such a circumstance is whether the court abused its discretion in denying the motion. Relying principally on <em>Child Support v. Shehan, </em>148 Md.App. 550, 813 A.2d 334 (2002) and <em>Gerland v. Gerland, </em>703 A.2d 70 (Pa.Super.1997), however, appellant contends that, when the issues presented are of statutory interpretation that have not previously been decided\u2014issues of first impression\u2014the court should apply a <em>de novo </em>standard of review. The State, of course, argues otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Neither <em>Child Support </em>nor <em>Gerland </em>support a departure from the abuse of discretion standard in this case. In both of those cases, there was a timely appeal from the judgment itself. In <em>Child Support, </em>the trial court had vacated a child support order because of a subsequent cohabitation between the parents, and it did so in a proceeding of which the custodial parent had not been given notice and did not appear. That, the Court of Special Appeals held, was error. In <em>Gerland, </em>a custodial parent complained about the trial court\u2019s refusal to require the non-custodial parent to pay private school tuition for the children and to include the children under his health insurance policy. The appellate court applied an abuse of discretion standard with respect to the tuition expenses and found no abuse, but it concluded that a Pennsylvania statute required the defendant to provide health insurance. The trial court\u2019s failure to implement that statutory requirement was therefore legal error, warranting a remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">This Court has recognized that trial judges do not have discretion to apply inappropriate legal standards, even when making decisions that are regarded as discretionary in nature. In <em>Pasteur v. Skevofilax, </em>396 Md. 405, 433, 914 A.2d 113, 130 (2007), we confirmed that \u201ca failure to consider the proper legal standard in reaching a decision constitutes an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>See also Ehrlich v. Perez, </em>394 Md. 691, 708, 908 A.2d 1220, 1230 (2006), citing <em>LeJeune v. Coin Acceptors, Inc., </em>381 Md. 288, 301, 849 A.2d 451, 459 (2004) and <em>Alston v. Alston, </em>331 Md. 496, 504, 629 A.2d 70, 74 (1993) for the proposition that \u201ceven with respect to a discretionary matter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>a trial court must exercise its discretion in accordance with correct legal standards.\u201d The standard of review remains abuse of discretion. The relevance of an asserted legal error, of substantive law, procedural requirements, or fact-finding unsupported by substantial evidence, lies in whether there has been such an abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">\n<em>Whose Discretion Is At Issue?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">There were two significant discretionary rulings made by the trial court in this case. The first, made by Judge Pierson, set the amount of child support at $50 per month. The second was that of Judge Doory, who, by holding a hearing and listening to appellant, did \u201creconsider\u201d Judge Pierson\u2019s order, but, in the en d, refused to disturb it.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">The complaint with respect to Judge Pierson\u2019s decision is that the setting of child support at $50 a month rested on the unlawful consideration of the SSI benefits received by appellant as income to him and the wrongful consideration of the girlfriend\u2019s contribution to some of appellant\u2019s living expenses. Had a timely appeal been filed from that decision, those complaints could have been addressed\u2014whether, in fact, Judge Pierson <em>did </em>regard the SSI benefits as income, whether he <em>did </em>consider the girlfriend\u2019s contribution, and whether, if so, it was error for him to do so. The problem, of course, is that there was no timely appeal from Judge Pierson\u2019s order, so even if he <em>did </em>wrongfully regard the SSI payments as income and wrongfully consider the girlfriend\u2019s contribution to living expenses, those issues are not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">The only issue properly before us is whether Judge Doory abused his discretion in refusing to vacate the $50 child support order, and we are not persuaded that he did. The record before Judge Doory could properly have led him to conclude that Judge Pierson did <em>not </em>count the SSI benefit as income. The State conceded that it was not income, and Judge Pierson was obviously aware of the statute that precludes consideration of such benefits in determining actual income. What Judge Pierson apparently relied on were the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>statutory guidelines themselves, which expressly permit a child support award of up to $150, even when there is 0 actual monthly income, depending on \u201cResources And Living Expenses Of Obligor And Number Of Children Due Support.\u201d Based on appellant\u2019s own testimony, part of which he did not credit, Judge Pierson concluded that appellant must have resources other than what he claimed, and, indeed, there was some evidence that he <em>did </em>have other resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The question facing Judge Doory was not whether he would have reached the same conclusion as Judge Pierson, but only whether that conclusion was so manifestly wrong and unjust that failure on his part to vacate the award would constitute an abuse of the wide discretion that attaches to rulings denying motions to vacate existing judgments, even those not yet enrolled. We have defined \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d in a variety of ways, all of them setting a very high threshold. In <em>Schade v. Board of Elections, </em>401 Md. 1, 34, 930 A.2d 304, 323-24 (2007), quoting from several earlier cases, we defined abuse as occurring when the discretion was \u201cmanifestly unreasonable, or exercised on untenable grounds, or for untenable reasons,\u201d or when \u201cno reasonable person would take the view adopted by the [trial] court.\u201d In <em>Touzeau v. Deffinbaugh, </em>394 Md. 654, 669, 907 A.2d 807, 816 (2006), quoting <em>Jenkins v. State, </em>375 Md. 284, 295-96, 825 A.2d 1008, 1015 (2003), we said that abuse occurs when the judge \u201cexercises discretion in an arbitrary or capricious manner or when he or she acts beyond the letter or reason of the law.\u201d Citing <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 3598, </em>347 Md. 295, 312, 701 A.2d 110, 118-19 (1997), we added in <em>Touzeau </em>that abuse may be found \u201cwhen the court acts \u2018without reference to any guiding rules or principles\u2019 \u201d or where the ruling under consideration is \u201c \u2018clearly against the logic and effect of facts and inferences before the court,\u2019 or when the ruling is Violative of fact and logic.\u2019 \u201d <em>Touzeau, </em>394 Md. at 669, 907 A.2d at 816. Judge Doory\u2019s ruling does not even approach any of those standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION AFFIRMED, WITH COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b700-8\">. The two questions raised in appellant\u2019s brief are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-9\">[1] \"Whether ordering child support, within the $20-$ 150 range permitted under Md. Code Ann Family Law Article, \u00a7 12-204(e) for those parents with combined incomes of less that $850.00, was proper when the Appellant's primary source of income proves Supplemental Social Security Income (\u2018SSI\u2019), federally allocated money specifically set aside under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1381 <em>et seq, </em>to provide a minimum level of support to those both indigent and disabled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-10\">[2] \"Whether the mandate that courts deviate from the guidelines only after providing careful factual analysis is so strong that the motions judge denial of reconsideration amounted to reversible error, particularly given that the Appellant lives on means-tested income and that the judge considered financial assistance provided by third parties to the Appellant in issuing his decision.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b701-7\">. By 2007 Md. Laws, chs. 35 and 36, the provision deducting the cost of health insurance from actual income was repealed, but that cost was added to the basic child support obligation and divided between the parents in proportion to their adjusted actual incomes. Those laws became effective October 1, 2007, which was after the child support order entered in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b702-6\">. As noted, the guidelines actually provided for an award of $20 to $150 where the combined adjusted actual income was between 0 and $850.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
