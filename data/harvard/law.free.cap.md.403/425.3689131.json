The questions arise from an appeal of a conviction in the United States Magistrate Court of driving a motor vehicle while the privilege to drive is suspended, a violation of Md.Code (1977, 2002 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 16-303(c) of the Transportation Article. In his appeal before the District Court, the defendant, Julian M. Ambrose, disputes the magistrate judge\u2019s interpretation of the modifying phrase \u201cused by the public\u201d in two statutory provisions defining key terms of \u00a7 16-303(c): the definition of \u201chighway,\u201d \u00a7 11-127, and the private property provision, \u00a7 21-101.1(b)(l). Md.Code (1977, 2002 Repl.Vol.), Transportation Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">The District Court has certified the following questions for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-8\">I. Do the terms \u201cused by the public\u201d contained in the definition of \u201chighway\u201d in \u00a7 11-127 and in the private roads provision of \u00a7 21\u2014101.1(b)(1) of the Transportation Article of the Maryland Code require the unrestricted <em>right </em>of the public to the use of the highway or private property, as opposed to the <em>fact </em>of use of a highway or private property by the public?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-9\">II. If the terms \u201cused by the public\u201d as contained in the foregoing sections of the Transportation Article require that the public has a right, as opposed to the fact, of use, what level of restrictions, if any, may be imposed on the public before a highway or private property loses its character as one \u201cused by the public?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-Z\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>In answering the first question, we hold that the phrase \u201cused by the public\u201d contained in the definition of \u201chighway\u201d in \u00a7 11-127 and in the private roadway/property provision of \u00a7 21\u2014101.1(b)(1) of the Maryland Transportation Article does not require proof of an unrestricted right of the public to use the pertinent highway or private property where the offense allegedly occurred; rather, the proper inquiry involves a factual determination as to the character of the use of the highway or private roadway/property by the public, regardless of the restrictions placed on the public\u2019s access or use. Because of our resolution of question I, we need not address the merits of question II.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Factual and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">On June 27, 2005, at approximately 9:15 a.m., Mr. Ambrose was cited for a violation of \u00a7 16-303(c) of the Maryland Transportation Article, driving a motor vehicle while his privilege to drive was suspended, as a result of a routine identification check at the Old Farm Road Gate of Fort Detrick. When Mr. Ambrose and his vehicle approached the Fort Detrick entry gate, the civilian security guard assigned to the checkpoint stopped Mr. Ambrose\u2019s vehicle and requested to see Mr. Ambrose\u2019s identification. Upon receiving Mr. Ambrose\u2019s identification, the security guard was unable to determine a date on the card. The security guard then requested the assistance of Officer Thomas S. Plummer, a police officer with the United States Department of Defense, to verify Mr. Ambrose\u2019s identification. While waiting for Officer Plummer to arrive, the security guard asked Mr. Ambrose to move his vehicle to a designated area near the security gate to avoid blocking the traffic lanes leading to Fort Detrick.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">Officer Plummer responded to the gate and found Mr. Ambrose in the driver\u2019s seat of the vehicle. Officer Plummer inspected Mr. Ambrose\u2019s identification and, finding \u201cthe date on it was a little obscure [and] was kind of hard to read,\u201d ran <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>Mr. Ambrose\u2019s identification through the National Crime Information Center database and the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration database. The results of the database search indicated that Mr. Ambrose\u2019s driving privileges were suspended by the State of Maryland. Accordingly, Officer Plummer \u201ctook Mr. Ambrose into custody, brought him back to the station, [and] ... gave him [a] ticket.\u201d Mr. Ambrose was charged, under the Assimilated Crimes Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 13(a), with driving on a suspended license in violation of \u00a7 16-303(c) of the Maryland Transportation Article.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Officer Plummer then released Mr. Ambrose from police custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">A trial on the charge of driving while suspended was held before a United States magistrate judge on April 18, 2006, and September 19, 2006. At both the close of the Government\u2019s case and the trial, Mr. Ambrose moved for judgment of acquittal, which the magistrate judge denied. The judge then found Mr. Ambrose guilty of the offense. Mr. Ambrose received 18 months of supervised probation with the special condition that he not drive without a valid license, a $725.00 fine, and a $25 special assessment. On September 21, 2006, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Mr. Ambrose appealed his conviction to the United States District Court for the District of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">On March 26, 2007, the United States District Court for the District of Maryland held a hearing on the magistrate judge\u2019s decision. On June 15, 2007, the district court judge certified the two above-stated questions of law to this Court pursuant to the Maryland Uniform Certification of Questions of Law Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Fort Detrick</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">Fort Detrick is a research laboratory-oriented military installation under the control of the United States Army. The installation is home to several research laboratories and support buildings. The post also contains housing for some employees, recreational facilities, restaurants, stores, park areas, and a community activity center.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">The installation is considered a restricted area and is not open to the public. Indeed, the entire perimeter of the installation is protected by a fence, which directs all entry onto the installation through four security gates. A warning sign is posted on each gate declaring the installation\u2019s restrictive nature:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-9\">WARNING</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAi\">RESTRICTED AREA</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-10\">THIS INSTALLATION HAS BEEN DECLARED A RESTRICTED AREA BY THE AUTHORITY OF THE COMMANDING OFFICER, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE DIRECTIVE ISSUED BY THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ON 20 AUGUST 1954, PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 21, INTERNAL SECURITY ACT OF 1950. UNAUTHORIZED ENTRY IS PROHIBITED. ALL PERSONS AND VEHICLES ENTERING HEREIN ARE LIABLE TO SEARCH. PHOTOGRAPHING OR MAKING <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>NOTES, DRAWINGS, MAPS OR GRAPHIC REPRESENTATIONS OF THIS AREA OR ITS ACTIVITIES ARE PROHIBITED UNLESS SPECIFICALLY AUTHORIZED BY THE COMMANDER. ANY SUCH MATERIAL FOUND IN POSSESSION OF UNAUTHORIZED PERSONS WILL BE CONFISCATED.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Members of the general public, who are not employees of Fort Detrick, wishing to gain access to the installation are required to report to the 7th Street Gate. When a vehicle not displaying a Department of Defense decal approaches a security gate, the security guard assigned to the gate directs the vehicle to a security lane, where the guard requests the visitor\u2019s identification and reason for entry. Any vehicle entering the installation is also subject to a search by the security guard. If the security guard deems the reason for entry acceptable, the visitor(s) may proceed onto the installation. Otherwise, individuals without proper identification and a valid purpose are refused entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">The Maryland Transportation Article</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">At issue in the instant case is \u00a7 16-303(c) of the Maryland Transportation Article, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-9\">(c) <em>Suspended licenses </em>generally.\u2014A person may not drive a motor vehicle on any highway or on any property specified in \u00a7 21-101.1 of this article while the person\u2019s license or privilege to drive is suspended in this State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">The Code defines \u201chighways\u201d as \u201cthe entire width between the boundary lines of any way or thoroughfare of which any part is used by the public for vehicular travel, whether or not the way or thoroughfare has been dedicated to the public and accepted by any proper authority.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Md.Code (1977, 2002 RepLVol.), \u00a7 11-127 of the Transportation Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>In addition, Section 21-101.1, entitled \u201cScope of title,\u201d reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-4\">(a) <em>In </em>general.\u2014The provisions of this title relating to the driving of vehicles refer only to the driving of vehicles on highways, except:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-5\">(1) As provided in subsection (b) of the section; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-6\">(2) Where a different or additional place specifically is provided for.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-7\">(b) <em>Applicability to private </em>property.\u2014(1) A person may not drive a motor vehicle in violation of any provision of this title on any private property that is used by the public in general, or in Calvert County, on any private road located within a residential subdivision or community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-8\">(2) A person may not drive a motor vehicle in violation of any provision of this title on any property that is owned by or under the control of this State, or any of its political subdivisions, county boards of education, or community colleges and that is open to vehicular traffic and used by the public in <em>general.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-9\"><em>(3) </em>Any person who violates any provision of this subsection is in violation of the law to the same extent and is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>subject to the same penalty as if the motor vehicle were driven on a highway.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Md.Code (1977, 2002 RepLVol.).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A8E\">Parties\u2019 Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">The Government contends that the phrase \u201cused by the public\u201d contained in the definition of \u201chighway\u201d (\u00a7 11-127) as well as in the private property provision (\u00a7 21-101.1(b)(l)) requires only that the public in fact use the roadway/property in order for said roadway/property to be subject to the Transportation Article. Specifically, the Government argues that the phrase \u201cused by the public\u201d is clear and unambiguous, and it does not require lengthy or complicated analysis by this Court. Rather, the Government urges that this Court need only look to the plain language to conclude that the words \u201cused by the public\u201d do not reference a requirement that the public have some right to use a roadway. The Government states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-8\">This logical understanding of the plain language of the statutes is buttressed by the fact that the phrase \u201cused by the public\u201d in both statutes does not distinguish between the use of a roadway by the public by right and use of a roadway of the public by <em>permission </em>of the owner. Absent such a distinction in the statutory text, there is no basis for assuming that the phrase \u201cused by the public\u201d means \u201cused by the public by right.\u201d Instead, the plain reading of the statutes is that there need only be a showing that the roadway is, in fact, used by the public, even if only with the permission of the owner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">The Government then directs the Court\u2019s attention to the entirety of the Transportation Article, asserting that \u201cit becomes even clearer that the actual use of the roadway by the public ... is the linchpin of the phrase in question.\u201d Pointing to Section \u00a7 21-101.1(b)(l), the Government argues that this section \u201cestablishes that the traffic laws apply not only to highways, but also on property that is privately owned but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>used by the public;\u201d therefore, \u201cthe actual use of the roadway, not the public\u2019s unrestricted right to use a roadway, is the crucial and necessary inquiry.\u201d To utilize the rights-based test for this inquiry, the Government contends, is to render \u00a7 21\u2014101.1(b)(1) without force.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">In addition, the Government contends that this Court should not rely on earlier Court of Special Appeals\u2019s decisions, namely, <em>Walmsley v. State, 35 </em>Md.App. 148, 370 A.2d 107 (1977) and <em>Akins v. State, 35 </em>Md.App. 155, 370 A.2d 111 (1977), in answering this question because the Maryland General Assembly amended the statutory provision in question in 1978 to broaden its scope, thereby abrogating those decisions. The Government asserts that the legislative history of the 1978 amendment shows that \u201cthe change in the law was, in fact, specifically designed to properly address the \u2018loophole\u2019 cited in\u201d several Court of Special Appeals decisions. Lastly, the government argues that we should also not base our decision on <em>Locklear v. State, </em>94 MdApp. 39, 614 A.2d 1338 (1992), because \u201cthe Court of Special Appealsfs decision] was ultimately fact-driven and did not turn on the \u2018right to travel\u2019 test cited in its opinion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Ambrose counters, asserting that \u201cthe phrase \u2018used by the public\u2019 ... requires that the general public have an unrestricted right to use the pertinent highway or private property in question, meaning that the roadway or property must be open and available for use by all members of the public.\u201d Ambrose states: \u201cInterpreting these statutes to require such a right of access is not only consistent with the natural and ordinary meaning of the word \u2018public,\u2019 but is also necessary to avoid rendering statutory language superfluous.\u201d Ambrose then argues that the common definitions of the word \u201cpublic\u201d \u201csuggest that ... a roadway or private property must be available for use by all citizens of the [S]tate;\u201d therefore, \u201cit is appropriate to conclude that a roadway or private property is \u2018used by the public\u2019 when the road or property is open and available for use by all members of the public.\u201d Ambrose points out that not every road available to the public is a public road; otherwise the statutory language contained in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>Section 21-101(n), \u201cprivate road or driveway\u201d would become superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">These questions are matters of first impression for this Court as we have never addressed Sections 11-127 and 21-101.1(b)(l)\u2019s requirement that the highway or private property be \u201cused by the public.\u201d This question, however, has been before the Court of Special Appeals on three separate occasions. <em>See Locklear v. State, </em>94 Md.App. 39, 614 A.2d 1338 (1992); <em>Akins v. State, </em>35 Md.App. 155, 370 A.2d 111 (1977); <em>Walmsley v. State, </em>35 Md.App. 148, 370 A.2d 107 (1977). In two of the three cases, <em>Walmsley </em>and <em>Akins, </em>the Court of Special Appeals overturned the defendants\u2019 convictions by interpreting the \u201cused by the public\u201d element of \u201chighway\u201d to depend solely on the right of the general public to use the roadway.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">In <em>Walmsley, </em>the defendant appealed his conviction of driving while his license was revoked, asserting that the parking lot in which he was cited was not a public highway under state law. <em>Walmsley, </em>35 Md.App. at 150, 370 A.2d at 108. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>Court of Special Appeals agreed with Mr. Walmsley\u2019s position, holding that \u201cthe test to be applied is the right of the public to travel on the road, driveway, or parking lot, and not the actual exercise of that right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 152, 370 A.2d at 109. Applying the facts of the case to the newly-adopted test, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-5\">In the instant case, it cannot be questioned but that George\u2019s Tavern could have limited the driveway and parking lot to its employees or to its patrons. The public, other than business invitees, had no right to enter upon the driveway or to park their vehicles. It is obvious that driveways and parking lots are not \u201cpublic\u201d in the sense of the use by all vehicular traffic as a matter of right. We infer that the driveway and parking lot are maintained solely for the convenience of the patrons of the tavern and as such are subject to almost limitless regulation by the owners of the property, to the point that both the driveway and the parking area could be completely eliminated at whim. Thus, the private parking and driveway do not fall within the scope of \u201cused by the public for purposes of vehicular travel,\u201d Md.Ann.Code art. 66 1/2, [\u00a7 ] 1-132. It follows that operating a motor vehicle on a private parking lot, road, or driveway while a license is canceled, suspended, refused, or revoked is not proscribed by the present Maryland motor vehicle code, and Walmsley\u2019s conviction under [\u00a7 ] 6-303 of Article 66 1/2 was wrong.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 154, 370 A.2d at 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">In <em>Akins, </em>the intermediate appellate court\u2019s companion case to <em>Walmsley, </em>the defendant was convicted of driving at a time when his license was revoked after being observed driving on a shopping center parking lot. The defendant appealed, claiming there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for driving on a public highway at a time when his license was revoked. <em>Akins, </em>35 Md.App. at 155-56, 370 A.2d at 111. The court agreed and reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction, emphasizing the rule to be applied in cases regarding a parking area is \u201cthat a parking area and its roadways within a shopping center are considered to be private because the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>to use them is limited to those persons who have implied permission to do business with the owner, and that th\u00e9 owner retains the right to exclude anyone at anytime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 157, 370 A.2d at 112. The court then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-5\">The use of the parking lot and exit areas in this case was entirely for the convenience of the customers of the owners of the stores in the shopping center. The owner of the center had an absolute right to control the traffic patterns for the use of the areas and could, and undoubtedly did, promulgate rules and regulations as to the manner in which the area could be used. At his discretion the area could be closed or opened as the owner saw fit. It is clear, then, that the area in which the [defendant] operated his vehicle was not \u201cused by the public for purposes of vehicular travel\u201d within the meaning of Code art. 66 1/2, \u00a7 1-132. We hold that operating .a motor vehicle on a shopping center parking lot, or any other private parking lot, road, or driveway while a license is canceled, refused, suspended, or revoked is not a violation under \u00a7 6-303 of art. 66 1/2 and, therefore, reverse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 158, 370 A.2d at 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">In essence, the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s cases applied the test of whether there is an unrestricted right of the public to \u201ctravel on the road, driveway, or parking lot.\u201d <em>See Walmsley, </em>35 Md.App. at 152, 370 A.2d at 109. But, as the Government explained in its argument, the General Assembly amended the statutory language contained in \u00a7 16-303<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in order to expand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>its scope to include private property. <em>See </em>1978 Md. Laws, Chap. 34. It is clear from the legislative history of House Bill 170 that the General Assembly amended \u00a7 16-303 in direct response to the <em>Walmsley </em>and <em>Akins </em>decisions, in order to close the perceived gap in the law and apply \u00a7 16-303 to privately-owned property that is used significantly by the public. <em>See </em>1978 Md. Laws, Chap. 34.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The bill file to House Bill 170, for example, reveals a January 17, 1978, letter from William T.S. Bricker, Deputy Administrator of the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration, to Delegate Joseph Owens, then-Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, in which Mr. Bricker writes in pertinent part regarding House Bill 170:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-5\">Attached are copies of the Court of Special Appealsfs] opinions in <em>Walmsley v. State </em>and <em>Akins v. State, </em>for your information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-6\">A close reading of the opinions would indicate that Section 21-101.1 does apply to Title 21 offenses (Rules of the Road), but would imply that offenses under other titles, and specifically Section 16-303, are not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>Consequently, the bill would properly address the \u201cloophole\u201d cited in these opinions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">In addition, the Maryland Department of Transportation, indicating their support of House Bill 170 in a position paper submitted to the General Assembly, explained that \u201c[t]he bill was introduced at the request of several prosecutors who were unable to obtain convictions of persons charged with operating while suspended or revoked on private property used by the public in general.\u201d In essence, by including private property used by the public in general within the scope of the prohibition against driving while the privilege to drive is suspended, the General Assembly effectively abrogated the intermediate appellate court\u2019s test and reversed that court\u2019s prior holdings in <em>Walmsley </em>and <em>Akins. </em>Therefore, the <em>Walmsley </em>and <em>Akins </em>cases have little persuasive authority in the outcome of our decision in the case <em>subjudice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Notwithstanding the legislative history surrounding the 1978 amendment, which confirms our interpretation of \u00a7 16-303, we must focus our attention on the plain meaning of the phrase \u201cused by the public\u201d within the context of the statutory provisions under consideration. <em>See James v. Butler, </em>378 Md. 683, 696, 838 A.2d 1180, 1187 (2003) (noting that where there is no ambiguity in the words of a statute, \u201cin the interest of completeness, ... we may look at the purpose of the statute and compare .the result obtained by use of its plain language with that which results when the purpose of the statute is taken into account\u201d); <em>accord Smith v. State, </em>399 Md. 565, 578 924 A.2d 1175, 1182 (2007). In <em>Kushell v. Dep\u2019t of Natural Resources, </em>385 Md. 563, 576-77, 870 A.2d 186, 193-94 (2005), we discussed statutory interpretation, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-7\">The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature. Statutory construction begins with the plain language of the statute, and ordinary, popular understanding of the English language dictates interpretation of its terminology.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-8\">In construing the plain language, \u201c[a] court may neither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>evidenced in the plain and unambiguous language of the statute; nor may it construe the statute with forced or subtle interpretations that limit or extend its application.\u201d Statutory text \u201c \u2018should be read so that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered superfluous or nugatory/ \u201d The plain language of a provision is not interpreted in isolation. Rather, we analyze the statutory scheme as a whole and attempt to harmonize provisions dealing with the same subject so that each may be given effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-5\">If statutory language is unambiguous when construed according to its ordinary and everyday meaning, then we give effect to the statute as it is written. \u201cIf there is no ambiguity in that language, either inherently or by reference to other relevant laws or circumstances, the inquiry as to legislative intent ends; we do not need to resort to the various, and sometimes inconsistent, external rules of construction, for \u2018the Legislature is presumed to have meant what it said and said what it meant/ \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">(Internal citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Looking to the actual words of the phrase \u201cused by the public,\u201d in both the definition of \u201chighway\u201d and the private roads provision of \u00a7 21\u2014101.1(b)(1), we may discern the plain and ordinary meaning of that phrase. \u201cUsed by the public\u201d clearly does not indicate a requirement that the public have an unrestricted right to access. Rather, the phrase in its most plain reading means the public must (in fact) have traveled upon the roadway/property in some manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">The overall statutory context of this phrase further solidifies our position. The Court of Special Appeals\u2019s analytical framework in <em>Walmsley </em>and <em>Akins </em>focused on whether the public had the right to travel on the thoroughfare, roadway, or property. Utilizing this inquiry for properties specified in \u00a7 21\u2014101.1(b) would, in essence, render the provision superfluous and meaningless. The underpinning of private property is that the owner controls and restricts the access and use of the property. Requiring a private roadway, driveway, or parking lot to have an unrestricted right of use by the public would, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>total, render every private roadway, driveway, or parking lot immune to the motor vehicle laws contained in Title 21.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Such a result would be illogical and violate the canons of statutory construction. <em>See Kushell, </em>385 Md. at 577, 870 A.2d at 193 (noting that statutory text should be read so that no word, clause, sentence, or phrase is rendered superfluous but rather with an eye towards harmonizing multiple provisions within the statutory scheme). Instead, the applicable test for determining whether a thoroughfare, roadway, or other property is \u201cused by the public\u201d in conformity with the requirements of either \u00a7 11-127 or \u00a7 21\u2014101.1(b)(1) is a factual inquiry regarding the nature and extent of the use of the thoroughfare, roadway or property by the public.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Whether the public\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>access to or use of the thoroughfare or roadway is restricted in any way by the owner is of no consideration to this inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">While most of the available cases from the federal trial courts interpreting \u00a7 16-303 have adopted the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s rights-based test for the \u201cused by the public\u201d inquiry,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> there is one case from the United States District Court for the District of Maryland that did not subscribe to that analytical framework, which is consistent with our view of the appropriate test. <em>See United States v. Taylor, </em>441 F.Supp.2d 747 (D.Md.2006). In <em>Taylor, </em>the defendant was convicted of driving a motor vehicle while his privileges to drive were suspended in violation of \u00a7 16-303(c). 441</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">F.Supp.2d at 747. The defendant had been issued the citation during a routine identification check at the Maryland Gate of Aberdeen Proving Grounds. 441 F.Supp.2d at 748. He moved to dismiss the criminal complaint before the magistrate judge that convicted him, asserting that the roads on Aberdeen Proving Grounds are not \u201chighways\u201d or covered by \u00a7 21-101.1; and, therefore, he could not have been charged under \u00a7 16-303. 441 F.Supp.2d at 748-49. The court rejected the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>defendant\u2019s argument, holding, as we do here, that the applicable test for determining whether a roadway is \u201cused by the public\u201d is the extent of the public\u2019s use. 441 F.Supp.2d at 754. Acknowledging the canons of statutory interpretation, the court then held that adopting the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s test would render the private road provisions of \u00a7 21-101.1 \u201csurplusage and therefore unnecessary.\u201d 441 F.Supp.2d at 753-54. The court noted, \u201c[a] contrary conclusion would not only assume the legislature incorporated an entirely redundant provision into the statute, but would also lead to the absurd and unreasonable result of exempting roads on federal enclaves ... from the most basic traffic safety laws.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thereafter, the court reviewed the record, detailing the extent and nature of the public\u2019s use of the roads within Aberdeen Proving Grounds. <em>Id. </em>The court then concluded that \u201cthe roads of [Aberdeen Proving Grounds] are used by the public in general.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">We hold that the phrase \u201cused by the public,\u201d found in the definition of \u201chighway\u201d contained in \u00a7 11-127 and in the private property provision contained in \u00a7 21\u2014101.1(b)(1) of the Transportation Article of the Maryland Code, does not require the unrestricted right of the public to the use of the highway or private property in order to render the highway or private property subject to the requirements of \u00a7 16-303.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">CERTIFIED QUESTIONS OF LAW ANSWERED AS SET FORTH ABOVE. COSTS TO BE EQUALLY DIVIDED BETWEEN THE PARTIES.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b458-6\">. Because Fort Detrick is a United States military installation and a federal enclave subject to the \"special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States,\u201d <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 7, Mr. Ambrose was issued a citation for his violation of Maryland State law pursuant to the Assimilative Crimes Act (\"ACA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 13. The ACA provides, in pertinent part, that any person who is \"guilty of any act or omission\u201d within the boundaries of a federal reservation \"which, although not made punishable by any enactment of Congress, would be punishable if committed or omitted within the jurisdiction of the State ... in which such place is situated, by the laws thereof in force at the time of such act or omission, shall be guilty of a like offense and subject to a like punishment.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 13. In other words, the ACA applies state laws in federal reservations, filling gaps in federal criminal law that apply in federal jurisdictions. <em>See Lewis v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 155, 118 S.Ct. 1135, 140 L.Ed.2d 271 (1998); <em>United States v. Sharpnack, </em>355 U.S. 286, 78 S.Ct. 291, 2 L.Ed.2d 282 (1958). <em>See also United States v. Robson, </em>391 F.Supp.2d 383, 386-387 (D.Md.2005) (explaining the constitutional basis and scope of the Assimilative Crimes Act). Thus, under the ACA, \u00a7 16-303 of the Maryland Transportation Article is assimilated as a federal offense and made applicable to activities occurring on Fort Detrick.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b460-11\">. On April 24, 2007, approximately two years and two months after the incident which gave rise to the charges in this case, Senate Bill 35 was enacted to modify the definition of \"highway\" in \u00a7 11-127 to include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>roadways on federal reservations/installations. <em>See </em>2007 Md. Laws, Chap. 24. It appears that the General Assembly intended to clarify that highways located on property owned, leased, or controlled by the United States are subject to Title 16 offenses, including driving a motor vehicle while driving privileges are suspended. Section 11-127 now reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-11\">\"Highways\u201d means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-12\">(1) The entire width between the boundary lines of any way or thoroughfare of which any part is used by the public for vehicular travel, whether or not the way or thoroughfare has been dedicated to the public and accepted by any proper authority; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-13\">(2) For purposes of the application of State laws, the entire width between the boundary lines of any way or thoroughfare used for purposes of vehicular travel on any property owned, leased or controlled by the United States government and located in the State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-14\">Such a change is prospective and, therefore, does not affect the outcome of our answer to the relevant certified question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b464-8\">. In the third case, <em>Locklear, </em>the Court of Special Appeals overturned the defendant\u2019s conviction and reaffirmed that the test to be applied in determining whether a roadway/property is \"used by the public in general\" is whether the public had a right to travel on the roadway/property. In that case, the court reversed Mr. Locklear\u2019s conviction of driving while his license was suspended or revoked, holding that the State did not present sufficient evidence to convict him of driving on a public highway or on private property used by the public generally. <em>Locklear, </em>94 Md.App. at 41, 614 A.2d at 1338. The defendant was stopped for driving on dirt mounds on private property marked with a \u201cNo Trespassing\" sign. <em>Id. </em>at 45-46, 614 A.2d at 1340-41. The court reviewed the facts of the case and concluded that the property upon which Mr. Locklear was stopped \"was not used by the public in general.\" <em>Id. </em>at 47, 614 A.2d at 1341. The Court noted that the \"Agreed Statement of Facts\u201d reveals that the Genstar property on which [the defendant] was driving was marked, \"No Trespassing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court then stated: \"There is nothing in the 'Agreed Statement of Facts' to establish that the mounds upon which [the defendant] had been driving were used by the public in general.\u201d 94 Md.App. at 46, 614 A.2d at 1341. In so holding, the Court of Special Appeals did not acknowledge the General Assembly\u2019s 1978 amendment to \u00a7 16-303.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b466-8\">. The statutory language at play in the <em>Walmsley </em>and <em>Akins </em>cases differs from the statutory language contained in the current version of \u00a7 16-303. Indeed, there has been a number of changes in this statutory language since 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">The charge at issue in <em>Walmsley </em>and <em>Akins, </em>driving while the privilege to drive is suspended concerned Md.Code (1957, 1976 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 6-303 of Article 66)4. Section 6-303 provided: \"Any person who drives a motor vehicle on any public highway of this State at a time his license or privilege to do so is canceled, refused, suspended, or revoked is guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d The Code, at that time, defined \"highway\u201d as \"the entire width between the boundary lines of every way or thoroughfare of and kind used by the public for purposes of vehicular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>travel, whether actually dedicated to the public and accepted by the proper authorities or otherwise.\u201d Md.Code (1957, 1976 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 1-132 of Article 66 1/2. The Code did not mention private property.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">On March 8, 1976, prior to the decisions in <em>Walmsley </em>and <em>Akins, </em>the General Assembly amended and recodified \u00a7 6-303 as \u00a7 16-303 of the Transportation Article, effective July 1, 1977. 1977 Md. Laws, Chap. 14. The amended language read: \u201cA person may not drive a motor vehicle on any highway in this state while his license or privilege to drive is refused, canceled, suspended, or revoked.\u201d Section 1-132 was also amended and recodified at that time as \u00a7 11-127. The amended language read: \u201c \u2018highway\u2019 means the entire width between the boundary lines of any way or thoroughfare of which any part is used by the public for purposes of vehicular travel, whether or not the way or thoroughfare has been dedicated to the public and accepted by the proper authorities or otherwise.\u201d Still the Code did not mention private property. The intermediate appellate court in <em>Walmsley </em>and <em>Akins </em>interpreted \u00a7 6-303 of Article 66 1/2 as it was written at the time of Mr. Walmsley's and Mr. Akins\u2019s offenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b467-9\">. House Bill 170 amended \u00a7 16-303 to read: \"A person may not drive a motor vehicle on any highway or on any property specified in 21-101.1 of this article while his license or privilege to drive is refused, cancelled, suspended, or revoked.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b470-5\">. As explained by the District Court in <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>441 F.Supp.2d 747 (D.Md.2006), the adoption of the rights-based test would, in an instant, render the motor vehicle laws found in Title 21 inapplicable to federal enclaves and reservations, including Fort Detrick:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-6\">This is particularly true if such an interpretation would have the inimical effect of rendering inapplicable to [Aberdeen Proving Grounds (APG) ] nearly the totality of the \"rules of the road\u201d codified at Title 21 of the Maryland Transportation Article. This is so because \u00a7 21-101.1 states, relevantly, that Title 21 (rules of the road) govern highways and private property used by the public in general. Thus, if the roads of APG are neither \"highways\u201d nor \"private property that is used by the public in general,\u201d then, with the exception of the offenses identified at \u00a7 21-901 (reckless, negligent or impaired driving, fleeing or eluding police), the rules of the road would be inapplicable. This would mean that motorist could ignore traffic signs and signals, right of way rules and speeding restrictions without adverse legal consequence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">441 F.Supp.2d at 754.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b470-8\">. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>for example, the court could take into consideration, among other things, where the defendant was actually stopped by the civilian security guard and the military police officer. The analysis may either be broad, encompassing the entire installation, or narrowly-focused, focusing on the actual road on which the defendant was stopped. For example, there is evidence in the record that prior to his citation, Mr. Ambrose was stopped at an entry gate and then asked to pull to a designated area routinely used for vehicle searches. The record indicates that the roadway on which Mr. Ambrose traveled to reach the entry gate is one of four roadways which members of the public as well as Fort Detrick employees transverse to request entry onto Fort Detrick, regardless of whether they are granted access to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>installation. If an individual is denied entry onto Fort Detrick, the individual is directed to turn around and leave, taking the same roadway out that the driver took to obtain access. While Eileen C. Mitchell, Deputy Garrison Commander of Fort Detrick, testified before the magistrate judge that members of the public are directed to use only one of the entry gates\u2014the 7th Street gate, it is clear from the facts of this case that members of the public, if only occasionally, attempt to gain access onto the installation from the other, non-designated entry gates.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b471-8\">. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Robson, </em>391 F.Supp.2d 383 (D.Md.2005) (holding that an access road leading to Andrews Air Force Base was not a \"highway\u201d under \u00a7 11-127 because \u201cthe Base Commander retains absolute authority to bar the public from coming onto the base at any time\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Patrick, </em>No. CRIM 05-3950M, 2006 WL 83505 (D.Md.
