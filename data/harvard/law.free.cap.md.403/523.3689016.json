CATHELL, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A_T\">retired, specially assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-12\">With the inclusion of certain of the amici (via their briefs), this case, in one sense is a continuation of legislative battles that began in the early 1990s, where representatives of the environmental protection and professional land planning interests attempted to establish that the State, or State planners, should exercise greater control than theretofore enjoyed over most aspects of land use decision-making that then reposed in the local jurisdictions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>David Trail, et al., petitioners, presented only one question in their Petition for Certiorari:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-5\">\u201cMay a board of appeals deriving zoning authority under Article 66B grant a special exception, in the absence of an affirmative finding that the proposed use conforms to the jurisdiction\u2019s comprehensive plan?\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ak8\">We presume that petitioners are asserting that the administrative entity making the decision must mention the term \u201cconform,\u201d because it now appears in the relevant section of the State statute, Article 66B,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and then explain its decision in relation to petitioners\u2019 (and some of the amici\u2019s) versions of the definition of the term \u201cconform\u201d as it relates to the local jurisdiction\u2019s plans.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We hold that the agency did that which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>the statute required it to do. We believe that the term \u201cconform,\u201d standing alone, as first used by the Legislature in 1970, is the semantical equivalent of the phrase \u201cin harmony with\u201d which has long been the standard utilized in Maryland land use administrative practice.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We shall attempt later in our opinion to explain the history of the \u201clocal control/state control via mandates\u201d issue from an examination of the legislative actions over the years.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">The site at issue is located in the A and C zones in Allegany County. In those zones planned unit developments, such as that in the case at bar, are permitted as special exceptions to the provisions of the zoning code. The site had been expressly designated for urban development as far back as 1995 and that designation continued through the 2002 version of the County Comprehensive Plan. The site was not included under the County\u2019s master plans as a \u201csensitive area.\u201d There is nothing we have found in the record of this case indicating that the Maryland Department of State Planning prior to this action ever objected to the inclusion of this site as suitable for urban development in the County\u2019s Master Plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Prior to the application at issue here, the Allegany Planning Commission had visited the site and determined that the proposed development then contemplated, that later was the subject of the application and of the grant of the special exception at issue, was consistent with the Comprehensive Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">In August 2005, Terrapin Run, LLC (\u201crespondent\u201d) applied to the Board of Appeals of Allegany County (the \u201cBoard\u201d) for a special exception provided for in the local zoning code to establish a planned residential development (the \u201cdevelopment\u201d). The development was to be located on 935 acres of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>land, primarily zoned as District \u201cA\u201d (Agricultural, Forestry and Mining), with a portion of the tract located in District \u201cC\u201d (Conservation). The 935-acre tract of land abuts Route 40 and Shipley Road on the east side, and Green Ridge Road on the west. Green Ridge State Forest is located to the east of the tract, and there are also forested lands south of the tract.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The development would consist of 4,300 residential units, an equestrian center, a community building and a 125,000 square foot shopping center. Additionally, the development would require a sewage treatment plant, to be located along Route 40. The Board noted that the project would take twenty years to complete and during that time, 150 to 200 separate permits and approvals would be required for its completion.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">As relevant to the case at bar, after eight sessions in which the Board heard from 11 experts (nine for the applicants and two for the protestants), and received more than 80 exhibits, the Board, in a lengthy finding of facts, found that the proposed development would be in harmony with the Allegany County Comprehensive Plan, 2002 Update (the \u201cPlan\u201d). The Board opined that the Plan was advisory in nature, rather than regulatory, and that strict conformance with the plan was not required. Included in its findings were the following \u201cconclusions,\u201d as stated in Respondent\u2019s brief to the Court of Special Appeals:<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-6\">\u201c\u2022 There is a specific statement in the Allegany County Plan stating that it is the function of the Plan to serve as a guide;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AP5\">\u2022 It is commonly understood that Master Plans are guides in the development process, which guidelines are mandatory only if an Ordinance so provides;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>\u2022 The Allegany County Ordinance contains no requirement of strict adherence to the Plan and affords it no regulatory authority;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-5\">\u2022 That conformity to the Plan is not required; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-6\">\u2022 That the proper issue to be decided by the Zoning Board is \u2018whether the use in the particular case is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the Plan\u2019.\u201d (Internal citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">Consistent with Article 66B\u2019s requirement that if some jurisdiction desires to exercise zoning power, it must first develop a Master or other Comprehensive Plan, Allegany County, as we have indicated, had adopted such a Plan. Included in that Plan at the relevant time were the \u201cvision\u201d statements which were required to be included. Additionally, the Plan included a sensitive areas compilation as required by Article 66B. As previously indicated, the subject site was not included as a sensitive area in the Comprehensive Plan and was indicated for future Urban Development.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Plan describes that its purpose or intent is as a \u201cguide\u201d in respect to the issue of land use. The Maryland Department of Planning<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> was privy to the County\u2019s actions in adopting its Master Plan and there is nothing in the record before us to which our attention has been directed indicating that the Department made any objection at the time in respect to the inclusion of the subject site as an area for urban development.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">The request for a special exception was eventually approved by the Board using the traditional \u201cin harmony with\u201d stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>dard. Petitioners objected to the \u201cin harmony\u201d standard set forth by the Board of Appeals, and appealed to the Circuit Court for Allegany County. They contended that the Board erred as a matter of law in granting a special exception where there was no finding that the proposed use \u201cconformed\u201d to the Plan. At the Circuit Court, petitioners primarily relied on the definition of a special exception as set forth in the Maryland Code (1957, 2003 RepLVol.), Article 66, \u00a7 l(k), which now states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-5\">\u201c \u2018Special exception\u2019 means a grant of a specific use that would not be appropriate generally or without restriction and shall be based upon a finding that certain conditions governing special exceptions as detailed in the zoning ordinance exist, that the use conforms to the plan and is compatible with the existing neighborhood.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Petitioners relied on the definition of \u201cPlan\u201d as set forth in Article 66, \u00a7 1(h), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-7\">\u201c(1) \u2018Plan\u2019 means the policies, statements, goals, and interrelated plans for private and public land use, transportation, and community facilities documented in texts and maps which constitute the guide for the area\u2019s future development.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-8\">\u201c(2) \u2018Plan\u2019 includes a general plan, master plan, comprehensive plan, or community plan____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">On May 5, 2006, the Circuit Court issued a judgment and opinion remanding the case to the Board with directions that it determine whether the proposed use was \u201cconsistent with\u201d the policies and recommendations of the Plan. In arriving at that standard, it referred to the Allegany County Zoning Ordinance, which at one point had stated as part of its legislative purpose: \u201c[T]o ensure that these uses are <em>consistent with </em>the policies and recommendations of the Allegany County Comprehensive Plan----\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">Petitioners appealed the decision of the Circuit Court to the Court of Special Appeals, asserting that the proper standard is conformance, rather than harmony (or consistency). Respondents cross-appealed, arguing that the standard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>of harmony set forth by the Board was correct, and that the Board\u2019s decision should be affirmed for the reasons it had given. The Court of Special Appeals filed its decision on April 6, 2007, reversing the judgment of the Circuit Court, and affirming the decision of the Board. Relying in part on <em>Schultz v. Pritts, </em>291 Md. 1, 432 A.2d 1319 (1981),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and <em>Richmarr Holly Hills, Inc. v. American PCS, L.P., </em>117 Md. App. 607, 701 A.2d 879 (1997). Judge Eyler, James R., in an excellent opinion for that Court, held in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-5\">\u201cIt is beyond question that different words or phrases ' may connote different meanings. On the other hand, words have synonyms, and they must be viewed in context to determine if the choice of a particular word or phrase, as compared to a similar word or phrase, represents a semantical difference or a substantive difference.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\">\u201cArticle 66B is a general enabling statute and, by its express terms, rests land planning and land use controls with local jurisdictions. The \u2018Plan\u2019 is referred to several times in Art. 66B as being merely a guide. The definition of \u2018Plan\u2019 in Art. 66B, section 1.00(h)(1), states: \u201c \u2018Plan\u2019 \u201d means the policies, statements, goals, and interrelated plans ... which <em>constitute the guide </em>for the area\u2019s future development----Art. 66B, section 3.05(a)(2)(i), discussing the pow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>ers and duties of the local planning commission, states that the plan shall \u2018Serve as a guide to public and private actions and decisions to ensure the development of public and private property in appropriate relationships.\u2019 ... Article 66B, section 3.05(a)(4)(i) states that the plan shall contain a \u2018statement of goals and objectives, principles, policies, and standards, which shall serve as a guide for the development and economic and social well-being of the local jurisdiction.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AdR\">\u201cAdditionally, the terms that appellants allege have different meanings, requiring different levels of accord, are used interchangeably in Art. 66B without any discernible intended difference.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-5\">\u201cIn <em>Schultz v. Pritts,[</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>Judge Rita Davidson, writing for the majority, stated the required finding as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-6\">\u2018The special exception use is a valid zoning mechanism that delegates to an administrative board a limited authority to allow enumerated uses which the legislature has determined to be permissible absent any fact or circumstance negating that presumption. The duties of the Board are to judge ... <em>whether the use in the particular case is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the plan.\u2019</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-7\"><em>[Schultz v. Pritts, </em>291 Md.] at 11, 432 A.2d [at 1325] (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-8\">\u201cThe Court of Appeals was clearly aware of the definition of special exception contained in section 1.00(k), as that provision was reproduced in its entirety in the Court\u2019s opinion.... The Court\u2019s inclusion of the statutory definition of special exception, coupled with the language that the proposed use must be in \u2018harmony with the general purpose and intent of the plan,\u2019 necessarily means that the Court was of the view that the different words conveyed essential<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>ly the same meaning. That meaning, under Article 66B, is that special exception use does not have to strictly comply with a plan. It is up to the local jurisdiction, if it so chooses, to make it so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-4\">\u201cIn our view, nothing within the zoning code or the comprehensive plan itself acts to elevate the plan beyond a mere guide. Whether we describe the Board\u2019s analysis as examining whether the special exception use is in harmony with, consistent with, or in conformity with the plan, the terms differ only semantic ally. In the present case, each term connotes only a general compatibility with the purpose and intent of the plan, as opposed to a strict adherence of the plan.\u201d '</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-5\"><em>Trail v. Terrapin Run, LLC, </em>174 Md.App. 43, 50-57, 920 A.2d 597, 601-05 (2007).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We agree with the reasoning of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Before we address the legislative history of the relevant statutes, we point out once again that in Maryland, with some possible exceptions, local governments generally are not required to adopt zoning ordinances, master plans, comprehensive zoning plans, and the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">What is sometimes forgotten in the battles in the land use arena is that Article 66B was never intended to mandate that local governments adopt zoning. What it did was to empower them to do so, if they chose to do so, and if they so choose, Article 66B imposed suggestions, guides, and, in some instances, restrictions on how it was to be done. Its general permissive character was, and is, recognition that in adopting Article 66B the State was permitting local governments to interfere with a property owners constitutional and common-law rights to use his/her property in any manner (so long as a common-law nuisance is not created by the unrestricted use).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>The Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting general zoning legislation was not to mandate that local governments adopt zoning, it was merely empowering them to do so. It, in essence, stated: \u201cIf you want to do it, here is how you can tell property owners how their property may, and how it may not, be used.\u201d Its general intent was not to require, but to permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Accordingly, when it is argued that a provision was intended to be mandated, that provision must be examined in light of the general permissive aspect of Article 66B and not some perceived mandatory aspect. Thus, while the State might be able, so long as the language is sufficiently specific, to create mandated requirements, an intent to create compliance absolutism is not presumed\u2014it must be proven from specific language and/or the intent of the Legislature in enacting statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">We are also cognizant of the general rule relating to the interplay between zoning issues (as opposed to subdivision issues) and Master Plans. The appellate courts of this State have repeatedly noted that, generally, Master Plans, Comprehensive Plans, and the like, are advisory, guides only, and not normally mandatory insofar as rezonings, special exceptions, conditional uses and the like are concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">Seventeen years after the 1970 statute that first inserted the word \u201cconform\u201d in a definitional section that defined \u201cspecial exception,\u201d this Court, in <em>West Montgomery County Citizens Ass\u2019n v. Maryland-Nat\u2019l Capital Park and Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>309 Md. 183, 186-96, 522 A.2d 1328, 1329-34 (1987), opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-8\">\u201cA county enjoys no inherent power to zone or rezone, and may exercise zoning power only to the extent and in the manner directed by the State Legislature....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-9\">\u201cIn October, 1980, the Functional Master Plan for the Preservation of Agriculture and Rural Open Space in Montgomery County ... was approved and adopted.... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>\u201cSimilarly, in <em>Montgomery] Co[unty] v. Woodward &amp; Lothrop, </em>280 Md. 686, 704, 376 A.2d 483[, 493] (1977).... Chief Judge Murphy said for the Court that land use planning documents such as General or Master plans</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuI\">\u2018represent only a basic scheme generally outlining planning and zoning objectives in an extensive area, and are in no sense a final plan; they are continually subject to modification in the light of actual land use development and serve as a guide rather than a strait jacket.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">That remains the general rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">More important even, in analyzing land use issues that impact upon the fundamental constitutional rights of property owners, it is appropriate to start with a position stated by this Court long ago (and still relevant) in <em>Landay v. Zoning Appeals Board, </em>173 Md. 460, 465-66, 196 A. 293, 295-96 (1938):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-7\">\u201cIn a constitutional sense, the only justification for the restrictions imposed by such[zoning] laws as the ordinance under consideration on the use of private property is the protection of the public health, safety, or morals____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-9\">\u201cSuch ordinances are in derogation of the common law right to so use private property as to realize its highest utility, and while th\u00e9y should be liberally construed to accomplish their plain purpose and intent, they should not be extended by implication to cases not clearly within the scope of the purpose and intent manifest in their language.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">And see <em>Aspen Hill Venture v. Montgomery County Council, </em>265 Md. 303, 313, 289 A.2d 303, 308 (1972), where we stated further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-11\">\u201c[W]e are mindful of the fact that \u2018the constitutionality and validity of zoning laws depend essentially upon a reasonable balancing of public interest in zoning as against opposing private interests in property*.... In such a situation we must not forget the underlying principle that, \u2018such ordinances [zoning ordinances] are in derogation of the common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>law right to use private property as to realize its highest utility, ... they should not be extended by implication____\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>See also <em>White v.

Jones, </em>372 Md. 172, 187, 812 A.2d 312, 321 (2002) (quoting <em>Landay, </em>173 Md. at 466, 196 A. at 296).</p>\n<p id=\"ACE\">We now examine the relevant statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">A. The 1970 Legislation</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">Prior to the 1970 legislation (and at least since 1957), the Maryland Code, Art. 66B, \u00a7 7. Board of zoning appeals., (the then general section outlining the powers of boards of appeals) had provided in relevant part that \u201csaid board of zoning appeals may ... make special exceptions to the terms of the ordinance <em>in harmony with its gemral purpose </em>and in accordance with general or specific rules therein contained.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">In the late 1960s, a <em>Final Report </em>of the Maryland Planning and Zoning Law Study Commission, dated December 1969, was issued in support of proposed 1970 legislation.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The 1970 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>statute that resulted changed the relevant language relating to special exceptions by the insertion of a general definition clause<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> in the new Article 66B. As relevant to the case at bar, it read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-5\">\u201c \u00a7 1.00. Definitions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-6\">\u201c <em>\u2018Special exception \u2019 </em>means a grant of a specific use that would not be appropriate generally or without restriction and shall be based upon a finding that certain conditions governing special exceptions as detailed in the zoning ordinance exist, that the use conforms to the plan and is compatible with the existing neighborhood.\u201d (Underlining added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">The use of the word conform, or its derivatives, appears to date from this 1970 statute. The question then becomes\u2014 \u201cWhy did the Legislature change the relevant language in 1970?\u201d As we have noted, we have been unable to access any bill files from that 1970 era in respect to the statute at issue. We have, however, found the report (the <em>\u201cFinal Report </em>\u201d <em>supra) </em>that provided the impetus for the re-codification of Article 66B which resulted from the passage of Chapter 672 of the Laws of 1970. That report, fully titled as \u201cLegislative Recommendations-Final Report, (Dec.1969),\u201d was prepared by the Maryland Planning and Zoning Law Study Commission that was Chaired by the Honorable Goodloe E. Byron of Frederick, Maryland, and included members from all geographical regions of the State. Upon our reading of <em>the Final Report </em>and its appendices, notes and commentary, we find no indication that the State, by its use in the statute of the word \u201cconform,\u201d intended to force on local governments an absolute requirement for complete compliance with their respective local master and other comprehensive plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>In a Note relating to the Commission\u2019s proposal for the inclusion of the definition section, the report stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-5\">\u201c <em>\u2018Special Exception \u2019\u2014This term, was not defined informer Article 66B.

These are minor elements by comparison to the overriding elements which are (a) that the local government cannot go beyond the stated purposes of the Code (Section 201); and (b) that it cannot go beyond the limits imposed by the Constitution of this State or of the United States.

The contrary appears to be the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Moreover, a glance at dictionary definitions of the time indicate that the term \u201cconform\u201d was generally considered to be the equivalent of the phrase \u201cin harmony with.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>The Random House Dictionary of the English Language </em>308 (1983), contains this definition of \u201cconform:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-7\">\u201cconiform (konform), <em>v.i. </em>1. to act in accord or harmony; comply (usually fol. by to): <em>Being obstinate, she refused to </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number><em>conform, to the town\u2019s social pattern. </em>2. to be or become similar in form, nature, or character. 3. to comply with the usages of an established church <em>... v.t. </em>4. to make similar in form, nature, or character. 5. to bring into agreement, correspondence, or harmony.\u201d (Underlining added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AbT\"><em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>477 (3rd ed.1961), definition includes the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-5\">\u201cconform ...

There is no sufficient evidence that the General Assembly was attempting to change long accepted legal standards in \u201cspecial exception\u201d practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">Moreover, we generally do not construe recodifications as creating substantive changes in the absence of specific indications otherwise. We recently reiterated in <em>Marzullo v.

There, in interpreting our prior case of <em>Merlands Club, supra, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-5\">\u201cIn <em>[Merlands Club], </em>we went to some pains to stress that the special exception is a valid zoning mechanism that delegates to an administrative board a limited authority to permit enumerated uses which the legislative body has determined can, <em>prima facie, </em>properly be allowed in a specified use district, absent any fact or circumstance in a particular case which would change this presumptive finding. We said: \u2018The duties given to the Board are to judge whether the neighboring properties and the general neighborhood would be adversely affected, and whether the use, in the particular case, <em>is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the zoning plan.\u2019 </em>In accord is <em>[Oursler </em>].\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Then, just three years after the enactment of the 1970 legislation with its definition that included the use of the word \u201cconform,\u201d we decided <em>Turner v.

There, shortly after the passage of the 1970 statute, we reiterated what had been said before:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUR\">\u201cOccasionally the bar and less often the bench lose sight of the concept that the conditional use or special exception, as it is generally called, is a part of the comprehensive zoning plan sharing the presumption that as such it is in the interest of the general welfare and, therefore, valid....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-8\">\u201cWhile the applicant has the burden of adducing testimony which will show that his use meets the prescribed standards and requirements he does not have the burden of showing affirmatively that his proposed use accords with the general welfare____ [I]f there' is no <em>probative </em>evidence of harm or disturbance in light of the nature of the zone involved <em>or of factors causing disharmony to the functioning of the comprehensive plan, </em>a denial of an application for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>a special exception is arbitrary, capricious and illegal.\u201d (Last emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Eight years later, eleven years after the enactment of the 1970 legislation, we decided what some have called the seminal case in the Maryland law of special exceptions, <em>Schultz v.

In that case, Judge Rita Davidson, for the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-6\">\u201cThe special exception use is a part of the comprehensive zoning plan____The duties given to the Board are to judge whether ... the use in the particular case is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-9\">\u201cWhereas, the applicant has the burden of adducing testimony which will show that his use meets the prescribed standards and requirements, he does not have the burden of establishing affirmatively that his proposed use would be a benefit to the community____But if there is no probative evidence of ... <em>factors causing disharmony to the operation of the comprehensive plan, </em>a denial of an application for a special exception use is arbitrary, capricious, and illegal.\u201d (Citations omitted.)

Dixon, </em>365 Md. 95, 113, 775 A.2d 1234, 1244 (2001). We conclude, therefore, that there is virtually no basis for the proposition that the 1970 recodification\u2019s use of the word \u201cconform\u201d in its definition of \u201cspecial exception\u201d was intended, or did, create a compliance absolutism in respect to comprehensive plans when appropriate administrative entities grant special exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>B.

House Bill 1195 survived to become Chapter 437 of the Laws Maryland 1992. The proposed bills\u2019 titles are indicative of their general intent. House Bill 1195\u2019s title was <em>Economic Growth and Resources Act of 1992. </em>House Bill 1003\u2019s title was <em>Growth Management\u2014Comprehensive Plan Enforcement. </em>The contrasting titles stated the issue and the conflict being debated in the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">House Bill 1003 which provided that land use decisions must be \u201cSUBSTANTIALLY CONSISTENT WITH THE PLAN,\u201d contained several other provisions that met with much opposition in the Legislature. There was a provision in the State Finance and Procurement section (5-409) of proposed HB 1003 that the \u201cOffice,\u201d (presumably the Office of State Planning):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-8\">\u201c(B) ...

The local jurisdiction and the \u201cOffice\u201d selected the arbitrators, but only from \u201cA LIST OF <em>LOCAL PLANNERS MAINTAINED BY THE OFFICE </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) The arbitration part of the statute concluded with</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-6\">\u201c(VII) THE FINAL DECISION OF THE PANEL SHALL BIND BOTH THE OFFICE AND THE LOCAL JURISDICTION, NEITHER THE OFFICE NOR THE LOCAL JURISDICTION MAY TAKE ANY ACTION ON THE MATTER INCONSISTENT WITH THE DECISION OF THE PANEL. <em>THE FINAL DECISION OF THE PANEL MAY NOT BE APPEALED TO ANY COURT </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">In other words the \u201cOffice\u201d made the decision, objections would be heard by the \u201cOffice\u2019s\u201d arbitrators, and there would be absolutely no recourse in the courts for property owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">As might be imagined, this Bill (and the opposing HB 1195) engendered intensive political and lobbying activity.

We were willing to compromise in a spirit of cooperation for the higher goal of implementing the 2020 visions.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-12\">\u201cAgain, earlier this year we thought we were working in good faith with the administration to come up with meaningful growth management legislation.

We believes the bill balances other goals with that of economic growth and reducing increasing regulatory costs. We also support the bill because it permits region-wide planning and coordination between counties, but leaves ultimate responsibility for implementing the seven visions to local governments, who are most familiar with the problems their jurisdictions face. We feel that House Bill 1195 provides a unique opportunity to encourage region-wide and state-wide planning but at the same time retain flexibility at the local level to deal with individual problems.

Within this framework of local determination, the League supports the Administration\u2019s efforts through HB 1195 to meet the objections raised by MML and other parties to 2020 legislation that was considered during the 1991 General Assembly session. League objections last year included the supplant<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>ing of the planning judgments of local elected officials by non-elected [S]tate officials, the imposition of unfunded [Sjtate mandates, and the fact that future growth would be channeled around the existing cities and towns without addressing the need to annex those growth areas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-5\">\u201cFor the same reasons, the League opposes the approach offered in HB 1003. While the Administration\u2019s bill [HB 1195] ensures that decision making concerning local sensitive areas protection and implementation of the visions is made by local elected officials throughout the [Sjtate, HB 1003 provides for such judgements to be made ultimately by non-elected state officials in Baltimore unfamiliar with local conditions. Moreover, in these difficult economic times for both state and local governments, HB 1003 provides for a most severe club of revenue withholding powers wielded in Baltimore to ensure that the judgments of [Sjtate bureaucrats are implemented locally.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-6\">\u201cThe Maryland Municipal League urges this committee to provide a favorable report to HB 1195.

Further, the actions of local governments are to be monitored by the reconstituted State Economic Growth and Resource Commission.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">In February of 1992 as HB 1195 and HB 1003 were being debated in the Legislature, the Chairman of the Environmental Matters Committee requested answers to a series of questions from the Attorney General of Maryland in respect to HB 1195. In a letter dated February 7,1992, the Office of the Attorney General responded in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-7\">\u201c \u20181. What is the impact of using the term \u201cPolicy,\u201d rather than \u201cStatement,\u201d in terms of the Office [of Planning\u2019s] ability to adopt regulations, whether \u201cinterpretive\u201d or \u201clegislative?\u201d In particular, regulations on the contents of local comprehensive plans, and on locally undertaken infrastructure projects with partial [S]tate funding.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-8\">\u201cIn my view, House Bill 1195, does not confer authority on the Office of Planning to adopt \u2018legislative rules\u2019 to implement the economic and growth and resource vi<em>sions----The Office\u2019s general rulemaking authority is not affected or augmented by the bill; and, in my opinion, it would not be sufficient to allow the agency to promulgate legislative rules such as mandatory development standards.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AE3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>\u201cBut, any State regulations adopted would not be able to dictate the contents of local comprehensive plans, because such regulatory authority is vested by the bill \u2018solely\u2019 in the legislative body of the local jurisdictions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-5\">\u201c \u20184. Does the bill allow the State to intervene in local planning processes or decisions for allegedly failing to comply with the State Economic Growth and Resource Policy, regardless of the local implementation of similar visions under Article 66B, \u00a7 3.06(b)?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-6\">\u201cHowever, under House Bill 1195, local planning processes or decisions are governed by the local visions, not the State policies and are subject to local, not State, regulation. <em>Thus, even if the Office of Planning intervened in a local proceeding, it could not successfully allege a failure of the local government to comply with the State </em>policies.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">As these communications make clear, the Office of the Attorney General was advising the Chairman of the Environmental Affairs Committee during the journey of HB 1195 through the Legislature, that the Bill would not permit the Office of State Planning to impose mandatory requirements on local governments of the nature that would require local governments to absolutely comply with every provision of the various master and/or comprehensive plans that local governments might adopt. There is nothing in that exchange of questions and answers that would elevate the use of the word \u201cconform,\u201d or any other language of the pre-1992 statutes beyond the traditional \u201cin harmony with\u201d standard when considering special exceptions. Additionally, the fiscal notes in the file in respect to the competing bills (HB 1003 which failed of passage and HB 1195 which was enacted) further affirm that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>the difference between the bills was an example of the competing interests then contending for Legislative approval of their positions-HB 1003 (advocates of state control) and HB 1195 (advocates of local control). The fiscal note to HB 1003 provides in a relevant part that HB 1003:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-5\">\u201c\u2022 sets forth that the Office on Planning is (1) required to review efforts taken by local governments to legally incorporate these plan changes; and (2) authorized to take certain action to \u2018rectify a substantial inconsistency between the jurisdiction\u2019s comprehensive plan and land use law [defin\u00e9d]\u2019 which includes imposing a Stat\u00e9 funding moratorium (State and federal grant moneys) on selected programs ... [.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The fiscal notes in respect to HB 1195 provided after first reader and after the bill was enrolled, as relevant here, quoted at length from one of the Attorney General\u2019s opinion letters, <em>supra, </em>a small portion of which, stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-7\">\u201c\u2022\u2018... under House Bill 1195, local planning processes or decisions are governed by the local visions, not the State policies and are subject to local, not State, regulation.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A58T\">Additionally, a summary of HB 1195 presented at a hearing on February 17,1992, contained further language reaffirming the intention that local control be maintained. \u201cThis Bill enables PLANNED MANAGEMENT OF GROWTH AT THE LOCAL LEVEL, WITH THE HELP OF THE STATE ... RATHER THAN AS THE TOP-DOWN MANDATE OF specific planning standards in Last Year\u2019s Bills.\u201d Later the summary report addressed several questions. One was \u201cWhy Shouldn\u2019t Land-Use Ordinances, Like Zoning And Subdivision Ordinances, Be <em>Consistent </em>With Comprehensive Plans?\u201d The report specifically answered that question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-10\">\u201cAn absolute consistency requirement would create an unworkable situation in local planning processes. The ZONING MAP WOULD HAVE TO MIRROR THE COMPREHENSIVE MASTER PLAN IF CONSISTENCY WERE REQUIRED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-12\">\u201cThere is typically a considerable time delay between the ADOPTION OF A MASTER PLAN AND THE ADOPTION OF THE IMPLEMENTING ZONING AND SUBDIVISION ORDINANCES, 1 OR 2 YEARS IN <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>some cases. Master plans will have to be good for 6 years UNDER THIS BILL. BETWEEN THE TWO, AN ABSOLUTE CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENT WOULD HAMSTRING A LOCAL JURISDICTION\u2019S ABILITY TO REACT TO CHANGES IN ITS ECONOMY AND ENVIRONMENT.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Our review of the legislative history of the successful 1992 legislation, HB 1195, clearly indicates that the legislation was not intended to impose on local governments a requirement that in applying their special exception provisions, they must comply absolutely and completely with the suggestions of their master plans or of the visions contained in those plans (or as laid out in Article 66B); neither does that review indicate that the General Assembly believed that it was conferring enforcement powers on the Office of State Planning. Had it chose to do the latter, it merely had to enact HB 1003 instead of HB 1195.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">Accordingly, we find nothing in the history of the 1992 legislation, or the failed 1991 legislation, that remotely indicates that the Legislature believed that it was establishing that the use of the word \u201cconform\u201d in the 1970 statute and as stated in Article 66B, without additional restrictive language which was not added, imposed any stricter standard on such land use decisions than the traditional \u201cin harmony with\u201d language of the pre-1970 statute or our pre- and post-1970 cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">C. The 2000 Legislation</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">Two chapters of the Laws of Maryland 2000 concern land use issues. Neither chapter relates to any substantive changes in respect to the specific issue now before the Court. In 1999, a bill was introduced (HB 658) which combined substantive and non-substantive changes to Article 66B. The concept of combining substantive and non-substantive provisions in one bill created concerns and the 1999 bill was not passed. Instead it was sent to \u201csummer study.\u201d As a result, in 2000, the non-substantive and substantive changes were presented as two separate bills. The non-substantive changes were presented in House Bill 889 (there was a companion Senate Bill), which ultimately became Chapter 426 of the Laws of Mary<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>land 2000. The substantive changes were presented in Senate Bill 523 (there was a companion House Bill), which ultimately became Chapter 427 of the Laws of Maryland 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Chapter 426 (House Bill 889), \u201cAN ACT concerning Growth Management\u2014Land Use Definitions and Controls\u201d notes in its purposes clause:<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-6\">\u201cFOR the purpose of revising, restating, and recodifying the growth management and land use laws of the State; renaming Article 66B\u2014Zoning and Planning of Annotated Code of Maryland to be Article 66B-Land Use; and making stylistic changes in the growth management and land use laws of the State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Chapter 426 of the Laws of Maryland 2000, as it relates to definitions, merely repositioned the definition sections of Article 66B. The language of the definition of Special Exception remained the same. The Drafter\u2019s Note stated: \u201cThis section [\u00a7 1.00 \u201cDefinitions.] is transferred without substantive change from former \u00a7 3.06(b) of this article.\u201d There is nothing contained in this statute relating in any way to any change of intent in respect to local control or any change that would indicate that the continued use of the term \u201cconform\u201d in the special exception provision, was intended to impose any new sort of absolute requirement for complete compliance with what have been long considered general guides-master and comprehensive plans and the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">More important, perhaps, were the substantive changes made (and not made) in Article 66B by the adoption of Chapter 427 of the Laws of Maryland 2000 (Senate Bill 523). This chapter increased the power of certain local governments to utilize new procedures to lessen zoning restrictions by creating various new instruments that can affect changes in zoning. In other words, Chapter 427 increased the power of local governments\u2014not decreased that power. It empowered local governments to adopt an \u201cadaptive reuse\u201d procedure that under certain circumstances allowed a local government to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>change the permitted uses of specified properties without the necessity of changing the zoning ordinance. Additionally, Chapter 427 empowered local governments to authorize, under certain circumstances, \u201cadministrative adjustments\u201d to the provisions required under the zoning ordinance. Chapter 427 provides, as relevant to the added power of local governments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AtW\">\u201c[1.001(D) (1) A LOCAL LEGISLATIVE BODY MAY AUTHORIZE THE PLANNING DIRECTOR OR ANOTHER DESIGNEE TO GRANT ADMINISTRATIVE ADJUSTMENTS FROM THE FOLLOWING REQUIREMENTS IN A ZONING ORDINANCE ENACTED BY THE LOCAL LEGISLATIVE BODY:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-5\">(I) LOCAL HEIGHT REQUIREMENTS;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-6\">(II) LOCAL SETBACK REQUIREMENTS;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-7\">(III) LOCAL BULK REQUIREMENTS;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-8\">(IV) LOCAL PARKING REQUIREMENTS;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-9\">(V) LOCAL LOADING, DIMENSIONAL, OR AREA REQUIREMENTS; OR</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-10\">(VI) SIMILAR LOCAL REQUIREMENTS.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-11\">That the chapter next above was intended further to empower, not restrict, local governments is not only clear from the plain language of the statute, but also from the limited legislative history available.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> As relevant to the present issue that legislative history, in part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-12\">\u25ba Maryland Association of Counties, Incorporated March 9, 2000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-13\">\u201cThe Maryland Association of Counties (MACo) SUPPORTS Senate Bill 523.

We found nothing in the 2000 legislation, Chapters 426 and 427 that remotely indicates that the 2000 legislation was intended to restrict the power of local governments in the area of land use. In fact, the contrary is the only interpretation of that legislation that is possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">The conclusion as to the statutes pre-1970, the 1970 statutes, the failed 1991 statutes, the failed and enacted 1992 statutes and the 2000 legislation</p>\n<p id=\"b603-11\">In our extensive review of the statutes we have found no indication that any of the statutes actually enacted by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>Legislature were intended to diminish the local control of land use issues, albeit many additional considerations were imposed upon local governments in their planning processes. Generally, in the legislative battles between the advocates of increasing (if not total) state control of land use issues and the advocates of local control, the forces supporting local control invariably have prevailed in the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">More specifically, neither have we found a single indication that when the word \u201cconform\u201d first found its way into the definition of \u201cspecial exception\u201d that it was intended to modify or restrict the use of the traditional \u201cin harmony with\u201d standard that had previously prevailed. Nor have we found a single instance since 1970 that offers any evidence that the Legislature has thereafter desired to have the word \u201cconform\u201d be defined as a requirement that local governments must absolutely meet every local guide, every local or State vision, or every local desire mentioned in their respective master plans, comprehensive plans or the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Moreover, if a special exception had to meet every provision in the master plans, zoning ordinances and the like, they would not be exceptions in the first instance\u2014they would be in compliance. Likewise, if \u201cvisions\u201d were absolutes, they would be \u201creal\u201d requirements not visionary aspirations.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">The <em>Random House Dictionary of the English Language </em>1597 (1983), as relevant here, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-8\">\u201cvi\u00bbsion ... 2. the act or power of anticipating that which will or may come to be ... 5. a vivid, imaginative conception or anticipation: <em>to have visions of wealth and glory. </em>... 7. a sight that resembles something seen in a vision, dream, etc \u2014 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-9\"><em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>2557 (3rd ed.1961), provides, as relevant here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-10\">\u201c1 vi\u00bbsion ... something seen otherwise than by the ordinary sight; an imaginary, supernatural, or prophetic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>sight ... a vivid concept or object of imaginative contemplation....\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-5\">\u201c2 vision ... 2: to see in or as if in a vision: Imagine, Envision ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">It is clear to the Court, in light of the legislative history surrounding land use legislation over the last 25 years (or longer even) that the use of the words \u201cconform\u201d and \u201cvisions\u201d were never intended by the Legislature to impose absolute requirements on local governments in their practices involving their local land use programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">Could the State find ways to impose absolutely mandatory requirements on local governments in the exercise of local controls? As we have noted\u2014probably. But, the Legislature has been asked time and again to do so, and time and again it has intentionally declined to do so when offered the opportunity.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> In light of that history, the use of the word \u201cconform,\u201d standing alone, in the 1970 definition does not create such a mandatory requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF THE SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED. COSTS IN THIS COURT AND THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONERS.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-10\">HARRELL, Judge which RAKER and BATTAGLIA, Judges, Join.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-11\">I dissent. Although there are significant portions of the Majority opinion that are scholarly and commendable, it im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>properly dissects and assembles the relevant statutes and case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">To my reading, the Majority opinion urges that, because local, non-charter governments are free to choose to implement (or not) the grant of zoning and planning powers from the State Legislature, the non-procedural mandates of Article 66B, the source of the authority to enact those powers, largely need not be followed by such governments that elect to adopt local zoning and planning. The Majority opinion states, \u201c[w]hat [Article 66B] did was to empower [local jurisdictions to adopt zoning], if they chose to do so, and if they so choose, Article 66B imposed <em>suggestions, guides, and in some instances, restrictions on how it was to he done.\u201d </em>Majority op. at 534, 943 A.2d 1192,1199 (emphasis added). This overly broad conclusion is not borne out by the actual language of Article 66B; indeed, the Majority opinion fails to cite a single instance in the Article demonstrating its \u201csuggestive\u201d or \u201cguidance\u201d only grants of power.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">A plain reading of Article 66B suggests, instead, that the General Assembly established many requirements in delegating to, and authorizing implementation of, zoning and planning powers for non-charter counties.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Article details the composition of a local planning commission, including appointment, removal, and composition. Maryland Code (1957, 2003 RepLVol.), Article 66B, \u00a7 3.02. The Article requires the commission to hold a certain number of meetings, to adopt rules, to keep records, and describes the commission\u2019s powers. <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>\u00a7 3.03-3.04. The planning commission is required by the Code to \u201cmake and approve a plan which the commission shall recommend to the local legislative body for adoption.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3.05. Similarly, the Article defines the composition, appointment, terms, and powers for a zoning board of appeals in a non-charter county. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4.07.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">The Article plainly supplies definitions of the zoning tools available for adoption by non-charter counties. In relevant part, \u201cplan\u201d is defined as \u201cthe policies, statements, goals, and interrelated plans for private and public land use, transportation, and community facilities documented in texts and maps which constitute the guide for the area\u2019s future development.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1.00(h). A constituent part of the \u201cplan\u201d includes \u201ca general plan, master plan, comprehensive plan, or community plan adopted in accordance with \u00a7\u00a7 3.01-3.09.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cSpecial exception\u201d is defined as a \u201cgrant of a specific use that would not be appropriate generally or \"without restriction and shall be based upon a finding that certain conditions governing special exceptions as detailed in the zoning ordinance exist, that the use <em>conforms to the plan </em>and is compatible with the existing neighborhood.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1.00(k) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>The view that Article 66B provides local jurisdictions with mostly mere \u201csuggestions\u201d is undermined by the fact that the General Assembly painstakingly detailed the form and substance of local administrative zoning bodies. If the bulk of Article 66B is mere guidance, as the Majority opinion seems to suggest, the General Assembly had no reason to define the terms \u201cplan\u201d and \u201cspecial exception.\u201d Reading Article 66B in its entirety compels the conclusion that it intended to define specifically and limit the powers delegated to non-charter counties. <em>See Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs of Cecil County v. Gaster, </em>285 Md. 238, 243, 401 A.2d 666, 671 (1979) (finding that the Maryland Code required implementation of the plan with respect to subdivision regulations); <em>accord Height v.

Where it does not, the reviewing court must reverse the findings of that administrative agency and generally remand the matter with instructions that the proper standard be applied. <em>Liberty Nursing Ctr., Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene, </em>330 Md. 433, 443, 624 A.2d 941, 946 (1993) (\u201cWhen ... the issue before the agency for resolution is one solely of law, ordinarily no deference is appropriate and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>the reviewing court may substitute its judgment for that of the agency.); <em>People\u2019s Counsel for Balt.

The definition of special exception requires specific considerations. It \u201cshall be based upon a finding that certain conditions governing special exceptions as detailed in the zoning ordinance exist, that the use <em>conforms to the plan </em>and is compatible with the existing neighborhood.\u201d Maryland Code, Article 66B, \u00a7 1.00(k) (emphasis added).

As previously noted, \u201cplan,\u201d as defined by the Article, means \u201cthe guide for the area\u2019s future development.\u201d Maryland Code, Article 66B, \u00a7 1.00(h). The pre-1970 cases relied on by the Majority opinion indicate instead that the \u201cin harmony with\u201d standard was directed toward the local zoning ordinance regulations standing alone, which the common law accorded the same meaning as the \u201ccomprehensive plan.\u201d We said in <em>Montgomery County v.

(emphasis added).[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>The Majority opinion misuses the meanings of the relevant words and phrases established in the earlier cases. The misunderstanding is underscored by a case (not cited by the Majority) that clarifies that the \u201cin harmony\u201d standard is to be used with reference to the zoning ordinance, and that the zoning ordinance must be in \u201cuniformity\u201d and \u201caccord\u201d with a comprehensive plan: \u201c[Article 66B] requires that special exceptions be made only in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the <em>Zoning Ordinance </em>.... \u201d <em>Richmark Realty Co. v. Whittlif, </em>226 Md. 273, 285, 173 A.2d 196, 202 (1961) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The pre-1970 cases apply a statutory standard that existed before the 1970 code revision. Section 7 of the pre-1970 Code noted that a \u201cboard of zoning appeals may ... make special exceptions to the terms of the <em>ordinance </em>in harmony with <em>its </em>general purpose and in accordance with general or specific rules <em>therein contained.\u201d </em>Maryland Code (1 957), Article 66B, \u00a7 7(a) (emphasis added). The Majority contends that the 1970 legislation did not change this standard and should be treated merely as a non-substantive recodification. The 1970 revision to the Code, however, reflects that the \u201cin harmony\u201d standard was eliminated altogether. What replaced it was a delegation to non-charter jurisdictions to authorize their Boards of Appeals to \u201c[h]ear and decide special exceptions to the terms of an ordinance on which the board is required to pass under the ordinance.\u201d Maryland Code, Article 66B, \u00a7 4.07(d)(2). The language of the definition of \u201cspecial exception\u201d added by the 1970 Code amendment informs me that we should not conclude that it was merely a recodification of former \u00a7 7. The new definitional section requires \u201cconformity\u201d to the plan. If the General Assembly intended to retain \u201charmony\u201d as the test it would not have changed the language in \u00a7 7 or it would have employed the term \u201cin harmony with\u201d in the new definitional section. The new section must require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>something different\u2014\u201cconformity\u201d to the \u201cplan,\u201d the \u201cguide for the area\u2019s future development.\u201d Maryland Code, Article 66B, \u00a7 1.00(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">To buttress its claim that \u201charmony\u201d remained the standard, the Majority opinion cites to posi&gt;-1970 cases that mention the \u201charmony\u201d bellwether: principally <em>Turner v. Hammond, </em>270 Md. 41, 310 A.2d 543 (1973); <em>Schultz v. Pritts, </em>291 Md. 1, 432 A.2d 1319 (1981); <em>Alviani v. Dixon, </em>365 Md. 95, 775 A.2d 1234 (2001). The language quoted in these cases is directly traceable to the pre-1970 cases. Moreover, the cases are not concerned with the specific issue raised in the present case. <em>Alviani </em>contains block quotations from <em>Schultz, </em>but itself focuses on variances. 365 Md. at 112-17, 775 A.2d at 1243-47. <em>Schultz, </em>in turn, quotes <em>Turner </em>and the pre-1970 cases. In <em>Schultz </em>and <em>Turner, </em>the Court principally examined the findings of fact necessary to find an adverse effect on neighboring properties, a point unrelated to the necessary relationship standard between a special exception and the \u201cplan\u201d for the area\u2019s future development. <em>Schultz, </em>291 Md. at 23, 432 A.2d at 1331; <em>Turner, </em>270 Md. at 60, 310 A.2d at 553.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The present case is the first case to come before the Court where we are called upon to consider directly the language change made by the General Assembly in 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">The Majority would have us believe that, regardless of the changes effected by the General Assembly\u2019s 1970 legislation, the terms \u201charmony\u201d and \u201cconformity\u201d are synonymous. In so doing, the Majority ignores this Court\u2019s prior decisions that speak <em>directly </em>to the meaning of \u201cconform\u201d when used as a plan standard in zoning and planning matters. In <em>Board of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number><em>County Commissioners of Cecil County v.

How can a county effectively plan for capital expenditures for roads, schools, sewers, and water facilities if, without regard to preexisting plans, a developer, as proposed here, might place a settlement of 1,200 or more people in the middle of a previously undeveloped settlement which would overtax school facilities and which would necessitate improvement of a road whose reconstruction had not been contemplated before 1990?

As we have said time and again, this generally will be ignored by us.

This is not a case where it is alleged that a local statute is not being applied as the local statute requires, but a case (according to the question in the Petition) where it is alleged that a State statute mandates that local governments when exercising local zoning powers must be in absolute and complete compliance with whatever master or comprehensive plans have been adopted by the local governments.

From our review of the record it appears that the local administrative entity in the present case may well have conformed its decision to the relevant requirements in any definitional sense argued by the parties.

Because, however, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>administrative agency based its decision on the right standard, and the certiorari question is limited, we do not need to resolve whether the agency\u2019s decision would have been correct under the standard proffered by the petitioners.

We agree. That Court, as dicta, went on to suggest some examples of types of language that might achieve such a result. Again we agree that the use of language such as \u201cconform\u201d might be a part of the creation of mandates so long as it is surrounded by other language clearly indicating an intent on the part of the Legislature to establish mandates rather than guides. The Court of Special Appeals left the actual resolution of such issues to future cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Such additional language creating mandates is not present in the case <em>sub judice </em>and our examination of the legislative record in respect to the respective statutes, <em>infra, </em>indicates the contrary intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">We also acknowledge our statement in <em>Mayor and Council of Rock-ville v.

The legislative records of the relevant bills were not preserved, or if preserved, we have been unable to access the records.

The language remained basically unchanged in the 1970 statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b577-9\">. This Court has never before held that the insertion of the definitional section was meant to change the traditional standards in respect to the granting of special exceptions.

We do not attempt to include all permutations within these dictionary definitions, only those directly relating to the proposition that \"conform\u201d and \"in harmony\u201d are consistent terms.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b579-8\">. The facts of this case indicate that the challenge mounted against the exception was based upon a lack of harmony with the zoning ordinance, not lack of conformance with the master or comprehensive plan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b582-9\">. The \"Visions\u201d aspect of Article 66B apparently first found its way into the law in a statute from the early 1990s and was repeated in this 1992 legislation. Likewise, the term \"smart growth\u201d first finds its way into the land use arena via the testimony of spokespersons for the Schaefer administration in 1992. References to 2020 legislation refers to a group called the 2020 Panel designated to study and develop plan proposals for inclusion in 1991 legislation that would meet the goals the 2020 Panel proposed to be met by the year 2020. The 1991 legislation apparently was not enacted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b594-12\">. The purpose of including the extensive contents of the bill files in this opinion is not to proffer acceptance or non-acceptance of any speaker\u2019s or writer\u2019s stated position. It is included to show how the controversy over the two bills (HB 1003 and HB 1195) set the stage for the issue over whether local control or state control (i.e., mandated requirements by Art. 66B that local governments completely comply with master plans approved by State entities in considering special exceptions) was intended by the Legislature. The two bills, and the discussions in regard to them clearly lay out what was occurring in 1992 in the Legislature between advocates of local control (local governments and various economic interests) and advocates of state control via mandates. Simply stated HB 1003, if enacted, would have \u25a0 established strong, state control and enforcement; HB 1195 strongly reaffirmed local control and enforcement. HB 1195 passed; HB 1003 did not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b597-8\">.

In that the only proper question before this Court has been adequately addressed, we shall reiterate only briefly that had \u201cconform\u201d been construed to require a higher level (if one exists) of absolute compliance, it appears to the Court from our own assessment of the facts in the record, the conclusions of the administrative entity and the opinion of Court of Special Appeals, that the Board, in any event, made a decision that was not arbitrary, capricious, and unsupported by fact under any definition of \"conform\u201d proffered by petitioners. As noted earlier, however, in our present determination, we (as did the Court of Special Appeals) are affirming the decision of the Board for the reasons it gave for that decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b606-8\">. The constraints of the law vary for local jurisdictions and are dependent on the empowering Article of the Maryland Code. <em>Mayor &amp; City Council of Rockville v. Rylyns Enters., Inc., </em>372 Md. 514 n. 3, 528, 814 A.2d 469, 477 n. 3 (2002). Most charter counties exercise greater freedom because the Maryland Code sketches only the boundaries of available local power concerning zoning and planning for these entities. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1957, 2005 RepLVol.), Article 25A, \u00a7\u00a7 5(U) &amp; 5(X). The Maryland Code, Article 66B, describes the constraints on non-charter counties with far greater clarity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b607-6\">. Compared to this very structured empowerment of non-charter counties, the Maryland Code leaves much more leeway to the people and local governments of charter counties. Where Article 66B details the composition of the board of appeals and planning commission, Article 25A, addressing the same for charter counties, empowers a local government to detail the structure and powers granted the board of appeals and is silent concerning the planning commission. Maryland Code, Article 25A, \u00a7\u00a7 5(U), 5(X). Similarly, where Article 66B defines precisely how a local body may zone, Article 25A broadly grants to charter counties the power to determine that for itself. <em>Compare </em>Maryland Code, Article 25A, \u00a7 5(X) (granting the local government the power to enact local laws relating to zoning) <em>with </em>Maryland Code, Article 66B, \u00a7 4.01 (defining what a local legislative body may regulate and restrict in the process of zoning). Furthermore, unlike Article 66B, which defines the tools that a local jurisdiction may use to zone, Article 25A conspicuously lacks a central definitional section. It seems that charter counties are to determine the meaning of words such as \"special exception\u201d for themselves, a distinction that well may explain and distinguish a number of the cases relied on in the Majority opinion and which arise in a charter county context.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b611-8\">. Citing this case for the contention that the common law standard was applicable to the comprehensive plan, the Majority opinion footnotes that \"[t]he facts of this case indicate that the challenge mounted against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>the exception was based upon a lack of harmony with the zoning ordinance, not lack of conformance with the master plan or comprehensive plan.\u201d Majority op. at 549 n. 20, 943 A.2d 1192, 1208 at n. 20.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b613-8\">. <em>Schultz </em>concludes, \u201c[t]hese standards dictate that if a requested special exception use is properly determined to have an adverse effect upon neighboring properties in the general area, it must be denied.\u201d <em>Schultz v. Pritts, </em>291 Md. 1, 12, 432 A.2d 1319, 1325 (1981). This precept of law is true regardless of whether the Maryland Code dictates an additional required finding of \"harmony\u201d or \"conformity\u201d with the \"plan.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b616-11\">. The Majority opinion states that \"if a special exception had to meet every provision in the master plans, ... they would not be exceptions----\u201d (Majority op. at 574, 943 A.2d 1192, 1221). This statement confuses what a special exception is excepting from in the first place\u2014 the requirements of the <em>zoning ordinance. See Mayor &amp; City Council of Rockville v.

Ironically, as the Majority opinion suggests, had the Board applied the \"conformity\u201d standard here, a very persuasive argument could be made that there was substantial evidence in the record to support granting the special exception.
