We conclude that the writ of certiorari should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">I. Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">Between October 2003 and February 2004, Petitioner entered into separate written home improvement contracts with Darlene Wright, Ruth Daniels and Emma Daniels, but later refused to perform the requested work. The aggrieved individuals filed complaints with the Maryland Home Improvement Commission, and as a result, Stachowski was separately charged three times in the District Court of Maryland, sitting in Somerset County, with failing to perform home improvement contracts in violation of Section 8-605 of the Business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>Regulation Article, Maryland Code (1992,1998 RepLVol.),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and with acting as a contractor without a license in violation of Section 8-601 of the Business Regulation Article, Maryland Code (1992,1998 RepLVol.).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">In the Darlene Wright case (District Court Case 4G10084), Petitioner pled guilty to failing to perform a home improvement contract, the State nolle prossed the charge for acting as a contractor without a license, and Petitioner received a six months suspended sentence, a $1,000.00 suspended fine, three years supervised probation, and was ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $2,142.85, in $250.00 monthly installments. In the Ruth Daniels case (District Court Case 2G10348), Stachowski pled guilty to failing to perform a home improvement contract, the State nolle prossed the charge for acting as a contractor without a license, and Stachowski received a six months suspended sentence, a $1,000.00 suspended fine, three years supervised probation, and was ordered to pay restitution of $8,997.00 in monthly payments of $250.00. In the Emma Daniels case (District Court Case 3G10349), Petitioner pled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>guilty to acting as a contractor without a license, the State nolle prossed the charge for failing to a perform home improvement contract, and Petitioner received a thirty days suspended sentence, a $1,000.00 suspended fine, three years supervised probation, and was ordered to pay restitution of $4,140.00 in monthly increments of $250.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">The restitution orders were a condition of Stachowski\u2019s probation in each case; in none of them did he make the required payments. Subsequently, Judge R. Patrick Hayman of the District Court found Petitioner in violation of probation in all three cases and sentenced Stachowski to six months incarceration in the Darlene Wright case, another six months in the Ruth Daniels case, and another thirty days in the Emma Daniels case, all sentences to be served consecutively. Judge Hayman also separately imposed the $1,000.00 fine, heretofore suspended, in all three cases. Stachowski timely appealed the disposition of the three violation of probation cases to the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">On October 11, 2006, Petitioner pled guilty in the Circuit Court in the three violation of probation cases, now numbered Cases 8150 (the Darlene Wright case), 8151 (the Ruth Daniels case) and 8152 (the Emma Daniels case), which were consolidated for the purposes of the hearing pursuant to a motion filed by the State. Stachowski also agreed to plead guilty in an unrelated, separate matter, Case 8089 that originated in the Circuit Court, in which he was charged with theft under $500.00 in violation of Section 7-104 of the Criminal Law Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">Pursuant to the plea agreement, Stachowski admitted guilt in Case 8089, the unrelated, separate, theft case, and was sentenced to eighteen months, \"with all but five months suspended, and five years probation. As part of Stachowski\u2019s probation in Case- 8089, the Court ordered restitution to be paid to the victims in the home improvement contract cases. In the three violation of probation cases, the Circuit Court revoked Stachowski\u2019s probation and imposed a six months sentence in Case 8150, another six months sentence in Case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>8151, and a thirty day sentence in Case 8152, all to be served consecutively. The following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-5\">[THE STATE]: Your Honor, I believe we\u2019ve worked out a plea agreement although I had not stated that on the record. My understanding of the plea agreement, your Honor, three of these are an appeal for violation of probation from District Court. I think that we\u2019re in agreement and the State would consent to the fact that Judge Hayman had imposed all of the backup time for the cases. And in addition to that he had imposed a thousand dollar f\u00edne per case and ordered that the Defendant serve that off at ten dollars a day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-6\">Your Honor, that portion that we\u2019re in agreement with is that the thousand dollar f\u00edne that he would serve off at ten dollars a day was an illegal sentence. My understanding as part of the plea agreement the Defendant will agree to serve the suspended portion of the sentence which was six months, six months and thirty days. If you need to know for each case it will take me a minute to find that out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-\">[THE COURT]: I\u2019ll look at it in a minute. Go ahead and finish up and we\u2019ll make sure we have our numbers right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AS\">[THE STATE]: Your Honor, as well the Defendant has agreed to plead guilty in Case No. K-06-8089 to the only count, Single count of bad check. Your Honor, the State would recommend an active portion of five months incarceration which would be consecutive to the three other sentences as well. Those would be six months consecutive, consecutive to six months, consecutive to thirty days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-7\">[THE COURT]: Sixty days isn\u2019t it? Did you say thirty or sixty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-8\">[THE STATE]: I believe it\u2019s thirty days, your Honor. And that\u2019s consecutive to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-9\">[COUNSEL FOR STACHOWSKI]: And that\u2019s Case No. 8152.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-10\">[THE STATE]: Consecutive to five months. In this case the suspended portion, your Honor, we would leave up to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>you, but we would recommend some sort of a split sentence with an active period of incarceration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-5\">As well, your Honor, restitution has already been paid in this case. His wife provided documentation this morning\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4v\">[THE COURT]: So all restitution is paid?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-6\">[THE STATE]: In this Case No. 8089 a hundred and eighty-two dollars and fifty cents has been paid by cash to the victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-7\">[THE COURT]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-8\">[THE STATE]: I just need a copy of that for the files.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-9\">Your Honor, as well, the State is not opposed to work release for those active incarcerations as well as local time contingent on the fact that if he is granted work release that he would pay restitution to the victims in the violation of probation cases. Your Honor, he will agree to pay three hundred dollars a month that would be a hundred dollars per victim. Your Honor, that\u2019s not going to be enough to cover all of the restitution but at least they\u2019ll be able to recover some portion of it. And then either sue him civilly or you know\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-10\">[THE COURT]: Central collection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-11\">[THE STATE]: Central collection or put a lien on his house or something of that nature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-12\">And, your Honor, I believe that that would be the nature of the nature of the plea agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-13\">[COUNSEL FOR STACHOWSKI]: I would like to add that the three hundred dollars a month starts at the end of the first full calendar month he\u2019s out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-14\">[THE STATE]: Your Honor, that would be contingent on work release.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-15\">[COUNSEL FOR STACHOWSKI]: Yeah, if he\u2019s out on work release.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-16\">[THE STATE]: Okay. I thought you meant out of jail. [COUNSEL FOR STACHOWSKI]: He\u2019s out on work release.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>[THE COURT]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-4\">[THE COURT]: All right. In 8089 the sentence of the Court is the Defendant shall serve eighteen months in the Somerset County Detention Center. The Court is going to suspend all but five months of that sentence. Give him credit for forty-five days time served. I\u2019m doing it this way for ease of computation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-5\">He\u2019s placed on supervised probation for a period of five years. And I\u2019ll come back to the probation in just a minute. In case ending 8150 I\u2019m going to revoke his probation and impose a sentence of six months in the Somerset County Detention Center consecutive to the sentence imposed in 8089. The sentence in 8089 is consecutive to the last sentence to expire of all outstanding and unserved sentences.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-6\">So 8089 the one in which I just imposed eighteen months suspended all but five is consecutive to the last sentence to expire of all outstanding and unserved sentences. The six month sentence in 8150 is six months, I\u2019ve revoked his probation, to the sentence imposed in 8089. In 8151 I\u2019m going to revoke his probation and impose a sentence of six months in the Somerset County Detention Center consecutive to the sentence imposed in 8150 and the sentence imposed in 8089.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-7\">In 8152 I\u2019m going to revoke his probation and impose a sentence of thirty days in the Somerset County Detention Center consecutive to the sentence imposed in 8151, 8150 and 8089.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-8\">In all cases I\u2019m going to waive fines, costs and fees given the amount of restitution that\u2019s due.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-9\">In 8150 the amount of restitution due is two thousand one-forty-two-eighty-five. The amount of restitution in 8151\u2014that\u2019s to Darlene Wright two thousand one-forty-two-eighty-five. Ruth Daniels is eight thousand nine hundred and ninety-seven dollars. Restitution is ordered in both of those cases. Likewise in 8152 restitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>tion in the amount of four thousand one hundred and fifty dollars is owed to Emma Daniels.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-5\">As a condition of his probation in 8089 he\u2019s to make restitution to those three victims in the amount of three hundred dollars per month beginning thirty days from the last\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-6\">[COUNSEL FOR STACHOWSKI]: The end of the first full calendar month.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-7\">[THE COURT]: The end of the first calendar month. He\u2019s allowed on work release.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-8\">Work release will be allowed subject to the resolution of the detainer in Delaware.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-9\">What have I forgotten other than his post trial rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-10\">[THE STATE]: Are you waiving the supervision fees as well?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-11\">[THE COURT]: Yes. I always do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-12\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-13\">Petitioner filed Applications for Leave to Appeal in the three violation of probation cases and in the unrelated theft case in the Court of Special Appeals asking the intermediate appellate court to review the legality of the probation conditions imposed in the theft case, Case 8089, in which the judge ordered restitution to the three home improvement victims. Pursuant to Maryland Rule 8-132,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Court of Special Appeals transferred the Applications for Leave to Appeal in the three violation of probation cases, Cases 8150, 8151 and 8152, to this Court,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> after which Stachowski filed a Supple<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>ment to Petition for Writ of Certiorari, which we granted. <em>Stachowski v. State, </em>400 Md. 647, 929 A.2d 890 (2007). <em>Stachowski </em>posed the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-5\">Did the trial court, after finding Petitioner in violation of probation in three cases, err in ordering restitution to three victims as a condition of probation in a fourth unrelated case in which no restitution was due?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">In the theft case, Case 8089, the Court of Special Appeals denied Petitioner\u2019s application for leave to appeal. Stachowski filed a motion for reconsideration and on June 28, 2007, the intermediate appellate court put a hold on the case, pending our resolution of the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">The State has filed a motion to dismiss in which the State contends that Stachowski\u2019s petition for certiorari in the violation of probation cases before us should be dismissed, arguing that the issue is not \u201cjusticiable\u201d because Petitioner\u2019s argument deals exclusively with the legality of the Circuit Court\u2019s actions in ordering restitution for the three home improvement victims as one of the conditions of probation in the unrelated theft case, which is not before this Court. Petitioner, conversely, argues that he is challenging the legality of the restitution orders in the three violation of probation cases even though they were imposed in the fourth, unrelated, theft case, and further asserts that were the issue lacking in justiciability, the \u201cquestion is deserving of an answer because the same situation could arise in future cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Although the State argues justiciability and Stachowski counters, in part, by arguing an exception to that policy, the doctrine itself, analytically, has no application in the present case. Rather, Stachowski\u2019s writ of certiorari must be dismissed, in accordance with our jurisprudence, because the legality of the restitution order in the theft case is not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">In <em>Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. v. Webb, </em>291 Md. 721, 436 A.2d 465 (1981), we had the opportunity to address the validity of a \u201cconsent to sue\u201d clause in an uninsured motorist endorsement in light of the provisions of the uninsured motorist law. Two petitions for certiorari had been filed, seemingly, presenting the same legal issue. In one, brought by Anthony Franz, we held that \u201cMAIF, having had notice of the tort action against the uninsured motorist and ample opportunity to intervene, was bound by the judgment in the tort suit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 743, 436 A.2d at 478. In the other, filed by William Jackson Webb, we declined to rule because the \u201cconsent to sue\u201d clause relied upon by the insurer in the litigation, Nationwide Mutual Insurance, was not applicable to the controversy. Judge Eldridge, speaking for this Court, opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-6\">If this case actually presented the same issues as <em>Franz, </em>what was said in Part I of this opinion would be dispositive. However, those issues cannot logically be reached in this case. The factual basis for Nationwide\u2019s position throughout this litigation, and the express premise of the first \u201cquestion\u201d in the certiorari petition, was that the uninsured motorist endorsement contained in Mr. Webb\u2019s policy was applicable, and that, under the terms of that endorsement, Nationwide was not bound by the outcome of the tort suit because it did not consent and because it did not receive the suit papers. However, the endorsement relied upon by Nationwide has no application to the controversy in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-7\">Consequently, Nationwide cannot prevail because of the threshold issue contained in the first question presented in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>its certiorari petition. There are in this case no policy clauses supporting Nationwide\u2019s position. The entire foundation for Nationwide\u2019s contention that it is not bound by the tort judgment are two clauses in endorsement number 576B: (1) the consent to sue clause; (2) the requirement that the insured forward to the insurer the pleadings in the tort action. Since these clauses have no application to this accident, Nationwide\u2019s contention must be rejected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 747-48, 436 A.2d at 480-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Similarly, in <em>Haub v. Montgomery County, </em>353 Md. 448, 462, 727 A.2d 369, 376 (1999), we did not address issues presented by the petitioner because we recognized that \u201csome of the matters which have been argued by the parties are not actually presented by the facts of the case and need not be reached by us.\u201d In <em>Holiday Point Marina Partners v. Anne Arundel County, </em>349 Md. 190, 201-04, 707 A.2d 829, 834 (1998), we declined to rule upon an appeal from a declaratory judgment action where, as here, the issue raised by the petitioner was in another case and not the one before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">Further, in <em>Insurance Commissioner v. Equitable Life Assurance Society, </em>339 Md. 596, 664 A.2d 862 (1995), we were called upon to address the applicability and constitutionality of various sections of Article 48A authorizing differentials in certain insurance rates and underwriting based on gender if actuarially justified. We declined because of their inapplicability to the controversy before us:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-8\">The Insurance Commissioner\u2019s order in this case was premised entirely upon the applicability of Art. 48A, \u00a7\u00a7 223(b)(2), 226(c)(2) and/or 234A(b), to Equitable\u2019s gender based life insurance rates. Moreover, both the Insurance Commissioner\u2019s and the circuit court\u2019s interpretation and application of Art. 49B, \u00a7 8, was based upon the presumed applicability of the more specific \u00a7\u00a7 223(b)(2), 226(c)(2) and 234A(b). We have concluded that these three sections are inapplicable to the present controversy; thus, the Insurance Commissioner\u2019s order must be vacated in its entirety. Moreover, because of the inapplicability of these sections, both the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>Insurance Commissioner and the circuit court erred in ruling on the constitutionality of the statutes. Neither an administrative agency nor a court should pass upon the [issues] which are inapplicable to the controversy before the agency or the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 634-35, 664 A.2d at 881-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">In <em>St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Co. v. House, </em>315 Md. 328, 554 A.2d 404 (1989), we were asked to resolve a question of whether an insurer had to prove actual prejudice resulting from a lack of notice or cooperation on the part of the insured in order to disclaim coverage under a \u201cclaims made\u201d liability policy because the claim was not made while the policy was in effect. We declined to address the question, noting that that \u201cissue is not presented on the facts of this case, however, because that issue arises only if the policy here involved is construed as the insurer contends.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 330, 554 A.2d at 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Finally, in <em>Clea v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>312 Md. 662, 541 A.2d 1303 (1988), we declined to address a respondeat superior issue regarding the liability of the Baltimore City Police Department and its Commissioner, as state agencies, for the conduct of one of their officers because the issue was not properly before us in the case. <em>See also Layton v. Howard County Bd. of Appeals, </em>399 Md. 36, 45 n. 6, 922 A.2d 576, 581 n. 6 (2007) (\u2018Whether reapplication prohibitions apply when the law itself is changed is an issue not directly presented in this case and the resolution must await a case in which the issue is present.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">In all of these cases, we declined to address questions raised in the petitions for certiorari, because, for a number of reasons, the issues were not presented by the facts of the cases. In the present case, we also decline to address the question raised in the petition for certiorari because Stachowski is challenging a circuit court order requiring him to pay restitution in \u00e1 case which is not before us. Thus, any resolution of the issue presented would have no effect on either Stachowski or the State; a reversal of the Circuit Court orders in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>home improvement cases, as requested by Stachowski, would have no effect on the restitution order in the theft case. As a result, we dismiss the writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">WRIT OF CERTIORARI DISMISSED WITH COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b32-10\">.
