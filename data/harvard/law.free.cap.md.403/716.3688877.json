Nonetheless, the views shared by myself and Judges Greene, Karwacki, and Wenner, joined in part by Judge Rodowsky (as explained in his concurrence), result in a majority opinion and judgment of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">Petitioner, Bruce C. Bereano, raised two questions in his petition for writ of certiorari:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-8\">I. Whether the enforcement provisions of the Maryland state ethics laws may be applied retroactively to an agreement that was executed two months before the statute was enacted?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-9\">II. Whether the \u201cmissing witness rule\u201d should be applica- . ble to administrative agency proceedings in Maryland, and even if it can be, did the Commission commit reversible error by misapplying the rule by violating petitioner\u2019s due process rights to notice and an opportunity to be heard, shifting the burden of proof to petitioner, and ignoring the \u201cpeculiar control\u201d requirement?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-11\">The Court is unanimous in its disposition of the first issue as explicated in Part I of this opinion. We part company, however, as to the disposition of the second issue. Part II of the Court\u2019s opinion is joined in its entirety by myself and Judges Greene, Karwacki, and Wenner. In a concurrence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>Judge Rodowsky explains what portion of Part II he joins, as well as why he joins the judgment. A dissent by Judge Theime, joined by Judge Getty, reveals why they are unable to subscribe to Part II of the Court\u2019s opinion or the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The result is that the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals shall be reversed and the matter remanded to that Court with directions to reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court for Howard County and further remand the case to the Circuit Court with directions that it reverse the final decision of the State Ethics Commission and remand the case to the Commission for further proceedings not in consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">Petitioner Bereano failed to convince the State Ethics Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Circuit Court for Howard County, and the Court of Special Appeals that he did not knowingly and willingly violate Maryland Code (1984, 2004 RephVol.), \u00a7 15-713(1) of the State Government Article. He now solicits this Court to find error in the determination that he was engaged for lobbying purposes for compensation contingent upon executive or legislative action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-10\">The material facts in large measure are undisputed, although their consequences are not. In September of 2001, Bereano, an experienced lobbyist of many years, entered into an agreement to provide lobbying and consulting services to Mercer Venture, Inc., d/b/a Social Work Associates (Mercer). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>The terms of this agreement were set forth in a letter from Bereano to Mike Tra\u00edna of Mercer, dated 1 September 2001. This was signed by Tra\u00edna on 13 September 2001. The letter began with a reference to \u201cour discussions,\u201d and, in its first paragraph, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-5\">I propose to represent Mercer Ventures in the State of Maryland in a lobbying, political consulting, and strategy development capacity relative to the Company\u2019s plans to develop and obtain contracts and arrangements with various county, municipal, and State government agencies and departments in order to provide and perform on a privatized basis staffing agencies and case management functions. In addition, I would be willing and able to assist your company with any business development and activities in other states and jurisdictions outside of Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-6\">Paragraph two provided:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-7\">I propose commencing the month of September 1, 2001, a monthly retainer fee of $2,000.00 plus reimbursement for any necessary and reasonable expenses such as postage, duplicating costs, long distance telephone calls, mileage, fax expense, and <em>legislative meals' and entertainment. </em>Any significant or unusual expenses would have to be approved and authorized by you before being incurred. These fees and expenses would be paid and continue on a regular basis once your company attains a financial cash flow, and ability to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b754-9\">Paragraphs three and four amplified the services to be provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-10\">The nature and scope of my services for the monthly retainer would include and encompass performing lobbying services, giving advice, consultation, strategy and be a resource concerning legislative and political and government matters at both the State and local levels, attending and participating in all necessary and required meetings, monitoring and watchdogging on behalf of the Company, and providing information to your companies as to matters of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>concern and importance with its work and relationships with the State of Maryland, as well as any political subdivision in the State and generally performing any and all other such similar and related services and activities as you may request of me. In this regard, I also would register as a lobbyist and fully comply and conform with the State\u2019s applicable law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-4\">It is further understood and agreed that in addition to and separate and apart from payment of the aforementioned monthly fee retainer fee and any further increase thereof, Mercer Ventures will compensate and further pay me one percent (1 %) of the first year receivable for continuing representation and services be performed, provided, and made available when and after each separate facility and/or site or location that is opened in which I was involved in securing and participated in obtaining, and/or any contract and performance of services which is entered into by your company with any government entity, unit or agency in the State of Maryland or any other state or jurisdiction in which I worked on the matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Next, Bereano addressed the subject of relationships with non-governmental entities:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-6\">As to and concerning any private contracts and business which I assist and help on obtaining for your company it is understood and agreed upon that separate from and in addition to any monthly fee arrangement as set forth herein I also will receive and be paid a monthly agreed upon bonus and reward for each such private contract or business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">As summarized by the Court of Special Appeals in its reported opinion in this case, the following resulted from the signing of this document:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-8\">On November 13, 2001, Bereano filed a lobbying registration form with the Commission, declaring, under oath, his intention to perform executive and legislative action lobbying on behalf of Social Work Associates, a subsidiary of Mercer. Bereano indicated that the effective date for lobbying on behalf of Social Work Associates for \u201cany and all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>legislative and executive matters concerning staffing and case management foster care, children and social services issues\u201d was November 1, 2001 to October 31, 2002.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-5\">Later, on December 1, 2001, Bereano sent an invoice to Mercer requesting a $2,000 retainer for the months of September, October, November, and December. He also requested payment for expenses that included long distance phone calls, mileage, duplicating, and $393.34 in \u201cLegislative Meals [and] Expenses.\u201d Again, in an invoice dated January 16, 2002, Bereano requested payment in the amount of $24,000 for \u201cprofessional [s]ervices [r]endered,\u201d and a $2,000 retainer for January. He also sought reimbursement for expenses, including $454.39 in \u201clegislative meals and expenses.\u201d Bereano sent similar invoices to Mercer billing for his monthly retainer fee and seeking reimbursement of \u201clegislative expenses,\u201d meals and entertainment, mileage, duplicating, and long distance telephone calls on February 6, 2002, March 1, 2002, April 1, 2002, May 1, 2002, and June 1, 2002.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-6\">Tra\u00edna sent Bereano a letter dated May 17, 2002, detailing Mercer\u2019s recent projects. The letter was accompanied by an \u201cOrganizational Capability\u201d statement, listing among Mercer\u2019s \u201cmajor clients\u201d the following State Agencies: the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services; the Department of Assessments and Taxation; the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene; the Department of Business and Economic Development; and the Department of Human Resources.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-7\"><em>Bereano v. State Ethics Commission, </em>174 Md.App. 146, 156, 920 A.2d 1137, 1143 (2007).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">On 12 June 2002, Tra\u00edna wrote to Bereano that he had learned of an investigation by the press into whether paragraph 4 of their agreement was a prohibited contingency fee. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>Although Traina told Bereano he considered this a \u201cmisinterpretation,\u201d he requested that their contract be amended to delete that language. Bereano agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">In addition, Bereano filed with the Commission an amended report on his lobbying activities on behalf of Mercer. In his initial report, dated 31 May 2002, he listed compensation for lobbying activities during the period of 1 November 2001 through 30 April 2002 as $139,379.46. On 13 June 2002, he changed that figure to $17,579.46. In a later report, filed on 2 December 2002, Bereano stated that he had performed lobbying activities on behalf of Traina\u2019s business from 1 May 2002 through 31 October 2002, for which he had received a total o f $10,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">The Commission\u2019s staff initiated a complaint against Bereano on 19 September 2002. A hearing on the merits began on 25 June 2003. Throughout his testimony, Bereano insisted that paragraph 4 of the 1 September 2001 letter agreement did not create a contingency agreement. He stated repeatedly that he was an experienced lobbyist and legislative draftsman who knew of the longstanding prohibition against contingency fees. He explained the intent of this paragraph as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-6\">If\u2014what is in the separate arrangement here is that by providing further services, in other words working, continuing representation and services to be performed, I would be paid for additional work and services, not a success fee, not a bonus, not an outcome situation. In other words, the language in here for continuing representation and services to be performed, I would have to work for that; and that is why those words are in there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-7\">Now, this has never come to be, but just in discussing it in answering your question, Madam Commissioner, those words are there and were intended to be there to mean that you\u2019re not going just to get something and not do anything or what have you. You\u2019re going to have to continue working and provide services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>As long as, and that\u2019s why this language is in here, I continued to perform work and services. As clear as the nose that I have on my face, I have known from day one, Madam Commissioner, I swear to you, that you can\u2019t have contingencies, and to me contingencies are a bonus, a success fee, here\u2019s something and you\u2019re finished. The intent of this document and the drafting of this document was in compensation for continuing work and it was phrased by saying continuing representation and services to be performed. That is a condition precedent and a continuing condition to the receipt of additional compensation, which, respectfully, in the drafting of this I did not consider to be a contingency arrangement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-5\">I would just say finally, and I mean this sincerely, hindsight, you know, in hindsight could be drafted better, no question. No question. Hindsight is wonderful for everybody. And I say that sincerely. I\u2019m not saying that just as I\u2019m sitting here on a witness stand under oath. I know it looks that way, but everybody that knows me knows that I have never done a contingency in my life, and I\u2019ve told people you can\u2019t have it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">In addition, Bereano testified that it was not he, but his client, who wrote paragraph four:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-7\">This letter is on my stationery and I did type up and send this letter to Mr. Tra\u00edna and I am not trying to walk away from it. The truth of the matter is that this language was Mr. Traina\u2019s language. I\u2019m not making excuses, I\u2019m not walking away from this. It\u2019s on my\u2014I typed it and I signed it. He signed it too. But he gave me this language and I know if he were here under oath he would say that to you as well....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">Bereano further testified that Tra\u00edna never asked him for his assistance with work from State agencies, although he acknowledged that he tried to find opportunities for Mercer in the private sector and at the county and local levels of government. He denied performing any services for Mercer that could be considered lobbying and detailed his work on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>business development with private entities. He explained that he registered as Mercer\u2019s lobbyist out of an abundance of caution, as previous legal problems had convinced him always to make the fullest possible disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">When confronted with his bills to Mercer for \u201clegislative meals and expenses,\u201d after 1 November 2001, under paragraph 2 of the 1 September 2001 letter of agreement, Bereano gave several accounts of what had happened during meetings with legislators. He denied that the terms used in these bills meant he had been lobbying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-5\">It was related to meetings that Mr. Tra\u00edna and I had with legislators that he knows that were social in nature. There was no discussion of any bills or any policies or any actions or anything of that nature. Mr. Tra\u00edna from a previous job came to know a number of state legislators, so whenever we had social time periods with those legislators, that\u2019s what these charges related to.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">He also stated that he had not billed Mercer for \u201csocial time,\u201d Subsequently, he elaborated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-7\">Q. But you testified that you didn\u2019t speak to any public officials with regard to Mr. Tra\u00edna\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-8\">A. On lobbying matters. They were all social. Mr. Tra\u00edna has known from a previous employment a number of legislators in the Baltimore area. And on social occasions, there was no issues, no lobbying, no bills, nothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-9\">Q. If it is a, if it\u2019s purely a social meal or social dinner, why is it being billed? You mean to tell me you don\u2019t discuss business with these legislators?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-10\">A. No, no, there\u2019s nothing to discuss.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-11\">Q. Then why is it billed as an expense if it\u2019s not related?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-12\">A. Because Mr. Tra\u00edna under our agreement is going to reimburse me for my expenses. Sometimes I would pick up not only my meal but his meal and then bill him back.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-13\">In explaining his billing practices, however, Bereano noted that personal relationships were an advantage to his clients:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>[I]in lobbying you can spend a few moments talking to a public official and it\u2019s very valuable to your client. Because you\u2019ve had immediate access or you have a <em>foundation of relationship </em>for that conversation, you can get a quick result or action or decision or clarification. The value of that is far greater than maybe 15 minutes of an hourly billing or something of that nature. So the' clients understand that, the lobbyist understands that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">THE STATUTE</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">Bereano concedes that Maryland law has long prohibited contingency fees for lobbying. Prior to 1 November 2001, this prohibition was codified in \u00a7 5-706 of the State Government Article, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-9\">A regulated lobbyist may not be engaged for lobbying purposes for compensation that is dependent in any manner on:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-10\">(1) (i) the enactment or defeat of legislation; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-11\">(ii)any other contingency related to legislative action;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-12\">or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-13\">(2) (i)the outcome of any executive action relating to the solicitation or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-14\">securing of a procurement contract; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-15\">(ii) any other contingency related to executive action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-16\">Although the prohibition existed, a sanction did not. A Study Commission on Lobbyist Ethics, established in 1999, recommended the adoption of sanctions. (H.J.R. 20, Chapter 3, Acts of 1999 and S.J.R. 3, Chapter 2, Acts of 1999). In response, the General Assembly adopted the following legislation, which became effective on 1 November 2001, codified as \u00a7 15-405:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-17\">(d) If the Ethics Commission determines that a respondent has violated Subtitle 7 of this title, the Ethics Commission may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>(1) require a respondent who is a regulated lobbyist to file any additional reports or information that reasonably relates to information required under \u00a7\u00a7 15-703 and 15-704 of this title;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-4\">(2) impose a fine not exceeding $5,000 for each violation; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-5\">(3) subject to subsection (e) of this section, suspend the registration of a regulated lobbyist.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">(e)(1) If the Ethics Commission determines it necessary to protect the public interest and the integrity of the governmental process, the Ethics Commission may issue an order to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-7\">(1) suspend the registration of an individual regulated lobbyist if the Ethics Commission determines that the individual regulated lobbyist:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-8\">1. has knowingly and willfully violated Subtitle 7 of this title; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-9\">2. has been convicted of a criminal offense arising from lobbying activities; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-10\">(ii) revoke the registration of an individual regulated lobbyist if the Ethics Commission determines that, based on acts arising from lobbying activities, the individual regulated lobbyist has been convicted of bribery, theft, or other crime involving moral turpitude.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-11\">(2) If the Commission suspends the registration of an individual regulated lobbyist under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the individual regulated lobbyist may not engage in lobbying for compensation for a period, not to exceed 3 years, that the Commission determines as to that individual regulated lobbyist is necessary to satisfy the purposes of this subsection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-12\">(3) If the Commission revokes the registration of an individual regulated lobbyist under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the individual regulated lobbyist may not engage in lobbying for compensation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>C.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">Our review of the Commission\u2019s fact-finding does not permit us to engage in an independent analysis of the evidence. <em>Anderson v. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety &amp; Corr. Servs., </em>330 Md. 187, 212, 623 A.2d 198, 210 (1993). Under no circumstances may we substitute our judgment for that of the agency. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThat is to say, a reviewing court, be it a circuit court or an appellate court, shall apply the substantial evidence test to the final decisions of an administrative agency----\u201d <em>Balt. Lutheran High Sch. Ass\u2019n., Inc. v. Employment Sec. Admin., </em>302 Md. 649, 662, 490 A.2d 701, 708 (1985); <em>Anderson, </em>330 Md. at 212, 623 A.2d at 210; <em>Bulluck v. Pelham Wood Apts., </em>283 Md. 505, 513, 390 A.2d 1119, 1125 (1978); <em>Moseman v. County Council of Prince George\u2019s County, </em>99 Md.App. 258, 262, 636 A.2d 499. 501 (1994). In this context, \u201c \u2018substantial evidence,\u2019 as the test for reviewing factual findings of administrative agencies, has been defined as \u2018such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion____\u2019 \u201d <em>Bulluck, </em>283 Md. at 512, 390 A.2d at 1123 (quoting <em>Snowden v. Mayor of Balt., </em>224 Md. 443, 448, 168 A.2d 390, 392 (1961)). We are also obligated to view \u201cthe agency\u2019s decision in the light most favorable to the agency, since its decisions are prima facie correct and carry with them the presumption of validity.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>330 Md. at 213, 623 A.2d at 210; <em>Bulluck, </em>283 Md. at 513, 390 A.2d at 1119.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">\u201cengaged for lobbying purposes\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">Bereano commences by contending that he was not subject to any sanction because he was not \u201cengaged for lobbying purposes\u201d on behalf of Mercer on or after 1 November 2001, the date when the legislation took effect. At the threshold, we agree with Bereano on the question of whether the sanction provision of \u00a7 15-405 may be applied retrospec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>tively. In general, statutes are presumed to operate prospectively unless a contrary intent appears. A statute will be given retrospective effect if that is the legislative intent, but not if this would impair vested rights, deny due process, or violate the prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws. A statute governing procedure or remedy is applied to cases pending in court only when the statute becomes effective. <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Kim, </em>376 Md. 276, 289, 829 A.2d 611, 618 (2003). In <em>State Ethics Commission v. Evans, </em>382 Md. 370, 855 A.2d 364 (2004), we applied these principles to the statute in question in the instant case. Evans was a registered lobbyist who was convicted of wire and mail fraud in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland as a result of his lobbying activities. <em>Evans, </em>382 Md. at 373, 855 A.2d at 365. He completed his sentence in 2000, before \u00a7 15-405 took effect. <em>Id. </em>In 2002, after that section had been in effect for several months, Evans attempted to return to lobbying and the Commission immediately attempted to sanction him under its newly granted authority. <em>Evans, </em>382 Md. at 373, 855 A.2d at 366. We held that \u00a7 15-405 was unavailable as the basis for sanctions unless the improper conduct occurred when that statute was in effect. <em>Evans, </em>382 Md. at 388, 855 A.2d at 374.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Bereano submits that his plight is indistinguishable from that of Evans. He classifies any improper conduct as the inclusion of a prohibited contingency clause in the agreement by which he was retained, a discrete act that occurred prior to 1 November 2001, the effective date of \u00a7 15-405. Bereano testified that he did not fulfill the agreement by lobbying on behalf of Mercer after 1 November 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">For diverse reasons, we disagree. First, under the applicable standard of review, the Commission was empowered to resolve conflicts in the evidence, based upon its conclusions concerning its determination of the credibility of the testimony and evidence presented. Faced with conflicting evidence in the form of Bereano\u2019s 13 November 2001 registration as a lobbyist on behalf of Mercer, his bills to Mercer for legislative \u201cexpenses,\u201d as well as meals, the fact that he filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>official documents showing lobbying activities after 1 November 2001, and its evaluation of Bereano\u2019s demeanor and credibility while testifying, the Commission found uncredible his claim to have done nothing other than socialize with legislators:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-5\">We find the Respondent\u2019s testimony to be less than credible and incongruous with the plain language of the documents submitted into evidence. Respondent\u2019s fee letter of September 1, 2001 to Mr. Tra\u00edna recites that he was \u201cfollowing up our discussions.\u201d Respondent proposes to \u201crepresent Mercer Ventures in the State of Maryland\u201d in a \u201clobbying\u201d capacity relating to the company plans \u201cto develop and obtain contracts and arrangements with various county, municipal, and State <em>government agencies and departments\u201d </em>(emphasis added). The lobbying services would include \u201cgovernment matters at both the State and local levels\u201d and Respondent would provide information to the company \u201cas to matters of concern and importance with its work and relationship with the State of Maryland.\u201d Respondent also indicates that he \u201cwould register as a lobbyist.\u201d A reader of the September 1, 2001 letter has to go five paragraphs into the letter before the words \u201cprivate contracts and businesses\u201d appear. Respondent was being hired to obtain State contracts in Maryland and his testimony that it was not until nine months after the fee agreement that he became aware that Mr. Tra\u00edna had some existing contracts with State agencies, is not credible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-6\">Respondent testified that he did \u201cnothing at the State level.\u201d Yet he registered as a lobbyist on November 13, 2001 for the period November 1, 2001 through October 31, 2002 (Staff Counsel Exhibit No. 1, Respondent Mercer Venture Exhibit 2). On June 12, 2002 Respondent filed an \u201cAmended and Revised\u201d General Lobbying Activity Report under oath and on behalf of Social Work Associates for the period November 1, 2001 through April 30, 2002. (Staff Counsel Exhibit No. 4). Respondent reported compensation and expenses related to \u201cany and all legislative and executive matters concerning staffing and case manage<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>ment, and social services issues.\u201d Included in the report is $200 for \u201cgifts to or for officials or employees or their immediate families.\u201d [footnote omitted] At the hearing Respondent could not explain the gift disclosure and denied making any gifts to officials on behalf of Mercer Ventures. During the same time period, Respondent was submitting invoices to Mr. Tra\u00edna that included statements for \u201clegislative expenses\u201d and \u201clegislative expenses and meals.\u201d Respondent testified that he kept detailed time records on all his activities on behalf of his clients. Yet Respondent did not produce records at the hearing showing his activities on behalf of Mr. Tra\u00edna and Mercer Ventures.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">We will not second-guess its assessment of that evidence. What the Court of Special Appeals observed, in another case in the context of declaring a mistrial, is equally appropriate here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-5\">[The trial court\u2019s] reviewing stand was, after all, far better situated than our own. He had shared firsthand the entire course of the trial; had observed the demeanor and reactions of witnesses, lawyers, and jurors alike; was privy to the vital non-verbal communication; and was in the right position to sense the vibrations that never surface in a typewritten record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-6\"><em>DeLuca v. State, </em>78 Md.App. 395, 435, 553 A.2d 730, 750 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">In the case at bar, we accept all of the Commission\u2019s first level factual findings that Bereano took actions that constituted lobbying after 1 November 2001. We next will review the Commission\u2019s interpretation of the law as it applies to the facts actually found, not to the facts envisioned, especially when the Commission\u2019s decision turns on its assessment of a party\u2019s credibility. Having done so, we must \u201cdetermine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>Aviation Admin, v. Noland, </em>386 Md. 556, 573 n. 3, 873 A.2d 1145, 1155 n. 3 (2005) (quoting <em>United Parcel v. People\u2019s Counsel, </em>336 Md. 569, 577, 650 A.2d 226, 230 (1994)). For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>facts found by the Commission correctly interpreted Maryland Code (1984, 2004 RepLVol.), \u00a7 15-713(1) of the State Government Article and the law was not applied retrospectively.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-5\">The Commission found:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-6\">The plain language of the agreement drafted by the Respondent clearly contemplated the lobbying of various county, municipal and State government agencies and departments in Maryland, for a flat fee plus the <em>1% </em>contingency fee. A fair reading of the focus of the agreement was that Respondent was going to lobby in Maryland and as a side thought, the fee agreement would also apply if Respondent was successful in other States----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-7\">The facts indicate that Respondent did not file his lobbying registration on behalf of Mercer Ventures d/b/a Social Work Associates with the Commission until November 13, 2001. As such, Respondent is subject to the provisions of the law in effect as of that date, which includes the new sanctions contained in HB2. Additionally, the contingency fee restrictions contained in the Ethics Law date back to the inception of the law in 1979 and have not changed in substance since 1994. Moreover, the fee agreement at issue here was in effect until June 12, 2002 when the contingent fee provision was terminated by letter. Respondent billed Mercer Ventures pursuant to this agreement and submitted Lobbying Activity Reports in reference to this agreement, well past the November 1, 2001 effective date of HB2. As a result, Respondent\u2019s agreement and continuing relationship with Mercer Ventures is properly subject to the sanctions introduced by HB2. Accordingly, we do not believe the present complaint is a retroactive application of the law and we have authority to impose fines and suspension if appropriate____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-8\">Respondent continues to lobby and is currently registered on behalf of Mercer Venture, Inc. and on behalf of the tobacco industry on matters concerning the \u201cwholesale and retail business of tobacco\u201d; the welfare system on matters concerning \u201cWelfare Pilot Program, privatization issues, welfare eligibility, supplemental benefits and medical man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>agement care and child support collection programs\u201d; and the professional liability insurance industry on matters concerning \u201cprofessional malpractice insurance issues for physicians and other healthcare providers, negligence and tort law issues,\u201d among other clients.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-4\">As pointed out by the Court of Special Appeals:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-5\">According to the Commission, the fact that Bereano may not have actually secured contracts for Mercer or have been compensated pursuant to the terms of the contingency clause of the Fee Agreement was \u201cirrelevant\u201d because S.G. \u00a7 15-713(1) proscribes a registered lobbyist from \u201cbeing engaged for lobbying purposes\u201d for compensation that is contingent upon legislative or executive action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">174 Md.App. at 161, 920 A.2d at 1146.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-7\">And further:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-8\">Despite Bereano\u2019s explanations of the intentions of the parties, the plain language of the Fee Agreement supports the Commission\u2019s interpretation that Bereano was \u201cengaged for lobbying purposes\u201d on behalf of Mercer \u201cto develop and obtain contracts and arrangements with ... State government agencies and departments.\u201d For his success in obtaining \u201ccontract[s] and performance of services with <em>any </em>government entity, unit or agency in the State of Maryland,\u201d he was to be compensated one percent of the first year receivable in addition to the $2,000 monthly retainer. (Emphasis added.) In effect, the securing of government contracts was such an integral part of the Fee Agreement that all of the provisions of the Fee Agreement were subject to modification \u201cexcept for the provision and understanding ... to compensate [Bereano] when and after any contract is entered into [with] a government unit.\u201d Even if the percentage of the first year receivable was intended as a flat fee for continuing services, the contract still provides for compensation that is contingent upon the executive action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">174 Md.App. at 172-73, 920 A.2d at 1152-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-10\">Bereano argues that he simply signed the agreement but did absolutely nothing to execute it. As the Court of Special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>Appeals stated, \u201cWe are persuaded that the legislative intent as expressed in the language of the statute supports an interpretation that entering into a contract for \u2018lobbying purposes\u2019 for compensation is an \u2018engage[ment]\u2019 and that the \u2018engage[ment]\u2019 continues for so long as the contract remains in effect.\u201d 174 Md.App. at 168, 920 A.2d at 1150.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">The crucial element is not that an agreement was signed by the parties. To the contrary <em>it is that the agreement gave Mercer a claim upon Bereano\u2019s time and lobbying </em>services. There is no requirement that services actually be rendered, as the benefit to Tra\u00edna begins and continues for as long as Bereano is \u201con call.\u201d Thus, the agreement entitled Mercer to expect that Bereano would take actions to protect and advance its interests and would refrain from taking actions that would have an undesirable effect. For example, had unfavorable legislation been introduced during the term of the agreement and had Bereano done nothing to thwart it, Mercer might have legal recourse for Bereano\u2019s failure to fulfill his lobbying obligations. In this regard, there is a kinship to a lawyer\u2019s \u201cengagement fee\u201d or \u201cavailability fee,\u201d in which the service purchased by the client is the attorney\u2019s availability to render service if and as needed as long as the agreement continued. <em>In re Gray\u2019s Run Technologies, Inc., </em>217 B.R. 48, 53 (Bkrtcy. M.D.Pa.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Bereano\u2019s engagement as Mercer\u2019s lobbyist commenced, but did not terminate, on the day the agreement was signed. Despite his protestations, the Commission found that Bereano \u201cengaged in\u201d the lobbying activities for which he was \u201cengaged by\u201d Mercer, making himself available for, and engaging in, lobbying purposes after 1 November 2001, the effective date of the statute. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">In his concluding assignment' of error, Bereano confronts the authority of the Commission to infer that his failure to call Tra\u00edna as a witness indicates that Traina\u2019s testimony would be unfavorable. The \u201cmissing witness rule,\u201d or \u201cempty chair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>doctrine,\u201d permits an \u201cadverse inference to be drawn from a party\u2019s failure to call a material witness, when the circumstances are such that the party should naturally have called the missing witness.\u201d JOSEPH J. MURPHY, JR., MARYLAND EVIDENCE HANDBOOK \u00a7 409(B), at 142 (3d ed.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">The implicated portion of the Commission\u2019s Final Decision and Order of concern is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-5\">At the hearing Respondent testified that the language in the fee agreement related to <em>\u201c1% of </em>the first year receivables\u201d was added to the agreement at Mr. Traina\u2019s request and that Mr. Tra\u00edna had sent him the language. The records provided at the hearing indicate that Respondent billed Mr. Tra\u00edna for \u201cLegislative expenses\u201d and \u201cLegislative expenses and meals.\u201d He testified that the \u201cLegislative meals\u201d were costs associated with his and Mr. Traina\u2019s personal meals with legislators who were personal friends and acquaintances. Mr. Tra\u00edna was on the Respondent\u2019s witness list submitted to the Commission as part of the prehearing requirement pursuant to our regulations at CO-MAR 19A.01.03.09.A(2). Because Mr. Tra\u00edna did not appear and testify, we make the inference pursuant to the \u201cmissing witness rule\u201d that his testimony would not have supported Respondent\u2019s testimony particularly in view of Respondent\u2019s incongruous testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">Some background is appropriate on the rules governing administrative adjudications by the Commission to illustrate why reliance on the missing witness rule to support the agency decision in the present case is problematic. In a contested administrative hearing under the State Administrative Procedure Act (APA), each party \u201cshall offer all of the evidence that the party wishes to have made part of the record.\u201d Maryland Code (1984, 2004 RepLVol.), State Govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>ment Article, \u00a7 10\u2014213(a)(1).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Similarly, if \u201cthe agency has any evidence that the agency wishes to use in adjudicating the contested case, the agency shall make the evidence part of the record.\u201d \u00a7 10\u2014213(a)(2). It is clear that the Commission, in reaching its final decision, is limited to the facts presented on the record.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> MD. CODE REGS. 19A.01.03.10(E)(4)(d) provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-5\">[ejxcept as set forth in \u00a7 E(4)(e) [taking official notice of a fact] and (f) [inadmissibility of settlement offers] of this regulation, all evidence, including records and documents in the possession of the Commission, of which the Commission desires to avail itself, shall be offered and made a part of the record in the case. Other factual information or evidence may not be considered in the determination of the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">There are sound policy reasons for the requirement that agencies are limited to the record in deciding a given case. In addition to satisfying constitutional due process requirements, the rule that agency decisions are limited to the record ensures that the agencies \u201cobserve the basic rules of fairness as to parties appearing before them.\u201d <em>Fairchild Hiller Corp. v. Supervisor of Assessments for Wash. County, </em>267 Md. 519, 524, 298 A.2d 148, 150 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">The missing witness rule was misapplied here. The vital passage in American law regarding the missing witness rule comes from <em>Graves v. United States, </em>150 U.S. 118, 121, 14 S.Ct. 40, 41, 37 L.Ed. 1021 (1893):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>The rule ... is that, if a party has it peculiarly within his power to produce witnesses whose testimony would elucidate the transaction, the fact that he does not do it creates the presumption that the testimony, if produced, would be unfavorable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">A pivotal issue in the present case for proper application of the rule is whether Tra\u00edna was \u201cpeculiarly\u201d available to Bereano, but not to the Commission or its staff counsel. The dissent here compares the issue regarding the missing witness inference to another issue addressed in the Commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-5\">During the same time period, [Bereano] was submitting invoices to Mr. Tra\u00edna that included statements for \u2018legislative expenses\u2019 and \u2018legislative expenses and meals.\u2019 [Bereano] testified that he kept detailed time records on all his activities on behalf of his clients. Yet [Bereano] did not produce records at the hearing showing his activities on behalf of Mr. Tra\u00edna and Mercer Ventures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-6\">I see no appreciable difference between this inference and the one that followed in the next paragraph, <em>i.e., </em>the missing witness inference regarding Tra\u00edna.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">Dissent op. at 759-760.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">Contrary to this view, there is an appreciable difference between the drawing of a permissible adverse inference in the two situations. As McCormick\u2019s treatise recognizes,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfZ\">the cases fall into two groups. In the first, an adverse inference may be drawn against a party for failure to produce a witness reasonably assumed to be favorably disposed to the party. In the second, the inference may be drawn against a party who has exclusive control over a material witness but fails to produce him or her, without regard to any possible favorable disposition of the witness toward the party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">2 Kenneth S. Broun et al\u201e Mccormick on Evidence \u00a7 264 (6th ed.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">Documentary records regarding Bereano\u2019s activities on behalf of Mercer presumably were in Bereano\u2019s file cabinet in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>his office at .the time of the Commission\u2019s hearing. Bereano maintained exclusive control over those documents. Traina, however, was not under Bereano\u2019s lock and key. Prior to the evidentiary hearing before the Commission, Traina made himself available for an interview at the Commission\u2019s offices, responded to all document requests, and invited staff counsel to call him if further assistance was desired. It may not be contended reasonably that Traina was physically unavailable to staff counsel. <em>See United States v. Young, </em>468 F.2d 934, 943 n. 15 (D.C.Cir.1972) (noting that a witness is unavailable where one party has a \u201cbetter opportunity to ascertain his testimony in advance of taking the stand\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Traina was not peculiarly available to Bereano.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Before a missing witness inference may be drawn, it must be demonstrated that \u201cthe missing witness was peculiarly within the adversary\u2019s power to produce by showing either that the witness is physically available only to the opponent or that the witness has the type of relationship with the opposing party th\u00e1t pragmatically renders his testimony unavailable to the opposing party.\u201d <em>Chi. Coll, of Osteopathic Med. v. George A Fuller Co., </em>719 F.2d 1335, 1353 (7th Cir.1983). There is no contention, nor could there be, that Traina was not physically available to both parties. Therefore, the issue turns on whether Traina was demonstrated to have the type of relationship with Bereano that would render Traina unavailable to the Commission\u2019s staff counsel as a practical matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">The dissent finds that the professional and contractual relationship between Traina and Bereano made Traina unavailable to Commission staff counsel. Such appellate fact-finding is contrary to Maryland appellate jurisprudence in deciding whether the tribunal\u2019s action under review correctly applied the missing witness rule. \u201cA reviewing court may not make its own findings of fact or supply factual findings that were not made by the agency.\u201d <em>Md. Sec. Comm\u2019r v. U.S. Sec. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number><em>Corp., </em>122 Md.App. 574, 586, 716 A.2d 290, 296-97 (1998) (citations omitted). Fact-finding and argument about the propriety of applying the missing witness rule occurs in the first instance <em>before </em>the case is appealed. <em>See Patterson v. State, </em>356 Md. 677, 688, 741 A.2d 1119, 1124 (1999) (\u201cThe missing witness inference may arise in one of two contexts. A party may request that a trial judge instruct the jury on the operation and availability of the inference where all the elements of the rule are present. Additionally, a party may wish to call the jury\u2019s attention to this inference directly during closing arguments.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">The Commission made no finding that the relationship between Bereano and Tra\u00edna created a bias on the part of Tra\u00edna in favor of Bereano. The nature of the relationship between the two, or the possibility of application of the missing witness inference, were not argued by anyone before the Commission. The dissent finds in a record devoid of any hostility between Tra\u00edna and the staff counsel that Tra\u00edna was so biased against the staff counsel that he was unavailable as a practical matter. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1984, 2004 RepLVol.), State Government Article \u00a7 10-222(f)(l) (\u201cJudicial review of disputed issues of fact shall be confined to the record----\u201d). Yet, for a witness so slanted in favor of Bereano, Tra\u00edna cooperated freely with the staff counsel\u2019s requests leading up to the hearing. Had there been any discussion of this issue on the record in front of the Commission, perhaps the dissent would be justified in upholding such a finding. As the record stands before us, however, at no point before the Commission was there anything approaching an allegation that Tra\u00edna was unduly biased in favor of Bereano or that he could not be relied upon by staff counsel to give full and truthful testimony. <em>See United Steelworkers of Am.

White, </em>811 F.2d 1204, 1207 (8th Cir.1987). This is a difficult showing to make. <em>See Hayes v.

The mere possibility that a witness personally may favor one side over the other does not make that witness peculiarly unavailable to the other side. <em>See Woodland v. State, </em>62 Md.App. 503, 510, 490 A.2d 286, 290 (1985) (\u201cThe inference to be drawn from the failure to call a witness will arise only if the relationship between the defendant and the witness is one of interest or affection.\u201d); <em>United States v.

The dissent, however, constructs a finding which should have been made by, if anyone, the Commission.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The dissent improperly presumes that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>friendship and professional relationship between Tra\u00edna and Bereano made Tra\u00edna unavailable to the staff counsel, despite case law to the contrary. <em>See, e.g., Bing Fa Yuen v.

Credibility determinations are left to the finder of fact, in this case, the administrative agency. \u201cWe give great deference to the agency\u2019s assessment of the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d <em>Schwartz v. Md. Dep\u2019t of Natural Res., </em>385 Md. 534, 554, 870 A.2d 168, 180 (2005). The Commission was within its discretion to assign little or no credibility or weight to Bereano\u2019s testimony. What it may not do, however, is give Bereano\u2019s testimony so little credibility that it results in shifting the burden to Bereano. <em>See Fine v. Dep\u2019t of Transp., Bureau of Driver Licensing, </em>694 A.2d 364, 368 n. 9 (Pa.Commw.Ct.1997) (\u201cSuch an inference is inappropriate where the witness could have been called by the opposing party. Moreover, a negative inference is generally made against the party with the burden of proof ....\u201d (citations omitted)); <em>State v. Brewer, </em>505 A.2d 774, 777 (Me.1985) (\u201cThe inference may have the effect of requiring the defendant to produce evidence to rebut the inference. If he fails to do so, the missing-witness inference allows the state to create \u2018evidence\u2019 from the defendant\u2019s failure to produce evidence. Such a result is impermissible.\u201d). That is what happened in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">The Commission, within its discretion, gave little or no weight to Bereano\u2019s testimony about the language in the retainer letter concerning the \u201c1% of the first year receivables\u201d originating with Tra\u00edna. The Commission permissibly may treat the asserted facts at issue as if Bereano had never spoken them, giving them no weight. The Commission, in not so many words, found that Bereano was incredible (or, at best, was mistaken) when he testified regarding the source o f the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>language in the retainer letter. It then concluded that staff counsel satisfied its burden of persuasion on the related charge of a violation. That is not permissible under any interpretation of the rules of evidence, whether strictly or loosely applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">The finder of fact properly may assign no weight and no credibility to a particular witness\u2019s testimony. It may not assign, however, negative weight to the testimony, inferring that the opposite of that witness\u2019s statements is true, without the consideration of any other evidence. The Commission may not infer that the relevant language in the retainer letter was inserted by Bereano simply because Bereano testified that the language came from Tra\u00edna. The staff counsel does not meet its burden merely because Bereano\u2019s assertions regarding the source of the improper contract language are not considered credible. There is nothing in the record, other than the Commission\u2019s finding that Bereano was not credible, to contradict Bereano\u2019s assertion that the language in the contract originated with Tra\u00edna. <em>See Maszczenski v. Myers, </em>212 Md. 346, 355, 129 A.2d 109, 114 (1957) (\u201cAlthough an inference arises from the suppression of evidence by a litigant that this evidence would be unfavorable to his cause, ... it is well settled that this inference does not amount to substantive proof____\u201d (citations omitted)).

There is no such claim in this record by staff counsel before the Commission. In fact, the first claim that Traina was biased against the staff counsel surfaced during judicial review of the Commission\u2019s Final Decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">The dissent analogizes the present case to <em>Robinson v. State, </em>315 Md. 309, 554 A.2d 395 (1989). <em>Robinson, </em>however, is distinguishable. In <em>Robinson, </em>the defendant was found driving a stolen car. <em>Robinson, </em>315 Md. at 312, 554 A.2d at 396. He testified that he borrowed the car from \u201cAlvin,\u201d who, in turn, told the defendant that he borrowed the car from his cousin. <em>Robinson, </em>315 Md. at 313, 554 A.2d at 397. The defendant did not call Alvin to the stand to testify. The trial court gave a missing witness instruction requested by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>State, permitting the jury to infer that if Alvin were called to testify, he would have testified unfavorably to Robinson. <em>Robinson, </em>315 Md. at 314, 554 A.2d at 397. We affirmed Robinson\u2019s conviction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\"><em>Robinson </em>is distinguishable in three respects. First, unlike in the present case, the defendant in <em>Robinson </em>was given an opportunity to argue or explain the absence of the witness in an effort to forestall the announced intent to rely on the missing witness rule. <em>Id. </em>The defendant argued that he lived in a neighborhood where one was subject to bodily harm for identifying a criminal perpetrator. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, he claimed that Alvin had moved since the defendant had been in contact with him last. <em>Robinson, </em>315 Md. at 320, 554 A.2d at 400. In the present case, there was no meaningful discussion of Traina\u2019s absence until the missing witness inference was invoked in the Commission\u2019s written decision. Unlike in the present case, Alvin was not physically available to both parties in <em>Robinson. </em>Until he was on the witness stand and the trial judge signed an order charging him with contempt, the defendant in <em>Robinson </em>refused even to give Alvin\u2019s last name. <em>Robinson, </em>315 Md. at 314, 554 A.2d at 397. The prosecution had no opportunity to confirm the existence of Alvin, much less the opportunity to interview him. In the present case, Tra\u00edna voluntarily submitted documents and met with staff counsel. Finally, in <em>Robinson </em>we noted that it was common \u201cfor one found in exclusive possession of recently stolen property to fabricate a story involving another person as the provider of the property\u2014some person often said to be known only by a street name, who supposedly gave, sold, or loaned the property to the defendant under the most innocent of circumstances.\u201d <em>Robinson, </em>315 Md. at 317, 554 A.2d at 399. In those rather ordinary circumstances, we held that the missing witness inference was proper. Those entirely common circumstances cannot compare to the rather unique situation where an agent hired by a principal contends that prohibited contract language was originally drafted by the principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>D.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">The inference drawn by the Commission in its final decision is even more troubling considering the generally relaxed rules of evidence applicable in administrative hearings. \u201c[T]he rules of evidence are generally relaxed in administrative proceedings.\u201d <em>Travers v. Balt. Police Dept., </em>115 Md.App. 395, 408, 693 A.2d 378, 384 (1997) (citing <em>Dep\u2019t of Publ. Safety &amp; Corr. Servs. v. Cole, </em>342 Md. 12, 31, 672 A.2d 1115, 1125 (1996), and <em>Dickinson-Tidewater, Inc. v. Supervisor of Assessments, </em>273 Md. 245, 253, 329 A.2d 18, 24 (1974)); <em>see also </em>MD. CODE REGS. 19A.01.03. 10(a) (\u201cThe [Ethics Commission] hearing need not be conducted according to the technical rules of evidence, and any relevant evidence, including hearsay of probative value, is admissible\u201d). The rules of evidence are so relaxed that the Maryland Code states that \u201c[e]vidence may not be excluded solely on the basis that it is hearsay.\u201d \u00a7 10-213(c). In fact, an administrative agency\u2019s decision may be wholly supported by hearsay. <em>Md. Dep\u2019t of Human Res. v. Bo Peep Day Nursery, </em>317 Md. 573, 595, 565 A.2d 1015, 1026 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">Given the relaxed rules of evidence, Bereano reasonably could expect that his testimony stating what Tra\u00edna would say if called to testify would be sufficient, if believed. Bereano could testify as to what Tra\u00edna said the contract language meant, where the contract language originated, and what the relevant \u201clegislative\u201d expenses were. Although such testimony perhaps would not be admissible in a civil trial, the relaxed standards of evidence in administrative hearings permit such testimony. Because hearsay statements are admissible and may be relied upon in an administrative agency hearing, any additional evidence in support of those assertions would be cumulative.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">In the instant case, the dissent would condone the Commission faulting Bereano for not calling Tra\u00edna to corroborate his testimony; however, the missing witness \u201cinference is not drawn from the failure of a party to produce cumulative and corroborative evidence.\u201d <em>Jacobson v. Julian, </em>246 Md. 549, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>557, 229 A.2d 108, 114 (1967). To paraphrase an older case, \u201c[i]t frequently happens that a party to a suit does not deem it necessary to offer corroborative testimony, and in this case the [Commission] could have called [Tra\u00edna] if it so desired.\u201d <em>United Rys. &amp; Elec. Co. of Balt. City v. Cloman, </em>107 Md. 681, 695, 69 A. 379, 384 (1908); <em>see also De Gregorio v. United States, </em>7 F.2d 295, 296-97 (2d Cir.1925), <em>cited with approval in Critzer v. Shegogue, </em>236 Md. 411, 422, 204 A.2d 180, 186 (1964) (holding that no missing witness instruction was proper where the state called only one of two law enforcement officers to testify regarding the legality of the officers\u2019 entry, noting that a contrary holding \u201cwould require a party to call all eyewitnesses at the risk of having it presumed that those not called would contradict those who were. The rule has no such purpose; it rests on the notion that the suppression of more cogent evidence than that produced is some indication that it would be unfavorable. Between witnesses having equal opportunity for observation it has never been applied.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">The present case deviates from the typical missing witness inference in another important way. As noted above, the missing witness inference in a court proceeding takes the form either of an instruction to the jury permitting it to make such an inference, or in permitting the parties to argue the inference to the fact-finder. <em>See </em>Robert H. Stier, Jr., <em>Revisiting the Missing Witness Inference-Quieting the Loud Voice from the Empty Chair, </em>44 MD. L. REV. 137,166 (1985) (\u201cTrial courts are usually called upon to determine the propriety of the missing witness inference in two situations: when an opposing counsel objects to a reference made in a closing argument about an uncalled witness, and when counsel request jury instructions on the inference.\u201d). In either case, the desired inference is noticed in advance of a final decision, and both parties are permitted to argue regarding it. <em>See Lowry v. State, </em>363 Md. 357, 375, 768 A.2d 688, 697 (2001) (\u201c \u2018[T]he opposing side also has an opportunity to refute the argument and counter with reasons why the inference is inappropriate.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>(quoting <em>Davis v. State, </em>333 Md. 27, 52, 633 A.2d 867, 879-80 (1993))); <em>Thomas v.

Because of the limited justification for the rule and the chance of an erroneous inference being drawn, \u201ccourts often require early notice from a party expecting to make a missing witness argument or intending to request such an instruction.\u201d 2 KENNETH S. BROUN ET AL., MCCORMICKON EVIDENCE \u00a7 264 (6th ed.2006); see <em>also Gass v. United States, </em>416 F.2d 767, 775 (D.C.Cir.1969) (\u201c[W]hen counsel, either for the prosecution or the defense, intends to argue to the jury for an inference to be derived from the absence of a witness, an advance ruling from the trial court should be sought and obtained.\u201d); <em>People v.

Staff counsel avoided any possible damage to its case through Traina\u2019s live testimony by not calling him, yet received the unsolicited benefit of the missing witness inference that his testimony would have been contrary to Bereano\u2019s testimony. <em>See United States v. Erb, </em>543 F.2d 438, 445 (2d Cir.1976) (\u201cBut there is more than the usual aura of gamesmanship in the arguments to us on this issue. The defense had interviewed Sedgwick and presumably would have offered his testimony if it could have been helpful. For reasons of their own, defendants chose not to do so, thus avoiding any possible damaging effect from presenting Sedgwick as a witness while at the same time attempting to get the benefit of an inference from his absence.\u201d); <em>Burgess v. United States, </em>440 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>F.2d 226, 289 (D.C.Cir.1970) (Robb, J. concurring) (\u201cMy interpretation of the record is that the witness was available to the defendant but that the defendant\u2019s counsel deliberately chose not to seek him out. Counsel carefully refrained from urging strenuously that the witness be produced; his cry for help was so muted as to be almost inaudible. I think it is a fair inference that counsel did not want the witness but hoped to take advantage of a missing witness instruction, or a claim of error if the instruction was refused. Having deliberately rejected an opportunity to produce a witness a defendant should not be permitted to complain that the witness is missing.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">The dissent\u2019s analysis runs contrary to the modern trend of reducing reliance on the missing witness rule in other legal contexts. Although many courts that recently addressed the issue, including this Court in <em>Patterson, 356 </em>Md. 677, 741 A.2d 1119, sought to reduce the scope and application of the missing witness or missing evidence inference, the dissent exerts considerable effort to sustain the Commission\u2019s application of the inference in an administrative context.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Patterson, 356 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>Md. at 688, 741 A.2d at 1124-25 (\u201cWe now further refine the issue in the case sub judice by holding that, regardless of the evidence, a missing evidence instruction generally need not be given----\u201d); <em>Herbert v.

While many other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>jurisdictions are curtailing the use of the missing witness inference in civil and criminal trials, the dissent here would expand its scope in the less protected environment of an administrative hearing where the inference is relied on without warning to the charged party appearing before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">F.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">The dissent suggests that, even if the missing witness rule and the inference drawn were mis-applied, that excludable evidence did not play a significant role in the Commission\u2019s decision.

For example, has the Court in the opinion established a new rule of procedure requiring an advance ruling by the court before counsel for a party may argue to a jury that an inference, adverse to the opponent, might be drawn from the absence of a witness? <em>See </em>Opinion at 753-754.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-10\">Also of concern to me is the apparently flat rejection in Part I-F of the opinion of the availability of the harmless error doctrine in the judicial review of agency decisions. In my opinion, it is certainly unnecessary, and perhaps unwise, to undertake to use the decision in this case as the vehicle for announcing that any error by an agency in stating the reasons for its decision requires remand. For example, if, under the statute, the Commission need only prove that Bereano entered into a contract with Mercer, so that the mere execution of the fee agreement, containing a contingency feature, conferred power on the Commission to suspend a registration, it would seem to be legally immaterial whether Tra\u00edna was the initial author of the prohibited provision. Section 15\u2014405(e)(l)(i)l, however, requires, as a condition of suspension, that the violation be committed \u201cknowingly and willfully.\u201d Thus, in this case, I cannot say that the error is harmless. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>Commission may or may not have considered that an adverse inference from the absence of testimony from Tra\u00edna was necessary to its conclusion that the violation was knowing and willful. Thus, I join in the remand in order to have that aspect of the Commission\u2019s decision clarified.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">Dissenting Opinion by THIEME, J., which GETTY, J., joins.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">I dissent from Part II of the Court\u2019s opinion and the judgment. I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">Although what results from application of the missing witness rule is sometimes referred to as a \u201cpresumption,\u201d it is in actuality a recognition of a permissible inference. The factfinder is not required to make this inference. Nor am I aware of any action initially required to be taken to permit the application of this inference. In a jury trial, even in the absence of an instruction explaining the inference, the jury is not precluded from making it. <em>Yuen v. State, </em>43 Md.App. 109, 113-114, 403 A.2d 819, 823 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">This longstanding principle has been applied generally in civil cases of various sorts, including administrative matters. <em>Radin v. Supervisor of Assessments of Montgomery County, </em>254 Md. 294, 301, 255 A.2d 413, 416 (1969). In 1903, this Court held that where the defendants were the only living parties to an agreement, withholding evidence which was within their power to produce resulted in the inference that the evidence, if produced, would have been unfavorable. <em>Turner\u2019s Executor v. Turner, </em>98 Md. 22, 33, 55 A. 1023, 1027 (1903).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In the context of a criminal trial, we have stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACI\">The failure to call a material witness raises a presumption or inference that the testimony of such person would be unfavorable to the party failing to call him, but there is no such presumption or inference where the witness is not available, or where his testimony is unimportant or cumula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>tive, or where he is equally available to both sides. The presumption or inference that the testimony of a missing witness would be unfavorable is applied most frequently when there is a relationship between the party and the witness, such as a family relationship, an employer-employee relationship, and, sometimes, a professional relationship.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-4\"><em>Christensen v. State, </em>274 Md. 133, 134-35, 333 A.2d 45, 46 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Initially I note the Commission\u2019s complaint that Bereano has included in his brief arguments that were not made below, and, therefore, are unpreserved. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8131(a). (Except for jurisdictional issues, an issue neither raised nor decided below is ordinarily waived for appellate review purposes.) Even aside from these arguments, I detect a question of preservation in this issue. It is a well recognized principle that an objection to evidence will be deemed waived if like evidence is admitted elsewhere during trial without objection. <em>Clark v. State, </em>97 Md.App. 381, 394-95, 629 A.2d 1322, 1329 (1993); <em>see also S &amp; S Bldg. Corp. v. Fidelity Storage Corp., </em>270 Md. 184, 190, 310 A.2d 778 (1973) (\u201cany objection to its admissibility was waived by its subsequent admission without objection\u201d); <em>Spriggs v. Levitt &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>267 Md. 679, 683, 298 A.2d 442, 444 (1973) (failure to object to subsequent testimony waived earlier objection to admissibility of evidence). An analogous situation appears in the instant case. Prior to invoking the missing witness inference, the Commission referred to Bereano\u2019s inability to explain certain items billed to Mercer and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-6\">During the same time period, [Bereano] was submitting invoices to Mr. Tra\u00edna that included statements for \u201clegislative expenses\u201d and \u201clegislative expenses and meals.\u201d [Bereano testified that he kept detailed time records on all his activities on behalf of his clients.] <em>Yet [Bereano] did not produce records </em>at the hearing showing his activities on behalf of Mr. Tra\u00edna and Mercer Ventures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-7\">(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>I see no appreciable difference between this inference and the one that followed in the next paragraph, <em>i.e., </em>the missing witness inference regarding Tra\u00edna. In one situation, the evidence would have been documentary, while in the other, the evidence would have been testimonial. But in both situations, Bereano asked the Commission to believe there was evidence supporting his position, then did nothing to produce that evidence. The Commission was not required to take his bald assertions on faith. Because Bereano does not argue that the Commission was not entitled to draw an adverse inference from his failure to produce records, I am unable to conceive of a principled distinction between an adverse inference drawn from those records and one drawn from live testimony.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that this issue is before the Court, I turn to Bereano\u2019s substantive arguments. First, he argues that the missing witness inference \u201cshould not\u201d be applied at all in administrative hearings. He provides no reason for this contention, other than his belief that the application of the inference in his case was \u201cegregious.\u201d Even if we were to accept that it was, error in the application of a rule in a particular case affects only the parties to that case and is not grounds for general revocation of that rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">Next, Bereano argues that the inference was improperly applied because either party could have called Tra\u00edna as a witness at the hearing. Tra\u00edna had been interviewed prior to the hearing and there was uncontroverted evidence that he had cooperated and made himself available to investigators. However, there also was no evidence that Tra\u00edna was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>longer Bereano\u2019s client or that the two no longer had a special relationship in which Bereano advised Tra\u00edna about matters important to the success of his business. To the contrary, when <em>Maryland Pattern Jury Instructions, </em>MPJI-Cv 1:10 SPOLIATION (2007). asked if he had terminated his \u201cwritten relationship\u201d with Tra\u00edna after the press reported allegations of impropriety, Bereano replied that Tra\u00edna wrote \u201ca letter of clarification\u201d to which he \u201cexecuted agreement.\u201d He continued to serve as Mercer\u2019s resident agent and to represent Tra\u00edna and his wife in business matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">Bereano also argues that his right to due process of law was violated because the Commission did not give him advance notice of its intention to consider Traina\u2019s absence. This argument might be more persuasive if the missing witness inference were some arcane legal principle and not a common matter in trial practice. The existence of the missing witness inference has been known to the legal community through numerous published opinions. Bereano was ably represented by counsel capable of weighing the effects of strategic decisions about which evidence should be introduced and which evidence withheld. The Commission, as fact finder, is not obligated to signal to the parties the significance or weight it is giving particular evidence so that they can adjust their strategy as trial progresses. As a deciding authority, the Commission is not required to enumerate the inferences it intends to draw from the evidence, so long as the evidence was properly admitted and the inference is a permissible one. As we said in <em>Robinson v. State, </em>315 Md. 309, 318, 554 A.2d 395, 399 (1989):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-5\">There is nothing mysterious about the use of inferences in the fact-finding process. Jurors routinely apply their common sense, powers of logic, and accumulated experiences in life to arrive at conclusions from demonstrated sets of facts. Even had there been no instruction concerning the availability of this inference, we think it likely that among the first questions posed in the deliberation of this case would have been, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t the defendant produce [the missing witness]?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>Why is what is permitted to a jury as fact finder not permitted to an' administrative body acting in .that capacity? Bereano has given us no reason and I am aware of none.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">Nor has he explained why this particular inference, out of all of the inferences a factfinder is entitled to draw, should be singled out for special notice. Instead, he directs our attention to Maryland Code, State Government Article, \u00a7 15-404(b)(1), which states: \u201cAt the hearing, the staff counsel shall present to the Ethics Commission <em>all available evidence </em>relating to each alleged violation of this title;\u201d. (Emphasis added.) As explained above, I disagree that the record before us permits the conclusion that Tra\u00edna was available to the staff counsel. Moreover, \u00a7 15\u2014404(b)(1) relates to evidence and not to the inferences therefrom. Staff counsel can do no more than present evidence; inferences from that evidence must be made by the Commission as deciding authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">Contrary to Bereano\u2019s argument, this does not shift the burden of proof. Even in a criminal case, we have upheld the application of a missing witness inference where the defendant, found in possession of a stolen car, testified that he believed the car belonged to his cousin, but he did not call his cousin as a witness. <em>Robinson, </em>315 Md. at 313, 554 A.2d at 397. We reached this holding even while recognizing that the cousin would have had a motive to avoid self-incrimination by refusing to testify on the defendant\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">Finally, I note my disagreement with Bereano\u2019s view of the emphasis placed by the Commission upon Traina\u2019s absence. Bereano contends that the Commission relied upon the inference as a substitute for fact-finding on the basic elements of the charge against him, that this reliance tainted and prejudiced all of its findings and that the inference became \u201cthe foundation\u201d of its conclusions. My review of the Commission\u2019s decision suggests otherwise. Before even mentioning Traina\u2019s absence, the Commission reviewed the many contradictions in Bereano\u2019s testimony, comparing his account of his activities with the documents introduced into evidence. As noted above, the Commission considered the comparable absence of records <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>Bereano claimed to have, records which would have supported his version of the events in question. The absence of Tra\u00edna was but a passing reference at the end of a lengthy discussion of Bereano\u2019s lack of credibility and not the foundation of the Commission\u2019s legal conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">Judge GETTY authorizes me to state that he joins the reasoning in this dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b752-12\">. As portrayed by the late character actor Strother Martin.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b753-11\">. We shall refer to the deciding authority, the State Ethics Commission, as \u201cthe Commission,\u201d as distinguished from its counsel and staff involved in the investigation and hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b753-12\">. The original complaint concerned three of Bereano's clients. After hearing evidence, the Commission granted judgment in favor of Bereano with regard to two of those cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b756-9\">. No retired member of this Court or the Court of Special Appeals recalled to sit specially on the present case participated in any way in the Court of Special Appeals's consideration of or decision in this matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b770-9\">. Unless otherwise noted, all references to the Maryland Code in Part II of this opinion are to Maryland Code (1984, 2004 Repl.VoL), State Government Article.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b770-10\">. The Commission may take official notice of a fact not in the record, however, prior notice of its intent to do so and an opportunity to rebut must be given to all parties. \u00a7 10\u2014213(h)( 1); MD. CODE REGS. 19A.01.03.10(E)(4)(e). In the instant case, no prior notice was given to Bereano regarding the Commission\u2019s contemplation of the use of the missing witness rule and the inference it chose to draw.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b772-7\">. The Commission justified its use of the rule by noting that \"Mr. Traina was on [Bereano\u2019s] witness list submitted to the Commission.\u201d Traina was also on the Commission\u2019s witness list.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b774-7\">. Because there is no proper finding that the witness was unavailable to either party, the dissent presents no sound reason why the missing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>witness inference should not be applied against the staff counsel. Staff counsel interviewed and received all requested documents from Traina. Staff counsel knew what Traina\u2019s testimony would be if called. Had he testified, any deviation from his prior statements could have been used to impeach him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b783-6\">. We have cited with approval such a concern in our own jurisprudence. In <em>Christensen v. State, </em>274 Md. 133, 135 n. 1, 333 A.2d 45, 46 n. 1 (1975), we quoted with approval from the Supreme Court of New Jersey\u2019s opinion in <em>State v. Clawans, </em>38 N.J. 162, 183 A.2d 77, 81-82 (1962). In <em>Clawans, </em>the New Jersey court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-7\">Application of the above principles is particularly perplexing and difficult where a litigant requests a charge to that effect. Such request normally comes at the conclusion of the entire case without warning to the opposition. The allegedly defaulting party is not accorded an opportunity to justify or explain his failure to call the witness. It is conceivable that the factual situation involved in the litigation and the relationship of the parties to the witnesses, are such that the trial judge may properly reach a conclusion as to whether an inference could arise without the necessity of proof in explanation and therefore without prior warning of the intention to request a charge. The better practice, however, is for the party seeking to obtain a charge encompassing such an inference to advise the trial judge and counsel out of the presence of the jury, at the close of his opponent\u2019s case, of his intent to so request and demonstrating the names or classes of available persons not called and the reasons for the conclusion that they have superior knowledge of the facts. This would accord the party accused of nonproduction the opportunity of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>either calling the designated witness or demonstrating to the court by argument or proof the reason for the failure to call. Depending upon the particular circumstances thus disclosed, the trial court may determine that the failure to call the witness raises no inference, or an unfavorable one, and hence whether any reference in the summation or a charge is warranted.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b785-6\">. In this respect, judicial review of an administrative action differs from judicial review of a judgment from a trial court. In reviewing a judgment of a trial court, \"the appellate court will search the record for evidence to support the judgment and will sustain the judgment for a reason plainly appearing on the record whether or not the reason was expressly relied upon by the trial court.\u201d <em>United Steelworkers of Am.

If you find that the intent was to conceal the evidence, the destruction or failure to preserve must be inferred to indicate that the party believes that his or her case is weak and that he or she would not prevail if the evidence was preserved. If you find that the destruction or failure to preserve the evidence was negligent, you may, but are not required to, infer that the evidence, if preserved, would have been unfavorable to that party.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
