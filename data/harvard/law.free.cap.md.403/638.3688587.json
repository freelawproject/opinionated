We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-13\">During the 2003 through 2006 school years, Kylie, the victim,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was a student in a physical education class taught by Tribbitt at a Queen Anne\u2019s County public middle school. Over this time, Tribbitt and the victim grew \u201cclose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-14\">According to Kylie\u2019s testimony at trial, Tribbitt requested, in the Spring of 2005, that she show him her thong underwear by pulling up her shirt and pulling down her pants. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>complied.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In August 2005, at the beginning of her ninth grade year, Kylie joined the school volleyball team. Tribbitt was its coach. Over the course of the volleyball season, Tribbitt touched Kylie inappropriately on four or five occasions in the school\u2019s locker room. Kylie testified that he requested that she hug him and rub her thighs up against him. During this hug, she noticed Tribbitt\u2019s tumescence. Kylie also claimed that Tribbitt grabbed her \u201cbutt\u201d as they walked through the locker room.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">On one occasion, when Tribbitt\u2019s shoe was untied, he said to Kylie, \u201ccan you bend down there and tie it and while you\u2019re down there,\u201d and, winking at her, \u201cpretty much tugged on his penis....\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They then walked together into the equipment room. Kylie testified that, while in the equipment room, Tribbitt \u201crubbed [her] butt and inner thighs.\u201d Next, they walked into the girls\u2019 locker room where Tribbitt rubbed Kylie\u2019s vaginal area through her pants.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">In an encounter later during the volleyball season, Tribbitt grabbed Kylie and played with her thong. She described yet another incident where Tribbitt grabbed her and, with his hand, started \u201creally going down [her] pants and he got like half way down there ...,\u201d stopping just above her vagina.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">Following a bench trial on 17 November 2006 in the Circuit Court for Queen Anne\u2019s County, the trial judge made the following relevant findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-8\">[T]here are several things that, probably a lot more than these, that are not in dispute. There was no oral sex; there was no sexual intercourse; there was no digital penetration. In my mind, there was no child pornography. There clearly was somebody who was responsible and that was you, Mr. Tribbitt, in your role, not only as Kylie\u2019s teacher, coach, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>what you did was obviously, completely inappropriate, and we\u2019ll get to whether it was criminal momentarily.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-5\">With respect to the statute, 3-602, sexual abuse of a minor, ... there\u2019s no dispute that the supervisor here was Mr. Tribbitt. The issue is whether or not, in this case, that sexual abuse is exploitation of a minor and would include sexual offense in any degree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-6\">What is clear to me is that over this period of time, there were inappropriate acts that are criminal in nature, that involve sexual offenses which is improper touching. Clear to me, four or five occasions when in middle school, four or five occasions in high school, that there was contact, purposeful contact, where you felt Kylie\u2019s butt, not her hip; her vaginal area, rubbed against her. There\u2019s no question in my mind that all that occurred. So with respect to Count 1, I have absolutely no doubt that that involves sexual exploitation of Kylie by you, that that was for your own sexual gratification. So as to Count 1, child abuse of a minor, the verdict is guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">Tribbitt was sentenced to 25 years in prison, with all but 18 months suspended, and five years of supervised probation. The Court of Special Appeals, in Tribbitt\u2019s direct appeal, affirmed in an unreported opinion. We granted Tribbitt\u2019s petition for certiorari to consider a single question: \u201c[m]ay sexual contact that does not constitute a sexual offense in any degree or otherwise violate any provision of Maryland law nonetheless provide the basis for \u2018sexual abuse\u2019 within the meaning of Section 3-602 of the Criminal Law Article?\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-8\">III.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-9\">Maryland Rule 8-131 (c) directs:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-10\">When an action has been tried without a jury, the appellate court will review the case on both the law and the evidence. It will not set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous, and will give due regard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Thus, we refrain from engaging in de novo fact-finding and accept the trial court\u2019s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>Glover v. State, </em>368 Md. 211, 221-22, 792 A.2d 1160,1165-66 (2002). When we review a trial court\u2019s determinations of legal questions or conclusions of law based on those findings of fact, however, the clearly erroneous standard does not apply. <em>Heat &amp; Power Corp. v. Air Prods. &amp; Chem. Inc., </em>320 Md. 584, 591, 578 A.2d 1202, 1205 (1990). Instead, we review de novo the trial court\u2019s \u201crelation of those facts to the applicable law.\u201d <em>Storetrax.com, Inc. v. Gurland, </em>397 Md. 37, 50, 915 A.2d 991, 998 (2007); <em>see also Schisler v. State, </em>394 Md. 519, 535, 907 A.2d 175, 184 (2006) (noting that when an issue \u201cinvolves an interpretation and application of Maryland constitutional, statutory or case law, our Court must determine whether the trial court\u2019s conclusions are \u2018legally correct\u2019 under a de novo standard of review\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">Tribbitt does not challenge the facts as found by the trial court. Rather, Tribbitt contends that Maryland Code (2002, 2007 Cum. Supp.), Criminal Law Article \u00a7 3-602<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> does not criminalize the acts that the trial court found that he committed on Kylie. Section 3-602 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-8\">Sexual abuse of a minor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-9\">(a) Definitions.\u2014(1) In this section the following words have the meanings indicated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-10\">(2) \u201cFamily member\u201d has the meaning stated in \u00a7 3-601 of this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-11\">(3) \u201cHousehold member\u201d has the meaning stated in \u00a7 3-601 of this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>(4)(i) \u201cSexual abuse\u201d means an act that involves sexual molestation or exploitation of a minor, whether physical injuries are sustained or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-5\">(ii) \u201cSexual abuse\u201d includes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-6\">1. incest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-7\">2. rape;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-8\">3. sexual offense in any degree;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-9\">4. sodomy; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-10\">5. unnatural or perverted sexual practices.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-11\">(b) Prohibited.\u2014(1) A parent or other person who has permanent or temporary care or custody or responsibility for the supervision of a minor may not cause sexual abuse to the minor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-12\">(2) A household member or family member may not cause sexual abuse to a minor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-13\">(c) Penalty.\u2014A person who violates this section is guilty of a felony and on conviction is subject to imprisonment not exceeding 25 years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-14\">(d) Sentencing.\u2014A sentence imposed under this section may be separate from and consecutive to or concurrent with a sentence for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-15\">(1) any crime based on the act establishing the violation of this section; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-16\">a(2) violation of \u00a7 3-601 of this subtitle involving an act of abuse separate from sexual abuse under this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-17\">Tribbitt\u2019s main focus is on the interpretation of \u00a7 3-602(a)(4). He argues that \u00a7 3-602(a)(4), which defines sexual abuse, requires that, in order to be convicted of a violation of the statute, a defendant\u2019s particular acts as found by the trial court must be \u201cotherwise criminal\u201d in nature. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-18\">The fundamental rules of statutory interpretation are well-settled. \u201c \u2018The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature. Statutory construction begins with the plain language of the statute, and ordinary, popular understanding of the English <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>language dictates interpretation of its terminology.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bowen v. City of Annapolis, </em>402 Md. 587, 613, 937 A.2d 242, 257 (2007) (quoting <em>Kushell v. Dep\u2019t of Natural Res., </em>385 Md. 563, 576-78, 870 A.2d 186, 193-94 (2005)). \u201cWhen construing a statute, we recognize that it \u2018should be read so that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered superfluous or nugatory.\u2019 \u201d <em>Collins v. State, </em>383 Md. 684, 691, 861 A.2d 727, 732 (2004) (quoting <em>James v. Butler, </em>378 Md. 683, 696, 838 A.2d 1180, 1187 (2003)). We will \u201cneither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain and unambiguous language of the statute____\u201d <em>Price v. State, </em>378 Md. 378, 387, 835 A.2d 1221, 1226 (2003). If the plain language of the statute is unambiguous, \u201cthe inquiry as to legislative intent ends; we do not then need to resort to the various, and sometimes inconsistent, external rules of construction, for \u2018the- Legislature is presumed to have meant what it said and said what it meant.\u2019 \u201d <em>The Arundel Corp. v. Marie, </em>383 Md. 489, 502, 860 A.2d 886, 894 (2004) (quoting <em>Toler v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>373 Md. 214, 220, 817 A.2d 229, 233 (2003)). \u201cIf, however, the meaning of the plain language is ambiguous or unclear, we seek to discern legislative intent from surrounding circumstances, such as legislative history, prior case law, and the purposes upon which the statutory framework was based.\u201d <em>Lewis v. State, </em>348 Md. 648, 653, 705 A.2d 1128, 1131 (1998) (citing <em>Haupt v. State, </em>340 Md. 462, 471, 667 A.2d 179, 183 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">\u201cIt is a fundamental principle of statutory construction that criminal statutes are to be construed narrowly so that courts will not extend the punishment to cases not plainly within the language used.\u201d <em>Farris v. State, </em>351 Md. 24, 36, 716 A.2d 237, 243 (1998), <em>superceded by statute on other grounds as stated in Boffen v. State, </em>372 Md. 724, 816 A.2d 88 (2003) (internal quotation omitted). \u201cThe rule of lenity, however, is a maxim of statutory construction which serves only as an aid for resolving an ambiguity and it may not be used to create an ambiguity where none exists.\u201d <em>Jones v. State, </em>336 Md. 255, 261, 647 A.2d 1204,1207 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>Tribbitt argues that the plain language of the statute requires that, in order to come within the statutory definition of sexual abuse, his actions must be otherwise criminal. Tribbitt notes that the list of acts that are \u201cincluded\u201d in the definition of sexual abuses in \u00a7 3-602(a)(4)(ii) all are prohibited otherwise by law. Therefore, Tribbitt contends, the Legislature intended that the definition of sexual abuse embraces only acts otherwise prohibited by law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> To conclude otherwise, he continues, would render \u00a7 3-602(a)(4)(ii) superfluous. Tribbitt is incorrect in his reading of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">The key to proper analysis of this argument rests primarily on <em>Hackley v. State, </em>389 Md. 387, 885 A.2d 816 (2005), and its discussion of the statutory meaning of the words \u201cincluding\u201d and \u201cmeans.\u201d 389 Md. at 392-93, 885 A.2d at 819. In <em>Hackley, </em>we addressed the construction of a criminal statute that stated \u201c\u2018[s]talking\u2019 means a malicious course of conduct that includes approaching or pursuing another person____\u201d Maryland Code (1957,1996 RepLVol., 2001 Cum.Supp.), Article 27, \u00a7 124(a)(3); <em>Hackley, </em>389 Md. at 392, 885 A.2d at 819.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We held that the words following \u201cincludes\u201d did not make \u201capproaching or pursuing\u201d necessary elements of the offense. We noted, as does Tribbitt in his brief here, that when statutory drafters use the term \u201cmeans,\u201d they intend the definition to be exhaustive. <em>Hackley, </em>389 Md. at 393, 885 A.2d at 819. By contrast, when the drafters use the term \u201cin-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>eludes,\u201d it is generally intended to be used as \u201cillustration and not ... limitation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation omitted); <em>see also </em>Maryland Code (1957, 2005 Repl.Vol.), Article 1, \u00a7 30 (\u201cThe words \u2018includes\u2019 or \u2018including\u2019 mean, unless the context requires otherwise, includes or including by way of illustration and not by way of limitation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Tribbitt argues for the exact opposite interpretation of \u00a7 3-602(a)(4). He contends that the items following the term \u201cincludes\u201d limit the definition of sexual abuse to the enumerated or otherwise criminal acts, instead of being merely illustrative. As in <em>Hockley, </em>however, the term \u201cmeans\u201d is exhaustive. The words following \u201cmeans\u201d form the broad definition of \u201csexual abuse.\u201d Therefore, \u201csexual abuse\u201d is defined by the Legislature as \u201can act that involves sexual molestation or exploitation of a minor, whether physical injuries are sustained or not.\u201d The list in \u00a7 3-602(a)(4)(ii) merely provides examples of acts that come within that definition. <em>See United States. v. Gertz, </em>249 F.2d 662, 666 (9th Cir.1957) (\u201cThe likelihood that \u2018includes\u2019 is used in this sense in \u00a7 11 is fortified by the fact that in one of the definitions set out in chapter 1 of title 18(\u00a7 9) U.S.C.A., \u2018means\u2019 is used instead of \u2018includes,\u2019 and in another such section (\u00a7 6) both \u2018means\u2019 and \u2018includes\u2019 are used. It would therefore appear that in chapter 1, \u2018means\u2019 is used when the term and its definition are to be interchangeable equivalents, and \u2018includes\u2019 is used when it is desired to eliminate any doubt as to the inclusion in a larger class of the particular class specifically mentioned.\u201d); <em>Fed. Land Bank of St. Paul v. Bismarck Lumber Co., </em>314 U.S. 95, 100, 62 S.Ct. 1, 4, 86 L.Ed. 65 (1941) (noting that generally \u201cthe term \u2018including\u2019 is not one of all-embracing definition, but connotes simply an illustrative application of the general principle\u201d); <em>Helvering v. Morgan\u2019s, Inc., </em>293 U.S. 121, 126 n. 1, 55 S.Ct. 60, 62 n. 1, 79 L.Ed. 232 (1934) (\u201cThat the draftsman used these words in a different sense seems clear. The natural distinction would be that where \u2018means\u2019 is employed, the term and its definition are to be interchangeable equivalents, and that the verb \u2018includes\u2019 imports a general class, some of whose particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>instances are those specified in the definition.\u201d); <em>Guar. Trust Co. of N.Y. v. W. Va. Tpk. Comm\u2019n, </em>109 F.Supp. 286, 296 (S.D.W.Va.1952) (\u201cClearly, by use of the word \u2018including\u2019 the lawmakers intended merely to list examples of known safety devices, but not to exclude others equally well known.\u201d); <em>Lyman v. Town of Bow Mar, </em>188 Colo. 216, 533 P.2d 1129, 1133 (1975) (\u201cFurther, the word \u2018include\u2019 is ordinarily used as a word of extension or enlargement, and we find that it was so used in this definition. To hold otherwise here would transmogrify the word \u2018include\u2019 into the word \u2018mean.\u2019 \u201d); Norman J. Singer &amp; J.D. Shambie Singer, 2A Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 47:7 (7th ed. 2007) (\u201cA term whose statutory definition declares what it \u2018includes\u2019 is more susceptible to extension of meaning by construction than where the definition declares what a term \u2018means.\u2019 ... A definition which declares what a term \u2018means,\u2019 excludes any meaning that is not stated.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Tribbitt\u2019s interpretation of the statute would render much of \u00a7 3-602(a)(4) nugatory. To limit the definition of \u201csexual abuse\u201d to otherwise criminal acts would ignore the Legislature\u2019s statement that \u201c \u2018[s]exual abuse\u2019 means an act that involves sexual molestation or exploitation of a minor____\u201d \u00a7 3-602(a)(4)(i). Tribbitt essentially would re-draft the statute to state that \u201c \u2018sexual abuse\u2019 means <em>an otherwise criminal act </em>that involves sexual molestation or exploitation of a minor.\u201d The plain language of the statute clearly contemplates that all acts of sexual molestation and exploitation fall within the definition of sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">The textual history, although unnecessary to consider because the plain language of the statute is unambiguous, is particularly damaging to Tribbitt\u2019s argument and confirms our view of the plain meaning. Prior to the re-codification of the Criminal Law Article, the prohibition against sexual abuse of a child was found at Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2001 Cum.Supp.), Article 27, \u00a7 35C(a)(6)(i). Sexual abuse was defined as <em>\u201cany </em>act that involves sexual molestation or exploita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>tion of a child by a parent or other person who has permanent or temporary care or custody or responsibility for supervision of a child, or by any household or family member.\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cAny\u201d act may not be read to be restricted to only acts made criminal elsewhere. The Special Revisor\u2019s Note to the 2002 recodification states that the recodification was \u201cderived without substantive change\u201d from the previous version. Therefore, the proper construction of the statute is that \u201csexual abuse\u201d still encompasses \u201cany\u201d act that involves sexual molestation or exploitation of a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Tribbitt\u2019s argument also is contrary to our precedent. We have noted before that the definition of \u201csexual abuse\u201d is not limited to the crimes enumerated by \u00a7 3-602(a)(4)(ii). <em>See Cooksey v. State, </em>359 Md. 1, 24, 752 A.2d 606, 618 (2000) (stating that \u201ca charge of sexual child abuse may be sustained on evidence that would not support a conviction under the sexual offense, rape, sodomy, or perverted practice laws\u201d) (citing <em>Nightingale v. State, </em>312 Md. 699, 708, 542 A.2d 373, 377 (1988), <em>superceded by statute discussed </em>infra). Dicta in <em>Cooksey </em>seems particularly apt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-6\">With respect to Count 4, the State alleged conduct ranging from the fondling of the victim\u2019s breasts to simply rubbing against her. A jury could certainly find a single incident of some of that conduct to constitute abuse under [the sexual abuse statute], but it might well require more than one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>incident of other conduct in order to find the requisite \u201csexual molestation or exploitation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-5\"><em>Cooksey, </em>359 Md. at 24, 752 A.2d at 618.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-6\">Whether the touching of a person\u2019s \u2018buttocks\u2019 would suffice as sexual contact [and therefore make the sexual abuse also a third or fourth degree sexual offense] is not clear. It might, however, depending on the circumstances, constitute sexual molestation or exploitation, even if it did not constitute sexual contact [and be otherwise criminal].

His interpretation of the statute in this manner is flawed. Had the Legislature intended such a limitation, the Legislature would have permitted consecutive sentences for \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>crime based on the act establishing the violation of this section.\u201d In fact, \u00a7 3-602(d)(l) provides further evidence that the Legislature did not intend to limit the definition of \u201csexual abuse\u201d to otherwise criminal conduct. Section 3-602(d)(l) notes that an \u201cact,\u201d not a \u201ccrime,\u201d may establish the basis for violation of the child sex abuse statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Although it is unnecessary for the disposition of this case to consider legislative history because the plain language of the statute is unambiguous, we note that Tribbitt ignores the legislative history of subsection (d). Section 3-602, in its current form, was created by Chapter 273 of the Acts of 2002.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Prior to that enactment, child sexual abuse was prohibited by the statute criminalizing child abuse generally.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In addressing the general child abuse statute, in <em>Nightingale, </em>312 Md. 699, 542 A.2d 373, we held that a conviction for second degree sexual offense was a lesser included offense of the sexual abuse portion of the child abuse statute. In so doing, we vacated the portion of the defendant\u2019s sentence imposed under the sexual offense statute. The Legislature responded by passing Chapter 604 of the Acts of 1990 for the \u201cexpress purpose of overruling the holding[ ] in <em>Nightingale.\u201d Fisher v. State, </em>367 Md. 218, 242, 786 A.2d 706, 720 (2001); <em>see also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>the Preamble to Chapter 604 of the Acts of 1990 (\u201cAn ACT ... FOR the purposes of reversing the holdings of the Maryland Court of Appeals in the cases of <em>Nightingale v. State, </em>312 Md. 699, 542 A.2d 373 (1988) and <em>White v. State </em>[318 Md. 740, 569 A.2d 1271 (1990) ], by providing that if a conviction is entered against an individual for murder, rape, sexual offense, any sex crime, or any crime of physical violence, and a conviction is also entered for child abuse, a court may impose sentence for the other offenses separate from and consecutive to or concurrent with a sentence imposed for child abuse.\u201d). The language added to the general child abuse statute was carried over to the child sexual abuse statute when the two were separated. Subsection (d) remains in substantively identical form to the language enacted in response to our holding in <em>Nightingale. </em>Accordingly, there is nothing in the plain language or legislative history that would indicate that subsection (d) should be accorded the meaning desired by Tribbitt.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Although apparently not considered by either party here, there is precedent from this Court interpreting a statute where both \u201cmeans\u201d and \u201cincludes\u201d were used in expressing a definition. In <em>City of Baltimore Development Corp. v. Carmel Realty Associates, </em>395 Md. 299, 322-323, 910 A.2d 406, 419-20 (2006) <em>(Carmel </em>Realty), we interpreted a statute structured identically to the one at issue in the present case. The issue there was whether the Baltimore Development Corporation (BDC) was a \u201cpublic body,\u201d and thus subject to the State Open Meetings Act. The definition of a \u201cpublic body\u201d expressed in the Act was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-6\">(h)(1) \u201cPublic body\u201d means an entity that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-7\">(i) consists of at least 2 individuals; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-8\">(ii) is created by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-9\">1. the Maryland Constitution;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-10\">2. a State statute;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-11\">3. a county charter;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-12\">4. an ordinance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-13\">5. a rule, resolution, or bylaw;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>6. an executive order of the Governor; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-5\">7. an executive order of the chief executive authority of a political subdivision of the State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">(2) \u201cPublic body\u201d includes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-7\">(i) any multimember board, commission, or committee appointed by the Governor or the chief executive authority of a political subdivision of the State, or appointed by an official who is subject to the policy direction of the Governor or chief executive authority of the political subdivision, if the entity includes in its membership at least 2 individuals not employed by the State or the political subdivision; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-8\">(ii) The Maryland School for the Blind.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">Maryland Code (1984, 2004 Repl.Vol.), State Government, \u00a7 10-502.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-10\">The BDC argued that it was not a public body because it did not meet the definition in \u00a7 10-502(h)(l). It, however, appeared to meet the definition in \u00a7 10-502(h)(2)(i). The BDC contended that \u00a7 10-502(h)(2)(i) was only intended to provide illustrative examples of the types of public bodies defined in \u00a7 10-502(h)(l). We disagreed. We held that the two portions of the statutes presented independent, alternative approaches to the definition of a public body because \u201c[\u00a7 ] 10-502(h)(2) introduces a new concept and is not a subsidiary section to \u00a7 10-502(h)(l).\u201d <em>Carmel Realty, </em>395 Md. at 322-23, 910 A.2d at 419-20.

In 2006, the General Assembly amended \u00a7 3-808 to prohibit consensual sexual contact between a person of authority and a student enrolled where the perpetrator is employed. Tribbitt argues that this indicates that, prior to the effective date of the amendments to \u00a7 3-308,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> his conduct was not prohibited by law. Agreeing with the State, Tribbitt acknowledges that the amendments to \u00a7 3-308 were in response to our opinion in <em>Anderson v. State, </em>372 Md. 285, 812 A.2d 1016 (2002). <em>See </em>Statement of Stephen Salvas, Detective/Sergeant, Charles County Sheriffs Office, before the House Judiciary Committee in favor of House Bill 353 (1 March 2006) (describing the need for amendments to \u00a7 3-308 in light of Anderson).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">In <em>Anderson, </em>we affirmed the sexual abuse conviction of a high school teacher who had sexual intercourse with a 14 year-old student enrolled at the school at which the defendant was employed. The issue was whether the defendant was a person with \u201cresponsibility for supervision of a child\u201d within the meaning of the sexual abuse statute. We noted that the conviction was proper, despite the fact that the sexual act occurred outside school property and that the student was not taught actually by the defendant, because there was no \u201ctemporal break\u201d in the teacher\u2019s supervision of the student. <em>Anderson, </em>372 Md. at 294-96, 812 A.2d at 1022-23. Had there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>been such a \u201ctemporal break,\u201d our holding in <em>Anderson </em>would have been different.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Legislature saw fit to conform the statute expressly to the Majority interpretation in <em>Anderson, </em>amending \u00a7 3-308 to prohibit sexual contact between a school employee and student where, at the time of the sexual contact, the employee is employed by the school attended by the student. As a result of the 2006 amendments, any \u201ctemporal break\u201d in the supervisory responsibilities of the school employee prospectively became irrelevant.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The 2006 amendments were not intended to require other criminal conduct in order to be convicted of sexual abuse under \u00a7 3-306. No such amendments were necessary, as the plain language of \u00a7 3-602 prohibits acts involving \u201csexual molestation or exploitation of a minor\u201d by an adult responsible for the minor\u2019s supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">Tribbitt\u2019s final argument rests on the <em>ejusdem generis </em>doctrine of statutory interpretation. \u201c[W]here the general words in a statute ... follow the designation of particular things or classes of subjects, ... the general words in the statute will usually be construed to include only those things of the same class or general nature as those specifically antecedently mentioned.\u201d <em>State v.

Furthermore, given general legislative policy and the purpose of the child abuse statute to protect minors from abuse, we find it difficult to believe the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>General Assembly chose to limit the forms of sexual abuse punishable to only those listed in [the sexual abuse statute]. Therefore, exercising <em>ejusdem generis </em>in this context would limit the meaning of sexual abuse and subvert its obvious purpose, (internal quotation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">We again decline to apply <em>ejusdem generis </em>to find the forced and unnatural interpretation of the statute urged by Tribbitt.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b671-15\">.
