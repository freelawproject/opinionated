We shall hold that the trial court abused its discretion in denying petitioner the opportunity to cross-examine the child-witness after the video-tape had been admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-14\">Robert Lee Myer, petitioner, was indicted in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County for sexual abuse of a minor and various other sexual offenses. He waived his right to a jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>and proceeded to trial before the court. He was convicted of the offenses of sexual abuse of a minor, third degree sexual offense, fourth degree sexual offense and second degree assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">Petitioner\u2019s convictions stem from events that occurred on or about November 19 and 20th, 2004. H.C., then three years old, was staying with petitioner and his wife, Ethel Myer, at their house overnight on November 19th. When H.C.\u2019s mother, Kelly C., picked her up the next morning, H.C. told her that Petitioner had been \u201cbad\u201d and indicated that he had touched her vagina. Kelly C., along with her husband David C., took H.C. to the police station in Cockeysville. Two days later, a licensed social worker at the Child Advocacy Center, Nelwyn Henry, interviewed H.C. The interview was videotaped. Petitioner was indicted by the Grand Jury for Baltimore County, and proceeded to trial in the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Petitioner filed an \u201comnibus motion,\u201d raising, <em>inter alia, </em>the competency of the child. At the hearing on the motion, he argued that H.C., a child of four years and nine months of age, was not a competent witness. He raised concerns as to her ability to recollect, her ability to differentiate between the truth and a lie, and impermissible coaching. As to the admissibility of a videotape made during the social worker\u2019s interview of the young child, counsel explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-6\">\u201cWe also believe that as part of the competency proceeding, it is important for the Court to weigh what the child says today as opposed to what she was saying a year ago in that tape and how she was saying it. And, so, we\u2019ve asked the Court to review the tape for that limited ground, but we reserve the right to object to it if the State tries to bring [it] in as substantive evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">The Court found H.C. competent to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">From the outset, petitioner objected strenuously to the admissibility of the videotape. Before the trial commenced, petitioner told the court that he objected to the tape. He stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>\u201cYour Honor, there is the argument regarding the tape. But [I\u2019d] like to reserve on that. I want to see what the State\u2019s going to do. For all I know, they may or may not admit it, so I\u2014we\u2019ll just wait. I\u2019d be pleased to wait for that to get things going.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">Petitioner moved <em>in limine </em>to exclude the testimony of the social worker as well as the videotape of the social worker\u2019s interview of H.C. His objection was twofold: that it was unreliable, and that it violated his constitutional right of confrontation. He maintained that the interview and the tape were hearsay, that the evidence was testimonial in nature, and it was therefore inadmissible based upon <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), and <em>Lawson v. State, </em>389 Md. 570, 886 A.2d 876 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">The State\u2019s position was that the social worker would be called only to lay the evidentiary foundation for the tape\u2019s admission, that the tape was not testimonial evidence and therefore it was admissible evidence. The trial court reserved ruling as to the admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">H.C. testified as the State\u2019s first witness. She testified that she was on the bed with Myer while her Aunt Ethel was taking a shower. She testified that Myer touched his fingers to his lips and then to her vaginal area, on the inside of her underwear. After the State concluded its direct examination, defense counsel declined to cross-examine H.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">The court heard testimony from several other witnesses, including H.C.\u2019s parents, Ethel Myer, expert witnesses interpreting forensic evidence recovered from H.C.\u2019s underwear, and Ms. Henry, the social worker. Defense counsel maintained that the social worker should not be permitted to testify at all, and objected. Ms. Henry testified about the interview she conducted with H.C., explaining to the court the protocol she uses when she conducts a \u201cforensic interview\u201d with a child to determine whether abuse has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">On cross-examination, defense counsel elicited the facts as to how the police became involved in the case and their involvement in the interview with H.C. The interview room contained a camera to videotape the interview and the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>could watch the interview from an adjoining room. There was a phone in the room and Ms. Henry structured the interview so there would be an opportunity at the end of the interview for a police observer to call with any questions he would like to ask the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The State waited until the end of its case-in-chief to formally offer the video-tape into evidence. Defense counsel objected again to the tape\u2019s admissibility on constitutional grounds and lack of reliability and particularized guarantees of trustworthiness. The following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-6\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: ... Also, if the Court decides it wanted to admit the tape for those substantive reasons, I would like to reserve the right to at least\u2014I\u2019m going to consider cross-examining [H.C.] on portion of the tape, if it comes in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, it would have been better, even if it were beyond the scope of the State\u2019s direct, to question the child about whatever matters needed to be addressed while she was here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-8\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, you know, Your Honor, I made a tactical decision, along with my client, based on what [H.C.] had to say and what I felt was best for this case for him not to cross-examine based on her testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: Hmm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-10\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Now, introducing some other testimony, or at least you\u2019re being requested to put in some other testimony of [H.C.], and, and I think I have the right to cross-examine her on that. However, it may very well be that the State and I can stipulate to what are really, I think, only two to three points in that tape that I would ask [H.C.] about. I, I am not and I do not want to inconvenience that child or have her get on the stand again, if I can help it....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">The court reserved ruling on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-12\">The next day, petitioner called Michael Spodak, M.D.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as an expert in the field of forensic psychiatry to testify that, in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>opinion, because the methods used in conducting the interview were suggestive, the interview was unreliable. Defense counsel again objected to the admissibility of the tape, based on lack of genuineness and trustworthiness, and <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177. Without conceding the tape\u2019s admissibility, counsel reiterated to the court that if the tape was received into evidence, counsel wanted to cross-examine the child. Counsel argued to the court as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-5\">\u201cBy the way, I think from my argument yesterday, I think the Court already understands that I disagree with the State when they said in their argument, I\u2019ve already had my chance to cross-examine [H.C.]. I certainly had my chance to cross-examine [H.C.] based on her testimony. I\u2019ve never had a chance to cross-examine [H.C.] with the information that\u2019s on this tape that has not been in evidence and is only now decided by the court, whether or not to admit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">The State argued that the tape possessed particularized guarantee of trustworthiness and that it was admissible pursuant to \u00a7 11-304 of the Criminal Procedure Article, Md.Code (2001, 2006 Cum.Supp.).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">The court ruled that the videotape had particularized guarantees of trustworthiness pursuant to \u00a7 ll-304(e) and was admissible, concluding as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>\u201cI\u2019ve considered all of the factors under Criminal Procedure Section 11-304; I\u2019ve considered the testimony, also, of Dr. Spodak and the arguments of respective Counsel, and I\u2019m satisfied that the statement given by [H.C.] to Miss Henry does have the particularized guarantees of trustworthiness. It was given to Miss Henry as she was acting in the course of her profession as a licensed clinical social worker, interviewing the child and, therefore, I do find that the tape should be admitted into evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Following a stipulation by the parties as to the testimony of an unavailable police officer, the State rested.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Petitioner renewed his request to recall H.C. for cross-examination. The following discussion took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgP\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, there\u2019s still the question about, with respect to the tape, the cross-examination of [H.C.].\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: [H.C.] was here, and there was an opportunity to cross-examine her on competency and then as to the merits of the case. That would have been the time to question her regarding the tape. I don\u2019t know what questions you would have asked her with respect to the tape. The interview took place back in November of 2004.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AF2\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, Your Honor, I can certainly make a proffer to you. But I, I\u2019ve already made the argument yesterday. I\u2019ll make\u2014excuse me\u2014Friday, I\u2019ll make it again.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-8\">\u201cAt the time the client pros- to cross-examine [H.C.] was based on the testimony that she had given. The tape was not into evidence at that time. Tape is in evidence now. And I believe the confrontation clause argument gives me the right to cross-examine her on the contents of the tape which, in some cases, is different than what she testified to on the stand. It\u2019s not identical. And I\u2019ve already made the Court aware of some of the areas, you know, with respect to Aunt Ethel being in the bed which is, I would suggest to the Court, a huge difference in, with respect to what she\u2019s testified to. And it goes to her credibility. Not whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>she\u2019s lying or not, but whether she has memory of the incident and how she\u2019s reporting it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-4\">\u201cAnd, so, there, there are things that are said on the tape that aren\u2019t said during testimony before you, and those are the things that I would ask her about. And, so, I ask for permission to do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, you have trial strategy, and it may be a decision to ask the witness about a prior inconsistent statement, or it may be a decision to simply point out the differences between testimony here at trial and statement given at the time that she spoke with Miss Henry back in November of 2004. But there was certainly an opportunity to conduct cross-examination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">The State opposed recalling H.C. for further cross-examination, arguing that the State had given the defense notice of intent to use the statement pursuant to \u00a7 ll-304(d)(3).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defense counsel pointed out that \u201cthings that are said in that tape, once again, that aren\u2019t said in [H.C.\u2019s] direct.' If there weren\u2019t those differences, I think that the State would have a good point.\u201d The court did not permit H.C. to be recalled for cross-examination, stating: \u201cI don\u2019t see the reason for that in light of the opportunity for cross-examination that\u2019s already been given.\u201d The court found petitioner guilty and sentenced him to a term of incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">Petitioner noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. Before that court, petitioner argued that the trial court violated his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation, based on <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177. He further argued that his rights to cross-examination and due process were violated when he was not allowed to recall H.C. for cross-examination after the tape was admitted. The Court of Special Appeals agreed with Myers that the recorded statement was \u201ctestimonial\u201d in nature as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>that term has been used by the Supreme Court in <em>Crawford v. Washington </em>but found that the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment was not offended. In an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals held that even though the statements made on the videotape were testimonial in nature, the Confrontation Clause was not offended because Myer had the opportunity to cross-examine H.C. before the tape was admitted. The intermediate appellate court reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-5\">\u201cIn the case at bar, because the State complied with its obligation to disclose the existence of the victim\u2019s recorded statement, it is of no consequence that appellants\u2019s trial counsel made a strategic decision to forego cross-examination of the victim. Because the victim actually testified during the State\u2019s case-in-chief, she was \u2018subject to cross-examination concerning the [recorded] statement.\u2019 The Confrontation Clause, which provides criminal defendants with the opportunity to cross-examine prosecution witnesses, does not require that a witness be \u2018recalled\u2019 as an essential condition precedent to the introduction of that witness\u2019s otherwise admissible prior statement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">We granted certiorari to answer the following question:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"ApL\">\u201cDid the trial court violate Petitioner\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights under <em>Crawford v. Washington </em>and his fundamental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>right to cross-examine witnesses against him when it allowed the State to introduce taped testimonial hearsay at the close of its case and refused to permit defense counsel to cross-examine the declarant-victim on the additional testimony?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-5\"><em>Myer v. State, </em>399 Md. 33, 922 A.2d 573 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">Before this Court, petitioner argues that the statements on the tape are testimonial hearsay under <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177, and its progeny. Petitioner argues that the interview and tapes are testimonial evidence because during the interview, a police officer was watching through a two-way mirror and the officer asked a question, by telephone, at the end of the interview. Petitioner asserts that he was never given a prior opportunity to cross-examine H.C. about the videotape because the tape was not yet in evidence when the State called H.C. as a witness and he was not allowed to recall H.C. after the tape was admitted into evidence. Finally, petitioner argues that the trial court committed prejudicial error under Maryland evidence law when it denied petitioner the opportunity to recall H.C. for cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">The State argues that petitioner declined to cross-examine H.C. when given the opportunity, and that <em>Crawford </em>was not \u2022 offended because H.C. was available for cross-examination before the tape was admitted. The State characterizes the refusal of the trial court to recall H.C. for further cross-examination as a permissible exercise of the court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">We turn to petitioner\u2019s contention that the trial court committed prejudicial error when it denied his request to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>recall the witness for cross-examination. This Court generally follows the principle that we will not reach a constitutional issue when a case can properly be disposed of on a non-constitutional ground. <em>See Smith v. State, </em>399 Md. 565, 570 n. 4, 924 A.2d 1175, 1178 n. 4 (2007); <em>Dept. of Corrections v. Henderson, </em>351 Md. 438, 451, 718 A.2d 1150, 1156 (1998); <em>Professional Nurses v. Dimensions, </em>346 Md. 132, 138, 695 A.2d 158, 161 (1997); <em>State v. Lancaster, </em>332 Md. 385, 404 n. 13, 631 A.2d 453, 463 n. 13 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">A court\u2019s interest in properly disposing of a case on non-constitutional grounds is so strong as to constitute one of the few exceptions to the general rule that an issue must be raised in the petition for certiorari, cross-petition or Order of the Court. <em>See McCarter v. State, </em>363 Md. 705, 713, 770 A.2d 195, 199 (2001); <em>Professional Nurses v. Dimensions, </em>346 Md. at 138-139, 695 A.2d at 161 (1997) (stating \u201c[t]he appellate policy of avoiding unnecessary decision of constitutional issues gives rise to one of \u2018a very limited number of circumstances [that] have been treated as extraordinary\u2019 and thus within the exceptions to the requirement that an issue be raised in a certiorari petition, cross-petition, or order by the Court.\u2019 \u201d) (internal citations omitted); <em>State v. Raithel, </em>285 Md. 478, 484, 404 A.2d 264, 267 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">In the instant case, the issue presented can be decided on Maryland evidentiary, non-constitutional grounds. We hold that the trial court\u2019s denial of Myer\u2019s request to recall the witness after the tape was admitted to be a violation of Maryland evidence law separate and apart from any rights Myer may have under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>See Michigan v. Long, </em>463 U.S. 1032, 1040, 103 S.Ct. 3469, 3476, 77 L.Ed.2d 1201 (1983). Because we find that the Circuit Court abused its discretion in restricting petitioner\u2019s right of cross-examination, and the error was not harmless, we do not consider petitioner\u2019s constitutional argument as to the admissibility of the tape.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">The trial court abused its discretion when it refused to recall the witness for purposes of cross-examination. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>trial court has discretion both in controlling the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and in controlling the scope of cross-examination. The trial court also abused its discretion because its refusal to recall the child-witness, under the unusual facts of this case, impermissibly limited petitioner\u2019s right of cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Trial courts are granted broad discretion under Md. Rule 5\u2014611(a) to control the mode and order of the interrogation of witnesses and the parties\u2019 presentation of evidence. Subject to constitutional considerations, the same is true as to the scope and timing of cross-examination. The Rule provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-6\">\u201c(a) Control by court. The Court shall exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to (1) make the interrogation and presentation effective for the ascertainment of the truth, (2) avoid needless consumption of time, and (3) protect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWx\">\u201c(b) Scope of cross-examination. (1) Except as provided in subsection (b)(2), cross-examination should be limited to the subject matter of the direct examination and matters affecting the credibility of the witness. Except for the cross-examination of an accused who testifies on a preliminary matter, the court may, in the exercise of discretion, permit inquiry into additional matters as if on direct examination ____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">We review an exercise of this authority for abuse of discretion. <em>See Ware v. State, </em>360 Md. 650, 684, 759 A.2d 764, 782 (2000) (noting that \u201ctrial judges have broad discretion in determining the order of presentation of evidence.\u201d). An abuse of discretion can occur when the trial judge\u2019s action \u201cimpair[s] the ability of the defendant to answer and otherwise receive a fair trial.\u201d <em>State v. Hepple, </em>279 Md. 265, 270, 368 A.2d 445, 449 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">Cross-examination is a right guaranteed by the common law. <em>See, e.g., Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. at 68, 124 S.Ct. at 1374 (holding that where testimonial evidence is at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>issue, the Sixth Amendment demands what the common law required: unavailability and a prior opportunity for cross examination); <em>U.S. v. Gomez-Lemos, </em>939 F.2d 326, 333 (6th Cir.1991) (describing \u201cthe ancient faith of the common law, incorporated by the founders in the Bill of Rights, that live confrontation and cross-examination of witnesses in the courtroom is the key to finding the truth in a criminal trial\u201d); <em>State v. Bumper, </em>275 N.C. 670, 170 S.E.2d 457, 460 (1969). The United States Supreme Court has recognized cross-examination as \u201cthe \u2018greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth.\u2019 \u201d <em>California v. Green, </em>399 U.S. 149, 158, 90 S.Ct. 1930, 1935, 26 L.Ed.2d 489 (1970) (quoting 5 John Henry Wigmore, Evidence in Trials at Common Law, \u00a7 1367 (3d ed.1940)).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Cross-examination has many purposes. The questioner may intend to impeach a witness with a prior inconsistent statement, to show bias or interest of a witness, or to even bring out helpful information not included in the direct testimony. We have described the role of cross-examination as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-6\">\u201cThe real object of cross-examination is \u2018to elicit all the facts of any observation or transaction which has not been fully explained.\u2019 That a witness may be cross-examined on such matters and facts as are likely to affect his credibility, test his memory or knowledge or the like, is a fundamental concept in our system of jurisprudence. And cross-examination to impeach, diminish, or impair the credit of a witness is not confined to matters brought out on direct examination; it may include collateral matters not embraced in the direct examination to test credibility and veracity, it being proper to allow any question which reasonably tends to explain, contradict, or discredit any testimony given by the witness in chief, or which tends to test his accuracy, memory, veracity, character or credibility. Of course, the right to cross-examine effectively necessarily includes the right to place the testimony of a witness in its proper setting to fairly enable the jury to judge its credibility.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number><em>State v. Cox, </em>298 Md. 173, 183-84, 468 A.2d 319, 324 (1983) (internal citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Cross-examination is permissible to elicit facts \u201ctending to discredit the witness by showing his testimony in chief was untrue or biased.\u201d <em>Alford v. U.S., </em>282 U.S. 687, 692, 51 S.Ct. 218, 219, 75 L.Ed. 624 (1931). The partiality of a witness is \u201calways relevant as discrediting the witness and affecting the weight of his testimony.\u201d 3A J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 940, p. 775 (Chadbourn rev.1970). A cross-examiner may also seek to draw out disparities in a witness\u2019 testimony. Such pursuit may yield an instance where \u201cthe witness who has told one story aforetime and another today has opened the gates to all the vistas of truth which the common law practice of cross-examination and re-examination was invented to explore.\u201d Edward W. Cleary, et al., McCormick on Evidence, \u00a7 251 at 603 (2d ed.1972). If a witness is not so easily led to contradiction, the \u201c[c]ommon law traditionally has allowed witnesses to be impeached by their previous failure to state a fact in circumstances in which that fact naturally would have been asserted.\u201d <em>Jenkins v. Anderson, </em>447 U.S. 231, 239, 100 S.Ct. 2124, 2129, 65 L.Ed.2d 86 (1980) (citing 3A J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1042, at 1056 (Chadbourn rev.1970)).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">In the instant case, the trial court improperly precluded petitioner\u2019s counsel from the opportunity to pursue these traditional avenues of cross-examination with respect to the video-taped testimony, which the State introduced into evidence after H.C., the child-victim had testified. When the trial court denied petitioner the opportunity to recall H.C. for cross-examination, the court said as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">\u2018Well, you have trial strategy, and it may be a decision to ask the witness about a prior inconsistent statement, or it may be a decision to simply point out the differences between testimony here at trial and statement given at the time that she spoke with Miss Henry back in November of 2004. But there was certainly an opportunity to conduct cross-examination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Arh\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>In this case, the denial of the opportunity to cross-examine after the tape had been admitted \u201cinhibited the ability of the defendant to receive a fair trial.\u201d <em>Martin v. State, </em>364 Md. 692, 698, 775 A.2d 385, 388 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">The general rule is that <em>ex parte </em>statements are excluded from evidence as hearsay unless otherwise permitted by rule or statute. Many states, including Maryland, have enacted statutes, sometimes known as the tender years exception, designed to protect the emotional and psychological health of young children alleged to be victims of sexual abuse and to provide for the admissibility of <em>ex parte </em>statements and video-tapes taken under particular circumstances. <em>See, e.g., State v. Snowden, </em>385 Md. 64, 867 A.2d 314 (2005); <em>Commonwealth v. Kriner, </em>915 A.2d 653, 657 (Pa.Super.2007) (quoting <em>Commonwealth v. Fink, </em>791 A.2d 1235, 1248 (Pa.Super.2002) (noting that \u201c[t]he tender years exception allows for the admission of a child\u2019s out-of-court statement due to the fragile nature of young victims of sexual abuse\u201d)). <em>See also </em>Robert P. Mosteller, <em>Remaking Confrontation Clause and Hearsay Doctrine Under the Challenge of Child Sexual Abuse Prosecutions, </em>1993 U. III. L.Rev. 691 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">H.C.\u2019s video-taped interview with the social worker was admitted into evidence pursuant to \u00a7 11-304, a carefully crafted exception by the Legislature to the hearsay rule for certain out-of-court statements of child sexual assault victims under the age of twelve and other specified offenses.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>\u00a7 ll-304(b). The statute sets out the requirements for admissibility, regardless of whether the child victim testifies at the trial; it also provides an opportunity for the defendant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>depose a child witness who -will testify under the statute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In providing for the opportunity to depose a child witness before trial, the statute expresses a clear legislative intent that the defendant have a right to cross-examine the witness, and in our view, the right must be a meaningful one.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Typically, attorneys make the tactical decision as to whether or not to cross-examine a witness. Ordinarily, the court\u2019s denial of a request by counsel to recall a witness for cross-examination is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard. Upon review, if the decision not to cross-examine was a pure tactical and strategic decision, a reviewing court will ordinarily find no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court. <em>See, e.g., Deibert v. State, </em>150 Md. 687, 693, 133 A. 847, 850 (1926) (stating that when an appellant did not inquire about an issue on cross-examination \u201c[h]is failure did not give him the right to call the witness to the stand again for what was, in effect, a belated cross-examination.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">It is correct that the court gave petitioner an opportunity to cross-examine H.C. after the child completed her direct examination, and petitioner declined to do so. And, the court did nothing to prevent the defense from questioning the witness, to confront H.C., to ask her relevant questions, and to bring out any inconsistencies in her testimony. But the opportunity to cross-examine H.C. was not a meaningful one when it preceded the receipt of the video-tape into evidence. Ordinarily, failure to exercise the opportunity to cross-examine would be considered a waiver of the right. But, the introduction of an <em>ex parte </em>statement of a child witness pursuant to \u00a7 11-304, well after the child has testified, is no ordinary case. Petitioner did not elect to cross-examine H.C. immediately after her direct testimony because he objected to the admissibility of the videotape. In a case such as this, it is an abuse of discretion to deny petitioner the opportunity to cross-examine on issues arising from the introduction of that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>H.C. testified before the State offered the tape into evidence, and the State waited until the conclusion of its case-in-chief before it offered the tape into evidence. Counsel indicated to the trial court that there were statements on the videotape that were inconsistent with H.C.\u2019s testimony and he wished to confront her with those statements. For example, when H.C. testified in court, she said that Ethel was in the shower when the purported touching occurred; in the video, she said that Ethel was on the bed with her and the defendant. There were some other inconsistencies as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">Defense counsel was placed \u201con the horns of a dilemma.\u201d He had objected consistently to the admissibility of the testimony of the social worker and to the admissibility of the videotape. His theory that the videotape and the social worker\u2019s testimony was inadmissible on <em>Crawford </em>grounds was neither baseless nor frivolous. If counsel had cross-examined H.C. on inconsistencies in her testimony and the videotape, he might well have opened the door for the State to put the entire videotape into evidence. <em>See, e. g. Brown v. State, </em>373 Md. 234, 238-39, 817 A.2d 241, 243-44 (2003) (stating that a party who introduces evidence cannot complain on appeal that the evidence was erroneously admitted). He was placed in a position of forgoing cross-examination, or himself introducing evidence of the video-tape. He was faced also with waiving his objection to the introduction of the video-tape or asking H.C. about statements contained on the video-tape before the tape was introduced. He cannot be faulted for not cross-examining H.C. when she testified in the State\u2019s case in chief. Under these circumstances, the trial court abused its discretion in not permitting counsel to recall H.C. for purposes of cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">An analogous situation arose in Delaware regarding an out-of-court statement of an adult rape victim and the timing of cross-examination. <em>See Smith v. State, </em>669 A.2d 1 (Del.1995). Even though <em>Smith </em>pre-dated the Supreme Court\u2019s recent pronouncements on the confrontation clause, <em>see Davis v. Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224 (2006) <em>and Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177, the Court\u2019s reasoning regarding the opportunity for cross-examination is instructive. Pursuant to Delaware statute, DehCode Ann., tit. 11, \u00a7 3507 (1994), the State offered the alleged victim\u2019s statement into evidence well after the victim had completed her direct, cross-examination and redirect testimony.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ad8\">\u201cAlthough Anderson was called as a witness and examined by the State, her statement was not offered into evidence when the State concluded its direct examination. As a result, Smith was left with two equally unsatisfactory alternatives. If he cross-examined Anderson about the statement before it had been offered as evidence, Smith would be calling the jury\u2019s attention to a damning statement made by a witness who testified in his favor on direct examination. Alternatively, Smith could ignore the statement and hope that the State had decided not to put it into evidence. By choosing the latter course, Smith lost the opportunity to cross-examine Anderson about the statement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-6\"><em>Smith, </em>669 A.2d at 7-8. The court held that the Delaware statute requires not only the opportunity to cross-examine a declarant, but also requires the opportunity to cross-examine the declarant about the out-of-court statement, and that introduction of the statement cannot be timed so as to place a strategic burden on the non-offering party. <em>Id. </em>at 8. The court created a rule for the admissibility of such statements: \u201cthe statement must be offered in to evidence no later than the conclusion of the direct examination of the declarant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>What is clearly the importance of <em>Smith </em>is that the introduction of an out-of-court statement should not be timed to strategically disadvantage a defendant or to limit the opportunity for quality cross-examination of the declarant.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>The issue of timing of cross-examination of a child sexual assault victim arose in <em>Vaska v. State, </em>135 P.3d 1011 (Alaska 2006). The out-of-court statement at issue was admitted by the court as a prior inconsistent statement. Noting that the practical question at issue in the case was whether the particular manner in which the State chose to present its case at trial could have influenced the defendant\u2019s tactical decision as to whether to cross-examine or not, the court stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnZR\">\u201cAs the state itself recognizes, Vaska\u2019s decision to waive cross-examination at trial reflects a tactical choice. Yet despite this recognition, the state ignores the most likely tactical explanation for Vaska\u2019s choice: the state\u2019s own strategic decision to cut short T.E.\u2019s testimony, have her declared unavailable, and ask that her earlier statements be admitted on grounds wholly unrelated to her ability to appear as a witness at trial or to be meaningfully cross-examined. Theoretically, of course, Vaska remained free to cross-examine T.E; but as a practical matter, the state\u2019s tactical choice gave Vaska no immediate reason to conduct cross-examination, and it suggested no foreseeable reason. Indeed, it appears that the state\u2019s most likely purpose in deciding to seek admission at trial under the catchall exception, instead of on alternative grounds that would have required T.E.\u2019s presence, was to spare T.E. from having to face the emotional trauma of cross-examination. From the state\u2019s perspective at trial, T.E. had no meaningful testimony to offer, so there was no point in initiating an ongoing dispute over her present ability to testify and be meaningfully cross-examined\u2014a dispute that the state was bound to invite unless it relied on the catchall provision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 1021.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">This case does not require any broad ruling. We are holding that, on the facts before us, the court abused its discretion by not allowing the defense to cross-examine the child once the statement was admitted. Whether a court has abused its discretion usually depends on the particular facts of the case\u2014on the context in which the discretion was exer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>cised\u2014and that is what we address here. The critical facts were as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">(1) The defense was aware of the statement, had a copy of it, and knew that, on the whole, it was highly inculpatory but that it also revealed an important inconsistency, which could be used to impeach the witness;</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">(2) The defense believed that the statement was inadmissible in evidence, both under <em>Crawford </em>and because it was unreliable; on balance, the defense concluded that it was more prejudicial .than helpful;</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">\u25a0 \u25a0 (3) The defense moved, <em>in limine, </em>that the court exclude the statement and-made clear that it would formally object if and when the statement was offered;</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">(4) The State played coy with whether it really intended to offer the statement, to the end that, when the child testified, it was not clear whether the statement would be offered;</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">(5) If the statement was not to be admitted, the defense was content not to cross-examine the child; and</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">(6) If the defense, immediately following direct.examination, had cross-examined the child about the content of the statement\u2014the part that was inconsistent with her testimony\u2014it ran a serious risk that, by questioning the child about the inconsistency, most likely the State would be able to introduce the inculpatory parts under the doctrine of verbal completeness, ev\u00e9n if the statement would otherwise have been inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">As we have indicated, the State\u2019s deliberate strategy created in this case a real Hobson\u2019s Choice for the defense, <em>i.e., </em>to forego cross-examination regarding a glaring inconsistency between the child\u2019s out-of-court statement and her testimony on a highly relevant fact, or to waive the efficacy of what may well have been a valid objection to a highly prejudicial piece of evidence. That dilemma, created entirely by the State\u2019s trial strategy, could be avoided only by allowing the defense to cross-examine the child after the statement was admitted. The court\u2019s refusal to do so constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>The concurring opinion, though agreeing with that conclusion, would go further and establish a <em>per se </em>rule regarding the <em>scope </em>of the cross-examination\u2014that, as a matter of law, cross-examination would be restricted to specific contradictions between the out-of-court statement and the child\u2019s testimony. That is too rigid. It is also unnecessary and could be hurtful to the child-witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">The trial court could have controlled the scope of the cross-examination; that, too, is largely discretionary, especially with respect to a child-witness, and there is no need for us to opine as to what a trial court may, in its discretion, allow. A court, in this situation, may be willing to allow, and ordinarily <em>should </em>allow, a broader cross-examination if the alternative, mandated by the concurring opinion, would require that the cross-examination be bifurcated, thereby subjecting the child to being cross-examined, and thus having to relive the incident, twice. There certainly would have been no error and no abuse of discretion had the trial court here chosen to allow a greater range of cross-examination than would be permitted by the concurring opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

The holding framed by the opinion is that \u201cthe court abused its discretion by not allowing the defense to cross-examine the child once the statement was admitted.\u201d Op. at 485, 943 A.2d at 628. Although claiming that this does not constitute a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>\u201cbroad ruling\u201d <em>(id.), </em>the Court\u2019s reasoning strips away that cloak of denial. The holding is overly broad.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Myer was given an opportunity to cross-examine the victim, called by the State, following the child\u2019s live, in-court testimony. He declined. The surmise of the Court\u2019s opinion seems a valid one in that his decision to forego cross-examination at that point in the trial in order to discredit or impeach the victim at that time, using what he believed to be conflicting or additional factual assertions found only in her videotaped interview, risked opening the door to wholesale admission of the hitherto unadmitted videotape. Nonetheless, as long as Myer steered clear in cross-examination at that time of factual predicates traceable only to the videotape, he risked nothing. His election not to cross-examine the victim at that juncture cannot be without any consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The unfairness to Myer on this record crept in when, after the videotape was admitted, which assertedly contained statements of fact contradictory to or supplemental to what the victim said on the witness stand, cross-examination as to the \u201cnew\u201d information was not allowed. Had the Court\u2019s opinion held that cross-examination aimed solely at exploring or developing the contradictory or supplemental statements by the victim in the videotape was what was wrongly denied, I would be at peace with the opinion; however, the opinion seems to encourage the trial judge in this case (and others in future analogous cases) to allow Myer an overly broad cross-examination right, including matters which were cumulative and consistent in both the in-court and videotaped statements, which he waived by not cross-examining the victim following the in-court testimony. That is, in my view, unnecessarily generous based on this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Judge BATTAGLIA has authorized me to state that she joins in this concurring opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b499-13\">.

Assuming proper notice is given to the defense, the statute allows the trial court in a criminal case to admit into evidence, to prove the truth of the matter asserted, an out-of-court statement of a child under the age of twelve who is the alleged victim of child abuse or certain sexual offenses, regardless of whether the child testifies at trial or not. The statement must have been made to statutorily identified persons acting lawfully in the course of their profession when the statement was made, and the court must find that the statement possesses particularized guarantees of trustworthiness. If the child victim does not testify, the child's out-of-court statement must be corroborated. In addition, the statement cannot be admissible under any other hearsay exception.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b502-8\">.
