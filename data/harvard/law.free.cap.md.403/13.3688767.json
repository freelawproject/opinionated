Co. v. Chase, </em>43 Md. 23, 34-36 (1875). There we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-9\">\u201cBy the common law it is well settled, that where land lies adjacent or contiguous to a navigable river, in which there is an ebb and flow of the tide, any increase of soil formed by the <em>gradual and imperceptible recession </em>of the waters, or any gain by the <em>gradual and imperceptible formation </em>of what is called alluvion, from the action of the water in washing it against the fast land of the shore, and there becoming fixed as part of the land itself, shall belong to the proprietor of the adjacent or contiguous land.\u201d 2 Bl. Com. 261; <em>Giraud v. Hughes, </em>1 G. &amp; J. 249. And the right to accretion, thus formed, is considered as an interest appurtenant to the principal land, and belonging, in the nature of an incident, to the ownership of that, rather than as something acquired by prescription or possession, in the ordinary legal sense of those terms. <em>And in addition to this right by reliction or accretion, the riparian proprietor, whose land is bounded by a navigable river, whether his title extends beyond the dry land or not,[</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em>] has the right of access to the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number><em>navigable part of the river from the front of his lot, and the right to make a landing, wharf or pier for his own use, or for the use of the public, </em>subject to such general rules and regulations as the Legislature may think proper to prescribe for the protection of the rights of the public, whatever those rights may be. This is well established doctrine by both Federal and State courts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-5\">\u201cThese riparian rights, founded on the common law, are property, and are valuable, and while they must be enjoyed in due subjection to the rights of the public, they cannot be arbitrarily or capriciously destroyed or impaired. They are rights of which, when once vested, the owner can only be deprived in accordance with the law of the land, and, if necessary that they be taken for public use, upon due compensation.... But these principles of the common law, governing the rights of the riparian owner, however well established, are subject to change and modification by the statute law of the State, and by the nature and circumstances of the grant by which the title may have been acquired to the land bounding on the river.\u201d (Some citations omitted.) (Some emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Almost a hundred years later, in <em>Bd. of Public Works v. Larmar Corp., </em>262 Md. 24, 37, 277 A.2d 427 (1971), we restated the common law of riparian rights, adding, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-5\">\u201cIn assessing the changes that have occurred in riparian rights down the corridor of years it is well to keep in mind an appreciation for the basic rationale behind the rule of law which gave to the riparian owner the rights to land surfacing through the process of apcretion or reliction. <em>In its nascency, the sole purpose of phe rule was to assure to the riparian owner that he would never be cut off from his access to water. </em>If an intervening party were permitted to gain title to accretions or to l\u00e1nd exposed by the subsidence of water, the riparian landovjner would be deprived of his valuable water-access rights.\u201d!<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-6\"><em>See also, Worton Creek Marina, LLC v. Claggett, </em>381 Md. 499, 509, 850 A.2d 1169, 1174-75 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">While other doctrines (i.e., \u201couster,\u201d \u201cadverse possession,\u201d and \u201ceasements\u201d) are presented by the parties in this case, the real fight, as it usually is in riparian rights issues, is over access to water and who has it.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>This case requires this Court to consider the various property rights of a waterfront community, as between the individual landowners and the Pines Community Improvement Association, Inc. Two petitions and one cross-petition for writs of certiorari from the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 decision have been granted. <em>White v. The Pines, </em>399 Md. 595, 925 A.2d 634 (2007). The first petition, consisting of petitioners Stuart White, Sondra White, Gayle Clow, Gill &amp; Associates, Allen Carey Garman, Steven G. Garman, Joseph Donahue and Cynthia Donahue<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>, all of whom were owners of individual lots that, but for a strip of community property separating their lots from the waters of Chase Creek, would have been waterfront properties which would have inherently had riparian rights.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Petitioner A presents the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-5\">\u201c1. When the Court of Special Appeals found that the use of certain piers began under an easement, and thus began as a permissive use, was the Court correct in rejecting the principle that an ouster could change the use from permissive to adverse, thus allowing adverse possession or a prescriptive easement to arise 20 years after the ouster?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-6\">\u201c2. When an easement to the water grants the easement holder the right to build a pier, and the easement holder does so, is the ownership of the pier vested in the easement holder by severance of the riparian rights under the easement, or in the land owner by Maryland Code, Environment Art., Section 16-201?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>\u201c3. When a covenant or easement is placed in a chain of title to certain property by the developer to protect uses granted to others over that land, may a later owner of that land, or a court at that land owner\u2019s request, ignore or treat the covenant or easement as meaningless?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">The second petition for certiorari, filed by petitioners Douglas W. Johnston, Jr., William C. Simmons and Mary J. Simmons<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>, presents the following questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-6\">\u201cI. DID THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS FAIL AS A MATTER OF LAW TO CORRECTLY INTERPRET THE LANGUAGE OF A MORTGAGE, PLAT AND DEED GRANTING TO PETITIONERS RIGHTS TO THEIR RESPECTIVE PIERS FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE LOTS, ACROSS COMMUNITY LAND, AND OVER THE WATERS OF CHASE CREEK AND INSTEAD AWARDING TO THE PINES COMMUNITY IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION, INC. A USE IN COMMON TO THOSE PIERS?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-7\">\u201cII. DID THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS ERR IN AFFIRMING THE DECISION OF THE CIRCUIT COURT WITH RESPECT TO THE PETITIONERS\u2019 CLAIMS OF OUSTER OF THE PINES COMMUNITY IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION, INC. FROM THE FEE SIMPLE OWNERSHIP OF THE COMMUNITY LAND ADJACENTTO THEIR RESPECTIVE PROPERTIES AND ADVERSE POSSESSION OF THAT COMMUNITY LAND?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-8\">\u201cHI. DID THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS ERR IN DETERMINING THAT THE PINES COMMUNITY IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION WAS ENTITLED TO JOINT USE OF THE PRIVATE PIERS ADJACENT TO THE PETITIONERS\u2019 RESPECTIVE LOTS AS A RIPARIAN OWNER WHEN THE PRIVATE PIERS ORIGINATED ON THE PRIVATE LOTS OF THE PETITIONERS, CROSSED OVER \u2018USE IN COMMON\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>COMMUNITY LAND, AND EXTENDING OVER THE WATERS OF CHASE CREEK?\u201d (Bolding in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKY\">Finally, the Pines Community Improvement Association, Inc., (\u201crespondent/cross-petitioner\u201d) presents the following questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-5\">\u201c1. Did the Court of Special Appeals err in failing to uphold the Trial Court\u2019s decision establishing a system that provided for the common use of piers attached to Community Lands even though the Court of Special Appeals recognized that the PCIA and all other property owners in the Pines community have the \u2018right to build and enjoy piers <em>in common </em>with all other lot owners\u2019?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-6\">\u201c2. Did the Court of Special Appeals err in reversing the Trial Court\u2019s award of damages in amounts equal to the rental value of pier slips where certain property owners excluded the PCIA and other lot owners from the \u2018use in common\u2019 of these slips?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">We affirm, in part, the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, and hold that the lot owners in this case have only easements in common with all other like lot owners in the community to riparian rights, that PCIA is the owner of all portions of the piers adjacent to the Community Lands and Community Lot that are situate over or that abut channelward from Community Lands or the Community Lot, and that consequently, such piers are equally available to all lot owners in common with all other lot owners, including PCIA, with such availability limited to access from Community Land or the Community Lot. For the reasons stated <em>infra, </em>we shall vacate that part of the trial court\u2019s order that conferred upon the PCIA express management authority over those piers not situate adjacent to the Community Lot.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We further hold that the Court of Special Appeals was correct in reversing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>decision of the trial court awarding damages equal to the amount of the past rental value of the pier slips.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">The facts and procedural history, as found by the trial court, indicate that the development process began in 1922. At that time, a Plat was recorded in the Land Records of Anne Arundel County by a Mr. Leonidas Turner, then a principal of The Severn River Company, and his wife, Amelia A. Turner. They evidently intended to create a new residential community to be known as \u201cPines-on-the-Severn\u201d (\u201cthe Pines\u201d) wherein some access to the waterfront for all Pines\u2019 residents would be an important feature. To that end, they created via that Plat a ring of land between Chase Creek and lots near the water, which was referred to as \u201cCommunity Land\u201d. A second Plat was recorded in 1924. That had the effect of expanding the community property to the entire waterfront of the Pines. In 1926, The Severn River Company was evidently succeeded by The Pines Company. The relevant grant to that entity included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-6\">\u201c[a]ll parts thereof marked Community Land or Community Lot, and all the roads, ways, streets, lanes[,] alleys, and paths, piers, riparian and water rights appurtenant to said Community lands, streets, roads, lanes, ways, alleys, and paths, being subject to such rights therein as granted to the owners of such lots or parts of said tract in the deeds from the said The Severn River Company heretofore executed and recorded.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">Later, in 1926, the Pines Community Improvement Association, Inc. (\u201cPCIA\u201d) was formed by incorporation, as noted in the joint stipulation of facts in the Circuit Court. According to its Certificate of Incorporation, the PCIA\u2019s function was: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>\u201cTo control and care for the Community lots and beaches, the water supply, fire protection, sanitation, enforcement of restrictions, roads, police, lighting, legislation, transportation and all other matters in which the community interest as a whole is involved.\u201d The joint stipulation of facts informs us that membership in PCIA is voluntary and at the time of this litigation, consisted of approximately 114 lot owners, including at least some of the petitioners.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Also in 1926, The Pines Company (as indicated above, the apparent successor to The Severn Company) conveyed to PCIA a deed granting it a waterfront lot as shown on the 1922 Plat, which became known as the \u201cCommunity Lot.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That conveyance also included the \u201cuse in common language,\u201d and was granted subject to covenants contained in the <em>habendum </em>clause, which stated in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-6\">\u201cTO HAVE AND TO HOLD the said lot of ground and premises above described and mentioned, and hereby intended to be conveyed, together with the rights, privileges, appurtenances and advantages, thereto belonging or appertaining, unto and to the proper use and benefit of the said Pines Community Association Incorporated, and for the title holders from The Pines Company, Incorporated, or Leon[id]as G. Turner, their successors or assigns, in fee simple, subject, however, to the following covenants, and agreements which are hereby entered into by the [PCIA], its successors and assigns, with the said The Pines Company, Inc., as part of the consideration of this deed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-7\">\u201cThat the said grantee doth hereby covenant and agree for itself, its successors and assigns, that the land hereby conveyed, shall be liable annually for the proportionate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>amount of the cost of maintaining the roads, included in the area of the Pines-on-Severn, for the total square feet in said lots said proportionate amount not to exceed, however, the sum of Sixty-dollars ($60.00) to be paid annually on the 15th day of March, in each year, by the grantee, its successors and assigns, to the Pines Company, its successors and assigns, or to such person or body corporate, as it or they may direct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-5\">\u201cIT IS DISTINCTLY UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED BETWEEN the parties hereto, that all covenants and agreements above expressed, shall be held to run and bind with the land hereby conveyed, the acceptance of this deed, shall have the same effect and binding force upon the grantee, its successors and assigns, as if the same were signed and sealed by the said Pines Company, Inc[J, and of the grantee; provided however, that the covenants contained in this deed may be changed with the written consent of the said The Pines Company, Inc. and of the [PCIA], their successors and assigns.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">In 1928, what became known as the Machen mortgage was executed between The Pines Company as mortgagors and Mary G. Machen as mortgagee. It encumbered the title to the remaining lots in The Pines, including any Pines Company community property, to Mary G. Machen, in exchange for $35,000 to the The Pines Company. That mortgage included the following descriptive language: \u201croads, ways, streets, lanes, alleys and paths, piers, riparian and water rights appurtenant to the land known as Pines on the Severn, subject however, to the use of the adjacent lot holders therein, and also all water works----\u201d Upon default and foreclosure of the Machen Mortgage in 1932, Pines-on-the-Severn, Inc. ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>quired title and assumed the mantle of developer through 1958. During that time period, conveyances from Pines-on-the-Severn, Inc. included similar \u201cuse in common language\u201d as contained in the prior deeds from the original developer.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">In 1952, the remaining lots, including community property, were conveyed from Pines-on-the-Severn to the Pumphreys and the Obrechts. The conveyance was: \u201csubject, however, to the rights of owners of property in the development to the areas designated as \u2018Community Land\u2019 and \u2018Community Lot.\u2019 \u201d In 1962, Chas H. Steffey, Inc. obtained all remaining lots and in turn conveyed them to White Acre, Inc. In 1966, White Acre conveyed its interest in the community property to PCIA in fee simple, and made the conveyance \u201csubject to such rights and privileges [whatever they might have been] heretofore granted from time to time by the Grantor to others ... to use said property hereby conveyed for the purpose set forth by such grants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Over the course of time, several lot owners built piers adjacent to their respective properties that traverse and/or abut the creek side of the community land as shown on the 1920\u2019s plats. Conversely, during that same period, PCIA undertook particular acts that asserted its ownership of the property at issue, including community walks<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and it adopted a pier management plan in September 2003.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>In December 2003, certain of the petitioners filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County seeking declaratory and equitable relief regarding certain piers near their homes extending across Community Land into the waters of Chase Creek. On January 20, 2004, PCIA answered the complaint and filed a motion to dismiss, alleging that the original petitioners had failed to join the necessary parties, which was denied April 16, 2004. On June 13, 2004, PCIA filed a counterclaim against the original petitioners, seeking damages for alleged violations of the slip assignment provisions of its bylaws. The original petitioners answered and denied responsibility to PCIA for damages. On July 26, 2004, the Circuit Court granted a motion to intervene filed by Mary E. Gleaves and Karl Gleaves, who were also lot owners in Pines-on-the-Severn.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">The first stage of the trial was held on April 13 and 15, 2005, whereupon the Circuit Court concluded that full relief could not be afforded without providing all lot owners in Pines-On-The Severn an opportunity to intervene and be heard. On June 7, 2005, the Court entered a show cause order pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-211, <em>sua sponte, </em>and directed the parties to cause the order to be served upon all lot owners in Pines-on-the-Severn.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">On July 8, 2005, PCIA filed a cross-claim against the owners of a number of lots whom they alleged to be similarly situated to the original petitioners, also seeking damages. In its cross-claim, PCIA asserted ownership of the community property and the right to control and regulate the use of the piers. Cross-defendants Mr. and Mrs. Gleaves answered and denied responsibility to PCIA for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">Trial resumed on December 21, 2005. On December 28, 2005, the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, by memorandum and order, ruled in favor of PCIA, ordering:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>\u201c1. The Pines Community Improvement Association, Inc. holds fee simple title to the Community Land or Community Lot (\u2018Community Land\u2019) shown on the 1922 and 1924 Plats of Pines-On-The-Severn recorded among the Land Records of Anne Arundel County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-4\">\u201c2. The Pines Community Improvement Association, Inc. owns all improvements existing on the Community Land, including all piers, pilings, boathouses and steps leading to piers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-5\">\u201c3. The claims of the Plaintiffs and Cross-Defendants that they have acquired title to portions of the Community Land, piers and boathouses extending from the Community Land, and, steps leading to piers existing on Community Land by adverse possession are denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-6\">\u201c4. The claims of the Plaintiffs and Cross-Defendants that they have acquired a prescriptive easement for the exclusive use of portions of the Community Land, piers and boathouses extending from the Community Land, and steps leading to piers existing on Community Land by adverse possession are denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-7\">\u201c5. The claims of the Plaintiffs and Cross-Defendants that the Machen mortgage and subsequent deed grant them an interest in portions of the Community Land or piers and boathouses extending from the Community Land different than the interest enjoyed by all property owners in Pines-On-The-Severn are denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-8\">\u201c6. The Plaintiffs and Cross-Defendants are enjoined from claiming or asserting, in an action at law or otherwise, that they have any claim of ownership of, title to, prescriptive easement over, or exclusive right to use or control any portion of the Community Land and any improvement existing thereon or extending therefrom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-9\">\u201c8. The Pines Community Improvement Association, Inc. is declared to have the right, power and authority to use, control, and regulate the use of the Community Land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>and all improvements.existing thereon, including the right (a) to assign boat slips at piers and boathouses extending from the Community Land (b) to charge fees for costs associated with the piers and boathouses and (c) to charge wet storage fees to boat owners that fail to comply with slip assignment regulations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-6\">\u201c10. Final judgments are entered against the Plaintiffs and Cross-Defendants for wet storage fees due and owing to The Pines Community Improvement Association, Inc. As follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-7\">(a) Joseph and Cynthia Donahue, jointly and severally, in the amount of $1,080.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-8\">(b) Douglas W. Johnston in the amount of $3,150.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-9\">(c) Keith and Dee Lyon, jointly and severally, in the amount of $7,740.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-10\">(d) Gayle Clow in the amount of $1,150.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-11\">(e) Stuart P.

Garman, Jr., and Steven Garman, jointly and severally, in the amount of $14,430.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-13\">(g) Michael and Jill Donnelly, jointly and severally, in the amount of $1,575.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-14\">(h) Gill <em>&amp; </em>Associates in the amount of $19,170.00.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-15\">A timely appeal<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> was noted to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed in part and reversed in part. It held, as relevant here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>\u201cThe deeds in the instant appeal created a property right for all lot owners. The express easements are for riparian rights and riparian rights include the right to wharf out. The PCIA has not constructed any piers and is the owner of the piers by virtue of its riparian land ownership. In more typical waterfront communities, easements created for lot owners are likely easements of use of piers and access to water. That is not the case in the matter under review because a grant of riparian rights without reservation includes the right to build piers as appellants did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-5\">\u201cThe parties, thus, are equally vested with the legal right to build and enjoy piers in common with all other lot owners. The PCIA is both a lot owner in this context and the servient tenement. The inability of the parties to come to agreement on how to implement the shared rights of use and maintenance creates interference in the use and enjoyment of the easements for all parties. In the attempt to devise an equitable solution, the trial judge granted [exclusive] powers to the servient tenement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-6\">\u201cThe fees that the PCIA established are not appropriate maintenance fees under easement law, as delineated in <em>Drolsum [v. Luzuriaga, </em>93 Md.App. 1, 17-18, 611 A.2d 116 (1992)]. Fees based upon commercial usage and enforced for punitive purposes do not embody the legal principles of the easement law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-7\">\u201cThe PCIA may not charge fees for usage of an easement granted expressly to lot owners and neither may lot owners exclude the PCIA or other lot owners from usage of piers. The issues before the Court allowed for determination of easement law application to a set of facts that do not lend themselves to the type of practical solution as decreed by the trial court. According legal effect, as we have accorded in this appeal, to the deeds and the express easements granted therein for riparian rights result in the only legally sound disposition. Were the PCIA both the owners of the riparian land and exclusive owners of the riparian rights incident thereto, an equitable solution similar to that pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>posed by the trial court could allow for fees to maintain the easements of usage and access.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-5\"><em>White v.

Cloisters at Charles, Inc., </em>392 Md. 374, 392-93, 897 A.2d 206, 216-17 (2006), offers clear instruction on the interpretation of instruments creating easements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-8\">\u201c \u2018In construing the language of a deed, the basic principles of contract interpretation apply. The grant of an easement by deed is strictly construed.... The extent of an easement created by an express grant depends upon a proper construction of the conveyance by which the easement was created.... \u201cThe primary rule for the construction of contracts generally\u2014and the rule is applicable to the construction of an easement\u2014is that a court should ascertain and give effect to the intention of the parties at the time the contract was made, if that be possible.\u201d ...\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>\u201cA court construing an agreement under this test must first determine from the language of the agreement itself what a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have meant at the time it was effectuated. In addition, when the language of the contract is plain and unambiguous there is no room for construction, and a court must presume that the parties meant what they expressed. In these circumstances, the true test of what is meant is not what the parties to the contract intend it to mean, but what a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have thought it meant. Consequently, the clear and unambiguous language of an agreement \"will not give [way] to what the parties thought that the agreement meant or intended it to mean.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-4\"><em>Garfink, </em>392 Md. at 392-93, 897 A.2d at 216-17. <em>E.g., General Motors Acceptance Corp. v.

That covenant was in addition to the use in common language found in the \u201cBEING\u201d clause of the PCIA\u2019s deed and appellants\u2019 deeds. The use in common language did not promise to do or refrain from doing anything. It simply granted a use in common of the Community Land and Community Lot. It is an express easement as discussed, <em>infra.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-7\">\u201cThe original grantors of The Pines were the Turners. The Severn River Co. was an entity of which Mr. Turner was president. The deed created by the Turners that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>conveyed The Pines to the company of which Leon[id]as was the president, and the plats accompanying that conveyance, clearly establish a waterfront community. Both plats show Community Land and Community Lot. The deed to the Severn River Co. clearly grants all the Community Land and Community Lot, together with riparian rights, \u2018piers and appurtenances and advantages to the same belonging or in anywise appertaining....\u2019 Whereas the deeds to individual lot owners provided them use in common of roads and the \u2018Community Lot on said Plat and all water and riparian rights incident thereto.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-4\">\u201cThus, the deeds granted the use in common of riparian rights. We hold that those terms are clear and unambiguous.

We agree with the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 reasoning, finding that PCIA is the owner of the community property, and that the community property is subject to a common easement that allows PCIA and all of the individual lot owners a right to use the community property in common with each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">As the PCIA is the owner of the community property, it follows therefore, that it also normally would be the owners of the piers attached to that community property. Maryland Code (1982, 2007 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 16-201 of the Environment Article states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-7\">\u201c[A] person may make improvements into the water in front of the land to preserve that person\u2019s access to the navigable water or protect the shore of that person against erosion. <em>After an improvement has been constructed, the improvement is the property of the owner of the land to which the improvement is attached.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">With regard to the case at bar, the Court of Special Appeals went on to hold:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>\u201cThe grant of riparian rights to appellants in the deeds are express and interpretation is, thus, controlled by the language of'the deed____No extrinsic evidence is required to interpret its meaning.

The grant of riparian rights to the lot owners does not equate to the ownership of riparian land.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-7\"><em>White v. Pines Community Improvement Ass\u2019n, </em>173 Md.App. at 45, 917 A.2d at 1147.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">As PCIA was the actual owner of the waterfront property, subject to an easement allowing all individual lot owners to exercise riparian rights in common with each other, there exists a presumption that the permissive use of the real property in common with all members of the community normally cannot ripen into a prescriptive easement. <em>Kirby v. Hook, </em>347 Md. 380, 393, 701 A.2d 397, 404 (1997) (citing <em>Phillips v.

That Court simply did not address the issue of ouster because it found that a co-tenancy had not been established. We disagree, in part, with the reasoning of the Court of Special Appeals on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-11\">Co-tenancy is not required for an ouster to exist. <em>See Potomac Lodge No. 31, I.O.O.F. v. Miller, </em>118 Md. 405, 415-16, 84 A. 554, 558 (1912) (citing 1 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 804.) (\u201c \u2018The ouster by a tenant in common, of his co-tenant, does not differ in its nature from any other ouster, nor in any respect except in the degree of evidence required.\u2019 \u201d) In cases where no co-tenancy exists, however, the criterion required for the showing of ouster is unclear. We are offered one definition in the case of <em>James Stewart\u2019s Lessee v. Robert Jones, of George, </em>8 G. &amp; J. 1, 17 (Md.1836), where the Court stated, in relevant part: \u201cAn ouster, is some act adverse to the posses<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>sion of another excluding him....\u201d In delineating the type of act that would be adverse to the possession of another, we have stated: \u201c[W]here \u2018[t]he real and vital purpose sought to be accomplished by [the action] is the ousting of the tenant,\u2019 the action is one at law.\u201d <em>Martin v. Howard County, </em>349 Md. 469, 489, 709 A.2d 125, 135 (1998) (quoting <em>Redwood Hotel v. Korbien, </em>195 Md. 402, 411, 73 A.2d 468, 471 (1950)). Further, ousting must be an overt act that is a hostile invasion of another\u2019s rights. <em>Jurgensen v. New Phoenix Atlantic Condominium Council of Unit Owners, </em>380 Md. 106, 124 n. 8, 843 A.2d 865, 875 n. 8 (2004). <em>See Beatty v. Mason, </em>30 Md. 409, 410 (1869) (\u201cA survey, unaccompanied by any other act of user and occupation, is not such a distinct and notorious act of possession as will justify the reasonable presumption of an ouster, or that the party went upon the land with a palpable intent to claim the possession as his own.\u201d). <em>Accord Rosencrantz v. Shields, Inc., </em>28 Md.App. 379, 393, 346 A.2d 237, 245 (1975). \u201cAnd while the ouster need not have been accompanied by positive force, it must have been actual, and be established by acts or declarations brought home to the knowledge of the cotenant.\u201d <em>Ross v. Phillips, </em>148 Md. 165, 167, 129 A. 21, 22 (1925). <em>Accord Bratton v. Hitchens, </em>43 Md.App. 348, 356, 405 A.2d 333, 338 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">In the context of co-tenancy, the Court of Special Appeals has defined ouster as: \u201ca notorious and unequivocal act by which one cotenant deprives another of the right to the common and equal possession and enjoyment of the property.\u201d <em>Young v. Young, </em>37 Md.App. 211, 221, 376 A.2d 1151, 1158 (1977). And this Court has stated \u201c \u2018and any act or conduct signifying his intention to hold, occupy and enjoy the premises exclusively, and of which the tenant out of possession has knowledge, or of which he has sufficient information to put him upon inquiry, amounts to an ouster of such [a co-]tenant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sowers v. Keedy, </em>135 Md. 448, 451, 109 A. 143, 144 (1919) (citing 1st R.C.L., page 742, paragraph 62). Where no cotenancy exists, however, the burden is less, because there exists no presumption that possession by one is possession by all.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>\u201cIt is not the law that there can be no adverse possession by one tenant in common against another, but <em>more evidence is required. </em>\u2018The ouster by a tenant in common, of his co-tenant, does not differ in its nature from any other ouster, nor in any respect <em>except in the degree of evidence required. </em>The distinction relates to the character of the evidence necessary to prove that the possession was adverse.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-4\"><em>Potomac Lodge No. 31, I.O.O.F., </em>118 Md. at 415-16, 84 A. at 558 (quoting 1 <em>Am. &amp; Eng.

We need not, however, resolve that issue or the other ousting issues because even if ouster could be shown, there was sufficient factual evidence before the trial court in each relevant case for it to find that adverse possession after ouster could not be proved for various reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">This Court has held that: \u201cTo establish title by adverse possession, the claimant must show possession of the claimed property for the statutory period of 20 years.:.. Such possession must be actual, open, notorious, exclusive, hostile, under claim of title or ownership, and continuous or uninterrupted.\u201d <em>Costello v.

Appellants presented a letter from Chet Harriman, a president of the PCIA acknowledging Pier 2 as \u2018your pier\u2019 and appellees presented evidence of a letter from its lawyer from 1983 claiming ownership of piers in The Pines. The trial judge found that the Donahues had applied for boating permits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>from 1993 to 2003, boats were assigned to Pier 2 and in the years subsequent to 1966[ ] community walks have entered upon Pier 2. Substantial evidence as to adverse possession exists in the record [supporting the trial court\u2019s decision] for the court to decide the issue and we find no error of fact or law as to adverse possession.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-4\">\u201cPiers 8 and 9\u2014Simmons and Johnston</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-5\">\u201cPier 8 and Pier 9 are claimed by appellants through color of title and appellants contend that the PCIA, moreover, has acknowledged their ownership as late as 1998 when, in its newsletter, it stated that \u2018the shoreline from the west end of the community beach to the south end of The Terraces is privately owned. Access to the water and private piers in this area is by invitation only.\u2019 Further, the property in front of Pier 9 was backfilled and a 1974 confirmatory deed was filed putting on public record the claim that all the property in front of lot 401 and part of lot 402 belonged to the lot owner. The property was advertised for sale as riparian property. Johnston claims no PCIA member ever tried to come onto the contended property when he was there, no Pines logos were painted on Pier 9 and no one from the PCIA ever tried to evict him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-6\">\u201cThe Simmons\u2019 bought their lot from Frederick Green (hereinafter Green). The deeds conveyed the lots that the Simmons\u2019 bought to the water\u2019s edge. Green established a bulkhead, backfilled washed out land, maintained Pier 8, erected a fence and, as early as 1975, Simmons erected a \u2018No Trespassing\u2019 sign and wrote to the PCIA stating that the land and pier were his property. The Simmons personally insure Pier 8 as part of their homeowner\u2019s policy and, like Johnston, the Simmons\u2019 property is taxed as waterfront. Payment of taxes is a salient fact in support of, but alone not sufficient to prove, adverse possession. <em>Bratton v.

The record is replete with testimony and evidence in support of both parties\u2019 contentions. We do not find that the trial court abused its discretion by not consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>ering Simmons\u2019 testimony because there is no evidence to that effect and we presume the trial judge carefully considered all of the arguments before making a decision. <em>Thomas [v. City of Annapolis], </em>113 Md.App. [440,] 450, 688 A.2d 448 [, 453 (1997)]. Likewise, appellant cites no law to support the contention that building a bulkhead and backfilling the land amounts to erasing the Community Land and, further, one cannot adversely possess one\u2019s own land as the Simmons\u2019 assert the land between their lots and Chase Creek became. Alternatively, the record reflects that some Community Land remained after the bulkhead was erected and backfilled. The PCIA conducted community walks on the Community Land in front of the Simmons\u2019 lot. The trial judge\u2019s ruling was not clearly erroneous that the reentry was enough to assert ownership by the PCIA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-5\">\u201cThe trial court found that [Johnston\u2019s predecessor in title] failed to respond to the 1983 letter from the PCIA that it owned Pier 9 and, in 1985, wrote the PCIA in regard to Pier 9 following a community walk. They acknowledged a dispute as to ownership of Pier 9, but that was less than twenty years ago and hardly hostile possession as they asked to discuss a resolution of various claims to the property and settlement. <em>See Hungerford, supra. </em>Thus, as Johnston\u2019s predecessor did not claim adverse possession or prescriptive easement, title cannot be tacked which Johnston must do in order to reach the statutory period.[<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>] The PCIA continued to enter the property and painted a logo on Pier 9 in 1990.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-6\">\u201cPier 11\u2014Clow</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-7\">\u201cPredecessor owners, the Elgerts, did not respond to the assertation of ownership contained in the 1983 letter from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>the PCIA.

Clow argues that she approached the PCIA about extending Pier 11 because without PCIA\u2019s consent, as deeded owner of the land, she thought a permit would not. be issued. We find no error of fact or law as it relates to the trial court\u2019s ruling in regard to Pier 11. There was no mistake on Clow\u2019s part as to ownership of the riparian land and no exercise of actual, open, notorious, exclusive, hostile, under claim of title or ownership for the statutory period. <em>Costello [v.

Notwithstanding that Lenzer\u2019s 1941 letter provided, in notorious and hostile fashion, his claim to pier 12, it was not directed at the title owners of the Community Land and Community Lot to which the pier attached as discussed <em>supra. </em>Further, the litigation addressed the fence constructed by Lenzer and not the pier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-6\">\u201cThe court in <em>Kipp v. </em>Lenzer[<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>] ruled that it was \u2018not asked to require the defendants to remove so much of the pier as extends out over the water. In any event, it is difficult to understand how the Court, on the present state of the record, could do anything about that. The <em>Plaintiffs do not own the Beach hut have only an easement therein in virtue of their ownership of lots in the development. </em>They have no more right to the use of the water in front of the beach than any other member of the general public has; and, in the absence of a showing that they have suffered a special damage, that is to say, a damage different from that suffered by the general public, by reason of the maintenance of so much of the pier as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>extends out over the water, they are certainly not entitled to injunctive relief as to that part of the pier which extends out over the water.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-4\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-5\">\u2018The Court will, accordingly, conf\u00edne its discussion to the steps leading down the bluff and the boardwalk leading from the foot of the steps out to the water\u2019s edge.\u2019 (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-6\">\u201cThe <em>Kipp </em>Court further found that it could not \u2018see any possible objection to the maintenance of the steps\u2019 because the bluff could be used for no other purpose than access from lot 609 to the beach. No other lot holder or Kipp could \u2018be hurt by the maintenance of those steps\u2019 and although it was possible, though the court did not find an invasion of technical rights; it was not an invasion of practicable rights such that an equity court would interfere. The topography of the land was the issue as to access to the beach, not the steps. The lot owners were precluded from obstructing passage along the community beach.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-7\">\u201cNotwithstanding that ruling, appellants contend that Lenzer\u2019s successor Price held Pier 12 exclusively and even told the PCIA to \u2018go fly a kite\u2019 when the PCIA demanded dock rental fees for use of Pier 12. The police were called to evict trespassers and the Whites believed Pier 12 came with their house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-8\">\u201cTo support their claim of tacking, the Whites\u2019 rely on the deeds in their chain of title as having conveyed Pier 12 to them. A review of the deed reveals that the deed from the Whites\u2019 immediate predecessor states a conveyance of lots 608 and 609 \u2018TOGETHER with all improvements thereon and the rights, alleys, ways, waters, privileges, appurtenances and advantages thereto belonging or in anywise appertaining.\u2019 The immediately subsequent paragraph states that the grant is \u2018SUBJECT to the covenants, conditions, easements and restrictions of record and amendments thereto,\u2019 making the appurtenance of the pier that the Whites and their predecessors claim subject to the common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>scheme provided for in the plats and the permissive easements granted in the deeds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-4\">\u201cTestimony at trial indicated that the \u2018No Trespassing\u2019 signs posted by the Whites and their predecessors were taken down by the PCIA and that the PCIA\u2019s signs were replaced with private signs. The Whites argue that no Community Lot or Community Land exists, the PCIA has never moored nor assigned a boat at Pier 12, executed any leases with respect to Pier 12 and the Whites have paid the taxes assessed for the pier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-5\">\u201cContrary testimony indicated an absence of no trespassing signs on Pier 12 and that the advertised community walks that occurred with regularity beginning in the mid-1960\u2019s and extending to the present time, constituted a reentry on the land for purposes of indicating that appellants\u2019 possession was invalid. <em>Rosencrantz, </em>28 Md.App. at 389, 346 A.2d [at] 237. The variance applied for by the Whites in 2001 indicates that there is indeed a strip of community land that appellants acknowledged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-6\">\u201cSubstantial and conflicting evidence in the record presented by both parties was found by the trial court to militate in favor of the PCIA and we find no clear error of law or fact in which to ground a reversal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-7\">\u201cPier 13\u2014Garman</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-8\">\u201cIn previous litigation, the court ruled that, \u2018even though the Garmans may have rebuilt the pier as a result of its destruction by ice during the winter of 1976-1977, it shall remain the property of the riparian owner.\u2019 The court named the PCIA as riparian owner and, thus, appellees claim that that ruling precludes appellants\u2019 claim as to ownership under <em>res judicata. </em>We disagree. A ruling as to ownership of the pier does not preclude the beginning of a new statutory period if the elements of adverse possession are met. The moment adverse possession is interrupted another period may begin <em>de novo. Hughes v. Insley, </em>155 Md.App. 608, 622, 845 A.2d 1[, 9] (2003).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>\u201cAppellants aver that notwithstanding the ruling of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County in favor of the PCIA in 1982, the Garmans nevertheless continued to possess Pier 13 to the exclusion of all others and, thus, meet the statutory requirements for adverse possession. PCIA letters requesting compliance with the court order were ignored and assigned boats\u2019 owners were told by Mr. Gar-man that he was the \u2018dockmaster.\u2019 Substantial evidence exists in the record that Mr. Garman was not claiming exclusive use of Pier 13 and, in any event, the PCIA exerted control over the pier by assigning boats, sending correspondence and conducting community walks thereby interrupting any twenty year period begun after the 1982 decision and we do not find clear error on the part of the trial court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-4\">\u201c14B, 15 and 16\u2014Gill &amp; Assocs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-5\">\u201cThe trial court was not clearly erroneous in finding that appellants did not acquire title to the above referenced piers by adverse possession because substantial evidence exists in the record for the trial court to have so found from the following evidence in the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-6\">\"14B</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-7\">\u201cPier 14B was constructed some time before 1943. The trial court found that Pier 14B can hardly qualify as a pier because it was dismantled in the late 1970\u2019s. That action by the PCIA was the impetus for the suit filed by Wirt Gill and later dismissed without prejudice. Testimony exists in the record from <em>Nichols[</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>that the pier is in use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-8\">\"15</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-9\">\u201cThe finding of the Anne Arundel Circuit Court, which was not appealed, granted ownership of Pier 15 to the PCIA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>in 1987. A claim of adverse possession would have had to begin again and, thus, we perceive no clear error of the trial court\u2019s factual finding that adverse possession did not accrue and Pier 15 belongs to the PCIA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">\"16</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-5\">\u201cAppellants contend that, because the pier was constructed and solely maintained by the [ ] previous owner and the general reputation was that the pier belonged to the owners of lot 624, that they have acquired title to Pier 16 by adverse possession. The PCIA added additional pilings a!nd the record indicates that Nichols was unable to get a permit to repair it because of the PCIA\u2019s ownership of the pier.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AA\"><em>White, </em>173 Md.App. at 49-59, 917 A.2d at 1150-1155 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">While the findings of fact of the trial, court are somewhat confusing, and, to some extent, unusual, we see no sufficient error of fact or law in the relating of those findings by the Court of Special Appeals. In other words, while there is evidence to the contrary, there is sufficient evidence (albeit barely in some cases) in the record to support the trial court\u2019s findings on the issues next above discussed. \u201cThe weighing of the evidence and the assessment of witness credibility is for the finder of fact, not the reviewing court. <em>Terranova v. Board of Trustees, </em>81 Md.App. 1, 13, 566 A.2d 497, 503 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">The Court of Special Appeals, after further describing the trial court\u2019s findings, correctly went on to hold that where there is an agreement that violates the law, that agreement is unenforceable in Maryland.. <em>See e.g., State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co. v. Natiomvide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>307 Md. 631, 643, 516 A.2d 586, 592 (1986). With respect to the instant case, the Court of Special appeals stated: \u201c[T]he [trial] judge noted that attempts by the PCIA to control piers violates the R-2 zoning of the area because community piers and marinas are not permitted uses except in the area adjacent to the Community Beach [i.e. the Community Land].\u201d <em>White, </em>173 Md.App. at 62, 917 A.2d at-1157. By its own admission, the trial court then established a system that would be unenforceable in Maryland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>if its finding that such action would violate zoning provisions is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">Enforceability of this agreement, however, may be a moot issue, as we are unable to find in the record where PCIA was ever granted the authority to manage the piers. As a lot owner itself, PCIA is both a servient tenement and a dominant tenement. In other words, it has both the right to use, in common with other lot owners, the community property as a lot owner, and as the owner of the community property, it is subject to the other lot owners\u2019 rights to use the community property. We have been unable to find, however, any conveyance that grants PCIA the authority to exclude any lot owner or to charge any fee for the use of the piers. Further, we find no error of law in the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 analysis of this issue. That Court stated, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-5\">\u201cA servient tenement cannot close or obstruct an easement so as to prevent the reasonable enjoyment of those entitled to use it. <em>Maddran v. Mullendore, </em>206 Md. 291, 297, 111 A.2d 608[, 610] (1955). Similarly, the PCIA may not control the piers to exclude those who have an express grant of riparian rights nor can appellants prevent the PCIA\u2019s use in common in its role as lot owner and servient tenement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-6\">\u201cAppellants argue that if not created by an express provision, the PCIA\u2019s only basis for collecting fees then, can be that there is \u2018an implied obligation to <em>contribute to the maintenance of </em>commonly held property without regard to usage.\u2019 Restatement (Third) of Property, Servitudes, \u00a7 6.2 (2000) (emphasis added by appellant). We agree. The fact that those sharing a common easement may be responsible for its maintenance does not make the several landowners a common-interest community because their duty is determined by the extent of their use. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-7\">\u201cThe PICA\u2019s right to require reasonable maintenance fees comes from a shared right of use in the easement and not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>from its status as a community association or by a covenant in lot owners\u2019 deeds.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-4\"><em>White, </em>173 Md.App. at 67-68, 917 A.2d at 1160. We further agree with the Court of Special Appeals that the past wet storage fees assessed against all the petitioners appear to be inappropriate, even if a statute or the common law permits. The record, however, does not reflect that such issue has been addressed sufficiently below, and as stated above, we have found no conveyance that expressly grants PCIA such power. Accordingly, we leave the possibility of proportionately distributing the future wet storage fees to further negotiation, settlement or litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm, generally, the Court of Special Appeals, with the reservation next above stated, which presumably may be subject to further negotiation, settlement or litigation, and hold that the PCIA is the owner of the community property, i.e., Community Land and Community Lot, and as a result of that ownership, is also the owner of the facilities, i.e., the piers at issue in this appeal, extending channelward from the Community Land and Community Lot That ownership is subject to an express common easement to all property owners in the community (unless other title instruments provide otherwise) as to riparian rights, which would include PCIA. Finally, the wet storage fees assessed by the trial court were inappropriate, as was the maintenance system established by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS IS AFFIRMED IN PART AND VACATED IN PART; COSTS IN THIS COURT AND THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID EQUALLY BY PETITIONERS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b46-10\">. In some areas of the state the descriptions of property (metes, bounds, and courses, etc.) carry the boundaries of the title conveyed out into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>beds of watercourses, often when titles date back to the original patents that frequently contain descriptions carrying to the middle or the channel of this or that waterway.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">Additionally, sometimes as the water levels rise the mean high tide line of navigable water courses moves landward transforming former fast land into the beds of the waterways. When that happens, properties that were formerly abutting on the waters become part of them. As an example, there are numerous platted lots out in the Atlantic Ocean east of Ocean City resulting from the rise in ocean levels that caused the barrier island, upon which Ocean City sits, to migrate (move) westward. As a consequence of that movement, land over the years was re-platted creating new water front lots. But what happened to the platted lots to the east now out under the ocean?</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">The intellectual abilities of the Real Property Bar will be taxed to the ultimate if water levels ever fall and the island moves eastward again and conflicting claims to riparian rights are made based upon the early plats and the re-plats. If that were to ever happen, the \"real\u201d real property afficionados trying to sort out the mess, will be as happy as a tick that has been on a dog for two days. Alas, for the writer, the tides of time will probably cause him to miss this great event.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b48-8\">. A question thus exists as to whether riparian rights can even be lost under the theory of adverse possession or prescription. We note that there are conflicting cases in other jurisdictions. We have never decided the issue. As the water level rises and the mean high tide mark advances landward, new waterfront properties come into being to which riparian rights become appurtenant. If water levels were to fall, the mean high tide mark would, move channel ward out into the waters, eventually moving past the area! of riparian rights previously claimed by adverse possession. As only riparian rights would have been claimed by adverse possession (as in the present case), i.e., the right of access to water, and no fast land is claimed, how would title to the new land created channelward of the area where riparian rights have been claimed, be established? Considering the unique nature of riparian rights, it may be doubtful whether they can be obtained under the theory of adverse possession or prescription. How can a property right which by its very nature must be attached to fast land, be severed from it? How can an unattached riparian right exist'\u2014ever? In light of the fact that the lower court and the Court of Special Appeals have found and affirmed that, in any event, the requirements of adverse possession have not been met in this case, and we agree, we need not resolve that issue in this case. We expressly leave it for another time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b49-7\">. For the sake of clarity, these petitioners, all of whom are pier builders or whose predecessors in title built piers, sometimes shall, as a group, be referred to collectively as petitioner A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b49-8\">. The \"key deeds\u201d in the chains of title from which most, if not all, these petitioners obtained their property contained language relating to riparian rights similar to: \"... the use in common with others ... of the community lot on said Plat and all water and riparian rights incident thereto.\u201d The phrase \"key deed\u201d is defined in <em>Bright v. Lake Linganore Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>104 Md.App. 394, 404, 656 A.2d 377, 383 (1995), as \"the deeds first subjecting each of the lots at issue ... to ... the ... Declaration [whatever conditions were imposed in the Declaration in that case].... \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b50-9\">. These three petitioners sometimes shall be referred to collectively as petitioner B.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b51-8\">. There may be covenants or provisions in the title documents that are not readily discernable from the record that would authorize PCIA to manage all of the piers. If so, that is a matter for further negotiation, settlement or litigation. Additionally, management by PCIA may or may not be prohibited by various statutory provisions, one of which is discussed <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b52-8\">. Some early off-conveyances of lots from The Severn River Company included the language as: \"also the use in common with others of the road extending from Chase Creek to the Baltimore and Annapolis Boulevard and also the use in common with others entitled thereto of the lots of ground designated as Community Lot on said Plat and all water and riparian rights incident thereto.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b53-8\">. Our review of the record does not reveal that the creation of a community association was provided for by covenants in the relevant instruments in the chain of title.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b53-9\">. We shall sometimes refer to \"Community Land\u201d and \"Community Lot\u201d as community property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b54-9\">. We have not been directed to any part of the record where there was any such written consent to any changes by all of the owners of property where title evolved from The Pines Company, Inc., the PCIA and their successors in title, i.e., apparently all of the owners in \"The Pines.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b55-7\">. Beginning in the 1960\u2019s and continuing to present day, these \u201ccommunity walks\u201d were advertised throughout the Pines by way of the PCIA newsletter. They include walking on community lands and have at one time or another included walking on each of the piers extending from the community property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b55-8\">. The pier management plan included a system for distribution of slips on piers located in the Pines, requiring a lot owner to join PCIA and remain in good standing to have permission to maintain a slip. The plan provides that application for a slip may be made after the posting of a refundable bond and paying a yearly maintenance fee. A fifteen dollar per day wet storage fee is assessed for boats in slips without assignment thereto. The plan apparently contemplated that PCIA would assume control over the piers and slips built by the individual lot owners with the intention that such piers would be limited to use by lot owners designated by PCIA according to specific criteria created by it. The actions of PCIA in asserting ownership of the piers and attempting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>to assume control of the piers and the respective lot owners response is the primary focus of the present dispute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b58-16\">. There, the appellants included: Stuart P. and Sondra R. White, Joseph and Cynthia Donahue, Michael and Jill Donnelly, Gill &amp; Associates, Gayle Clow, Steven Garman, Virginia E. Garman, Allen L. Gar-man, Sr., Allen L. Garman, Jr., Keith and Dee Lyon, Douglas W. Johnston, Jr. William C. and Maty J. Simmons, Douglas C. and Stephanie S. Rice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b60-13\">. Not all of the appellants in the Court of Special Appeals joined in the petitions for certiorari.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b69-8\">. We neither agree, nor necessarily disagree, with the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 statement that a predecessor in proper possession must make some active declaration that his possession of property is adverse in order for \"tacking\u201d to apply in an adverse possession context. In the context of this case, we need not address this issue further.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b70-7\">. That case was heard in October 1943, in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, In Equity, Case No. 8401 Equity, found in the record extract at E. 1500.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b73-10\">. Nichols was an appellant in the case before the Court of Special Appeals, but is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b76-7\">. We do not agree necessarily with that final statement. As we noted earlier, the record reflects that membership in PCIA is voluntary. Where PCIA is not permitted by statute to operate a marina outside of the Community Lot, and where membership in PCIA is voluntary, it may be difficult to set up a system for contribution for the maintenance of the piers or even a system for use of the piers. We note that just because an owner may have riparian rights does not mean that he must exercise them just because someone else who shares riparian rights is using them and that in such a circumstance he must pay to maintain a pier over which he does not exercise the rights he may have <em>unless the covenants affecting the land generally, or the instruments in his chain of title so provide.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
