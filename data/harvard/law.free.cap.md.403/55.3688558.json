The Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission awarded Alejandro Garcia benefits, but noted that as a result of his status as an illegal alien,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Smigelski\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy would not cover the injury. On petition for judicial review, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County granted summary judgment to the insurance provider, Potomac Insurance Company of Illinois, on the issue of coverage. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the grant of summary judgment, and we granted Smigelski\u2019s petition for certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">We shall hold that the workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy, by its own terms, excluded coverage in states other than Virginia for activities requiring the employer to procure workers\u2019 compensation insurance in those states. Pursuant to Maryland law, Smigelski, as a statutory employer, was required to procure workers\u2019 compensation insurance for his employees in Maryland. We shall hold that the jury\u2019s finding that Alejandro Garcia was regularly employed in Maryland precludes a determination that he was a casual employee. Accordingly, Smigelski was required to procure workers\u2019 compensation coverage in Maryland. Therefore, under the terms of the policy, Garcia was not covered for this accident. Finally, we shall hold that, because Alejandro Garcia was an illegal alien at the time of his injury, he could not properly file a claim in Virginia. There is no basis, consistent with our prior case law, to extend coverage in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">Andrew Smigelski, owner of Columbia Roofing &amp; Home Improvements, a Virginia company, purchased a workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy (\u201cthe policy\u201d) from Potomac Insurance Company of Illinois (\u201cPotomac\u201d), with a policy period from February 28, 1998 to February 28, 1999. The policy, pursuant to Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 65.2-820 (1950, 2007 Repl. Vol.),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> provides coverage for employers who are unable to secure a policy in the voluntary market. The policy terms are predetermined by law and regulations governing Virginia assigned risk policies. Specifically, the policy provides coverage for injuries to workers arising out of and in the course of employment in Virginia,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and limited coverage outside of Virginia according to the Residual Market Limited Other States Insurance Endorsement (\u201cthe Endorsement\u201d). The Endorsement provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-5\">1. We will pay promptly when due the benefits required of you by the workers compensation law of any state not listed in Item 3.A.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the Information Page if all the following conditions are met:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-6\">a. The employee claiming benefits was either hired under a contract of employment made in a state listed in Item 3.A. of the Information Page or was, at the time of injury, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>principally employed in a state listed in Item 3.A. of the Information Page; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-4\">b. The employee claiming benefits is not claiming benefits in a state where, at the time of the injury, (i) you have other workers compensation insurance coverage, or (ii) you were, by virtue of the nature of your operations in that state, required by that state\u2019s law to have obtained separate workers compensation insurance coverage, or (iii) you are an authorized self-insurer or participant in a self-insured group plan; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-5\">c. The duration of the work being performed by the employee claiming benefits in the state for which the employee is claiming benefits is temporary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">The construction project underway at the time of Alejandro Garcia\u2019s accident arose when Philip Kalnitzky, doing business as Victory Homes, contracted with Andrew Smigelski to install a roof for a new home being constructed in Maryland. Smigelski subcontracted the work to Ruben Garcia. Ruben Garcia assigned his nephew, Alejandro Garcia, to a crew of approximately five men who were to work on the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">The job was expected to take four days to complete, and on February 25, 1999, after the job had been in progress for approximately three and one half days, Alejandro Garcia was injured when he slipped and fell from the roof. At the time of the accident, which occurred in Maryland, Alejandro Garcia was an illegal alien whose residence was in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">Alejandro Garcia filed a claim for benefits with the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission. The Commission issued an order, finding, <em>inter alia, </em>that Smigelski was the statutory employer, and that the Potomac policy did not cover Smigelski against the claim because Alejandro Garcia was an illegal alien at the time of the accident. The Commission awarded benefits to Alejandro Garcia.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">Smigelski filed a timely Petition for Judicial Review in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, and both Smigelski and Potomac filed motions for summary judgment. Potomac argued in its motion that, because Maryland law required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Smigelski to procure separate coverage, the Endorsement specifically excluded coverage for this type of work. In Smigelski\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment, he argued that Alejandro Garcia was performing temporary or incidental \u25a0work in Maryland; therefore, Smigelski argued that the policy covered Alejandro Garcia\u2019s injury, pursuant to the terms of the Endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">The trial court agreed with the Commission, granting Potomac\u2019s motion on the issue of insurance coverage, and denying Smigelski\u2019s cross-motion for summary-judgment. The case proceeded to a jury trial on the four remaining issues relating to Alejandro Garcia\u2019s claim: jurisdiction, willful misconduct, average weekly wage and temporary total disability.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-6\">The jury returned the following special verdict:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-7\">VERDICT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-8\">1) WAS ALEJANDRO GARCIA REGULARLY EMPLOYED IN THE STATE OF MARYLAND? YES.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-9\">2) WAS ALEJANDRO GARCIA\u2019S INJURY CAUSED BY WILLFUL MISCONDUCT ON HIS PART? NO.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-11\">3) FOR WHAT PERIOD OF TIME WAS ALEJANDRO GARCIA TEMPORARILY AND TOTALLY DISABLED? FROM FEBRUARY 26, 1999 THROUGH AUGUST 11, 1999.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-15\">4) WHAT WAS ALEJANDRO GARCIA\u2019S AVERAGE WEEKLY WAGE? $415.00.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-17\">Smigelski appealed the court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the Court of Special Appeals, but neither party appealed the judgment entered on the jury verdict. In an unreported opinion, the intermediate appellate court affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court. Smigelski then filed a petition for writ of certiorari in this Court, which we granted.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Smigelski v. Potomac Ins., </em>400 Md. 647, 929 A.2d 890 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">In reviewing a court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, we determine first whether there is any genuine dispute of material fact, and, if not, then whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Educ. Testing Serv. v. Hildebrant, </em>399 Md. 128, 139, 923 A.2d 34, 40 (2007). The relevant inquiry in this case, therefore, is whether the Circuit Court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of Potomac on the issue of coverage. Furthermore, \u201c[i]f the trial court does not state its reasons for granting the motion, we will affirm the judgment so long as the record \u2018discloses it was correct in so doing.\u2019 \u201d <em>Phillips v. Allstate Indem. Co., </em>156 Md.App. 729, 740, 848 A.2d 681, 687 (2004) (quoting <em>Casey Dev. Corp. v. Montgomery County, </em>212 Md. 138, 145, 129 A.2d 63, 67 (1957)). Although the Circuit Court judge did not specify his reasons for granting summary judgment, nonetheless, we shall affirm because he was legally correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">\n<em>I. Policy Excludes Coverage</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Avs\">By its own terms, the Endorsement excludes coverage for activities where, \u201cby virtue of the nature of [Smigelski\u2019s] operations in that state, [Smigelski was] required by that state\u2019s law to have obtained separate workers compensation insurance coverage.\u201d Maryland workers\u2019 compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>law requires employers to \u201csecure compensation for covered employees of the employer.\u201d Md.Code (1991, 1999 RepLVoL), \u00a7 9-402(a) of the Labor &amp; Employment Article. There is no genuine dispute that Smigelski is the correct statutory employer,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and Smigelski concedes as much. As a statutory employer, Smigelski is required to secure insurance for covered employees.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u00a7 9-402(a) of the Labor &amp; Employment Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Petitioner contends that Alejandro Garcia qualifies as a \u201ccasual employee,\u201d and therefore is not considered a covered employee.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u00a7 9-205 of the Labor &amp; Employment Article. Although the term is not defined by statute, \u201cthis Court has consistently held that ... application of the term, \u2018casual employee,\u2019 should be made according to the particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>facts presented in each case.\u201d <em>Wood v. Abell, </em>268 Md. 214, 221, 300 A.2d 665, 669 (1973). This Court has noted that \u201c \u2018where the employment for one job cannot be characterized as permanent or periodically regular, but occurs by chance, or with the intention and understanding on the part of both employer and employee that it shall not be continuous, it is casual.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lupton v. McDonald, </em>241 Md. 446, 452, 217 A.2d 262, 265 (1966) (quoting <em>Consumers\u2019 Mut. Oil Producing Co. v. Indus. Comm\u2019n., </em>289 Ill. 423, 124 N.E. 608 (1919)). Some of the factors we use to determine whether an employee is a casual employee are: the nature of the work, the duration of the employment, and the nature of the contract of employment. <em>Wood, </em>268 Md. at 222, 300 A.2d at 669 (quoting <em>Moore v. Clarke, </em>171 Md. 39, 53, 187 A. 887, 893 (1936)). We use these factors to determine whether an employment arrangement is casual, and the question \u201cmust be determined with principal reference to the scope and purpose of the hiring rather than with sole regard to the duration and regularity of the service.\u201d <em>State Accident Fund v. Jacobs, </em>134 Md. 133, 135, 106 A. 255, 255 (1919).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">In this case, the jury determined that Alejandro Garcia was regularly employed in Maryland. The jury\u2019s finding on this matter is final and conclusive. Neither party has made an issue in this appeal of the jury\u2019s special verdict, and we see no reason to disturb that verdict on appeal. Because the jury found that Alejandro Garcia was regularly employed in Maryland, we cannot say that he was a casual employee. As such, Smigelski as a statutory employer was required to procure coverage for Alejandro Garcia in Maryland. Because Smigelski was required to obtain coverage for Alejandro Garcia, pursuant to Maryland law, the Endorsement excludes coverage, by its own terms, for Alejandro Garcia\u2019s work in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">\n<em>II. Kacur Does Not Provide an Alternative Basis for Coverage</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Petitioner relies on <em>Kacur v. Employers Mut. Cas. Co., </em>253 Md. 500, 254 A.2d 156 (1969), for the proposition that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>even though the policy does not provide coverage for injuries outside Virginia, workers\u2019 compensation coverage is extended to other states where a proper workers\u2019 compensation claim could be filed. The facts in <em>Kacur, </em>however, are distinguishable from the facts in this case, and therefore our holding in Kacur does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">In <em>Kacur, </em>an employee was injured in Maryland while in the course of his employment. <em>Kacur, </em>253 Md. at 503, 254 A.2d at 157. He was, at the time, employed by a tire recapping and sales business located in Pennsylvania. <em>Id. </em>at 501, 254 A.2d at 156. Kacur\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy expressly limited its coverage to claims under Pennsylvania law; however, Kacur\u2019s employee filed his claim in Maryland. <em>Id. </em>at 5-3-04, 254 A.2d at 158. This Court noted that there was no doubt that, had the injured employee filed in Pennsylvania, the insurance carrier would have been obligated to honor the claim. <em>Id. </em>at 507, 254 A.2d at 160. Based on public policy concerns, we extended the policy\u2019s coverage, noting that the employee\u2019s decision to file his claim in a particular state, where jurisdiction is proper, should not limit his employer\u2019s insurance carrier\u2019s contractual obligation to pay benefits. <em>See id. </em>at 509-10, 254 A.2d at 161.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">This reasoning does not apply to the facts of this case because, under Virginia law in effect at the time of his injury, Alejandro Garcia was not considered an employee eligible for benefits because of his status as an illegal alien. At the time of Alejandro Garcia\u2019s injury, Virginia law did not include illegal aliens, who are unable to work legally because of lack of documentation, among the class of employees eligible for workers\u2019 compensation benefits.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Granados v. Windson Dev. Corp., </em>257 Va. 103, 108-09, 509 S.E.2d 290, 293 (1999). Therefore, if Alejandro Garcia had filed his claim in Virginia, his claim would have been denied. In <em>Kacur, </em>this Court reasoned that an insurance carrier\u2019s obligation to pay benefits should not be dependent on the claimant\u2019s choice of forum, where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>both states have proper jurisdiction. <em>Kacur, </em>253 Md. at 509-10, 254 A.2d at 161. Thus, since Alejandro Garcia was ineligible for compensation benefits under Virginia law, our reasoning in <em>Kacur </em>is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">In <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Harleysville Mut. Ins. Co., </em>110 MdApp. 45, 675 A.2d 1059 (1996), the Court of Special Appeals faced a similar challenge. In <em>Harleysville, </em>a Virginia corporation obtained a workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy, assigned pursuant to the Virginia Assigned Risk Plan. <em>Harleysville, </em>110 Md.App. at 48, 675 A.2d at 1061. The employer in that case specifically declined coverage for work outside of Virginia. <em>Id. </em>As such, the court concluded that the employee could not have filed his claim in Virginia. The intermediate appellate court noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayy\">\u201c[bjecause a Virginia forum was not available, the claimant was not provided with a choice of forums in which to bring his claim. Without such a choice, the rationale behind the <em>Kacur </em>decision does not exist, and accordingly, the concept of holding an insurer liable for benefits in a jurisdiction not covered in the insurance contract cannot be justified using <em>Kacur\u2019s </em>reasoning.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-5\"><em>Harleysville, </em>110 Md.App. at 57-58, 675 A.2d at 1065-66. In the case at bar, as in <em>Harleysville, </em>there is no alternate forum available to Alejandro Garcia, because his status as an illegal alien at the time of his injury disqualified him for coverage under Virginia\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation law. We, therefore, concur with the rationale of the intermediate appellate court in <em>Harleysville.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">The policy at issue in this case, by its own terms, excludes coverage for activities outside Virginia requiring separate workers\u2019 compensation insurance. Because the jury in this case found that Alejandro Garcia was regularly employed in Maryland, we cannot say that he was a casual employee. Alejandro Garcia is not a casual employee, and Smigelski is a statutory employer; therefore, Smigelski was required to procure workers\u2019 compensation insurance in Maryland. Be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>cause Smigelski was required to obtain separate workers\u2019 compensation insurance in Maryland, the terms of the policy issued by Potomac exclude coverage for Alejandro Garcia\u2019s work in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Further, our analysis in Kacur does not provide an alternate basis for coverage. In <em>Kacur, </em>we noted that, where an injured employee may properly file in one of several jurisdictions, an insurance provider may not decline coverage merely because of the employee\u2019s choice of forum. Alejandro Garcia\u2019s status as an illegal alien precluded him from filing a successful claim for workers\u2019 compensation in Virginia. Therefore, our reasoning in <em>Kacur </em>does not extend coverage for Alejandro Garcia\u2019s accident in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS IS AFFIRMED. PETITIONER TO PAY THE COSTS IN THIS COURT AND IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b87-8\">. It is undisputed by the parties that Alejandro Garcia was an illegal alien at the time of his injury.

Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 65.2-820 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-8\">Every employer subject to the provisions of this chapter who has been unable to obtain a workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy shall have the right to apply to the State Corporation Commission to have his risk assigned to an insurance carrier licensed to write and writing workers\u2019 compensation insurance in this Commonwealth. The insurance carrier, whether stock, mutual, reciprocal or interinsurer or other type or form of organization, to whom any such risk is assigned shall issue a policy of workers\u2019 compensation insurance which will enable such employer to meet the requirements of this chapter.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b88-9\">.
