Appellants contend that the trial court erred in overruling their motions to dismiss and for summary judgment, and further erred in granting Tudor\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We agree with appellants that the trial court improperly entered summary judgment in Tudor\u2019s favor and improperly denied their motion for summary judgment. Therefore, the judgment of the trial court will be reversed, and summary judgment will be entered in favor of appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b667-12\">Shortly before midnight on August 3, 1982, Homer Tudor, a deputy sheriff for Greene County, Ohio, was riding his motorcycle to work. As Tudor was travelling westbound on Jasper Pike, an automobile approaching from the opposite direction turned left into Tudor\u2019s lane of traffic and struck his motorcycle. Tudor was thrown from the vehicle and, as a result, suffered a fractured left ankle.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-13\">Tudor sought payment of compensation and medical benefits from the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund. Greene County Sheriff Russell Bradley certified Tudor\u2019s claim to the Ohio Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation. A claims examiner for the bureau allowed Tudor\u2019s claim, and compensation and medical benefits were paid accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>Some time in December 1982, the Ohio Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation and Greene County, through its commissioners, each began independent investigations into the validity of Tudor\u2019s claim. The Greene County Commissioners filed a motion with the Industrial Commission requesting a hearing on the allowance of Tudor\u2019s claim. In February 1983, the Industrial Commission found that it had jurisdiction to reconsider the allowance of the claim pursuant to R.C. 4123.514. The Industrial Commission further found that Tudor\u2019s claim was \u201cDENIED for the reason that the injury described * * * did not occur in the course of and arising out of employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Tudor appealed the Industrial Commission\u2019s decision to the Dayton Regional Board of Review. In May 1983, the regional board reinstated Tudor\u2019s claim. From that decision, the Greene County Commissioners appealed to the Industrial Commission, which again denied Tudor\u2019s claim. Tudor requested that the Industrial Commission reconsider its ruling. In July 1984, the Industrial Commission denied Tudor\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">In August 1984, Tudor filed a complaint in the Greene County Court of Common Pleas appealing from the decision of the Industrial Commission. After a protracted procedural history, the trial court overruled the Greene County Commissioners\u2019 motion to dismiss and granted summary judgment in Tudor\u2019s favor. From this judgment, the Ohio Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation, the Greene County Commissioners, and Sheriff Russell Bradley appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">Appellants\u2019 first assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">\u201cThe trial court erred when it denied defendants-appellants\u2019 motion to dismiss since the plaintiff appellee\u2019s notice of appeal to Greene County Common Pleas Court pursuant to Revised Code \u00a7 4123.519 was fatally defective on its face as it did not list the proper employer as a defendant and, therefore, did not vest the trial court with subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d Essentially, appellants argue that Tudor improperly designated Sheriff Russell Bradley as his employer in his notice of appeal to the Greene County Court of Common Pleas and, therefore, pursuant to the requirements of R.C. 4123.519, the notice of appeal was jurisdictionally defective and should have been dismissed by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">Tudor named Sheriff Russell Bradley as his employer. Nowhere in the pleadings has Tudor ever designated Greene County, Ohio, as his employer. The Greene County Commissioners argue that the county is actually Tudor\u2019s employer, and since Tudor\u2019s notice of appeal failed to list Greene County as a party-defendant, such notice was \u201cfatally defective on its face\u201d and should have been dismissed by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>We agree with the Greene County Commissioners that Greene County, Ohio, not Sheriff Russell Bradley, is Tudor\u2019s employer.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">While Sheriff Bradley has the power, pursuant to R.C. 325.17, to appoint and employ the necessary deputies and assistants for his office, to fix the compensation of such employees, and to discharge them, he exercises that power on behalf of Greene County. In common parlance, we may refer to Sheriff Bradley as Tudor\u2019s \u201cemployer,\u201d because Sheriff Bradley is Tudor\u2019s supervisor, to whom Tudor is accountable on a daily basis; however, for purposes of workers\u2019 compensation, Greene County, not Sheriff Bradley, is Tudor\u2019s employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">R.C. 4123.01(B)(1) defines \u201cemployer\u201d to include \u201ceach county.\u201d Moreover, R.C. 4123.01(A)(1) defines \u201cemployee\u201d as \u201cevery person in the service of * * * any county.\u201d Nowhere does the workers\u2019 compensation statute provide that supervisors or department heads of county offices shall be deemed \u201cemployers\u201d of those who are deputies and assistants in their offices. The plain language of the statute is that the \u201ccounty\u201d is the \u201cemployer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">In pertinent part, R.C. 4123.519 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-8\">\u201cThe claimant or the employer may appeal a decision of the industrial commission * * * to the court of common pleas of the county in which the injury was inflicted * * *. Notice of the appeal shall be filed by the appellant with the court * * * [and] the filings shall be the only act required to perfect the appeal [and vest jurisdiction in the court].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-9\">\u201cNotice of appeal shall state the names of the claimant and the employer, the number of the claim, the date of the decision appealed from, and the fact that the appellant appeals therefrom. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-10\">The Supreme Court of Ohio <em>had </em>held that the statutory provisions set forth in R.C. 4123.519 were jurisdictional and strict compliance therewith was mandatory. <em>Starr v. Young </em>(1961), 172 Ohio St. 317, 318, 16 O.O.2d 105, 105, 175 N.E.2d 514, 514. Recently, however, the court has softened its stance on this issue and has held that R.C. 4123.519 shall be liberally construed as required by R.C. 4123.95. <em>Mullins v. Whiteway Mfg. Co. </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 18, 15 OBR 15, 471 N.E.2d 1383.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-11\">The court has also stated that certain mitigating factors are to be considered when examining the sufficiency of a notice of appeal. \u201cThese factors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>include whether appellant has substantially complied with the statutory appeal provisions and whether the purpose of the unsatisfied provision is sufficiently important to require compliance for jurisdictional purposes.\u201d <em>Wells v. Chrysler Corp. </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 21, 23, 15 OBR 18, 19, 472 N.E.2d 331, 333.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">In <em>Wells, </em>the court decided that a notice of appeal from the denial of a workers\u2019 compensation claim that did not designate the employer as such, but named the employer in the caption although not in the body of the appeal, was sufficient to vest jurisdiction in the court of common pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">The court held that R.C. 4123.519 simply requires that the name of the employer be provided somewhere in the notice of appeal. There is no requirement that the employer be designated as \u201cemployer.\u201d The court cautioned, however, that in refusing to require that the employer be designated as such in the appeal, it was not eliminating any of the jurisdictional requirements enumerated in R.C. 4123.519. The court concluded that \u201c * * * the purpose of a notice of appeal is to set forth the names of the parties and to advise those parties that an appeal of a particular claim is forthcoming.\u201d <em>Wells, </em>15 Ohio St.3d at 24, 15 OBR at 20, 472 N.E.2d at 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">In a more recent case, the Supreme Court has held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-7\">\u201c * * * Substantial compliance for jurisdictional purposes occurs when a timely notice of appeal filed pursuant to R.C. 4123.519 includes sufficient information, in intelligible form, to place on notice all parties to a proceeding that an appeal has been filed from an identifiable final order which has determined the parties\u2019 substantive rights and liabilities.\u201d <em>Fisher v. Mayfield </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St.3d 8, 11, 30 OBR 16, 18-19, 505 N.E.2d 975, 977.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">We construe the issue in the case before us to be whether Tudor\u2019s notice of appeal was in a form reasonably calculated to give notice to Greene County of the pendency of Tudor\u2019s appeal. Tudor\u2019s notice of appeal captioned the appellees as \u201cJames L. Mayfield, Administrator, Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation,\u201d and \u201cRussell A. Bradley, Sheriff of Greene County,\u201d respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">Although, in our view, Sheriff Bradley was misnamed as one of the appellees (the proper appellee was Greene County), we conclude that the form of notice employed by Tudor was reasonably calculated to have put Greene County on notice that Tudor\u2019s appeal was pending. Significantly, Greene County has never claimed that it did not have prompt, actual notice of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-10\">The process of serving notice of an appeal is analogous to the process of serving notice of a complaint. Civ.R. 4.2(11) prescribes the method for serving a summons and complaint upon a county, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>\u201cService of process * * * shall be made as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-4\"><em>U </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-5\">\u201c(11) Upon a county or upon any of its offices, agencies, districts, departments, institutions or administrative units, by serving the officer responsible for the administration of the office, agency, district, department, institution or unit or by serving the prosecuting attorney of the county.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">The foregoing suggests that under at least some circumstances Sheriff Bradley, as an elected officer responsible for the administration of his office, may have been a proper agent to receive service of process on behalf of Greene County. Similarly, we conclude that he was authorized to receive notice of the appeal in this case on behalf of Greene County. There is no suggestion that he failed to communicate with the appropriate officers (the county commissioners) to let them know that Tudor\u2019s appeal was pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">Finally, since the county commissioners had already made an issue of Sheriff Bradley\u2019s representative capacity in the administrative forum, they were not likely to have been misled by the misnomer in Tudor\u2019s notice of appeal into thinking that Greene County was not a party to the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">Upon the particular facts of this case, we hold that Tudor\u2019s notice of appeal was in a form reasonably calculated to put Greene County on notice that his appeal was pending. Therefore, in accordance with <em>Fisher v. Mayfield, supra, </em>Tudor\u2019s notice of appeal was in substantial compliance with jurisdictional requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">Appellants\u2019 first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b671-11\">Appellants\u2019 second assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-12\">\u201cThe trial court erred when it granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff solely on the basis that there was no timely appeal when such basis is unsupported by any evidence in the record.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-13\">Appellants argue that the trial court improperly granted summary judgment in Tudor\u2019s favor on the basis that their \u201cappeal\u201d was untimely filed. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-14\">In its \u201cRuling,\u201d dated July 14, 1988, the trial court found that even though Sheriff Bradley did not notify the county commissioners that he had certified Tudor\u2019s workers' compensation claim, the Greene County Commissioners \u201c * * * were aware the claim was allowed within the appeal time * * *.\u201d The trial court also found that \u201c * * * any appeal filed [by Greene County] was untimely and any order made on such appeal [by the Industrial Commission] is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>void.\u201d We conclude that the trial court erroneously characterized Greene County\u2019s request for a hearing on the validity of Tudor\u2019s claim as an \u201cappeal\u201d from the allowance of such claim pursuant to R.C. 4123.516.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">In pertinent part, R.C. 4123.516 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-6\">\u201cA claimant, an employer, or the administrator of the bureau of workers\u2019 compensation who is dissatisfied with a <em>decision of the district hearing officer </em>may appeal therefrom by filing a notice of appeal with the bureau, with a regional board of review, or with the industrial commission, within twenty days after the date of receipt of notice of the decision of the district hearing officer.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">In the case before us, the trial court found that Greene County failed to file its \u201cappeal\u201d within twenty days of receiving notice of the allowance of Tudor\u2019s claim and, therefore, the appeal was \u201cuntimely.\u201d The trial court\u2019s conclusion, however, was incorrect because Greene County was not \u201cappealing\u201d from a decision of the district hearing officer; rather, it was disputing the original allowance of the claim by the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">In January 1983, Greene County filed a motion with the Industrial Commission requesting a hearing on the validity of Tudor\u2019s claim. The Industrial Commission granted Greene County\u2019s request and in February 1983, Hearing Officer Davidek found that \u201c * * * pursuant to Ohio Revised Code Section 4123.514, there [was] jurisdiction to reconsider the allowance of this claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">Pursuant to R.C. 4121.34(B)(2), district hearing officers of the Industrial Commission are granted original jurisdiction over \u201c[a]ll contested claims matters under Chapter 4123. of the Revised Code * * *.\u201d Moreover, R.C. 4121.34(D) provides that \u201c[n]othing in this section shall restrict the authority of the administrator to issue orders authorized by Section 4123.514 of the Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">In pertinent part, R.C. 4123.514 provides that \u201c[i]n the event the employer notifies the administrator that he objects to the tentative order awarding compensation to the claimant, the claim shall be forthwith set for hearing under section 4123.515 of the Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-11\">Pursuant to R.C. 4123.515, the district hearing officer must afford both the claimant and the employer an opportunity to be heard upon reasonable notice and the opportunity to present testimony and facts pertinent to the claim. There are no time limitations set on the claimant or on the employer other than the requirement that \u201c[t]he parties * * * proceed promptly and without continuances except in cases of hardship prejudicial to a party * * Subsequent to the hearing, the district hearing officer is required to present his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>decision and the reasons therefor and to mail copies of such decision to the claimant and the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">In the case before us, Greene County properly requested a hearing before a district hearing officer of the Industrial Commission. The hearing officer found that he had jurisdiction to hear the matter pursuant to R.C. 4123.514. The parties \u201cproceeded promptly and without continuances,\u201d and the district hearing officer concluded that Tudor\u2019s claim should be disallowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">From our review of the record, we conclude that all of the prerequisites set forth in the Revised Code for the hearing and disposition of a disputed claim were met. Therefore, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in Tudor\u2019s favor upon the ground that Greene County\u2019s \u201cappeal\u201d was untimely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">Appellants\u2019 second assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">Appellants\u2019 third assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-10\">\u201cThe trial court erred when it did not grant summary judgment in favor of defendants-appellants since there are no facts pleaded which would tend to establish that plaintiff-appellee\u2019s injury arose out of his employment with the Greene County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-11\">Essentially, appellants contend that the trial court erred in not granting summary judgment in their favor. Appellants argue that Tudor failed to plead any facts that would establish that his injury arose out of his employment and, therefore, his claim should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-12\">Summary judgment, pursuant to Civ.R. 56(C), is appropriate only upon a determination that: (1) there is no genuine issue as to any material fact; (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, who is entitled to have the evidence construed most strongly in his favor. <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 66, 8 O.O.3d 73, 74, 375 N.E.2d 46, 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-13\">In the case before us, Tudor testified at his deposition that at approximately 11:35 p.m., on August 3,1982, he left his home to report to work at the Greene County Sheriff\u2019s Office. Tudor had been assigned to the third shift and he was required to begin work at 12:00 midnight. Tudor further testified that he left for work a half hour before the commencement of his shift, and he was not compensated for his travelling time.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>After having ridden his motorcycle approximately seven miles from home, Tudor approached the intersection of Jasper Pike and Shawnee Trail Drive. Tudor was still some seven miles away from work. Near the intersection, Tudor was struck by an oncoming automobile. Tudor suffered a fractured ankle as a result of the collision, and he subsequently sought participation in the state Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund claiming that the injury arose out of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Tudor testified that the traffic on Jasper Pike was relatively light on the evening he was injured. There was no evidence that Tudor had been called into work early, or that he was carrying out an assigned task on his way to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">An injury sustained by an employee is compensable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act only if it is \u201c * * * received in the course of, and arising out of, the injured employee\u2019s employment.\u201d R.C. 4123.01(C); <em>Bralley v. Daugherty </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 302, 303, 15 O.O.3d 359, 360, 401 N.E.2d 448, 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">The test of the right to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund is not whether there was any fault or neglect on the part of the employer or his employees, but whether a \u201ccausal connection\u201d existed between an employee\u2019s injury and his employment either through the activities, the conditions, or the environment of the employment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">Generally, where an employee, having a fixed and limited place of employment, sustains an injury while travelling to and from his place of employment, such injury does not evidence the required causal connection to the employment; it therefore does not arise out of and in the course of his employment and is not compensable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">There are two recognized exceptions to this \u201cgeneral\u201d rule, however. The first exception is known as the \u201czone of employment\u201d rule. It has been used by courts to find a \u201ccompensable\u201d injury in situations where the employee has sustained an injury either on property that is adjacent to the employer\u2019s premises and is controlled by the employer, or on a roadway that is the sole means of ingress to and egress from the employer\u2019s premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">The second exception is known as the \u201cspecial hazard\u201d rule, and it provides that an employee will be entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits when the employment creates a special hazard and the injuries are sustained because of that hazard. <em>Littlefield v. Pillsbury Co. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 389, 6 OBR 439, 453 N.E.2d 570. The special hazard rule applies where: (1) \u201cbut for\u201d the employment, the employee would not have been at the location where the injury occurred, <em>and </em>(2) the risk is distinctive in nature or quantitatively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>greater than the risk to the general public. <em>Id. </em>The special hazard rule has been limited to situations where the employee was making a left turn against heavy traffic into the employer\u2019s premises or was otherwise exposed to an increased risk of injury near the employer\u2019s premises. See <em>Harden v. Conner </em>(Nov. 23, 1984), Lucas App. No. L-84-195, unreported.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">We conclude that Tudor has not demonstrated that either one of the two exceptions listed above is applicable to the facts of this case. The \u201czone of employment\u201d exception does not apply because Tudor was injured approximately seven miles away from his place of employment. Tudor\u2019s injury was not sustained on or adjacent to the employer\u2019s premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Likewise, the \u201cspecial hazard\u201d exception does not apply. Although it is true that \u201cbut for\u201d his employment Tudor would not have been at the location where the injury occurred, we conclude that the risk Tudor encountered in driving down Jasper Pike was not \u201cdistinctive in nature or quantitatively greater than risks common to the public.\u201d Tudor was nowhere near his employer\u2019s premises; he was not required to turn left against heavy traffic into his employer\u2019s premises; nor was he required to expose himself to any other hazard greater than the risk normally associated with using public roads.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">Neither one of the two exceptions being applicable to the case before us, the \u201cgeneral\u201d rule must be applied. Therefore, since Tudor was injured while travelling to work, his injury does not have the required causal connection to his employment. Accordingly, Tudor\u2019s injury did not arise out of his employment, and it is not compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">Based upon our examination of the record, and construing the evidence most strongly in Tudor\u2019s favor, we find that appellants have satisfied the tripartite test of Civ.R. 56(C). Accordingly, the trial court erred in not granting summary judgment in favor of appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">Appellants\u2019 third assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-10\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b675-11\">Appellants\u2019 second and third assignments of error having been sustained, the judgment of the trial court will be reversed and summary judgment will be entered in favor of the appellants, that being the judgment that the trial court should, as a matter of law, have entered in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-12\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b675-13\">Grady, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b675-14\">Wilson, J., concurs in the judgment.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b676-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>Wilson, Judge, concurring.</judges>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">I agree with Judge Whiteside\u2019s opinion that a sheriff is a deputy sheriff\u2019s employer.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b669-12\">.
