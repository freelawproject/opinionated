Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b233-19\">Defendant-appellant, Susan M. Voss, appeals from an order by the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas compelling her to execute an authorization for the inspection of records relating to communications between herself and her social worker.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-20\">II. The Facts, Generally</p>\n<p id=\"b233-21\">Defendant-appellant Susan Voss and plaintiff-appellee Kenneth C. Voss were divorced in Illinois in May 1981. Custody of their minor child, Steven Voss, born June 8, 1972, was awarded to defendant-appellant. Following the divorce, defendant-appellant moved to Cuyahoga County, Ohio, and plaintiffappellee moved to Georgia. Ohio is the home state of the child for purposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Law. R.C. 3109.21(E). Accordingly, plaintiff-appellee filed his motion to modify custody here in Cuyahoga County, asserting that defendant-appellant was mentally unfit, impairing the child\u2019s mental and emotional development.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Through the course of discovery, it was revealed that defendant-appellant had seen a social worker for counseling on numerous occasions. Plaintiffappellee sought the social worker\u2019s records for the purpose of preparing for trial. Defendant-appellant refused to release the records, asserting that they were privileged.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">A hearing was held before a referee on April 8, 1987. The referee\u2019s report, adopted by the trial court, acknowledges the asserted privilege, and notes that if defendant-appellant refuses to waive the privilege, she will be precluded from using the social worker\u2019s testimony and records on her own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">Nevertheless, by journal entry of March 4, 1988, the trial court ordered defendant-appellant to execute an authorization releasing the subject records. Defendant-appellant refuses to do so, and hereby timely appeals the trial court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">III. Appellee\u2019s Motion to Dismiss</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">Initially, we address plaintiff-appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss this appeal based on an allegedly inadequate record and the lack of a final appealable order. For the reasons set forth below, plaintiff-appellee\u2019s motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">The underlying issue of this appeal concerns the propriety of the trial court\u2019s order journalized March 4, 1988, compelling the defendant-appellant to execute an authorization for the inspection of her social worker\u2019s file, which records constitute confidential, privileged communications pursuant to R.C. 2317.02(G). Plaintiff-appellee correctly notes that the record on appeal does not include a transcript or a statement of proceedings under App.R. 9. We find, however, that the record is sufficient for us to determine the narrow issue presented for review, as stated above.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-11\">Plaintiff-appellee further contends that this court should dismiss the instant appeal since there is no final appealable order. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-12\">The term \u201cfinal order\u201d is defined at R.C. 2505.02 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-13\">\u201cAn order that affects a substantial right in an action which in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment, <em>an order that affects a substantial right made in a special proceeding </em>or upon a summary application in an action after judgment, or an order that vacates or sets aside a judgment or grants a new trial * * (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>The general rule in Ohio is that a discovery order is not a final order and, therefore, is not subject to immediate appellate review. <em>Kennedy v. Chalfin </em>(1974), 38 Ohio St.2d 85, 67 O.O.2d 90, 310 N.E.2d 233; <em>Graines v. Strozier </em>(Apr. 3, 1986), Cuyahoga App. No. 50337, unreported, 1986 WL 4025. The rule, however, is not without its exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">Discovery orders that affect \u201ca substantial right made in a special proceeding\u201d are considered final and appealable if they satisfy that two-prong test. R.C. 2505.02. Under the facts of this case, there is no requirement in R.C. 2505.02 that the instant order need be accompanied with the magic words of Civ.R. 54(B) regarding \u201cno just reason for delay,\u201d contrary to plaintiffappellee\u2019s contentions. The test is merely twofold: (1) the order must affect a substantial right, and (2) the order must be made in a special proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Two seminal Ohio Supreme Court opinions have excepted, from the general rule concerning the nonappealability of discovery orders, orders that infringe upon certain confidential relationships, such as that between a social worker and her client. <em>State v. Port Clinton Fisheries, Inc. </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 114, 12 OBR 157, 465 N.E.2d 865; <em>Humphry v. Riverside Methodist Hosp. </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 94, 22 OBR 129, 488 N.E.2d 877.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Evid.R. 501 leaves the matter of privilege to the Ohio General Assembly, which enacted R.C. 2317.02, \u201cPrivileged Communications and Acts,\u201d providing in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-7\">\u201cThe following persons shall not testify in certain respects:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-8\"><em>(i </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-9\">\u201c(G) * * * social worker, social work assistant, or independent social worker concerning a confidential communication made to him by his client in that relation or his advice to his client * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">Thus, by statute a \u201csubstantial right\u201d exists to protect confidential communications between a social worker and her client. This right is undoubtedly affected by an order to waive it, such as the order <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b235-11\">Before we can conclude that the instant order is an appealable \u201cfinal order,\u201d a determination must be made as to whether the order was made in a \u201cspecial proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-12\">The above-cited Supreme Court cases have set forth guidelines for our consideration in making this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-13\">In <em>Port Clinton Fisheries, </em>12 Ohio St.3d at 116, 12 OBR at 159, 465 N.E.2d at 867, the high court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-14\">\u201c * * * the issue of whether an order is made in a special proceeding is resolved through a practical determination which balances the need for effective and prompt disposition of litigation with the necessity for immediate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>review because post-judgment appeal is not practicable. <em>Amato v. General Motors Corp. </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 253, 258 [21 O.O.3d 158, 161, 423 N.E.2d 452, 455-456]; <em>Columbus v. Adams </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 57, 59 [10 OBR 348, 349-350, 461 N.E.2d 887, 889-890].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">This position was restated in <em>Humphry, </em>22 Ohio St.3d at 96, 22 OBR at 131, 488 N.E.2d at 879, where the court sharpened its focus stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-6\">\u201c * * * The precise query is whether there is an appreciable <em>need for immediate review, </em>and only when this is answered in the affirmative will the ordinary course of a proceeding to final adjudication be interrupted.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">In <em>Port Clinton Fisheries, supra, </em>the high court held that the trial court\u2019s order compelling the disclosure of confidential informants was immediately reviewable, and fit within the definition of a \u201cspecial proceeding\u201d since, once the informant\u2019s identity is disclosed, no appeal could possibly remedy the harm of the disclosure. Similarly, in <em>Humphry, supra, </em>a trial court\u2019s order to the hospital to unveil the names of certain diseased patients was found to amount to a \u201cspecial proceeding\u201d since the potential harm to the patients, who believed their communications with their doctors were protected by law and confidential, could never be undone by appeal, the high court succinctly stating that \u201c[o]nce the information is divulged, the damage is done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">In short, a particular order is one \u201cmade in a special proceeding\u201d if it is a ruling which affects a claim of right that would be irretrievably lost if its review could occur only after final judgment. See, <em>e.g., State, ex rel. Leis, v. Kraft </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 34, 10 OBR 237, 460 N.E.2d 1372; <em>Bernbaum v. Silverstein </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 445, 16 O.O.3d 461, 406 N.E.2d 532.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">We find that the instant case presents such a dilemma, and that the scales tip in favor of an immediate review. If we were to dismiss this case and allow the trial court\u2019s order to stand, appellant would be compelled to execute an authorization waiving her indisputable privilege, thereby forcing her to disclose statutorily protected communications spoken in confidence and trust. No later appeal could correct the harm caused by the fruition of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">Consequently, the order at issue is found to constitute a \u201cfinal order\u201d pursuant to R.C. 2505.02 since it affects a substantial right, and was made in a special proceeding. Accordingly, this court possesses subject matter jurisdiction and plaintiff-appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">We now turn to defendant-appellant\u2019s assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-12\">IV. Assignment of Error Re Discovery Order</p>\n<p id=\"b236-13\">In a single assignment of error, appellant contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>\u201cThe trial court erred in ordering the defendant-appellant to sign an authorization releasing her medical records where such matter is confidential, not subject to discovery procedures, and not required under Section 3109.-04(B).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">It is defendant-appellant\u2019s position that the subject communications are privileged and therefore not subject to discovery even if they are relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">As discussed in our ruling on plaintiff-appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss, communications between a social worker and her client are unquestionably privileged. R.C. 2317.02(G). Plaintiff-appellee asserts in his brief, however, that since the subject of the communications is relevant to the motion for modification of custody based on defendant-appellant\u2019s alleged mental imbalance, the communications are therefore discoverable. We disagree with appellee and find appellant\u2019s assignment of error well-taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">V. The Discovery Rule</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">Civ.R. 26(B)(1) defines the scope of discovery:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-9\">\u201cParties may obtain discovery regarding any matter, <em>not privileged, </em>which is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action * * (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">Thus, it is clear that privileged matter is not rendered discoverable merely because it is relevant. Absent waiver, privileged matter is without the scope of permissible discovery. The record reveals that defendant-appellant has not waived her statutory social worker-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">Accordingly, the trial court erred in compelling appellant to execute authorization for the release of her privileged communications.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-12\">The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-13\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b237-14\">Dyke and Francis E. Sweeney, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
