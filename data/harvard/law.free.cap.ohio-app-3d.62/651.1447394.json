On that date, at roll call and during weapons\u2019 inspection, appellant\u2019s weapon accidentally discharged. The bullet struck appellant\u2019s commanding officer, Lieutenant Kevin Wendt.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-11\">Later that day, appellant experienced an adverse emotional reaction to the incident and sought treatment at Toledo\u2019s Mercy Hospital. In August 1986, appellant requested a medical leave of absence from the police department for \u201cpost traumatic stress disorder.\u201d Appellant filed a claim for Ohio workers\u2019 compensation which was administratively denied. This decision was appealed to the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas. In an opinion and judgment entry dated May 5, 1988, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the city of Toledo. A <em>nunc pro tunc </em>judgment entered November 8, 1988 reaffirmed the summary judgment and dismissed the city of Toledo and defendant-appellee James Mayfield, Administrator of the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-12\">Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal from the May 5, 1988 decision and has set forth the following two assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-13\">\u201cI. The court of common pleas erred when it decided that amended Section 4123.01(C)(1) of the Ohio Revised Code was controlling on this issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-14\">\u201cII. The court of common pleas erred by granting summary judgment thereby concluding that psychiatric injuries incurred in the course of and arising out of employment are not compensable as a matter of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>In order to facilitate a clearer understanding of this appeal, appellant\u2019s assignments of error will be discussed simultaneously.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">At the time the incident occurred, September 1983, the statutory definition of a compensable \u201cinjury\u201d was specified in R.C. 4123.01(C).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-6\">\u201c(C) \u2018Injury\u2019 includes any injury, whether caused by external accidental means or accidental in character and result, received in the course of, and arising out of, the injured employee\u2019s employment.\u201d R.C. 4123.01(C), effective January 1, 1979.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">Effective August 22, 1986, the statute was amended to provide, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-8\">\u201c(C) \u2018Injury\u2019 includes any injury, whether caused by external accidental means or accidental in character and result, received in the course of, and arising out of, the injured employee\u2019s employment. \u2018Injury\u2019 does not include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-9\">\u201c(1) Psychiatric conditions except where the conditions have arisen from an injury or occupational disease;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-10\"><em>(( </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-11\">In its May 5, 1988 judgment entry, the trial court stated that R.C. 4123.-01(C)(1) was \u201ccontrolling\u201d and found that most psychiatric conditions were expressly excluded from the definition of a \u201ccompensable injury.\u201d Our analysis of existing case law on this subject indicates that the trial court relied upon an inappropriate version of the statute; however, we do not find the overall result reached by the court to be improper under the facts and circumstances of the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b685-12\">The Supreme Court of Ohio recently reaffirmed that a worker\u2019s substantive right to compensation is measured by the statute in force on the date of the injury. <em>State, ex rel. Kirk, v. Owens-Illinois, Inc. </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 360, 25 OBR 411, 496 N.E.2d 893. Appellant\u2019s psychiatric condition allegedly stems directly from an incident which occurred in 1983; accordingly, the former version of R.C. 4123.01(C), <em>i.e., minus </em>the express exclusion of psychiatric conditions, should have been utilized by the trial court. Despite this apparent misapplication of the statute, we find that the judgment was correct and, analyzing former R.C. 4123.01(C), affirm the grant of summary judgment by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-13\">\u201cBy repeated decisions of this court it is the definitely established law of this state that where the judgment is correct, a reviewing court is not authorized to reverse such judgment merely because erroneous reasons were assigned as the basis thereof.\u201d <em>Agricultural Ins. Co. v. Constantine </em>(1944), 144 Ohio St. 275, 284, 29 O.O. 426, 430, 58 N.E.2d 658, 663. See, also, <em>Wampler v. Bolen </em>(1938), 28 Ohio Law Abs. 22, paragraph five of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>syllabus; <em>Newcomb v. Dredge </em>(1957), 105 Ohio App. 417, 6 O.O.2d 178, 152 N.E.2d 801, paragraph seven of the syllabus; and <em>Hallworth v. Republic Steel Corp. </em>(1950), 153 Ohio St. 349, 41 O.O. 341, 91 N.E.2d 690, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Initially, we note that on a motion for summary judgment, the moving party has the burden of showing that no genuine issue exists as to any material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 66, 8 O.O.3d 73, 74, 375 N.E.2d 46, 47. Appellees, in their motion for summary judgment, had the burden of establishing that appellant had not submitted, or could not submit, sufficient evidence to prevail at trial. At all times prior to the entry of summary judgment, the burden was on appellant to submit sufficient evidence to overcome the inference that her claim for workers\u2019 compensation should not be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">In her second assignment of error, appellant argues that psychiatric conditions are included within the definition of \u201cinjury\u201d set forth in R.C. 4123.01(C). Appellant asserts that there is no statutory distinction between physical and emotional injuries. Appellant also repeatedly reminds the court that Ohio\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation laws are to be liberally construed in favor of the employee. R.C. 4123.95.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">Appellant\u2019s claim is based solely on a psychiatric disorder. She did not suffer a physical injury or an occupational disease prior to her psychological difficulties. Further, appellant has not claimed that a physical disability has occurred as a result of her psychological condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">In <em>Ryan v. Connor </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 406, 28 OBR 406, 503 N.E.2d 1379, the Supreme Court of Ohio held that a physical injury caused by mental or emotional stress, arising out of employment, was compensable under R.C. 4123.01(C). As a matter of clarification, the <em>Ryan </em>court was compensating a <em>physical </em>injury, not authorizing claims based solely on mental disorders. Accordingly, \u201c * * * <em>Ryan, supra, </em>did not remove the need for there to be a physical injury in order to receive compensation under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.\u201d <em>Mettes v. Transamerica Ins. Corp. </em>(1987), 36 Ohio App.3d 180, 181, 521 N.E.2d 1138, 1139. Our analysis of existing case law indicates that a mental condition caused solely by mental or emotional stress has never been a compensable injury under R.C. 4123.01(C). We also note, however, that the Supreme Court of Ohio has yet to hold that \u201c * * * emotional stress, mental strain, or psychiatric condition, standing alone, is <em>not </em>an injury within the meaning of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Currier v. Roadway Express, Inc. </em>(June 24, 1987), Ashland App. No. CA-879, unreported, 1987 WL 14055.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>Accordingly, we find that it was correct to grant summary judgment in favor of appellees. The alleged disability is a mental condition or disorder caused exclusively by emotional and/or mental stress and is, therefore, not compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">In the final portion of her second assignment of error, appellant asserts that the exclusion of psychiatric conditions from R.C. 4123.01(C) is a denial of equal protection. Appellant asserts that there is no rational basis upon which to distinguish classes of employees whose injuries are psychiatric or physical when those injuries are all received during the course of employment. Appellant argues that the Ohio Legislature did not limit the classes of employees who could be compensated and states that any judicially imposed limits are arbitrary and without a rational basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Appellees have not addressed the merits of appellant\u2019s constitutional argument. Asserting that appellant is automatically precluded from raising this issue for the first time on appeal, appellees emphasize that the equal protection claim was not evaluated by the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">In general, we agree with appellees\u2019 assertion that an issue raised for the first time on appeal is not properly before the reviewing court. See, <em>e.g., Blausey v. Stein </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 264, 266, 15 O.O.3d 268, 269, 400 N.E.2d 408, 410. The case <em>sub judice </em>is slightly different, however, in that appellant is now challenging the <em>constitutionality </em>of a statute. In evaluating a case wherein the appellate court <em>sua sponte </em>raised a constitutional question, the Supreme Court of Ohio stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-8\">\u201c * * * the question of the constitutionality of a statute must <em>generally </em>be raised at the first opportunity and, in a criminal prosecution, this means in the trial court.\u201d (Citation omitted and emphasis added.) <em>State v. 1981 Dodge Ram Van </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 168, 170, 522 N.E.2d 524, 526.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">Construing the court\u2019s use of \u201cgenerally\u201d in the section quoted above, we look to <em>State v. Awan </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 120, 22 OBR 199, 489 N.E.2d 277, and Justice Douglas\u2019 concurring opinion in <em>1981 Dodge Ram Van, supra. </em>In <em>Awan, </em>the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-10\">\u201cFailure to raise at the trial court level the issue of the constitutionality of a statute or its application, which issue is apparent at the time of trial, constitutes a waiver of such issue and a deviation from this state\u2019s orderly procedure, and therefore need not be heard for the first time on appeal.\u201d <em>Awan, supra, </em>syllabus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-11\">Broadly construing <em>Awan, </em>Justice Douglas stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>\u201cA statute which is, in any respect, unconstitutional cannot be effective to accomplish its purpose no matter when the constitutional infirmity is raised or determined. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-5\">\u201c * * * The syllabus in <em>Awan </em>says that constitutional issues not raised at the trial court level \u2018 * * * <em>need not </em>be heard for the first time on appeal.\u2019 (Emphasis added.) The case does not and should not be read to say that a court sitting in an appellate capacity <em>may not </em>hear a constitutional issue raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>1981 Dodge Ram Van, supra, </em>36 Ohio St.3d at 171-172, 522 N.E.2d at 527-528 (Douglas, J. concurring).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">Under the facts presented, we hold that appellant did not <em>automatically </em>waive her equal protection claim by failing to raise it in the court below. However, we find that any constitutionally based challenge was \u201capparent at the time of trial\u201d and, therefore, a failure to raise the issue below precludes this court from evaluating it for the first time. It is obvious from the facts presented that appellant\u2019s psychologically based claim for compensation would be allowed or rejected based upon a finding of similarities or differences between it and a physical injury. Appellant was always aware of the foundation for her compensation claim. Accordingly, we find that any equal protection issue was apparent at the time of trial and should have been raised at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">For the aforestated reasons, we find appellant\u2019s second assignment of error not well taken. Due to the disposition of the second assignment of error, we find that appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is moot and, therefore, not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">On consideration whereof, the court finds substantial justice has been done the party complaining, and judgment of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed. It is ordered that appellant pay court costs of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b688-10\">Handwork, P.J., Connors and Glasser, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
