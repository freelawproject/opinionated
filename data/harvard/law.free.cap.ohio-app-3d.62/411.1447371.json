He complains he was convicted with insufficient evidence and his motion to dismiss the indictment was erroneously overruled. Since we agree that appellant was convicted with insufficient evidence, we are reversing the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">On November 17, 1986, a residence on Svec Road was burglarized. The basement window was broken and a stereo and radio were unplugged but not removed. A neighbor who saw two black men approaching the house called the police. The police saw two black men running from the house but were able to capture only one, Donnell Hill. Hill told the police appellant was with him and had driven the car, which appellant owned. The police went to appellant\u2019s residence but received no response. Appellant was arrested in \u25a0March 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-11\">At trial to the court, Donnell Hill, who had already pled guilty to aggravated burglary and had been sentenced, gave testimony contrary to his statement to the police. Hill testified he borrowed appellant\u2019s car but said appellant was not with him when he committed the burglary. Neither the neighbor nor the police could identify appellant. Appellant filed a notice of alibi but did not put on any evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-12\">The court found appellant guilty and sentenced him accordingly. Appellant timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">Appellant\u2019s first assigned error is that:</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">\u201cThe trial court committed reversible error in overruling the defendant\u2019s motion for acquital <em>[sic </em>] as the evidence presented by the state was insufficient to sustain the defendant\u2019s conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Appellant was convicted of burglary and possession of criminal tools. These crimes were shown to have occurred, the sole issue being whether the defendant was involved. Hill\u2019s statement to the police identified appellant as the driver of the car. However, this statement could not be used as substantive evidence against appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">The Supreme Court of Ohio has held that:</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">\u201cWhen taken by surprise by the adverse testimony of its own witness, an accomplice of the accused, the state may interrogate such witness concerning his prior inconsistent sworn statement, made in or out of the presence of the accused, for the purpose of refreshing the recollection of the witness, but not for the purpose of offering substantive evidence against the accused.\u201d <em>State v. Duffy </em>(1938), 134 Ohio St. 16, 17, 11 O.O. 383, 383, 15 N.E.2d 535, 536, paragraph two of the syllabus; see <em>State v. Diehl </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 389, 391, 21 O.O.3d 244, 246, 423 N.E.2d 1112, 1114; <em>State v. Wright </em>(1967), 11 Ohio App.2d 31, 40 O.O.2d 78, 227 N.E.2d 650.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">This holding was reaffirmed in <em>State v. Dick </em>(1971), 27 Ohio St.2d 162, 56 O.O.2d 101, 271 N.E.2d 797, paragraph one of the syllabus, where the Ohio Supreme Court stated that \u201c[a]n extra-judicial, unsworn, signed statement of a witness which has been denied by the declarant under oath is not admissible as proof of the allegations contained therein.\u201d In <em>Dick, </em>the court reviewed the views adopted by commentators on evidence. Professor McCormick promoted the view that a witness\u2019 previous inconsistent statement should not be evidence of the facts stated because it is hearsay and because the declarant was not under oath or subject to cross-examination when the prior statement was made. <em>Id. </em>at 164, 56 O.O.2d at 102, 271 N.E.2d at 799. Professor Wigmore would permit the prior self-contradiction to be used as substantive evidence because the dangers of hearsay are alleviated when a witness testifies. <em>Id. </em>at 164-165, 56 O.O.2d at 102-103, 271 N.E.2d at 799. The Supreme Court of Ohio adopted McCormick\u2019s view and stated in <em>Dick </em>that \u201c[t]he fact that [Dick] did not have the opportunity to cross-examine [the declarant] when the statement was made, nor during the second trial, is sufficient in itself to avoid any consideration of Wigmore\u2019s position.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 165, 56 O.O.2d at 103, 271 N.E.2d at 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>State jurisdictions are split on this issue, although a growing number of states are adopting Wigmore\u2019s position and are permitting prior inconsistent statements to be used as proof of the matters asserted in the statements. Annotation, Use or Admissibility of Prior Inconsistent Statements of Witness as Substantive Evidence of Facts to Which They Relate in Criminal Case\u2014 Modern State Cases (1984), 30 A.L.R.4th 414. Whether or not a trend is developing toward the adoption of Wigmore\u2019s position or whether or not this court believes Wigmore\u2019s position to be the better view is irrelevant to our disposition of this matter. We are bound by the previous decisions of the Supreme Court of Ohio which have rejected the use of prior inconsistent statements as substantive evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">The only competent evidence connecting appellant to these crimes is appellant\u2019s ownership of the automobile found near the burglarized residence. This evidence is insufficient to sustain appellant\u2019s convictions. Moreover, Hill testified that he had borrowed appellant\u2019s car in the past and that he borrowed it the day of the offense. The evidence of appellant\u2019s ownership of the car was consistent therefore with a reasonable theory of innocence and not consistent only with appellant\u2019s guilt. Accordingly, this assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">Appellant\u2019s second assigned error is that:</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">\u201cThe trail [sic] court committed reveisible [sic] error in overruling the defendant\u2019s motion to have the indictment against him dismissed with prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">The first indictment of appellant contained an incorrect aggravated felony specification. The state reindicted appellant on June 1, 1987, with the correct aggravated felony specification, and on August 26, 1987, moved to dismiss the first indictment. The court granted the state\u2019s motion over appellant\u2019s objection. Appellant now contends he was prejudiced by the second indictment because he had insufficient notice of the charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">The reindictment of appellant, which was more in the nature of an amendment to the original indictment, did not prejudice appellant in the defense of his case. The state merely added a penalty enhancer to the indictment for purposes of sentencing. The enhancer did not change the name or identity of the crimes charged and was not an essential element of the charged offenses. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>See <em>State v. Allen </em>(1987), 29 Ohio St.3d 53, 29 OBR 436, 506 N.E.2d 199. Accordingly, this assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Appellant\u2019s remaining assigned errors are that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-6\">\u201cIII. The trail [sic] court\u2019s judgment is contrary judgment is contrary [sic] to law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-7\">\u201cIV. The trail [sic] court\u2019s judgment is contrary to the weight of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-8\">\u201cV. For other errors manifest upon the foce [sic] of the record and prejudicial to the rights of the defendant/appellant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">Because these assigned errors have not been argued in appellant\u2019s brief, they are being disregarded pursuant to App.R. 12(A). See <em>Hawley v. Ritley </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 157, 519 N.E.2d 390; <em>State v. Rivers </em>(1977), 50 Ohio App.2d 129, 4 O.O.3d 100, 361 N.E.2d 1363. These assignments are overruled therefore for lack of briefing.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">The judgment of the trial court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b447-12\">Markus, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b447-13\">Krupansky, P.J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b447-14\">Krupansky, Presiding Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AMk\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-15\">I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s opinion. The relevant facts of the case <em>sub judice </em>follow: On November 17, 1986, a neighbor witnessed two black males exit a grey 1977 Plymouth Volare and walk by the side of the victim\u2019s house. The witness then called the Cleveland Police. Upon arriving at the scene, officers witnessed two black males running in the backyard of the victim\u2019s house. Donnell Hill became caught on a fence and was apprehended, but the other suspect negotiated the fence and escaped.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-16\">After being advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, Hill made several inculpatory statements. Hill also told the officers defendant Ralph Townsend was with him and that Townsend owned the 1977 Plymouth. However, at defendant Townsend\u2019s trial, Hill, who had previously pled guilty to aggravated burglary, testified defendant was not with him at the time of the burglary and that, he, Hill borrowed defendant\u2019s automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>In <em>State v. Dick </em>(1971), 27 Ohio St.2d 162, 164, 56 O.O.2d 101, 102, 271 N.E.2d 797, 799, the Ohio Supreme Court accepted the view of Professor McCormick that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-5\">\u201c[A] previous statement of the witness, though admissible to impeach, is not evidence of the facts stated. * * * When used for that purpose, the statement is hearsay. Its value rests on the credit of the declarant, who was not under oath nor subject to cross-examination, when the statement was made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">The <em>Dick </em>court also noted the contrary view of Professor Wigmore, which states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-7\">\u201cIt does not follow, however, that prior self-contradictions, when admitted, are to be treated as having no <em>affirmative testimonial </em>value, and that any such credit is to be strictly denied them in the mind of the tribunal. The only ground for doing so would be the hearsay rule. But the theory of the hearsay rule is that an extrajudicial statement is rejected because it was made out of court by an absent person not subject to cross-examination. * * * Here, however, by hypothesis the witness is present and subject to cross-examination. There is ample opportunity to test him as to the basis for his former statement. The whole purpose of the hearsay rule has been already satisfied. Hence there is nothing to prevent the tribunal from giving such testimonial credit to the extrajudicial statement as it may seem to deserve.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Dick, supra </em>at 164-165, 56 O.O.2d at 102-103, 271 N.E.2d at 799.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Donnell Hill\u2019s prior unsworn statement to police officers should have been admissible evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt. Since Hill testified at trial, he was available for cross-examination. Professor Wig-more\u2019s view of prior inconsistent statements is superior to that of Professor McCormick\u2019s as accepted in <em>Dick, supra. </em>Since it is not unheard of for the Supreme Court to reverse its prior decisions, I respectfully dissent and urge the adoption of Professor Wigmore\u2019s view on the issue of prior inconsistent statements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
