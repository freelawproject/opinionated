In his complaint, appellee states the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-11\"><em>\u201c1. </em>Plaintiff brings this action under R.C. Chapter 3111 in an order <em>[sic </em>] to establish the parent and child relationship, if any, existing between Plaintiff and Defendant, Rodney Kimmel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-12\"><em>u </em>* * \u00ab</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-13\">\u201c3. Plaintiff brings this action upon the belief that he is the natural father of Defendant, Rodney Kimmel, by virtue of his having engaged in sexual intercourse with Defendant, Martha Kimmel, at or near the time of the conception of Defendant, Rodney Kimmel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-14\">\u201c4. Plaintiff avers that absent a genetic test as provided in R.C. \u00a7 3111.09, the existence of a parent and child relationship between Plaintiff and Defendant, Rodney Kimmel, cannot be alleged with any greater exactitude other than hereinabove set forth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b808-15\">In her answer, appellant stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-16\">\u201c3. Deny the allegations contained in Paragraph 3 and 4 of Plaintiff\u2019s Complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-17\"><em>U </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-18\">\u201cCounterclaim</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-19\">&lt;&lt; * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-20\">\u201c2. That Plaintiff, Daniel McCarty, is the natural father of said Rodney Kimmel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b808-21\">Appellee filed no reply to the counterclaim of appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>Appellee commenced a prior paternity action on May 6, 1985, (see case No. JC 85 1940), wherein he \u201cstates that he is the natural father\u201d of Rodney Kimmel. Appellant filed an answer wherein she admitted that appellee was the father of her child. However, this case was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice by appellee pursuant to Civ.R. 41(A)(1)(a) on October 23, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">On April 8, 1988, the trial court granted appellee\u2019s request for genetic testing. On April 15, 1988, appellant moved for reconsideration, which was denied by the trial court on June 13, 1988. On that date, the trial court affirmed its decision mandating genetic testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">In its decision and entry of August 5, 1988, the trial court found that although appellee had arranged for genetic testing to take place on July 19, 1988, appellant refused to comply with the court-ordered testing. Consequently, the trial court found appellant in contempt and sentenced her to ten days in the Montgomery County Jail. Execution of appellant\u2019s sentence was stayed pending this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-8\">\u201cThe trial court erred in finding appellant in contempt for refusal to comply with the court\u2019s order where the court was without authority to issue such order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">It is well-settled that \u201c[a]n order issued by a court with jurisdiction must be obeyed until it is reversed by orderly and proper proceedings.\u201d <em>Hamilton City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Hamilton Classroom Teachers Assn. </em>(1982), 5 Ohio App.3d 51, 53, 5 OBR 146, 149, 449 N.E.2d 26, 29. Thus, at first glance it would appear that appellant should have appealed the underlying order regarding genetic testing and that because she did not, we are precluded from reviewing the contempt citation. However, this is not the case, and we find that we may review the underlying order as well as the contempt citation.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-10\">Both the Constitution and legislation of this state permit this court to review only \u201cfinal\u201d orders and judgments. See Section 3(B)(2), Article IV, Ohio Constitution and R.C. 2505.03. A \u201cfinal order\u201d is defined by R.C. 2505.02, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-11\">\u201cAn order affecting a substantial right in an action which in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment, an order affecting a substantial right made in a special proceeding or upon a summary application in an action after judgment, or an order vacating or setting aside a judgment and ordering a new trial is a final order which may be reviewed, affirmed, modified, or reversed, with or without retrial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>As stated in <em>Lantsberry v. Tilley Lamp Co. </em>(1971), 27 Ohio St.2d 303, 306, 56 O.O.2d 179, 180, 272 N.E.2d 127, 129: <em>\u201cA </em>final order, therefore, is one disposing of the whole case or some separate and distinct branch thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">This case does not involve a \u201cspecial proceeding,\u201d a \u201csummary application * * * after judgment\u201d or an order \u201cvacating * * * a judgment and ordering a new trial.\u201d Only the first portion of R.C. 2505.02 is applicable here. In view of that fact, we find that the court order mandating genetic testing was not a final appealable order because it was not determinative of the paternity action. Therefore, appellant could not have appealed the order for genetic testing prior to the present time.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">The case of <em>Smith v. Chester Twp. Bd. of Trustees </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St.2d 13, 14 O.O.3d 162, 396 N.E.2d 743, establishes our ability to review the underlying order regarding genetic testing. In the <em>Smith </em>syllabus, the Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-7\">\u201cWhere a non-appealable interlocutory order results in a judgment of contempt, including fine or imprisonment, such a judgment is a final and appealable order and presents to the appellate court for review the propriety of the interlocutory order which is the underlying basis for the contempt adjudication.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">Upon review of the genetic testing order, we hold that contrary to appellant\u2019s assertion, the trial court was not without authority to issue such order. Appellant argues that in his complaint filed May 6, 1985 in case No. JC 85 1940, appellee unequivocally stated that he was the father of Rodney Kimmel and that in her answer, appellant admitted his paternity. However, we find that case No. JC 85 1940 has limited relevance to the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-9\">This court, in <em>Crawford v. Bohannon </em>(1959), 110 Ohio App. 71, 75, 12 O.O.2d 248, 250, 168 N.E.2d 431, 435, discussed the relevance of an \u201cabandoned or superseded pleading\u201d and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-10\">\u201c[W]e recognize that an abandoned or superseded pleading no longer functions as such; the issues are to be found in the amended pleading. However, in the trial of the case, a party cannot escape completely from the content of abandoned pleadings. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-11\"><em>it </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-12\">\u201c[T]he [party] verified each pleading and is chargeable with knowledge of <em>any </em>inconsistencies therein.\u201d See, also, <em>Gest v. Piketon Lanes </em>(1965), 5 Ohio App.2d 1, 34 O.O.2d 16, 212 N.E.2d 922.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-13\">The statements made in appellee\u2019s initial complaint cannot be considered judicial admissions in the case at bar because his pleading is no longer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>functional. We must look to the instant complaint in order to analyze appellant\u2019s contention that appellee\u2019s paternity is an admitted fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">In his complaint, appellee seeks to \u201cestablish the parent and child relationship, <em>if any\u201d </em>between himself and Rodney Kimmel. (Emphasis added.) (Complaint Paragraph 1.) He brings the action \u201cupon the <em>belief </em>that he is the natural father\u201d of Rodney Kimmel. (Emphasis added.)\u2019 (Complaint Paragraph 3.) In her answer, appellant \u201cadmits\u201d the allegations in Paragraph 1 of the complaint. It appears to us that appellant has thereby merely admitted that appellee is seeking to establish the parent and child relationship, if any exists, between appellee and Rodney Kimmel.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">Appellant asserts in her counterclaim that appellee is the natural father of Rodney Kimmel. We find that this is the only unequivocal statement regarding paternity contained in the pleadings. Appellee never filed a reply admitting this allegation and we cannot assume such an admission without proof. Therefore, we hold that the issue of paternity is, in fact, contested and that the trial court possessed authority, pursuant to R.C. 3111.08, to \u201corder genetic tests to be taken in accordance with section 3111.09 of the Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">Appellant argues that our view of the instant facts would permit \u201cpersons who have no relationship to a child to file actions under Chapter 3111 and force the mother and child to undergo blood tests. * * * \u201d (Appellant\u2019s Brief, at 8.) This argument is unconvincing. We find it unlikely that a \u201cstranger\u201d would desire to shoulder the obligation of support payments which are likely to follow the paternity action or to exercise visitation or custody rights with an unrelated child. Furthermore, we trust that the court would exercise appropriate sanctions if it found that a party had intentionally abused the genetic-testing process.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">For the reasons stated above, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-10\">\u201cThe trial court erred in finding appellant in contempt for refusal to comply with the court\u2019s order where the order violates appellant\u2019s right to privacy under the First, Third, Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Amendments, as applied through the Fourteenth Amendment, to the United States Constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-11\">In her brief, appellant concedes that \u201cin the ordinary paternity case, there is a compelling state interest in resolving disputes regarding paternity by using genetic testing.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Brief, at 11.) Appellant then argues that this is not an ordinary paternity case because appellee has admitted paternity and appellant has acknowledged it. Our discussion of appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>first assignment of error, <em>supra, </em>indicates our disagreement with this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">We find that even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the court-ordered withdrawal of blood is an invasion of appellant\u2019s fundamental right to privacy, the state has a compelling interest which is paramount. See <em>Leach v. Akron General Med. Ctr. </em>(1980), 68 Ohio Misc. 1, 9, 22 O.O.3d 49, 54, 426 N.E.2d 809, 814, stating: \u201cThe Constitutional right to privacy is paramount to a state interest unless that interest can be demonstrated to be compelling or outweighs the individual\u2019s Constitutional right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">Although research has revealed no Ohio case law directly on point, the Washington case of <em>State v. Meacham </em>(1980), 93 Wash.2d 735, 612 P.2d 795, is analogous to the case at bar. Therein, the state brought two actions, consolidated on appeal, against the putative fathers of two children. Pursuant to the Washington state version of the Uniform Parentage Act, (akin to R.C. Chapter 3111), the state requested and the court ordered each man to submit to blood testing. The alleged fathers objected to the testing, <em>inter alia, </em>on the grounds that \u201cthe blood test would violate [their] constitutional rights to personal privacy.\u201d <em>Meacham, </em>93 Wash.2d at 736, 612 P.2d at 797. The <em>Meacham </em>court stated at 737, 740, 612 P.2d at 797, 799:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-6\">\u201cThe constitutional objections raised in these cases, right of privacy ... [does] not preclude the trial court from ordering the withdrawal of a small amount of blood from the alleged fathers for testing. The intrusion by the state is minimal in each instance and the State\u2019s interest in accurately determining the parentage of the children is compelling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-7\"><em>(( </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-8\">\u201cThe right to privacy, to be let alone, while fundamental and personal in nature, is not absolute. The state may reasonably regulate this right to safeguard society or where it otherwise has a compelling interest. <em>Whalen v. Roe, </em>429 U.S. 589, 97 S.Ct. 869, 51 L.Ed.2d 64 (1977).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-9\">\u201cHere, the State has a compelling interest in fixing the parentage of a minor child. The test specified to be used is highly reliable. No other evidence that is at all comparable in effectiveness is available to the State. The pain inflicted when blood is withdrawn by an experienced technician is inconsequential. And, any hazard to health is virtually nonexistent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-10\"><em>a </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-11\">\u201cHere, the rights of the children concerned are also of constitutional magnitude. In <em>Gomez v. Perez, </em>409 U.S. 535, 538, 93 S.Ct. 872, 875, 35 L.Ed.2d 56 (1973), the Supreme Court held:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>\u201c[O]nce a State posits a judicially enforceable right on behalf of children to needed support from their natural fathers there is no constitutionally sufficient justification for denying such an essential right to a child simply because its natural father has not married its mother.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">We hold, as did the <em>Meacham </em>court, that \u201cthe requirement to submit to the withdrawal of blood is not susceptible to a right of privacy challenge.\u201d <em>Meacham, </em>93 Wash.2d at 738, 612 P.2d at 798. Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">Finally, we address what appears to be an assignment of error on cross-appeal by appellee which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-6\">\u201cThis court has no jurisdiction to hear this appeal as it is from an interlocutory order and the decision of August 5, 1988 is not a final appealable order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">It is clear that an order of contempt is final and appealable once the trial court makes a finding of contempt and imposes a sanction or penalty. See <em>Chain Bike Corp. v. Spoke \u2018N Wheel, Inc. </em>(1979), 64 Ohio App.2d 62, 18 O.O.3d 43, 410 N.E.2d 802. Appellee\u2019s assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">In accordance with this opinion, the decision of the trial court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b813-10\">Wolff, P.J., and Grady, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
