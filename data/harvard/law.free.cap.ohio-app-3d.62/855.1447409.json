Schafer filed suit seeking to recover compensatory and punitive damages for a second set of five airplane tickets appellant was required to purchase when appellant and his family missed an earlier flight for which he had previously purchased tickets in the amount of $508. After suit was filed, appellant was contacted by a representative of Continental Airlines, Inc., appellee, to discuss the possibility of a settlement. Following the telephone conversation between appellant and Vincent Nguyen, a law clerk employed by appellee, appellee did not file an answer and appellant obtained a judgment by default in the amount of $1,306.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">Appellee filed a motion for relief from judgment, pursuant to Civ.R. 60(B)(1), (3) and (5), and attached an affidavit from Nguyen. Appellant filed a response supported by his own affidavit. The trial court granted appellee\u2019s motion without conducting an evidentiary hearing and appellant appeals setting forth the following assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-6\">\u201cThe trial court erred and abused its discretion in granting defendant\u2019s motion for relief from judgment as indicated on its second amended \u2018half sheet\u2019 entry dated November 29, 1988 decision as recorded on the \u2018half sheet\u2019 of the court file.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">The issue herein is not as appellant argues, whether a settlement agreement existed and what the terms of that settlement agreement were, but whether appellee had a good faith belief that the matter had been resolved and should be relieved from judgment on the basis of excusable neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">The affidavits filed in support of and in opposition to the motion for relief from judgment set forth conflicting facts. The affidavit of Nguyen states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-9\">\u201c5. I offered to him that Continental would refund the amount of the extra tickets he had to purchase, upon receipt from him of a doctor\u2019s bill that verified his son had been injured in Arizona on this trip.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-10\">\u201c6. Mr. Schafer indicated that my offer was acceptable and that he would try to find the information and send it to me for my review.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-11\">\u201c7. Mr. Schafer also indicated to me that he would not proceed with his lawsuit pending my receipt and review of the doctor\u2019s bill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-12\"><em>(( </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-13\">\u201c9. Therefore, Continental did not prepare and file an answer to Mr. Schafer\u2019s complaint, based upon Continental\u2019s good faith understanding that an agreement had been reached to resolve this matter, subject to Mr. Schafer\u2019s provision to Continental of the document to verify his claim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b889-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>However, the affidavit of Schafer states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-5\">\u201cMr. Nguyen made a conditional offer to me which I did not accept in any way, shape or form. Mr. Nguyen\u2019s statement in Paragraph 7 of his affidavit, \u2018Mr. Schafer also indicated to me that he would not proceed with his lawsuit pending my receipt and review of the doctor\u2019s bill\u2019 is an outright fabrication.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9l\">In <em>U.A.P. Columbus JV326132 v. Plum </em>(1986), 27 Ohio App.3d 293, 294-295, 27 OBR 338, 339, 500 N.E.2d 924, 926, this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-6\">\u201cThe trial court has discretion whether to hold a hearing before ruling on the motion. Where grounds for relief from judgment appear on the face of the record, a court may grant the motion without a hearing. <em>Matson v. Marks </em>(1972), 32 Ohio App.2d 319 [61 O.O.2d 476, 291 N.E.2d 491], paragraph five of the syllabus; <em>Doddridge v. Fitzpatrick </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 9 [7 O.O.3d 5, 371 N.E.2d 214], syllabus. However, where grounds for relief from judgment appear on the face of the record, a court abuses its discretion and may not overrule the motion unless it first makes a factual determination of the alleged grounds for relief adverse to the movant. <em>Matson v. Marks, supra, </em>paragraph six of the syllabus. In other words, if movant\u2019s Civ.R. 60(B) motion contains allegations of operative facts warranting relief, the trial court should grant a hearing to take evidence and either discredit or verify these facts before ruling. <em>Coulson v. Coulson </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 12, 16 [5 OBR 73, 76, 448 N.E.2d 809, 812]; <em>Twinsburg Banking Co. v. RHEA Constr. Co. </em>(1983), 9 Ohio App.3d 39 [9 OBR 41, 458 N.E.2d 440], syllabus; <em>Adomeit v. Baltimore </em>(1974), 39 Ohio App.2d 97 [68 O.O.2d 251, 316 N.E.2d 469], paragraph four of the syllabus; see, also, <em>Advance Mortgage Corp. v. Novak </em>(1977), 53 Ohio App.2d 289 [7 O.O.3d 338, 373 N.E.2d 400], paragraph two of the syllabus.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">While the facts alleged in appellee\u2019s affidavit could be the basis for a finding of excusable neglect, the trial court abused its discretion in granting appellee\u2019s motion without holding an evidentiary hearing to resolve the issue as to whether appellee had a good-faith belief a settlement had been reached in view of appellant\u2019s adamant assertion that the offer was never accepted. Such a decision requires a determination as to the credibility of the affiants, which cannot be made from the face of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">For the foregoing reasons, appellant\u2019s assignment of error is sustained and the judgment of the trial court is reversed and this matter is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and case remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b889-10\">Whiteside and Ammer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b890-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>William Ammer, J., of the Pickaway County Court of Common Pleas, sitting by assignment.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
