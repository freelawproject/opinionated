Bryant, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b259-11\">Relator has filed an original action in mandamus in this court pursuant to R.C. 149.43(C) (action in mandamus to obtain public records). Relator has requested that respondents provide him with a variety of public records relating to his arrest and conviction for rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-12\">Respondents admit that the records requested are disclosable under R.C. 149.43. Respondents do, however, argue that, because relator is unable to pay for the cost of copying the records, he is not entitled to the writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-13\">Respondents are correct to the extent they argue that nothing in R.C. 149.43 explicitly requires them to provide documents free of charge. R.C. 149.43(B) states, in part, \u201c[u]pon request, a person responsible for public records shall make copies available <em>at cost </em>* * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.) However, in his reply brief, relator asserts that he never said he was unwilling to pay. Relator contends he suggested that the city of Whitehall absorb the cost of copying only as \u201can afterthought\u201d because the imposition of copying costs would serve \u201cas a sanction.\u201d Given that relator is willing to pay for copying, we conclude that respondents present no valid objection to relator\u2019s obtaining the documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-14\">Relator has also requested an award of attorney fees in his brief (although relator\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus does not mention attorney fees). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>a mandamus action under R.C. 149.43(C), a court may award \u201c * * * reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to the person that instituted the mandamus action. * * * \u201d In this case, since plaintiff is litigating <em>pro se, </em>an issue arises whether a person not represented by an attorney may obtain an award of attorney fees under R.C. 149.43. Cases interpreting the Freedom of Information Act, the federal analogue to Ohio\u2019s public records law, are divided on the issue. See, generally, Annotation, Pro Se Litigant as Entitled to Award of Attorneys\u2019 Fees for Value of His Own Services Rendered in Lawsuit Under Freedom of Information Act (5 USCS \u00a7 552) (1982), 56 A.L.R. Fed. 573.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">However, we need not address the question of whether <em>pro se </em>litigants in general may recover attorney fees under R.C. 149.43(C) because relator is not entitled to attorney fees for reasons other than his <em>pro se </em>status. An award of attorney fees under R.C. 149.43(C) is not mandatory; rather, the award is within the discretion of the court. <em>State, ex rel. Beacon Journal Publishing Co., v. Akron Metro. Hous. Auth. </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 1, 2, 535 N.E.2d 1366, 1367; <em>State, ex rel. Fox, v. Cuyahoga Cty. Hosp. System </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 108, 529 N.E.2d 443, paragraph two of the syllabus. When exercising its discretion in deciding whether to award attorney fees, a court may consider the reasonableness of a respondent\u2019s refusal to comply with a relator's requests for documents. <em>Id. </em>at 112, 529 N.E.2d at 447. We therefore find that imposition of a sanction is inappropriate in the present case, since respondents apparently had a good faith belief that relator was unable to pay for the cost of copying. See <em>id. </em>(\u201cgood faith\u201d). In a letter of May 8, 1989, attached as Exhibit A to relator\u2019s petition for a writ, relator stated to the \u201cInformation/Records Officer\u201d of \u201cWhitehall Police Station,\u201d \u201c[i]f necessary, please provide me with a reasonable estimate for any copywork needed or bill me for the copies as I am an indigent prisoner without funds.\u201d From this statement, respondents could have reasonably inferred that relator was declaring that he could not pay for copies of the records.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">In regard to relator\u2019s suggestion that he should receive the records free of charge as a sanction, we note that no explicit authority exists in R.C. 149.43(C) for that type of award. Even if this sanction were available under the statute, though, we would again find that imposition of a penalty is inappropriate in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">In conclusion, because respondents appear willing to provide the records if relator is willing to pay, we grant a writ of mandamus ordering respondents to notify relator of the cost of the public records requested and, upon receipt of those costs, to provide copies to relator.
