Hofstetter, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">LTV Steel Company, Inc., formerly known as Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel, Inc., appellant, is appealing the judgment of the trial court which allows Betty Bussey, appellee, to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund. Appellant contends the court should have granted a directed verdict at the close of all the evidence. Because we agree, we are reversing the judgment of the trial court and entering judgment for appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">The parties stipulated to the following facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-7\">\u201cThat there was, in fact, an accident that occurred on September 11, 1983, which was a Sunday, at about 2:00 o\u2019clock p.m. between a car driven by Betty Bussey, and a truck driven by a Joseph Donato, employed by Research Wilmont Oil Company, and at that time, Mr. Donato was making a delivery to the Jones &amp; Laughlin [now LTV] plant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-8\">\u201cThe accident happened when Mr. Donato turned into or onto the roadway leading up to the J &amp; L gate, which gate was approximately six-tenths of a mile from the point of the accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">In addition to these stipulated facts, there was testimony that the road leading up to the LTV gate was a public road. Appellee was on her way home from work and was stopped at the Jennings Road\u20141-71 intersection where she intended to turn left when she was hit by a delivery truck turning onto the LTV access road.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">At the close of the evidence the trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict based on <em>Littlefield v. Pillsbury Co. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 389, 6 OBR 439, 453 N.E.2d 570. The jury returned a verdict for appellee, the court overruled appellant\u2019s motion(s) for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and/or new trial, and appellant timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b607-12\">Appellant\u2019s first assigned error is that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-13\">\u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of the defendant-appellant in overruling its motion for a directed verdict.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-14\">A trial court may grant a motion for a directed verdict only when, \u201cafter construing the evidence most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion is directed, [the court] finds that upon any determinative issue reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion upon the evidence submitted and that conclusion is adverse to such party * * *.\u201d Civ.R. 50(A)(4); see <em>Strother v. Hutchinson </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 282, 284, 21 O.O.3d 177, 179, 423 N.E.2d 467, 469. In making this determination, the court is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>to weigh the evidence or judge credibility but is \u201cto determine whether there exists any evidence of substantial probative value in support of that party\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>Ruta v. Breckenridge-Remy Co. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 66, 69, 23 O.O.3d 115, 116-117, 430 N.E.2d 935, 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">In <em>Littlefield </em>the Supreme Court of Ohio held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-6\">\u201c1. An employee will be entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits when the employment creates a special hazard and the injuries are sustained because of that hazard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-7\">\u201c2. The special hazard rule applies where: (1) \u2018but for\u2019 the employment, the employee would not have been at the location where the injury occurred, and (2) the risk is distinctive in nature or quantitatively greater than the risk common to the public.\u201d 6 Ohio St.3d 389, 6 OBR 439, 453 N.E.2d 570, paragraphs one and two of the syllabus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">Thus, the issues to be decided in this case were whether \u201cbut for\u201d appellee\u2019s employment at LTV, appellee would not have been at the intersection of Jennings Road and 1-71 where her injury occurred and whether the risk to appellee was distinctive in nature or quantitatively greater than the risk common to the public?</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">A directed verdict should have been granted for appellant because appellee never established that turning left at the Jennings 1-71 intersection was the necessary, most direct or safest route to her home. Unlike the claimant in <em>Littlefield, </em>appellee had options. Consequently, appellee failed to meet the first criterion of the special hazard rule. To construe the evidence otherwise would extend the \u201cbut for\u201d philosophy to appellee\u2019s arrival at home, an untenable result. Accordingly, this assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b608-11\">Appellant\u2019s second assigned error is that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-12\">\u201cThe verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-13\">Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that pursuant to Civ.R. 50(A)(4) the trial court, as here, chose not to direct a verdict in its belief it was following the \u201cspecial hazard\u201d rule promulgated in <em>Littlefield v. Pillsbury, supra, </em>the jury verdict and judgment of the court are, nevertheless, as appellant claims, against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-14\">The distinctions of the facts between the <em>Littlefield </em>case and the case <em>sub judice </em>are numerous, some of which were discussed earlier. In <em>Littlefield, </em>there was no other choice of ingress and egress at the plant entrance where the accident occurred according to the stipulation of the parties. Here, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>however, at a point more than a half mile away from the plant entrance, on a public highway, the employee Bussey had the option of turning either left or right from the Jennings Road intersection with 1-71. Her position on Jennings Road in preparation for the turn was dependent on the exercise of her own choice. It was her location at the intersection, in anticipation of turning left, that placed her vehicle more nearly in the line of travel of the truck making the turn than would have occurred had she turned right.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">When a choice of directions exists when leaving a place of employment on a public highway that is six-tenths of a mile away from the plant entrance or exit, the \u201cspecial hazard\u201d requirement of no choice, as promulgated in <em>Littlefield </em>has been vitiated. To hold otherwise would require the employer to grant safe passage from work to home whenever it is evident the employee would not have been at a particular location en route \u201cbut for\u201d her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">The \u201cbut for\u201d analysis, in our opinion, has to demonstrate that the intersection where the accident occurred constitutes a special hazard that does not inure to the detriment of the public at large at this or comparable intersections. Although the evidence indicated other accidents were reported over the years near this intersection, there was no indication this intersection was more dangerous than comparable intersections simply because it was a means of egress from Jennings Road which led away from the LTV plant six-tenths of a mile away.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">Legal precedence requires an intermediate court of appeals to conform with the law enunciated by the Supreme Court when the facts are reasonably comparable to, and fall <em>within, </em>the factual parameters of the new course set by that court, as in <em>Littlefield, supra, </em>by a vote of four to three.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">When the bounds of the new course are exceeded, as here, by a fact situation which, unless distinguished, suggests the \u201cspecial hazard\u201d rule exists until the employee\u2019s return home has been safely accomplished because of the \u201cbut for\u201d theory, this clearly exceeds the intent and purpose of <em>Littlefield, </em>in our opinion, as set forth by the slim majority therein. It is our function and duty as an intermediate appellate court to contain our thinking <em>within </em>the limits of <em>Littlefield </em>and not to expand on the <em>Littlefield </em>philosophy and its change of course.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">When the fact situation in a succeeding case exceeds the factual boundaries that gave rise to the decision in <em>Littlefield, </em>especially in light of the vigorous triple dissents therein, our judicial thinking must be constrained by the fact situation before us. As the facts herein are distinguishable and substantially exceed the facts giving rise to the rationale of <em>Littlefield, </em>we find the verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>is against the manifest weight of the evidence under the limitations of existing Ohio law.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">This assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">Appellant\u2019s last assigned error is that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-8\">\u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of the defendant-appellant in overruling its objections to improper arguments by plaintiff-appellee\u2019s counsel to the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">Three of counsel\u2019s arguments are contended to be prejudicial. In the first, appellee\u2019s counsel told the jury that appellant\u2019s counsel was going to try to scare them and to cry wolf. The court overruled appellant\u2019s objection. While these sorts of comments regarding opposing counsel\u2019s interpretation of the law will not be condoned, the comments were not prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">In the second, appellee\u2019s counsel argued that everyone was working on Sunday and that they were working because LTV was open and making money. The court overruled counsel\u2019s objection. While these comments were clearly error, <em>see, e.g., Groves v. Phillips Petroleum Co. </em>(1969), 22 Ohio App.2d 25, 33, 51 O.O.2d 20, 25, 257 N.E.2d 759, 765, again, when read in context with the whole argument, we cannot conclude they were prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">Finally, appellee\u2019s counsel argued that appellee took quite a chance pursuing this claim because she is still employed by LTV. He stated that appellee was obviously a good employee or she would have been fired. The court sustained appellant\u2019s objection, admonished counsel and instructed the jury to disregard counsel\u2019s statement. Appellant now complains that the court\u2019s instruction to the jury was incomplete and left the jury with the implication that LTV could retaliate against appellee for pursuing this lawsuit. However, counsel did not advise the court of this concern at the time and did not request a supplemental instruction. The trial court\u2019s actions were sufficient to guard against prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-12\">For all of the above reasons, this assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-13\">The judgment of the trial court is reversed and judgment is hereby entered for appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-14\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b610-15\">Krupansky, P.J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"A1p\">Dyke, J., dissents.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b611-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>Edwin T. Hofstetter, J., retired, of the Eleventh Appellate District, sitting by assignment.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b611-4\">Krupansky, Presiding Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AYr\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">I agree with the majority\u2019s analysis concerning appellant\u2019s first and second assignments of error. However, unlike the majority, I would also reverse the decision of the trial court based upon appellant\u2019s third assignment of error. The third comment by appellee\u2019s counsel concerning the chance appellee took in bringing the case <em>sub judice </em>and that appellee was obviously a good employee or she would have been fired was highly prejudicial and warrants reversal. However, assuming <em>arguendo, </em>the trial court\u2019s instruction cured the prejudice, the cumulative effect of all three comments about which appellant complains was highly prejudicial and warrants a reversal. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s third assignment of error should have been sustained.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b611-6\">Dyke, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A5I\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s disposition of Assignments of Error Nos. One and Two.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">In its first and second assignments of error defendant claims that the trial court erred when it did not grant its motion for directed verdict and that the verdict for plaintiff was against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">A claimant\u2019s injury is compensable under the workers\u2019 compensation laws if the individual sustained it \u201cin the course of, and arising out of, the injured employee\u2019s employment.\u201d R.C. 4123.01(C); see, also, R.C. 4123.54; <em>Primiano v. Ohio Bell Tel. Co. </em>(May 5, 1986), Cuyahoga App. No. 50495, unreported, 1986 WL 4962. An activity occurs in the course of claimant\u2019s employment if it is part of her employment duties or reasonably incidental. An injury is not compensable if it is remote to employment and lacks a nexus to that employment. In determining whether a nexus exists, relevant factors to be taken into consideration include: (1) the proximity of the accident scene to the place of employment; (2) the degree of control exercised by the employer over the accident site; and (3) the employer\u2019s benefit received from the employee\u2019s presence at the accident site. <em>Primiano, supra. </em>Control is a relevant factor but is not dispositive in determining whether the injury occurred in the course of the claimant\u2019s employment. <em>Primiano, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">It has been the general rule that when an employee sustains an injury while travelling to or from a fixed place of employment, that injury is not compensable under workers\u2019 compensation law. <em>Bralley v. Daugherty </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 302, 15 O.O.3d 359, 401 N.E.2d 448. In such a situation an employee generally is not considered to be within the scope or course of his or her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>employment. In <em>Littlefield v. Pillsbury Co. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 389, 6 OBR 439, 453 N.E.2d 570, the Supreme Court carved out an exception to the general rule enunciated in <em>Bralley. Littlefield </em>held that an off-site injury sustained while travelling to or from work may be considered to be within the course and scope of employment if the following two-part test is met: (1) the employee would not have been at the location where the injury occurred \u201cbut for\u201d the employment, and (2) the risk involved is distinctive in nature or quantitatively greater than the risks common to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">In <em>Littlefield </em>the plaintiff, returning from a sanctioned lunch break, was injured on a public road as he sat waiting to turn left into his employer\u2019s premises. The Supreme Court applied its two-prong test and found that but for his employment, Littlefield would not have been making the left hand turn into the company. Secondly, although the risk attendant to travelling the busy road was shared by the public, Littlefield\u2019s risk was \u201cquantitatively greater than that to which other motorists occasionally driving down the road are subjected.\u201d <em>Littlefield, </em>6 Ohio St.3d at 394, 6 OBR at 443, 453 N.E.2d at 575.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">\u201cThe regular exposure to the common risk plus the risk of making a left turn creates a greater degree of risk and sustains the causal relationship between the employment and the accident resulting from the risk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">Defendant-appellant argues that the trial court erred in submitting the issue of plaintiff\u2019s entitlement to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund to the jury. Defendant argues that the evidence demonstrated as a matter of law that plaintiff did not satisfy the two-prong <em>Littlefield </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">I believe that the evidence in the present case demonstrated that the plaintiff was injured off the work premises after work but that the accident occurred six-tenths of a mile from the company\u2019s gate on a road that only provided a means of ingress and egress to the employer\u2019s plant. Testimony further revealed that defendant-LTV placed a sign outside its gates which regulated the heavy truck traffic entering the plant from the access road. Testimony showed that the access road was used mostly by employees entering or exiting the plant and by trucks being driven into the plant. Plaintiff testified that the site at which she was injured was the route she travelled in entering and exiting the plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">Defendant-appellant argues that plaintiff\u2019s injury occurred on a public street and therefore indicates that the accident site was wholly outside of its control. Public streets and sidewalks, neither owned nor controlled by any private employer have been found to be within the zone of employment. <em>Littlefield, supra; Sloss v. Case Western Reserve Univ. </em>(1985), 23 Ohio App.3d 46, 23 OBR 90, 491 N.E.2d 339. Defendant also asserts that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>accident was the result of the truck driver\u2019s negligence, again wholly outside of its control. The point is not well taken. The case law clearly indicates that it is not a question of the other driver\u2019s negligence but rather a question of whether a claimant who is injured off the premises satisfies the two-prong <em>Littlefield </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">When there is sufficient evidence presented of an essential issue, which if believed, would permit reasonable minds to reach different conclusions, it is the duty of a trial court to submit the issue to the jury. <em>O\u2019Day v. Webb </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St.2d 215, 58 O.O.2d 424, 280 N.E.2d 896, paragraph four of the syllabus. I believe that there was sufficient evidence presented which would permit reasonable minds to come to different conclusions whether plaintiff would have been at the site of the accident \u201cbut for\u201d her employment and whether the risk attendant to the intersection was \u201cquantitatively greater\u201d than that to which motorists occasionally driving down the road are subjected.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">I do not believe the present facts to be analogous to those cases where judgment has been entered as a matter of law for the defendant employer. See, <em>e.g., Kopera v. Sheller-Globe </em>(Oct. 31, 1986), Fulton App. No. F-86-9, unreported, 1986 WL 12234 (after work, plaintiff fell in an alleyway which had just received snow as did all other areas of the city. The alleyway was not the only means of ingress and egress to plaintiff\u2019s employment but rather plaintiff\u2019s choice as a route home.); <em>Monjar v. Mayfield </em>(1987), 35 Ohio App.3d 76, 519 N.E.2d 681 (plaintiff injured while driving on a public highway to the first of her three nightly cleaning jobs).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">The trial court did not err in submitting the issue to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">Further, there was substantial credible evidence presented which indicated that plaintiff\u2019s accident occurred in close proximity to her place of employment; that LTV had some control over the access road, <em>i.e., </em>its posted sign which regulated truck traffic; and that the employer benefitted from plaintiff\u2019s presence at the site because it was the way by which she entered and exited the plant. There was substantial evidence submitted by way of testimony which clearly showed that plaintiff would not have been at the intersection but for her employment. Further, the plaintiff faced a peculiar risk by having to stop at an intersection on a regular basis where large tractor trucks routinely had to make sweeping left turns onto the road where she had to wait. There clearly was evidence presented which would allow a jury to conclude that plaintiff\u2019s repeated exposure to this uncommon risk provided the necessary nexus <em>Littlefield </em>requires between employment and the accident resulting from the risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>The jury\u2019s finding that plaintiff was entitled to workers\u2019 compensation was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. I believe that defendant\u2019s first and second assignments of error should be overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
