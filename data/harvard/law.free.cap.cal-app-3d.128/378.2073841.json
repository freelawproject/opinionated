D.), J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJ2\">Appellant Keith Clayton Krall was civilly committed to the Department of Developmental Services on November 3, 1980, pursuant to. a court finding that he was mentally retarded and dangerous to others. (Welf. &amp; Ipst. Code, \u00a7 6500 et seq.) At the hearing in superior court, appellant\u2019s counsel stipulated that appellant was dangerous to others but denied that appellant was mentally retarded within the meaning of the statutes. In this proceeding, appellant argues that Welfare and Institutions Code section 6500<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is unconstitutionally vague for failure to define \u201cmentally retarded\u201d persons, and that there is insufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that he is mentally retarded. After careful consideration of appellant\u2019s arguments and the record, we uphold the constitutionality of the statute and the finding of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">On September 25, 1980, the District Attorney of San Luis Obispo County filed a petition to commit appellant to the Department of Developmental Services. The petition incorporated several medical reports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>and requested judicial notice of all other reports in superior court action numbers 15867 and 2869; the petition also requested appointment of the public defender to represent appellant pursuant to section 6500.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">On October 15, 1980, a letter was filed by Mr. James R.. Teigen of the Tri-Counties Regional Center for the Developmentally Disabled in response to the trial court\u2019s request under section 6504.5. Letters from Doctors Mosman and Bramwell, appointed under section 6507 and Evidence Code section 730, were received on October 20. Appellant appeared with the public defender at the hearing on the petition on October 21, 1980, and opposed the commitment. At the hearing, counsel for appellant stipulated that appellant is a danger to others; Doctors Bramwell, Mosman and Sharpe testified on the issue of mental retardation. After hearing the evidence and arguments of counsel, the court found true beyond a reasonable doubt the allegations of the petition that appellant was a mentally retarded person and a danger to himself or others within section 6500; findings of fact and conclusions of law, and a formal order committing appellant to the Department of Developmental Services were filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Statement of Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">According to the medical reports filed with the superior court and the testimony of Doctors Bramwell, Mosman and Sharpe, Keith Clayton Krall was 23 years old at the time of the instant commitment \u00e1nd had been confined continuously in state hospitals since March 1971. The September 15, 1980, report of Craig C. Rath, Ph.D., staff psychologist at Patton State Hospital, provides this background information: \u201cThe patient was born 4-10-57. He was adopted in an anemic condition at age 6 months .... As an infant he fell off a counter, striking his head, with unknown results. Developmental milestones were somewhat delayed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-8\">\u201cAt age 9 months he was sitting; at 18 months crawling; standing at 20 months; walking at age 2 years; and talking at 3 years of age. Toilet training was accomplished at 3 years of age, at which time he was described as \u2018very resistive.\u2019 When age 3 he was said to be hyperactive and a \u2018loner\u2019 who was envious of his sibling. By age 5 he was being termed hyperactive, disruptive, roaming and unresponsive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-9\">\u201cAlthough placed temporarily at Deveneux [sic] schools, at age 8, by age 9 he had set two fires. A visit to a fire station and conversation with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>the fire marshal terminated this behavior. Numerous behavioral problems continued. In October, 1970, he took down the pants of a five-year-old boy and beat him up. This behavior was repeated in December of 1970 with a young girl, culminating in his commitment to Camarillo State Hospital from 3-10-71 to 6-23-75. In 4/72 he was charged with inserting his finger in the vagina of a 5-year-old girl and spanking her. Hospitalization at Camarillo continued until he apparently assisted in the rape of a woman. He was transferred to Atascadero State Hospital where he resided from. 6-23-75 to 7-28-79. After some four years in that secure environment he was transferred back to Camarillo State Hospital where he resided from 9-28-79 to 1-9-80. At that time it was felt he was inappropriately placed at Camarillo, due to his propensity for taking advantage of lower-functioning residents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-4\">\u201cAdmission to Patton State Hospital was effected by transfer from Camarillo State Hospital on 1-9-80 under the provisions of Welfare and Institutions Code 6500 et seq. Since there was no open Regional Center case, he could not be housed on the units for the Developmentally Disabled and was placed in the Penal Code section of the Hospital. Behavior on the unit has been marginal since admission. He has had numerous interpersonal problems with peers, is quite litigious and has sexually exposed himself as recently as August, 1980.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Further details of appellant\u2019s prior behavior are provided in the written report of Dr. Bill E. Mosman, Ph.D., a licensed psychologist who interviewed appellant on October 10, 1980: \u201cKeith indicates that his difficulties extend way back to approximately 3 years of age when he began having conflict with neighbor girls. He remembers arguing with one and slugging her. At age 11, he indicates that it got rather difficult for his mother to \u2018watch me.\u2019 T was a roughhouse and being verbally abusive and aggressive and physically aggressive.\u2019 He recalls experiences of playing \u2018sexual show and tell\u2019 about this age, but assures me that he was not violent during those events. He then goes on to tell me about girls with whom he did play sexual show and tell, and that he would be secretly angry at his mother and take his anger out on the girls. T would fingerbang them and beat the shit out of them and say \u201cMom, I hate your guts.\u201d\u2019 From age 10 to 11, he was placed at Deveraux School. During 1969, at age 12, he started molesting children and recalls 11 girls that he molested. The records indicate that he molested approximately five, but he indicates they were 11 in total. He was placed in Camarillo State Hospital for this, and during one of his leaves on pass he additionally molested two boys. Approximately at age 15, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>molested a boy and \u2018I almost beat the boy to death with a board.\u2019 He indicates that he has molested a total of approximately 11 girls in 1969 and prior, he additionally molested two 5-year-old boys in 1970, in 1972 he molested one boy, and while at Camarillo in 1976 he and another patient raped a mentally retarded adult female. He assures me that he just did not do the rape at that point in time because the other man was \u2018200 pounds and I wasn\u2019t going to kick him off.\u2019 When I asked him what he felt he might have done if the fellow was 120 pounds instead of 200 pounds he said, \u2018I sure would have kicked his ass off.\u2019 He further indicates that he probably would have \u2018got some\u2019 himself at that point in time. Since then he has had homosexual experiences in the state hospital system, and recalls that during the time I saw him a year ago, he was having homosexual relationships with some of the men on the ward because T was scared of women.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">As indicated in the report of Dr. Rath, appellant, first committed under section 6500 in September 1979, was initially placed at Camarillo State Hospital. Thereafter, appellant filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus requesting a less restrictive placement and, by agreement of the court, appellant and the Department of Developmental Services, appellant was transferred to Patton State Hospital in January 1980. Hospital records from both Camarillo and Patton indicate that appellant continued on many occasions to be verbally, physically and sexually assaultive.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Appellant has been the subject of psychological tests and evaluations for 18 years. Dr. Mosman noted that appellant\u2019s I.Q. has generally been in the 69 to 81 range, depending on his age and the test given. Dr. Mos-man wrote: \u201cThere appears to be consistent agreement that his full-scale intelligence has been in the area of 80 to 83, that he has had some splinter skills higher than that, and certainly has had some splinter skills much lower than that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">However, there has been no \u201cconsistent agreement\u201d regarding the proper diagnosis of appellant\u2019s mental condition, as illustrated by Dr. Rath\u2019s summary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-8\">\u201c8-66\u2014Chronic Brain Syndrome with Behavioral Reaction (19.43)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-9\">\u201c6-71\u2014Unsocialized Aggressive Reaction of Childhood (308.4) with Borderline Mental Retardation (310.4)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>\u201c6-71\u2014Paranoid Schizophrenia (295.30) with Organic Brain Syndrome and Mild Mental Retardation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-4\">\u201c4-72\u2014Paranoid personality (301.07) with [non] Psychotic Organic Brain Syndrome and Ganser Syndrome.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-5\">\u201c10-74\u2014Paranoid Schizophrenia (295.30) with Organic Brain Syndrome and mental retardation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-6\">\u201c6-75\u2014Paranoid Personality (30.1.07); Non-psychotic Organic Brain Syndrome (309.20); Pedophilia (302.20[)] and Aggressive Sexuality (302.80).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-7\">\u201c2-76\u2014Paranoid Personality (301.07); Non-psychotic Organic Brain - Syndrome (309.20); Pedophilia (302.20); Aggressive Sexuality (302.80[)] and Chronic Undifferentiated Schizophrenia (295.90).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-8\">\u201c1-77\u2014Paranoid Schizophrenia (295.30) with borderline I.Q.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-9\">\u201c12-77\u2014Mental Retardation (789.00); Pedophilia (302.20) and Aggressive Sexuality (302.80).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-10\">\u201c10-79\u2014Mental Retardation, not further specified (80.008); Sexual Deviation, Pedophilia (302.20); Sexual Deviation, other (302.80).\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-11\">The executive director and two staff psychologists from Patton State Hospital where appellant spent the nine months preceding the hearing concluded that appellant is not mentally retarded and recommended that he \u201cnot be considered for commitment under Section 6500 ... According to the executive director, appellant was reviewed and tested by each of the reporting psychologists; Dr. Jay Adams indicated that she had day-to-day contact with appellant at the hospital. Dr. Rath\u2019s report provides an evaluation of appellant\u2019s status and a comprehensive discussion of the questions relating to his proper placement.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-12\">\u201cThe patient is of borderline intelligence as indicated by a series of intelligence tests dating back 18 years. His test scores are significantly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>above the level at which he would be termed mentally retarded. Further, his social functioning in terms of independent social skills is much too high for him to be termed developmentally disabled. Academically, he has made significant progress in school such that he currently reads nearly as well as the average seventh grade student.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-5\">\u201cThe current evaluation gives no indications of a thought disorder in terms of hallucinations, delusions, flattened or dissociative affect. Speech pattern and content is average, albeit somewhat impoverished commensurate with his intellectual level. At times he is somewhat concrete and tangential, secondary to a mild degree of organic dysfunction. Content of speech is indicative of an unsocialized, immature young man with poor impulse control and a high potential for asocial acting out.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Specifically addressing the applicability of the concepts of developmental disability, dangerousness and grave disability, Dr. Rath stated: \u201cThe resident is definitely not mentally retarded. He has been incorrectly deemed so numerous times in the past. Using the criteria of the American Association on Mental Deficiency, his intellectual level is not sufficiently subaverage enough to be in even the mildly retarded range. He functions, rather, in the \u2018borderline\u2019 area, not qualifying as being mentally retarded. Further, a truly mentally retarded person would have significant social deficits existing concurrently with his intellectual deficits. The resident is not nearly socially deficient enough in terms of self-help skills, etc. to be termed mentally retarded. Finally, onset of mental retardation should occur before the age of 18, during the developmental period. There is no evidence the resident has experienced significant intellectual and social deficits before age 18 to the degree required to be termed \u2018mentally retarded.\u2019</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-7\">. \u201cSince the resident is not mentally retarded, the only other way he could be termed developmentally disabled would be if he had infantile autism or cerebral palsy. There is no evidence he has ever had any other malady which would qualify him as \u2018developmentally disabled.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">Dr. Rath further opined that appellant would not qualify for a Lanterman-Petris-Short (LPS) conservatorship in that he is neither gravely disabled nor suffering from a psychosis or severe organic brain disease. However, Dr. Rath agreed that appellant is dangerous \u201c... in that there is an imminent likelihood of aggressive and sexual acting out to<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>wards others. Indicators of dangerousness are numerous: history; poor impulse control; emotional liability; social withdrawal; etc. Every \u2018expert\u2019 evaluating Mr. Krall in the last decade has noted severe interpersonal problems and a strong tendency to act asocially.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Dr. Rath noted that Dr. Jay Adams had consulted with him and concurred in this assessment of appellant. Dr. Rath recommended against placement of appellant with developmentally disabled or EPS patients and stated, \u201c[sjhould further offenses occur, disposition of [appellant\u2019s] case in the Criminal Justice System, rather than the Mental Health System should be seriously considered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">James R. Teigen, hospital liaison counselor for Tri-Counties Regional Center for the Developmentally Disabled, basing his report to the court entirely upon earlier evaluations and reports by others, cited neurological and other evidence of brain trauma in concluding that \u201csome degree of developmental disability does exist.\u201d However, based on review of appellant\u2019s test scores, Mr. Teigen found that appellant had consistently fallen within the \u201cborderline-to-dull normal range of intellectual functioning\u201d and was therefore not mentally retarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">The most important evidence on the question of whether appellant is mentally retarded was presented by Doctors Bramwell and Mosman, who discussed in detail the <em>basis </em>for their conclusions. Each interviewed appellant and administered tests, submitted written reports to the court and testified at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">Dr. Paul F. Bramwell, Ph.D., a licensed clinical psychologist, testified that he interviewed appellant on October 19, 1980, and administered the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS). Dr. Bramwell had previously evaluated appellant in 1976. Appellant\u2019s full-scale I.Q. on both occasions was 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">Dr. Bramwell explained that the WAIS is designed to measure the whole range of intelligence through use of different subtests. From the scores on the subtests, an aggregate score, commonly known as intelligence quotient, or I.Q., is computed. Wechsler defined intelligence as \u201cthe aggregate or global capacity of an individual to act purposefully, to think rationally, and to deal effectively with his environment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">Dr. Bramwell said that test scores are not precise: there is statistically a standard error of measurement in any test, as well as variance in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>the test subject\u2019s attention and emotional state on the day of the test, and a subjective element in scoring on the Wechsler and StanfordBinet. Dr. Bramwell said that he prefers to speak in terms of a <em>range </em>of intelligence rather than a specific score; appellant\u2019s range was between 70 and 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Also, I.Q. score was only one element of several that Dr. Bramwell took into consideration in reaching an opinion on whether appellant is mentally retarded.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-6\">\u201cI think in ... establishing what a person\u2019s psycholigical [j?c] state is, of which mental retardation is a part, you have to see what he is doing in the world. It\u2019s not just how he might function on a test, but to see how he has adapted to the kinds of environment he has been in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-7\">. if we look specifically at mental retardation, then the new classificatory system of the American Psychiatric Association, the so-called DSM-III, talks about there being some other elements besides an IQ score that are involved in the determination of mental retardation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-8\">\u201cEssentially, those are that, one, there should be a significantly sub-average general intellectual functioning. Now, that is intellectual functioning; not necessarily a score on a test.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-9\">\u201cSecondly, there must be impairments in adaptive functioning, and they are precise in the DSM-II by defining what adaptive behavior is, and specifically they say it is the effectiveness with which an individual meets the standards of personal independence and social responsibility expected of his age and cultural group. That\u2019s the second aspect of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-10\">\u201cThe third involves that the onset of the condition should be below 18 years of age.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-11\"><em>\u201cNow, most certainly I felt that he met all three of those criteria, </em>and certainly in such diagnosis DSM-III even cautions in terms of differentiating between borderline intelligence and mild mental retardation, and I think specifically it indicates that differentiating mild mental retardation from borderline intellectual functioning requires careful consideration of all available information, including psychological test scores, but not exclusively that, as far as my understanding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>\u201cThat is consistent with the stand that the American Psychiatric Association has had even in the DSM-II; that you must look at all factors.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Dr. Bramwell stated in his written report that considering \u201cthe strong probability of practice effects and the standard error of measurement [,] Mr. \u00bfrail\u2019s Full Scale IQ score could easily fall slightly below 70.... [which] now falls within the intellectual range of Mild Mental Retardation.\u201d In his testimony, <em>Dr. Bramwell emphasized that all the records show that appellant has adapted poorly. </em>In Dr. Bramwell\u2019s view, appellant \u201c... lacks substantial capacity to understand what is really going on, and he does misinterpret things, and he has little ability to control or inhibit his behavior. When he has an expectation of something, when he has a goal and someone thwarts that goal, as small as it might be, we see\u2014and it\u2019s well documented\u2014some sometimes very violent outbursts. Certainly highly aggressive outbursts occur.\u201d When . asked why these outbursts occur, Dr. Bramwell explained: \u201c... it is his inability to understand, which is partially intellectual, partially situational. At the moment, it could be partially culturally defined as well. I think most of it comes because he doesn\u2019t have the intellectual capacity to really understand some of the social situations he is in. That\u2019s a predominant factor.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-5\">\u201cHe also has\u2014and I think it is a developmentally-induced problem, because he never developed his ability to inhibit or control his behaviors.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-6\"><em>Dr. Bramwell stated that both low test scores and </em>records, <em>of appellant\u2019s behavior indicate that his mental condition has existed since childhood. </em>Although appellant\u2019s behavior has led to varying diagnoses, Dr. Bramwell found no evidence of a thought disorder and believed that appellant\u2019s personality and sexuality problems were primarily the result of a lack of intellectual capacity in the broadest sense. Appellant has presented difficulties in diagnosis and placement because he is \u201cborderline,\u201d and at the \u201cupper limit\u201d of the mild mental retardation classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">Dr. Bill Mosman testified that prior to the hearing he interviewed and tested appellant, reviewed appellant\u2019s prior scores on a WAIS test administered by Mosman approximately one year earlier, and reviewed hospital records. Dr. Mosman administered two tests, the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, and the Slosson Intelligence Test. On the former, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>which tests understanding of language, appellant scored 91, the equivalent of a 15-year 7-month male\u2014at the low end of normal. On the Slosson, a broader test of intelligence, appellant had an overall score of 82, at the level of a boy 13 years 2 months old, with some higher and some lower specific areas. Dr. Mosman found the correlation between the current scores and the full-scale I.Q. of 77 obtained the previous year on the Wechsler to be very close.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Nevertheless, because of the change in diagnostic criteria from the DSM-II to the DSM-III (see fn. 2, <em>ante) </em>and a clinical judgment that appellant has not fit into treatment programs with the mentally retarded, where Dr. Mosman the previous year had testified that appellant was mentally retarded by every criterion, at the October 1980 hearing, Mosman testified that appellant was not \u201cglobally\u201d mentally retarded.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Dr. Mosman explained that the DSM-III lowered the ceiling I.Q. for mental retardation from 83 to 70. According to the authors of the DSM-III, the category of 71 to 84 I.Q. is no longer included within mental retardation because \u201c... the large majority of persons with borderline intellectual functioning ... do not have significant impairment in adaptive behavior, ...\u201d (DSM-III, Appen. C, p. 371.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Dr. Mosman said: \u201c... according to his present I.Q. levels as they exist today, under the diagnostic criteria that we have to use today, ... Keith would not be mentally retarded, if you take one score, the composite score.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-7\">\u201cI also tried to say, though, that in the issue of retardation, other factors have to be taken into consideration, and that, over and above that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>the I.Q. score is a composite score made of many different factors, and when you break that down, you are going to find some of his intellectual functioning is probably just above average. You are also going to find that some of his intellectual functioning and intellectual skills are significantly impaired and significantly below average and are in the retarded area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-4\">\u201cBut if you pool them or average them or lump them together into one score, you are not going to get a retarded picture.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-5\">\u201cThe other thing I tried to indicate in the report is that <em>if you bypass the I.Q. score and look at his impulse control, his social adjustment, his ability to be independent, his ability to function without supervision, then he is significantly impaired, and the impairment would be in the retarded area.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Dr. Mosman further testified that appellant is not within the normal band of adaptive behavior, and is in need of constant guidance and supervision. Appellant\u2019s social comprehension, impulse control, and judgment (as opposed to vocabulary and general functioning), are significantly substandard. Dr. Mosman scored appellant as between 60 and 70 in these areas, or approximately equivalent to the level of a 9-year-old child. Mosman was quite definite that appellant\u2019s behavioral deficiencies were a result of his low intellectual capacity in these areas. In summary, Dr. Mosman said that \u201cglobally\u201d appellant is \u201c... impaired but not retarded. In the latter case of the <em>social judgment, he is significantly retarded, and we have the scores to support that. </em>An I.Q. of 65 is what usually seems to be coming out of the testing the last few years along those lines. <em>Even in the DSM-III, that puts him in the retarded area.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-7\">\u201cNot only is the score there\u2014which we don\u2019t have to pay attention to, and we shouldn\u2019t, one hundred percent\u2014we have to look at his behavior in the hospital, his adaptive behavioral history the last year. It\u2019s in the record. I don\u2019t need to summarize it. It\u2019s time after time after time of impaired judgment, impaired impulse control, dangerousness, fighting with himself, exposing himself, ...\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">Dr. Richard W. Sharpe, Ph.D., a staff psychologist at Camarillo State Hospital, was called by appellant. As part of his duties at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>acute psychiatric inpatient unit in 1979, Dr. Sharpe examined appellant and administered psychological tests, including the WAIS. Appellant\u2019s overall I.Q. was 83. Dr. Sharpe indicated that the scores reported by Bramwell (76) and Mosman (77, one year earlier), were close to being within the realm of standard deviation. Dr. Sharpe did not feel that appellant was mentally retarded; at Camarillo, he was diagnosed as suffering from organic brain damage, with additional diagnoses of antisocial personality and chronic schizophrenia.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Dr. Sharpe stated that appellant needs a controlled, locked environment, but that the placement with acutely psychotic patients at Camarillo was inappropriate. Camarillo had no programs which would benefit appellant; placement with the present population of developmentally disabled patients was not appropriate because they are more impaired and appellant would be likely to take advantage of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\"><em>Dr. Sharpe said that in evaluating appellant he was not primarily concerned with determining </em>intelligence; his concern at that time was to assess appellant\u2019s dangerousness and proper placement in the hospital. Dr. Sharpe said that he agreed with Dr. Mosman that: \u201c... there are areas in Keith\u2019s functioning in which he has some serious impairment. At the same time, it\u2019s difficult to assess how much of that is native to him, ... and how much is a result of the environment in which he has lived. There is a very high antisocial aspect to his personality, and we diagnosed him as an antisocial personality as well as having these areas of deficit, and sometimes it\u2019s difficult to ascertain the difference between the two, whether it\u2019s a native inability or whether it\u2019s something else.\u201d Dr. Sharpe said that although appellant is in need of long-term care, he \u201cseems to fall somewhere between the cracks, as it were, in terms of what the state makes available to treat him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">The trial judge employed a beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and found that appellant was both dangerous and mentally retarded. The judge explained that he was considering the \u201cdefinition\u201d of mental retardation in former Welfare and Institutions Code section 6500, along with the current psychiatric diagnostic criteria, but weighting the factors of social and interpersonal functioning in accordance with his interpretation of legislative purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>Mootness</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">In a motion filed October 13, 1981, seeking dismissal as moot of the appeal and petition for writ of habeas corpus,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> respondent alleged that appellant sought habeas corpus relief in Ventura County Superior Court and his release from Camarillo State Hospital was ordered on September 25, 1981. Respondent requested that this court take judicial notice of a minute order of the Ventura County Superior Court ordering the release. (Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 452, subd. (d), 459.) Because of appellant\u2019s release, respondent urges that the appeal \u201chas no proper appellate objectives.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">On October 30, 1981, appellant filed opposition stating several reasons why the appeal should not be dismissed as moot despite termination of this commitment. Appellant argues that the issue of the constitutionality of section 6500 is one of continuing public importance (citing <em>Conservatorship of Buchanan </em>(1978) 78 Cal.App.3d 281 [144 Cal.Rptr. 241]) and that, because of the one-year commitment period under the statute, such commitments commonly will expire before an appeal can be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">It is established that an appellate court is justified in refusing to dismiss for mootness where an important issue is likely to recur yet evade review. <em>(So.

The declaration alleges that appellant was recommitted to Atascadero State Hospital on an ex parte order and thereafter was released to his parents\u2019 custody pending hearing on the new petition. Clearly, the issues in the appeal are of public interest and are not moot as to appellant. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Martin </em>(1980) 107 Cal.App.3d 714, 717, fn. 2 [165 Cal.Rptr. 773]; <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Gallinot </em>(9th Cir. 1981) 657 F.2d 1017, 1021, fn. 6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">For the above reasons we determine the merits of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">In a letter brief filed June 9, 1981, the Attorney General conceded that the order of commitment should be reversed on the ground that insufficient evidence of mental retardation was presented to support the commitment, but at the request of this court, respondent filed a supplemental brief addressing appellant\u2019s contention that section 6500 is unconstitutionally vague. A reviewing court is not bound by the respondent\u2019s \u201cconfession of error.\u201d (6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) pt. I, Appeal, \u00a7 330, pp. 4307-4308.) In <em>Thaler </em>v. <em>Thaler </em>(1932) 127 Cal.App. 28, 29 [15 P.2d 192], the court stated: \u201cThe mere fact that respondent is now willing to have the order reversed would not justify this court in rendering a judgment of reversal. A judgment or order will not be reversed unless the record shows some legal ground for reversal.\u201d (See also <em>Sun Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>White </em>(1897) 118 Cal. 468, 469 [50 P. 546].)</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Section 6500 provides in part, \u201cOn and after July 1, 1971, no mentally retarded person may be committed to the State Department of Developmental Services pursuant to this article, unless he is a danger to himself or others.\u201d Appellant contends that this section is unconstitutionally vague because the term \u201cmentally retarded\u201d is not defined, and alleges that the trial court \u201ccreated its own definition of the term ..., found Appellant to fall within its confines and involuntarily committed Appellant.\u201d The Attorney General counters that the statute is constitutional because the challenged term has an accepted meaning in medical terminology, such as the definition in the DSM-III, discussed at trial, but argues that the trial court erroneously attempted to \u201cinvent\u201d its own standard of mental retardation.

Vague laws offend several important values. First, because we assume that man is free to steer between lawful and unlawful conduct, we insist that laws give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly. Vague laws may trap the innocent by not providing fair warning. Second, if arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is to be prevented, laws must provide explicit standards for those who apply them. A vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges and juries for reso<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>lution on an <em>ad hoc </em>and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application.\u201d <em>(Grayned </em>v. <em>City of Rockford </em>(1972) 408 U.S. 104, 108-109 [33 L.Ed.2d 222, 227-228, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 2298-2299], fns. omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">Recognizing that the first of these concerns logically does not apply where the statutory classification involves mental status which is not subject to voluntary avoidance (see <em>Boutilier </em>v. <em>Immigration Service </em>(1967) 387 U.S. 118, 123-124 [18 L.Ed.2d 661, 665-666, 87 S.Ct. 1563, 1566-1567]), appellant concentrates on the second aspect of the vagueness doctrine: the hazard of arbitrary enforcement. \u201c[\u00d3]ne of the basic purposes of the Due Process Clause has always been to protect a person against having the Government impose burdens upon him except in accordance with the valid laws of the land.\u201d <em>(Giaccio </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania </em>(1966) 382 U.S. 399, 403 [15 L.Ed.2d 447, 450, 86 S.Ct. 518, 521].)</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Appellant argues that the trial judge acted arbitrarily in refusing to be bound by the current psychiatric criteria for mental retardation, in considering the former statutory \u201cdefinition,\u201d and in giving greater weight to evidence of retardation in the area of social activities and relationships. As a corollary to this argument, appellant complains that the lack of a clear standard hampered him in defending against the commitment. (See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lattimore </em>(D.C.

The pertinent portion of former section 6500 provided: \u201cAs used in this code, \u2018mentally retarded persons\u2019 means those persons, not psychotic, who are so mentally retarded from infancy or before reaching maturity that they are incapable of managing themselves and their affairs independently, with ordinary prudence, or of being taught to do so, and who require supervision, control, and care, for their own welfare, or for the welfare of others, or for the welfare of the community.\u201d Statutes 1970, chapter 351, section 3, page 765, added former section 6500.1, which stated: \u201cOn and after July 1, 1971, no mentally retarded person may be committed to the Department of Mental Hygiene pursuant to this article, unless he is a danger to himself or others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">In 1978, section 6500 was repealed and section 6500.1 was amended and renumbered as current section 6500 (Stats. 1978, ch. 1319, \u00a7 2, p. 4316; Assem. Bill No. 3119 (1977-1978 Reg. Sess.) Lanterman); the language describing \u201cmentally retarded persons\u201d in former section 6500 was eliminated. The reason for the 1978 change is explained in the Senate Committee on Judiciary Report on Assembly Bill No. 3119: \u201cW. &amp; I. Code Sections 6500 et seq. prescribe the procedures for the judicial commitment of a mentally retarded person who is a danger to himself or to others.

This language describes a <em>degree </em>of retardation.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">We conclude that the change in section 6500 does not alter the legal standard of mental retardation, but reflects the narrowing of the class of mentally retarded persons committable under the statute. This change was effected when former section 6500.1, imposing the requirement of dangerousness, was added. Thereafter, the description in section 6500 of the <em>class </em>of mentally retarded persons committable became surplusage, with the exception of the requirement that such persons be \u201cnot psychotic.\u201d We find no error in the trial judge\u2019s reference to the former section.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>The substitution of the concept of dangerousness reflects a sensitivity to constitutional limitations on involuntary confinement of mentally handicapped persons (see <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Donaldson </em>(1975) 422 U.S. 563, 572-576 [45 L.Ed.2d 396, 405-408, 95 S.Ct. 2486, 2492-2494]; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Indiana </em>(1972) 406 U.S. 715, 736-738 [32 L.Ed.2d 435, 449-451, 92 S.Ct. 1845, 1857-1858]), and parallels developments in the legislative treatment of the mentally ill. (See Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 5001, subd.

Within this general definition, there has been considerable controversy, particularly concerning the upper boundaries of the condition. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 555-556.) The level of \u201cgeneral intellectual functioning\u201d is identified through standardized intelligence tests; the I.Q. ceiling values inherently are somewhat arbitrary. (DSM-III, <em>supra, </em>at p. 37.) Also, the experts acknowledge that performance on intelligence tests is affected by cultural variables and other factors. (Herr, <em>supra, </em>at p. 556.) These points of unavoidable uncertainty underscore the importance of the multifactor diagnostic approach under both the DSM-II and DSM-III.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Circuit Judge David L. Bazelon wrote in the preface to the <em>Symposium on Mentally Retarded People and the Law </em>(1979) 31 Stan.L.Rev. 541, 543: \u201cIf we have learned anything about mental retardation in the past decades, it is that hidden beneath that simple and single diagnostic label lies a complex range of behavioral phenomena stemming from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>variety of causes.\u201d The lack of precision is not created by the code section, and does not make the statute unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Recognizing the \u201cmassive curtailment of liberty\u201d suffered by persons who are civilly committed <em>(Humphrey </em>v. <em>Cady </em>(1972) 405 U.S. 504, 509 [31 L.Ed.2d 394, 402, 92 S.Ct. 1048, 1052]), the Legislature has responded to the inherent difficulties in identifying \u201cmental retardation\u201d by enacting safeguards to protect the legal and human rights of those persons sought to be committed under the statute. Section 6500 provides for a <em>one-year </em>commitment of a mentally retarded person and only if such person is found to be dangerous. That commitment automatically expires at the end of the year; a new petition is subject to the same procedures as an original commitment. (\u00a7 6500.) The statute requires that the alleged mentally retarded person be informed of his right to counsel and that counsel be appointed if the person is unable to afford counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">California case law has paralleled the Legislature in protecting persons coming within the operation of the statute by applying criminal due process standards to the hearing procedures. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Burnick, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d 306, 332.) A jury trial must be provided at the commitment hearing unless a jury is waived; the physical presence of the person is required unless a physical disability exists preventing attendance or presence is waived. <em>(O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1976) 61 Cal.App.3d 62, 68-69 [132 Cal.Rptr. 13].) The person is entitled to the application of the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt and a unanimous jury verdict. <em>(In re Hop </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 82 [171 Cal.Rptr. 721, 623 P.2d 282]; <em>Conservatorship of Roulet </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 219 [152 Cal.Rptr. 425, 590 P.2d 1].) Although the alleged mentally retarded person may be called as a witness, \u201c[t]o the extent that the necessary elements of mental retardation and dangerousness may be established by evidence of criminal conduct, such evidence must, in its entirety, be elicited from sources other than the individual who is the subject of the commitment proceeding.\u201d <em>(Cramer </em>v. <em>Tyars </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 131, 138 [151 Cal.Rptr. 653, 588 P.2d 793].)

Further, the major thrust of appellant\u2019s attack is answered by the fact that California commitment hearings under section 6500 have been shaped by the Legislature and case law to include full procedural safeguards against errors in factfinding.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Finally, we hold that the record supports the trial court\u2019s finding of mental retardation. The trial judge reviewed the reports and testimony before making his determination and the transcript reflects a serious and careful scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">There was substantial agreement among the experts consulted that appellant\u2019s behavior is subnormal, but significant disagreement existed regarding his overall intelligence. Dr. Rath, who reported that appellant was \u201cdefinitely\u201d not mentally retarded, felt that appellant functioned in the \u201cborderline\u201d area, and was \u201cnot nearly socially deficient enough in terms of self-help skills, etc. to be termed mentally retarded.\u201d Dr. Rath also found insufficient evidence of significant social deficits before age 18. Dr. Jay Adams, who had daily contact with appellant at Patton, concurred in this assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">However, appellant\u2019s I.Q. scores since 1966 on the Weschler children\u2019s and adult scales range from 67 to 83, and Doctors Mosman and Bramwell both agreed that appellant\u2019s history showed severe deficits in adaptive behavior long before age 18. They also agreed that appellant\u2019s behavioral problems are linked to his lack of intellectual capacity, but disagreed on an overall diagnosis. Dr. Sharpe testified that in some areas appellant\u2019s functioning showed \u201cserious impairment,\u201d but concluded that appellant was not mentally retarded. Dr. Sharpe admitted that his purpose in testing appellant was not primarily to determine intelligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">Dr. Mosman, who at the time of the hearing found appellant to be <em>significantly impaired </em>in his ability to function independently in his social adjustment and impulse control, and had the year before testified that by <em>every criterion </em>appellant was mentally retarded, testified in 1980 that appellant was not \u201cglobally\u201d mentally retarded. The doctor\u2019s change in testimony clearly did not reflect a change in appellant, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>rather reflected a change in the ceiling I.Q. level under DSM-III. Dr. Mosman told the court: \u201cHe hasn\u2019t changed a bit; the law hasn\u2019t changed; just our definitions have changed.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">Dr. Bramwell, however, testified that he evaluated appellant after testing him in 1976 and again in 1980, and appellant\u2019s full scale I.Q. on both occasions was 76. I.Q. score was one of several elements that Dr. Bramwell considered in reaching his opinion that appellant is mentally retarded and that this retardation has existed since childhood; he stressed that appellant\u2019s aggressive outbursts occurred because he lacks \u201cthe intellectual capacity to ... understand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Appellant contends that Dr. Bramwell\u2019s opinion is insufficient to support the court\u2019s finding because it was contrary to that of other professionals and the DSM-III criteria. Appellant argues that if mental retardation is defined by reference to the term\u2019s technical medical meaning, such a definition must be responsive to advances in understanding of the phenomenon. We agree with this principle, but do not agree that the trial court was required to reject Dr. Bramwell\u2019s analysis as a departure from the approach outlined in the DSM-III.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\">\u201cSignificantly subaverage intellectual functioning is defined as an IQ of 70 or below on an individually administered IQ test. Since any measurement is fallible, an IQ score is generally thought to involve an error of measurement of approximately five points; hence, an IQ of 70 is considered to represent a band or zone of 65 to 75. <em>Treating the IQ with some flexibility permits the inclusion in the Mental Retardation category of individuals with IQs somewhat higher than 70 who truly need special education or other programs. It also permits exclusion from the diagnosis of those with IQs somewhat lower than 70 if the clinical judgment is that there are no significant deficits or impairment in adaptive functioning.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-7\">\u201cAdaptive behavior refers to the effectiveness with which an individual meets the standards of personal independence and social responsibility expected of his or her age and cultural group. There are scales designed to quantify adaptive behavior, but none is considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>sufficiently reliable and valid to be used alone to evaluate this aspect of functioning. Therefore, clinical judgment is necessary for the assessment of general adaptation, the individual\u2019s age being taken into consideration. The IQ level of 70 was chosen as the upper limit for Mental Retardation because most people with IQs below 70 are so limited in their adaptive functioning that they require special services and protection, particularly during the school-age years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-5\">\u201cThe arbitrary IQ ceiling values are based on data indicating a positive association between intelligence (as measured by IQ score) and adaptive behavior. This association declines at the upper levels of Mild Retardation.

The jurors would also be instructed that in resolving any conflict in the testimony of expert witnesses, the opinion of one expert should be weighed against that of another ahd the relative qualifications and credibility of the expert witnesses should be considered as well as the reasons and factual bases of the opinions.

Also the jury would be instructed that the testimony of one witness, if believed, \u201cis sufficient for the proof of any fact.\u201d (CALJIC No. 2.27.)</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">These criteria to guide the trier of fact apply in this civil commitment hearing before the judge. (See also BAJI Nos. 2.01, 2.40, 2.41 (6th ed. 1977).) Plainly, as <em>all </em>reports and testimony presented were in agreement that appellant\u2019s adaptive behavior was impaired, the trial judge was impressed by that harmony of opinion and accepted this conclusion. There was no such agreement on whether appellant was \u201cglobally\u201d mentally retarded; the trial judge was free to rely upon Dr. Bramwell\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>consistent testimony that appellant was mentally retarded at the time of the hearing and had been mentally retarded since childhood. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Samuel </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 489, 498, 504-505 [174 Cal.Rptr. 684, 629 P.2d 485].) The judge gave a comprehensive explanation of his thought processes in making his determination; counsel may criticize his approach, but the evidence in the record supports his finding of mental retardation.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">The record suggests that this young man, \u201cin the system\u201d since he was a boy, has not received the treatment, care and guidance the system should have provided. However, his degree of mental impairment is not determined by the unavailability of treatment programs which might enable him to take a place in society. Whether appellant is mentally retarded within section 6500 surely is determined in part by what services he <em>needs, </em>not by what services the system provides.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">The order of commitment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Brown (G.
