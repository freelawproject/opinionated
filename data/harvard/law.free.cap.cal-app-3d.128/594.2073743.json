J.</author>\n<p id=\"AtVM\">Plaintiff and appellant Rigging International Maintenance Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Rigging International, caused a complaint to be filed in the Superior Court of Alameda County on March 3, 1978, alleging that defendant and respondent Steve W. Gwin had wrongfully interfered with its business relationships (first cause of action), engaged in unfair competition and breached a confidential information agreement (second cause of action). In the complaint appellant sought an injunction, damages (first and second causes of action) and specific performance of the confidential information agreement (third cause of action).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">Appellant obtained a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction. The trial in the instant action commenced on May 15, 1978, before the Honorable Lyle E. Cook, sitting without a jury. At the conclusion of appellant\u2019s presentation of evidence, respondent moved for judgment pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 631.8. The motion was granted as to the first cause of action and denied as to the second and third causes of action. At the conclusion of the trial, the court found for respondent on the second and third causes of action. After findings of fact and conclusions of law were filed, judgment was entered in favor of respondent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial was denied. Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>Appellant contends on appeal that (1) the \u201cconclusions\u201d of the trial court that respondent did not unfairly compete with appellant is contrary to the governing law and is unsupported by the findings or evidence; (2) the trial court\u2019s \u201cconclusion\u201d that appellant had \u201cno trade secret or confidential information relating to a twist-lock interlock system\u201d is not supported by the findings, the evidence or the law; and (3) the confidential information agreement is enforceable against respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">The issues in this case revolve around (1) appellant\u2019s negotiations with Marine Terminals Company (hereafter MTC), a stevedoring company, concerning a proposed contract whereby appellant would do the maintenance work on four cranes of MTC located at MTC\u2019s Oakland terminal; (2) the establishment by respondent, a former employee of appellant, of a crane maintenance company, which company entered into negotiations with MTC for the maintenance work on MTC\u2019s four cranes; and (3) the development of \u201cimprovements\u201d for a cargo container lifting apparatus.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Appellant, a wholly owned subsidiary of Rigging International, is primarily in the business of providing repair and maintenance services for \u201ccontainer cranes on the docks that handle containers for shipping companies.\u201d In July of 1974, appellant hired respondent in the capacity of a crane mechanic, but within a few weeks appellant promoted respondent to the position of maintenance superintendent. Prior to his employment with appellant, respondent had worked for MTC. Respondent worked for MTC for 10 years, starting in 1964 as a journeyman mechanic. In 1969 or 1970 three container cranes were installed in MTC\u2019s Oakland facility. Since, at that time, there were no container crane mechanics, MTC asked General Electric to \u201c\u2018put together some type of a maintenance training program for this system.\u2019\u201d Thereafter, respondent attended three training courses devised by General Electric. At the time respondent terminated his employment with MTC he was the foreman \u201cin charge of all rolling stock, crane maintenance operation for Marine Terminals in the East Bay facilities.\u201d Respondent testified that when he left MTC in 1974, he intended \u201cto enter into a business, venture with two other individuals to perform container crane maintenance with Sea-Land Corporation ... in New Orleans.\u201d The venture did not materialize. Shortly thereafter respondent was approached by an employee of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>Rigging International because of respondent\u2019s familiarity with container cranes. Rigging International hired respondent for employment with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">In February of 1977, appellant was contacted by MTC and asked to make a proposal to take over the maintenance work for MTC\u2019s four cranes located at MTC\u2019s facility in the Port of Oakland, which maintenance work was then being performed by MTC\u2019s own mechanics. In May of 1977, negotiations broke down because of problems related to the effect of the proposed contract on the union maintenance men at MTC. Prior to the time the negotiations broke down, respondent helped estimate the number of man hours necessary to perform the work for MTC. Appellant then submitted a proposed contract to MTC. The proposed contract that appellant submitted to MTC was taken from past contracts with other clients, although the proposed contract was reworded and rephrased to suit the situation for the MTC cranes. Negotiations were resumed in August or September of 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">The renewed negotiations did not go smoothly. MTC wanted substantial changes made in the proposed contract. There were at least six to ten drafts prepared between September and the middle of December of 1977, as the proposed contract grew from five to fourteen pages in length. Particularly difficult to resolve were the terms relating to liability insurance and indemnification.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On December 14, 1977, appellant informed MTC that appellant would agree to the insurance coverage and terminology MTC wanted in the contract. Darold Hedlund, president of appellant and general manager for the west coast district of Rigging International, testified that at least by December 14, 1977, \u201cwe thought that we had an understanding.\u201d Appellant made the \u201cagreed\u201d upon changes and on December 14, 1977, the proposed agreement was forwarded to MTC for the signature of the president of MTC who was out of town and was not due to return until January 2 or 3, 1978. Raymond Barker, manager of appellant, testified that on that same day he told respondent that appellant had agreed to all of the terms demanded by MTC. However, in late December MTC raised further objections and advised appellant that the proposed contract did not reflect its un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>derstanding of the parties\u2019 verbal agreement. MTC further informed appellant at this time that MTC was going to seek other bids.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">On April 18, 1977, respondent signed a document entitled \u201cEmployee Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement\u201d (hereafter referred to as Agreement). The Agreement purports to be between Rigging International and respondent.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Agreement provides in part: \u201cAs used herein, the term \u2018Rigging International\u2019 shall include all of its subsidiaries and affiliated companies and joint ventures.\u201d The terms \u201cconfidential information\u201d and \u201cinvention\u201d are defined in and for the purpose of the Agreement. With regard to confidential information the Agreement specifies in part: \u201cEmployee shall not disclose Rigging International\u2019s trade secrets, proprietary know-how, or confidential information, directly or indirectly, or use for Employee\u2019s own benefit or purposes such information in any way, either during the term of this agreement or at any time thereafter, except as required in the course of Employee\u2019s employment by Rigging International .... This provision shall not apply to information that has been voluntarily disclosed to the public, or independently developed and disclosed by others, or otherwise enters the public domain through lawful means.\u201d With regard to inventioris, which the Agreement defines as including improvements, the Agreement provides in part: \u201cAny improvements or inventions made by Employee, either alone or with others, at any time during Employee\u2019s employment by Rigging International, whether during or after usual working hours, or made thereafter as a result of any invention made or conceived during Employee\u2019s employment, so far as said improvements or inventions relate to Rigging International\u2019s business, procedures, and developments, shall be held for the benefit and become the sole and exclusive property of Rigging International and Employee shall not disclose or use said inventions, except as required hereunder or as required in the course of his/her employment by Rigging International, without the prior written consent of Rigging International. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Respondent testified that the Agreement was in his \u201cin-basket\u201d one day. Respondent stated he \u201cdidn\u2019t feel that\u201d the Agreement \u201cpertained to\u201d appellant \u201cor to myself,\u201d because he was an employee of appellant not Rigging International. He \u201cdidn\u2019t give it a lot of concern.\u201d However, respondent signed the document without any objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>In November of 1977, respondent formed a corporation called Crane Maintenance Engineering, Inc. Respondent is the sole owner of the corporation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Respondent tendered his resignation to appellant on December 15, 1977. Respondent testified that he told Hedlund \u201cI was leaving to accept a position in my family\u2019s firm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Respondent testified that he first indicated to MTC that he was interested \u201cin putting in a proposal\u201d in the \u201cmid-part of January 1978.\u201d Respondent submitted one proposal around the middle of January and a second one in the latter part of January. MTC informed respondent that his proposals were not comprehensive enough and gave him a copy of a contract that had been prepared by MTC\u2019s attorney to use as a model. Respondent admitted that in preparing his first two proposals, he used portions of some of the earlier proposals that appellant had submitted to MTC. However, most of the language of appellant\u2019s earlier proposals is commonly found in contracts generally used in the industry. In fact, appellant had developed some of the forms it used to prepare its proposals by looking at forms used by other companies in the industry. Furthermore, some of the forms used by appellant to prepare its proposals could easily be duplicated by any trained crane mechanic. At the time of trial, neither appellant nor respondent had been awarded the contract with MTC, although it had been \u201ctendered\u201d to respondent.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">There is a vast difference in the testimonies given by respondent and the representatives of appellant describing the circumstances surrounding the development and improvement of a twist-lock interlock system for lifting shipping containers. The twist lock is a safety device. Appellant describes the safety device as follows: \u201cThe safety device consisted of electrical sensors to be placed on each of the four corners of a crane\u2019s lifting spreader to indicate when the twist locks on the spreader were in position to be properly engaged with each of the four corners of the shipping container to be lifted.\u201d The improvements to the safety device that appellant claims that respondent participated in developing during the course of his employment with appellant were to add a time delay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>to the safety device and to wire the sensors in parallel instead of in series.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">Respondent gave the following version of the circumstances surrounding his participation in the development of improvements to the twist-lock interlock system; Before his employment with appellant he was well aware of inadequacies of the interlock systems that were then being used in the industry. By 1976, respondent had an idea for a device using the sensors with a parallel circuitry. Respondent had been \u201cplaying around\u201d with noncontact sensors since 1975 or 1976, because a magnetic sensor would not work well on \u201can aluminum or a non-ferrous corner casting.\u201d In April of 1977, respondent approached Hedlund, president of appellant, and told him he had \u201ca real slick idea ... for a twist-lock control.\u201d Respondent revealed \u201ca little bit about\u201d his idea, but he did not discuss the circuitry. Hedlund informed respondent that appellant was not \u201cin the business of manufacturing, that [appellant was] in the business of selling a service.\u201d Shortly thereafter, respondent made a \u201cmarketing type drawing\u201d and showed it to Hedlund in the presence of Raymond Barker, manager of appellant, but received the same type of response from Hedlund. When Hedlund rejected the proposal because it was not in appellant\u2019s line of business, respondent decided he would go \u201cahead to complete the project on my own.\u201d While on vacation in August of 1977, respondent worked on the twist-lock control system and put together what he \u201cthought was a very workable product,\u201d but then concluded it needed a parallel resistor to compensate for the \u201cbleed rate\u201d in the parallel circuitry. Respondent \u201cfigured out\u201d that his system needed \u201cparallel resistance\u201d as a result of a conversation he had with a friend, who was an electrical design engineer. This conversation also occurred during his vacation in August of 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">In September of 1977, Larry Nelson of the Charles Lowe Company came to appellant\u2019s offices and demonstrated a safety device for lifting containers (the Lowe twist lock) that the Charles Lowe Company was \u201cgetting ready to produce .... \u201d Respondent attended this demonstra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>tion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The purpose of the demonstration was to interest appellant in the distribution and marketing of the device. The device demonstrated operated without a time delay and the sensors were wired in series. Barker thought that appellant should \u201cmake\u201d its own device rather than market the Lowe twist lock. At this point respondent said, \u201c\u2018I\u2019ve been telling you about this before.\u2019\u201d Don Simmons, a foreman with appellant, also attended the demonstration and suggested that the Lowe system could be improved by adding a time delay to the electrical system, Respondent stated that Simmons suggested the addition of a time delay to the Lowe system, \u201c[bjecause this is something we had talked about prior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">Shortly after the demonstration, Hedlund suggested to respondent that he go back to Sea-Land and \u201c\u2018snoop around\u2019\u201d to learn more about the system with which Sea-Land was experimenting. When respondent reported to Hedlund to tell him what he had found out at Sea^Land, Hedlund inquired, \u201c\u2018Well, whatever happened to the idea you were working on? Didn\u2019t you have an idea like this?\u2019\u201d Respondent replied, \u201c\u2018Yes, I did, and I thought it was a better idea.\u2019\u201d Thereafter Hedlund told respondent and Barker to try to develop a twist lock to market.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Respondent went to a company he knew called Steven Engineering in South San Francisco with Barker to purchase the parts to build a model of a modified Lowe system. Ken Walter, President of Steven Engineering, could not locate the type of sensors that respondent requested. Waltqr asked respondent, \u201c\u2018Can you make the circuits in parallel.\u2019\u201d Respondent replied he \u201chad been planning\u201d on such a system and then drew a sketch of the system using parallel sensors. When respondent returned to Steven Engineering, Walter showed respondent his drawing which Walter had modified to accommodate the parts Walter had available. Respondent was of the opinion that the system would not be dependable without a parallel resistor.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Respondent ordered the parts to build a model of the system in November of 1977, but he terminated his employment with appellant shortly thereafter (in December of 1977) and never built a model. Respondent returned the parts to appellant. In January of 1978 respondent perfected his system. Respondent\u2019s system included a time delay and the sensors were wired in parallel, but his system also included a parallel resistor. Respondent sold a twist-lock interlock system to MTC. At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>the time of trial, appellant had managed to build only a small model of a twist-lock interlock device, which malfunctioned for some five minutes during Barker\u2019s deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">On the other hand, witnesses called by appellant gave the following accounts of the circumstances surrounding the development of improvements to the Lowe twist-lock system: Hedlund asked respondent in \u201cmid-\u201976\u201d to look at an experimental twist-lock system that was being used by Sea-Land Services. Hedlund\u2019s purpose in requesting that respondent look at the system being used by Sea-Land was to learn what the system \u201cdid and if it was worthwhile having.\u201d The report that respondent gave Hedlund after he had seen the system at Sea-Land \u201cwas vague.\u201d Hedlund told respondent to obtain more information about the system being used at Sea-Land, but respondent did not mention the subject of a twist-lock system to him again until after the demonstration that was given by Larry Nelson of the Charles Lowe Company at appellant\u2019s offices in September of 1977. Donald Simmons, a foreman for appellant, stated that after the demonstration he suggested that the Lowe system could be improved by adding a \u201c[t]ime delay relay.\u201d Simmons further stated that he never had discussed with respondent before this time \u201cany type of system similar to the Charles Lowe device .... \u201d Raymond Barker testified that Ken Walter was the first person to suggest that the sensors should be wired in parallel.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Hedlund testified that after it was decided that the Lowe system could be improved by adding a time delay and wiring the sensors in parallel, he had a discussion with Barker and respondent regarding a method by which appellant could keep others from finding \u201cout exactly how our system worked.\u201d Hedlund stated that respondent \u201ccame up with the idea\u201d that the circuit box for the operation of the electric circuitry be filled with foam.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">\n<em>Unfair Competition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Appellant contends on appeal that the conclusions of the trial court that respondent did not unfairly compete with appellant is contrary to the governing law and is unsupported by the findings or evidence. In its closing brief appellant summarizes its position as follows: \u201cAll that appellant claims in this appeal is that [respondent] was barred from competing with [appellant], by soliciting MTC for the contracts under negotiation with [appellant], for a reasonable period of time after he terminated his employment at [appellant] and that in any competition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>with [appellant] for the MTC contract, he was barred from using confidential information obtained through his employment related to the specific terms, amount, and status of the [appellant\u2019s] negotiations with MTC. Although appellant did urge during the trial that the [respondent] was also barred from using the \u2018trade secret\u2019 information related to the general forms, formulas, and methods of doing business (as distinguished from the specific information related to the particular contract negotiations), it <em>does not </em>raise any issues related to the trial court\u2019s rulings on these general business methods in its appeal. [1\u00cd] With regard to the facts, appellant urges that under proper legal standards, the evidence conclusively established that [respondent] had competed unfairly in the manner complained of (i.e., solicited the contract and possessed and used confidential information in doing so).\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-4\">\u201cA former employee has the right to engage in a competitive business for himself and to enter into competition with his former employer, even for the business of those who had formerly been the customers of his former employer, provided such competition is fairly and legally conducted.\u201d <em>(Continental Car-Na-Var Corp. </em>v. <em>Moseley </em>(1944) 24 Cal.2d 104, 110 [148 P.2d 9]; <em>Cal Francisco Inv. Corp. </em>v. <em>Vrionis </em>(1971) 14 Cal.App.3d 318, 323 [92 Cal.Rptr. 201].) A former employee\u2019s use of confidential information obtained from his former employer to compete with his old employer and to solicit the business of his former employer\u2019s customers, is regarded as unfair competition. <em>(Greenly </em>v. <em>Cooper </em>(1978) 77 Cal.App.3d 382, 391-392 [143 Cal.Rptr. 514]; 7 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed. 1974) Equity, \u00a7 87, p. 5309.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-5\">\u201c\u2018A trade secret may consist of any formula, pattern, device or compilation of information which is used in one\u2019s business, and which gives him an opportunity to obtain an advantage over competitors who do not know or use it.\u2019 [Citations.] Although the nature of a trade secret is somewhat nebulous, a characteristic common to those secrets which have found protection from disclosure and use by the courts is the need for their continued use by the former employer in order to maintain a competitive advantage over others.\u201d <em>{Cal Francisco Inv. Corp. </em>v. <em>Vrionis, supra, </em>14 Cal.App.3d 318, 322.) Most trade secret litigation deals with a former employee\u2019s use of a list of customers of his former employer. (7 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law, <em>supra, </em>Equity, \u00a7 85, p. 5307.) \u201cThe cases on other trade secrets are fewer, and the principles are more difficult to apply. An employee\u2019s skill and knowledge of a particular business constitute the means by which he earns a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>living, and the courts should not hastily brand them as confidential where this will deprive him of employment opportunities.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 88, p. 5310; see also <em>Aetna Bldg. Maintenance Co. </em>v. <em>West </em>(1952) 39 Cal.2d 198, 206 [246 P.2d 11]; <em>Futurecraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Clary Corp. </em>(1962) 205 Cal.App.2d 279, 288 [23 Cal.Rptr. 198].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">Appellant cites <em>Fidelity etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Federal etc. Co. </em>(1933) 217 Cal. 307 [18 P.2d 950], for the proposition that a former employee may be found to be engaging in unfair competition even if the employee does not use any confidential information of his former employer. In <em>Fidelity, </em>the California Supreme Court stated: \u201cWe are in accord with the court on the proposition that if the defendants, or either of them, were carrying on uncompleted negotiations with prospective patrons on behalf of plaintiff at the time that Mr. Froelich and Mr. Bowater left the employ of plaintiff, or if negotiations were pending at said time, it would not be fair or equitable to permit them to reopen business negotiations with said prospective patrons on behalf of defendant corporation until a reasonable time thereafter should have elapsed.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 315.) The quoted comments by the California Supreme Court do not support appellant\u2019s position as the comments pertain to methods or acts which may be denounced as unfair competition on the part of <em>business rivals </em>and do not pertain to a determination \u201cwhether an employee should be permitted to solicit the patrons of his former employer.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 314.) To better illustrate the distinction the California Supreme Court was making in <em>Fidelity, </em>it is necessary to quote further from that decision: <em>\u201cIt is difficult indeed to draw the line between methods or acts which may be denounced as conspiracies to acquire the business or a part of the business of competitors, and those which may be considered legitimate acts- or methods of competition. </em>No fixed standard or code of business ethics has been adopted by the business world limiting or defining the extent to which business rivals may go in the employment of artifice, cunning or what are known as the \u2018tricks of the trade\u2019 or business craft in drawing trade from one to another. Ingenuity, business thrift and alertness are a part of the capital stock of those engaged in rival businesses. <em>So also it is difficult in many cases for the law to determine whether an employee should be permitted to solicit the patrons of his former employer. In the first case, it is only when the methods or acts of a business rival are clearly and manifestly unfair, and in the second case, only where the employee is in the possession of secret information not readily accessible to others and acquired by reason of his employment, that courts will afford injunctive </em>relief.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 314, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b488-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>Accordingly, <em>Fidelity </em>does not stand for the proposition that a former employee may be found to be engaging in unfair competition every time he solicits a prospective client or customer of his former employer, if his former employer was negotiating with the prospective client during the time the former employee was employed by his former employer, even if the employee does not use any confidential information of his former employer. The determination of legitimate acts or methods of competition for business rivals is separate and apart from the determination of proper acts of competition by a former employee, although a business rival may also be a former employee. In order for the methods of a business rival to be denounced as unfair, the methods must be of an \u201cextraordinary character\u201d and whether the methods of a business rival are of \u201cthat extraordinary character\u201d is a \u201cquestion primarily for the trial- court to determine, and this court will not disturb its findings unless they are entirely unsupported by the evidence.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 314.) The California Supreme Court in <em>Fidelity </em>found that the trial court\u2019s findings that defendants employed unfair methods of competition against plaintiff were supported by substantial evidence, stating: \u201cWhile it is true that the alleged specific acts constituting unfairness were but few, and the evidence offered to sustain them was susceptible of two constructions, the court found against appellants and we are bound by its findings. There is evidence, conflicting it is true, that Mr. Froelich did solicit, after he had severed his connections with plaintiff, certain customers with whom he had negotiated as agent for plaintiff while an employee of said plaintiff. The court further found that the information which Froelich acquired by reason of his employment by plaintiff was of that confidential character which an employee is not permitted to turn to his own advantage.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 315.) It is not altogether clear that the court in <em>Fidelity </em>found the methods adopted by the defendants were of the character that courts will afford injunctive relief without a finding that the individual or individuals used or possessed confidential information. This ambiguity is more clearly displayed in the California Supreme Court\u2019s discussion of the judgment entered in the trial court, wherein the court stated: \u201cWe do not understand the decree means to forever enjoin the defendants from soliciting business from persons who were the former patrons of plaintiffs, but merely enjoins them from taking advantage of any secret information the defendants, as former employees, may have gained by reason of their employment. This injunction applies to the solicitation of persons with whom negotiations with plaintiff were pending or with prospective patrons specifically identified at the time defendants left the employ of plaintiff.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 318.) For the purposes of resolving the issues raised in this appeal, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>unnecessary to determine, and we have not determined, whether the methods adopted by the defendants in <em>Fidelity </em>were of the extraordinary character that courts will afford injunctive relief without a finding that the defendants used or possessed confidential information. We will assume, only for the sake of argument, that <em>Fidelity </em>does not require a finding that the defendants used or possessed confidential information.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">The trial court in the instant case concluded that respondent \u201cdid not unfairly compete with\u201d appellant. Specifically, the trial court found: \u201c9. Prior to [respondent\u2019s] employment by [appellant], [respondent] had been employed by [MTC] in the crane maintenance industry for approximately 10 years. [11] 10. [Appellant] failed to establish that the methods, procedures, systems and specialized techniques used by [appellant] in selling and performing its services were confidential and not readily accessible to competitors. [U] 11. [Appellant\u2019s] methods, procedures and systems are matters of general knowledge in the industry, and the specialized techniques are but skillful variations of the general processes known to the particular-trade. [11] 12. [Appellant] failed to establish [respondent] used any knowledge or information obtained from [appellant] not readily accessible to the trade.... [II] 18. [Appellant] failed to establish that [respondent] interfered with [appellant\u2019s] negotiations with [MTC].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The trial court\u2019s conclusion in the instant case that respondent \u201cdid not unfairly compete with\u201d appellant is supported by substantial evidence. In other words, the California Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Fidelity etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Federal etc. Co., supra, </em>217 Cal. 307, does not compel or permit this court to disturb the conclusion reached by the trial court in the instant case; even though we have assumed for the purposes of this appeal, that the methods adopted by the defendants in <em>Fidelity </em>were of the extraordinary character that courts will afford injunctive relief without a finding that the defendants used or possessed confidential information. In <em>Fidelity, </em>it appears that the prospective clients\u2019 only contact with plaintiff was through defendants, when defendants were acting as the agents for plaintiff in negotiating with the prospective clients. Similarly, in <em>Fidelity, </em>defendants only became acquainted with the prospective clients of plaintiff because of their association with plaintiff. A different fact situation is presented in the instant case. Respondent was well acquainted with MTC before his employment with appellant. Respondent had been an employee of MTC for 10 years before his employment with appellant. Although respondent was informed of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>progress appellant was making with MTC in appellant\u2019s negotiations with MTC and had helped estimate the cost of performing the work for MTC, respondent was not part of appellant\u2019s negotiating team. In contrast to <em>Fidelity, </em>respondent\u2019s minimal connection with the negotiations between appellant and MTC, did not enhance any personal relationship between respondent and any representative of MTC nor particularly facilitate respondent\u2019s acquisition of any knowledge about MTC. (See <em>Aetna Bldg. Maintenance Co. </em>v. <em>West, supra, </em>39 Cal.2d 198, 205; <em>George </em>v. <em>Burdusis </em>(1942) 21 Cal.2d 153, 161 [130 P.2d 399].)</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Respondent tendered his resignation to appellant on December 15, 1977. Respondent continued working for appellant until December 20, 1977. Around December 28 or 29, 1977, MTC informed appellant that it was not pleased with the way the negotiations were going and that MTC was going to seek other bids. Respondent testified that he first indicated to MTC that he was interested \u201cin putting in a proposal\u201d in the \u201cmid-part of January 1978.\u201d There is nothing in <em>Fidelity etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Federal etc. Co., supra, </em>217 Cal. 307, which indicates that, as a matter of law, solicitation by a former employee of a prospective client or customer of his former employer, after the prospective client has indicated its dissatisfaction with the progress of the negotiation with the former employer and indicated that it was going to seek other bids, is an unfair method of competition for which courts will afford injunctive relief without a finding that the former employee used or possessed confidential information.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">There is evidence in the instant case that respondent had only minimal connection with the negotiations with MTC while respondent was in the employ of appellant and that respondent did not solicit the business of MTC until after MTC stated it was going to seek other bids. The fact situation presented in the instant case is clearly distinguishable from <em>Fidelity. </em>Even given the assumption we have made for the purpose of this appeal, <em>Fidelity </em>does not compel or permit this court to disturb the conclusion reached by the trial court in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">As noted earlier appellant also contends on appeal that the conclusion of the trial court that respondent did not unfairly compete with appellant cannot be sustained, because the evidence establishes that respondent used confidential information obtained through his employment with appellant in order to compete with appellant and to solicit the business of MTC. Appellant claims that the confidential information that respondent used related to the specific terms, amount, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>status of appellant\u2019s negotiations with MTC. Respondent asserts on the other hand that he made use of no confidential information in which appellant had a genuine proprietary interest. Respondent further asserts that if he used any information obtained during his employment with appellant, the information was not helpful. In support of this latter assertion, respondent points out that MTC was not satisfied with his first two proposals and thereafter gave him a contract prepared by an attorney of MTC to use as a model. Appellant dismisses respondent\u2019s assertions in the following manner: \u201cEven if MTC was not satisfied with , the submission and submitted a counter proposal, it does not follow that [respondent] did not use information that he had obtained from his employment. Finally, and most importantly, [appellant] submitted conclusive evidence that after he terminated his employment, [respondent] calculated the difference between [appellant\u2019s] monthly fixed fee figure that was independent of cost ($6,750), and his own fixed fee figure ($5,625.31), demonstrating that his figure was $1,124.69 per month less than [appellant\u2019s].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">Appellant was well advised to abandon its argument that its methods for making a proposal to a prospective client were a trade secret. A similar argument was considered by the California Supreme Court in <em>Aetna Bldg. Maintenance Co. </em>v. <em>West, supra, </em>39 Cal.2d 198, 206, and rejected. In rejecting this argument the California Supreme Court stated: \u201cAccording to Aetna, its procedure for estimating the price of a new contract, was a trade secret. However, no evidence was introduced tending to prove that Aetna had developed a secret, or even improved, system of making estimates. The very most which is shown by the evidence is that Aetna utilized a highly efficient system designed to meet competition and avoid losses. Of necessity, any competitor in the business must consider all of the factors which entered into Aetna\u2019s computations. There is a total absence of any showing that the method of making estimates are secret, or that West was informed of any claim of secrecy. Under these conditions, West was privileged to use \u2018methods of doing business and processes which are but skillful variations of general processes known to the particular trade.\u2019\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 206.) The California Supreme Court in <em>Aetna </em>made a distinction between the procedure for estimating the price of a new contract and the actual figures that were derived by the use of the procedure. However, the court in <em>Aetna </em>did not decide whether the use of actual figures which the former employer determined was its cost in doing business with the prospective client, by a former employee, was unfair competition. In this regard, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>California Supreme Court stated: \u201cThe evidence upon the question of whether West had access to Aetna\u2019s cost records is conflicting. The trier of fact could have believed that West, during this employment, acquired knowledge of costs of doing business and took it with him. However, assuming, without deciding, that this information was secret, there is no evidence tending to show that he made unfair use of it in competing with Aetna, or intends to do so.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 206.)</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">There is sufficient evidence present in the instant case which would support a finding that respondent did not make unfair use of any cdnfidential information in competing with appellant. There is substantial evidence that, whatever respondent\u2019s knowledge of appellant\u2019s costs of performing the work for MTC, he did not make unfair use of that knowledge. Respondent figured his costs using different methods than those employed by appellant. The methods used by a respondent were based upon his own extensive experience in the field. As noted earlier an \u201cemployee\u2019s skill and knowledge of a particular business constitute the means by which he earns a living, and the courts should not hastily brand them as confidential where this will deprive him of employment opportunities.\u201d (7 Witkin, Summary of Cal. law, <em>supra, </em>Equity, \u00a7 88, p. 5310.)</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Appellant also contends that the trial court erroneously found that appellant \u201cfailed to produce evidence that [respondent] solicited\u2019 [MTC].\u201d Appellant asserts that respondent admitted that he solicited MTC in respondent\u2019s answer and that the trial court was bound by this admission. There is no need to address this contention, because even if this finding is erroneous, reversal of the judgment in the instant case is not required. We have concluded above that respondent did not use any confidential information obtained from appellant to gain an advantage over appellant. \u201cIf no confidential information is used, a former employee is free to compete with his old employer, to advise customers of the old employer of his new activities, and to solicit their business.\u201d (7 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law, <em>supra, </em>Equity, \u00a7 87, p. 5309.)</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">\n<em>Twist-lock Interlock System</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">Appellant contends that the improvements (time delay and parallel wiring) made to the twist-lock interlock system were trade secrets and that respondent learned of these trade secrets during the course of his employment with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>We agree with appellant that such improvements could be classified as trade secrets.  \u201cThe cases emphasize that although a trade secret may be a devic\u00e9 or process which is patentable, patentability is not a condition precedent to the classification of a trade secret. Thus, it has been said that a trade secret may be a device or process which is clearly anticipated in the prior art or one which is merely a mechanical improvement on a machine or device. Novelty and invention are not requisite for a trade secret as they are for patentability [citation]. In harmony with these precepts, it has been held that a trade secret in the broad sense consists of any unpatented idea which may be used for industrial and commercial purposes [citation].\u201d <em>(Sinclair </em>v. <em>Aquarius Electronics, Inc. </em>(1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 216, 222 [116 Cal.Rptr. 654].) However, a \u201cbasis for the protection of trade secrets is that the recipient obtains through a confidential relationship something he did not previously know.\u201d <em>(Futurecraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Clary Corp., supra, </em>205 Cal.App.2d 279, 288.) An employee is said to have acquired information amounting to a trade secret from his employer if the information is acquired during the <em>course </em>of his employment. <em>(Ungar Electric Tools, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sid Ungar Co., Inc. </em>(1961) 192 Cal.App.2d 398, 403 [13 Cal.Rptr. 268].)</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">The trial court found in the instant case that respondent \u201chad knowledge of the basic principles involved in \u00e1 twist-lock interlock system prior to his employment by [appellant].\u201d The trial court further found that respondent \u201cdid not acquire any knowledge from [appellant] relating to a twist-lock interlock system.\u201d These findings support the conclusion that appellant did not have trade secrets in the improvements made to the twist-lock interlock system that were entitled to legal protection. These findings are also supported by substantial evidence. The testimony of one witness will support a finding of fact. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 411.)</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Respondent gave the following testimony which supports the above findings and conclusion of the trial court: Prior to his employment with appellant, respondent was well aware of inadequacies of the interlock systems that were then being used in the industry. Twice in 1977 respondent approached the president of appellant regarding possible improvements that could be made to the twist-lock interlock system. On both occasions respondent was informed that appellant was not in the business of manufacturing, but in performing a service. Given the response that respondent received from the president of appellant he decided he would go \u201cahead to complete the project on my own.\u201d While <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>on vacation in August of 1977, respondent worked on the twist-lock interlock system and put together what he \u201cthought was a very workable product.\u201d After respondent terminated his employment with appellant he perfected his system. Thereafter, respondent sold a twist-lock interlock system to MTC. On the other hand, appellant had managed to build only a small model of a twist-lock system by the time of trial, which model malfunctioned for some five minutes during the deposition of the manager of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">This evidence supports a finding that respondent did not acquire the information or make the improvements to the twist-lock interlock system during the <em>course </em>of his employment with appellant. Respondent\u2019s employment with appellant did not originally encompass the performance of services of an inventive nature. Respondent developed a \u201cworkable product\u201d before appellant became interested in developing its own interlock system. Under such circumstances appellant is not entitled to the improvements or to have them classified as appellant\u2019s trade secrets. <em>(Banner Metals, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lockwood </em>(1960) 178 Cal.App.2d 643, 654 [3 Cal.Rptr. 421]; see also <em>Daniel Orifice Fitting Co. </em>v. <em>Whalen </em>(1962) 198 Cal.App.2d 791, 797-798 [18 Cal.Rptr. 659].)</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">\n<em>Agreement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Appellant contends that the \u201cEmployee Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement\u201d is enforceable against respondent. However, appellant agrees with respondent that Business and Professions Code section 16600 precludes enforceability of the agreement signed by respondent \u201cbeyond the protection of confidential information ....\u201d Since we have determined that respondent did not make use of any confidential information of appellant that was entitled to protection, the agreement does not provide appellant with any additional basis upon which to attack the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">Feinberg, J., and Stern, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b478-9\">During trial, the fourth and fifth causes of action alleged in the complaint were dismissed on appellant\u2019s motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b478-10\">The preliminary injunction that had been granted prior to trial was \u201cdissolved as of May 22, 1978.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Respondent only attended two of the many meetings between appellant and MTC that were held for the purpose of reaching an agreement satisfactory to both sides.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Although the Agreement contains a signature line for the president of Rigging International, the Agreement was never signed by a representative of Rigging International.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b482-6\">At trial the parties did not treat respondent and the corporation he formed as separate entities (nor do they do so in their briefs on appeal).
